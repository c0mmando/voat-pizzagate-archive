<p>Norwegian police said on Sunday they are investigating a grotesque pedophilia ring suspected of involvement in the abuse of at least 51 people, which includes the abuse of infants and at least one case of a suspect acknowledging abusing his own children. The latest incident is considered one of the largest child sexual abuse cases in the country’s history.</p>
<p>Deputy Police Chief Gunnar Floystad said that in they have arrested 20 men so far, with three convictions, in western Norway. The 31 other suspects are from other regions in Norway. Those facing charges are to receive a maximum penalty of up to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>Floystad told reporters Sunday that many of the suspects are highly educated, and include lawyers and politicians. Two current or former elected officials, one teacher and a lawyer are allegedly among the accused. He said he could not reveal more details pending the conclusion of the investigation, known as “Dark Room,” which began in 2015. Prosecutors said the perpetrators met in the dark web, using encryption and anonymity to hide their tracks.</p>
<p>“We have the clear perception that like-minded individuals met with each other in the so-called dark net, where they could talk with one another and cultivate their interest in children in peace,” Hilde Reikrås, the head of Operation Dark Room, said at a press conference on Sunday, the Local Norway reported.</p>
<p>“There are several highly educated [individuals] with high IT skills. They’ve used encryption and anonymity to hide their tracks,” head police prosecutor Janne Ringset Heltne said at the Sunday press conference, adding that all of the perpetrators involved are allegedly men.</p>

            Police in Norway have filed charges against 51 men suspected of involvement in a massive paedophile ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            Authorities seized 150 terabytes (150,000 gigabytes) of data, including photos, videos and chat transcripts between members of various paedophile networks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Known as ‘Dark Room’, the police operation revealed sexual assaults against children as young as babies, according to The Local.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The material shows the abuse of children of all ages, including infants,” Hilde Reikrås, head of Operation Dark Room, said at a news conference.

“The material shows, among other things, the penetration of toddlers, children being tied up, children having sex with animals and children having sex with other children.”
           </p>
           <p>
            All of the men arrested live in Norway, but police confirmed they were investigating one individual living abroad. It is considered one of the largest sexual abuse cases ever in the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms Reikrås said those detained had met each other on the dark net; an ungoverned space online where users can surf with more anonymity.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the men who was awaiting the birth of his child with his girlfriend discussed plans to sexually abuse the baby once it was born, police said.

            Norwegian police reportedly began their investigation after a tip-off from the FBI.

            The 51 facing charges can receive a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.

            <p>
             Western Norway Police have seized 150 terabytes of data material that depicts many forms of sexual abuse against children in the operation “Darkroom”, referred as the biggest abuse case against children in Norway. Among the accused, there are politicians,  engineers, one kindergarten teacher , a police officer, a lawyer and students.
            </p>
            <p>
             For ten months, a separate special group of Western Norway Police worked continuously to uncover abuse networks on the Internet. They have kept the group secret, but on Sunday they went out with the preliminary results of the operation “Darkroom”, writes NRK.
            </p>
            <p>
             How did it start?
            </p>
            <p>
             Last fall a 22-year-old man was reported for sexual intercourse with a 14 year old girl in Bergen. While working on the case, the police found other similar cases, and gradually discovered communication among the suspects.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eventually, the police saw that there were multiple networks. Since January this year, 25 police officers from different departments worked together to expose pedophile abuse networks in the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the operations, a large number of photos, movies and text messages were seized and examined. The seizure is so far overall of 150 terabytes, which corresponds to 35,000 DVDs, and is one of the biggest seizure of pedophile materials in Norwegian history.
            </p>
            <p>
             The material has led to charges of sexual intercourse and rape of children from infancy to 15 years, serious trafficking and production, storage and sharing of material depicting sexual abuse of children, and luring of children to show off or sending nude photos or masturbate over the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police also found examples of offenders who have planned atrocities against their own children with other men.
            </p>
            <p>
             Disturbing chat histories among the accused offenders even make a basement for charging the suspects.
            </p>
            <p>
             From kindergarten teacher to politicians
            </p>
            <p>
             51 people, all men, are so far involved in the case. 24 of them come from Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane. 26 come from other areas of Norway, from Southeast to Finnmark in the north. Among the accused offenders, there is also one Swedish national.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two politicians, one Labor politician from Oslo and a former national Progress Party (FrP) politician  from Eastern Norway are involved in the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the perpetrators are men. They are of all ages and different professions and educational backgrounds. Several are apparently active resource persons in their community, and several are highly educated and have high IT skills. At least one has been employed in several kindergartens. At least four of the 51 men perpetrated the abuses in the materials.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prime Minister of Norway: This is Painful
            </p>
            <p>
             Prime Minister Erna Solberg says to NRK that the case upsets her very much.
            </p>
            <p>
             – I think this is incredibly painful. It is painful to hear and see stories about abuse against young babies, and the fantasies of abuse against young children. You do not need to be a mother to think that this is painful to hear, all people with empathy and contact with young children know that this type of abuse leaves marks for life, says Solberg.

            <p>
             33 new Dark Room cases – at least 300 children grossly abused in total
At least 300 children have been exposed to gross sexual assault that Norwegians have ordered and viewed over the internet. The Dark Room complex now encompasses 84 cases.
            </p>
            <p>
             – Several of the assaults appear to be torture, the West Police District reports in an update of the pedophile- and assault investigation entitled Operation Dark Room.
            </p>
            <p>
             The investigation now includes the whole country. All twelve police districts have one or more Dark Room-affiliated items on their table.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of them talk about dozens of cases involving sexual abuse of children, possession and proliferation of images and films showing offenses against children and, not least, a large number of cases of direct streaming of ordered abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             The case began to unravel in January 2016, when the police found a couple of thousand assault images and a few hundred video files on a computer at home of a man from Aalesund. Through analysis of the contents of the machine, the police found the persons the man had shared- and received content from.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since that time, the police have either created or investigated 84 cases pertaining to sexual abuse of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just since last update last November, 33 new cases have been filed – 13 of them belong to the West Police District, while 20 cases have been sent to other police districts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Orders abuse online
Western Police District, with assistance from the Criminal Police, has revealed a large amount of abuse that has been directly streamed on the web through webcams. The victims in the cases are children, right down to infancy, which repeatedly are exposed to very gross assaults.
            </p>
            <p>
             The police have found at least 300 children who are subjected to this type of abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Live streamed happening among others from the Philippines. The violations shown are ordered in the smallest detail by Norwegian network users.
            </p>
            <p>
             – We see that orders and the execution of such abuses have been in progress for several years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many of the affected children in these cases live in poverty and are without close care persons. They are cynically exploited by Western men, writes West Police District.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the direct streaming cases, the police believe that hundreds of adults facilitate or carry out the sexual assaults ordered.

             Travel guide for pedophiles
Among materials that the investigation has revealed, are recipes on how to book online abuse. Also how to buy prostituted children in Cambodia and Nepal which assaults can be performed against.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two documents released by investigators appear as detailed travel guides, with recommendations on where to gain access to children.
            </p>
            <p>
             They include how to behave to get offers to commit abuse, and how to pay for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The documents are apparently written by people who have been in the various places themselves and who seem to be very experienced when dealing with child prostitutes.
            </p>
            <p>
             – Boys and girls can be found in all age groups, but the younger ones are not advertised as openly. This to prevent trouble with the law, the author writes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The experience exchanges, as the police call them, are done in different discussion forums online.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another example from the investigation is a brief excerpt from a chat. In the chat a Norwegian man orders a six-year-old girl to be subjected to abuse:
            </p>
            <p>
             – What do you want to do with her? asks the provider in the Philippines.
            </p>
            <p>
             47 cases sent to other districts
Altogether, 47 cases originating in Dark Room are sent elsewhere by the police district. Two of them are sent to Denmark and Sweden.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of the country’s twelve police districts are now investigating one or more cases that are affiliated with, or is a result of, the investigation in Bergen.
            </p>
            <p>
             – Several of the police districts in Norway have now set up their own projects on abuse cases against children online. In several of the cases, we see that several of the same users are involved, says the update from the West Police District.
            </p>
            <p>
             Western Police District Prosecution has settled six cases; three cases are settled through confessions. There are indictment decisions in two cases and one case is settled with fines.
            </p>
            <p>
             In one of the cases where an action has been taken, physical sexual abuse applies to own children.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other cases relate to abuse material through chat and / or image sharing. In addition, five cases have been investigated, but are not yet concluded.

            <strong>
             Clinton Foundation drug contracts intersected with State Department work
            </strong>
           </h1>
           <p>
            Amid renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation's foreign ties this week, Hillary Clinton pointed to the success of its low-cost contracts with pharmaceutical firms in a rare acknowledgement of her family's controversial nonprofit network.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Democratic nominee, who has not held a press conference in 242 days and is selective about the media interviews she grants, seldom encounters questions about the Clinton Foundation despite the outsize role its past dealings have played on the campaign trail.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton denied on Sunday that she participated in any foundation activities while she served as secretary of state, employing a new defense of its operations by highlighting the negotiated healthcare deals.
           </p>
           <p>
            But under her leadership, at least a handful of the State Department's global health efforts relied on drug companies that were also major Clinton Foundation donors in arrangements that raise questions about the distance Clinton kept from her family's philanthropy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clinton Foundation has become a magnet for criticism from Republicans who have painted it as the embodiment of everything they see wrong with the Democratic nominee: her insularity, political longevity and willingness to skirt the rules when it suits her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton faced questions Sunday about alleged overlap between the work of her family's foundation and her official State Department duties.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I'm really proud of the Clinton Foundation. I am proud of the work that it does. Thanks to the Clinton Foundation, nine million more people in our world have access to HIV/AIDS drugs because they negotiated contracts that made them affordable," Clinton said during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday," her first in five years.
           </p>
           <p>
            "And there is absolutely no connection between anything that I did as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation," she added.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the same pharmaceutical firms that donated to the Clinton Foundation and sought the foundation-funded contracts Clinton described were also lobbying the State Department at the same time as some pursued taxpayer-funded contracts to do similar work. Executives at those companies have also contributed heavily to Clinton's presidential campaign, complicating her attempts to attack the pharmaceutical industry as a political " enemy" akin to Republicans.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clinton Foundation boasts of the four million patients who gained access to HIV drugs through its work negotiating pharmaceutical contracts. A separate nonprofit, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, claims to have helped 11.5 million patients obtain the treatments. Neither of those figures matches the nine million patients Clinton cited during her interview.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clinton Health Access is just one of several charities operating within the sprawling philanthropic network known as the Clinton Foundation. Others include the Clinton Global Initiative, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership and the Clinton Family Foundation. In some cases, the distinctions between which nonprofits are separate entities and which are offshoots of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation are unclear.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, the Clinton Global Initiative was peeled off from the larger Clinton Foundation in 2009 and operated as an individual charity until Clinton left the State Department in 2013, at which point it was rolled back into the main organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            The confusing structure can make tracing the precise destination of donations to the foundation a difficult task. However, donor records show major pharmaceutical firms — including Pfizer, Merck &amp; Co., and Sanofi — have written generous checks to the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            In its 2008 annual report, for instance, the Clinton Global Initiative touted a partnership with Merck to provide rotavirus vaccines to infants in Nicaragua. Shortly before that, the drug corporation was rocked by Brazil's decision to strip Merck of a patent on HIV drugs in order to open its markets to cheaper generic versions of the medication.
           </p>
           <p>
            During Clinton's first year at the agency, Merck lobbied the State Department to ease regulations restricting the distribution of its drugs "in certain Latin American markets," according to lobbying disclosure forms from 2009. That placed the drug company's international interests squarely on Clinton's desk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton sat down with Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier privately in March 2012 in a meeting that was closed to the press, according to her official schedule from that day. Immediately afterward, she walked into a staff meeting about "global health strategy."
           </p>
           <p>
            By June of that year, her staff was collecting press clips on a $75 million partnership with Merck, funded by the State Department, to reduce childbirth-related deaths in Africa. The Norwegian government had pledged a matching $75 million to the initiative, which was spearheaded by Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government of Norway has also donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation, giving up to $25 million to the nonprofit. In fact, Clinton's emails suggest she even asked members of her State Department staff to facilitate a Norwegian donation to a foundation project that was hosted by the United Nations, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.
           </p>
           <p>
            The clean cookstoves project served as a clear example of the blurred lines between Clinton's foundation and State Department work. In 2010, the secretary of state herself took the stage at the glitzy annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative and announced the State Department's commitment to the clean cookstoves alliance, which sought to reduce dependence on cookstoves for heating and cooking in developing countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Led by Clinton, the Obama administration poured $105 million into the clean cookstoves project.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a senator, Clinton had reportedly written a letter urging the Department of Health and Human Services to approve Merck's human papillomavirus vaccine in 2005.
           </p>
           <p>
            By 2011, under her purview at the State Department, the U.S. government had teamed up with Merck to provide that same HPV vaccine to women in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. The initiative was set to cost $75 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            A spokesperson for Merck did not immediately return a request for comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Aug. 2009, the Clinton Health Access Initiative announced it had negotiated a deal with Pfizer to provide HIV medications across the developing world at a price that was marked down by 60 percent. That same year, Pfizer was also lobbying Clinton's State Department in its interests, as it did every year of her tenure, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pfizer gave up to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, donor records show.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pharmaceutical giant wrote a large check to the State Department to sponsor the U.S. pavilion at the 2010 World's Fair in Shanghai. The expo was a priority early in Clinton's term for political reasons, and the former secretary of state tapped her vast donor network to foot the entire $60 million bill during her first year at the State Department.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2012, Pfizer teamed up with the U.S. Agency for International Development, an arm of the State Department, for a major purchase of contraceptive drugs that were to be distributed to three million women.
           </p>
           <p>
            Executives from Pfizer have also donated heavily to Clinton's presidential campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Our donations and partnerships with any given entity are determined by that entity's ability to expand access to healthcare and medicines, as well as work towards preserving and furthering innovation," Sharon Castillo, spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner.
           </p>
           <p>
            A spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation referred inquiries to the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which did not return a request for comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            The well-connected charity has weathered controversy for the pattern of preferential treatment that seemed to flow from the State Department to the most generous of foundation contributors, be they pharmaceutical giants or oil conglomerates, since Clinton launched her bid for the White House last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of those same donors line Clinton's campaign coffers today.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the Democratic nominee continues to downplay criticism of her family's philanthropy on the increasingly limited occasions she is asked about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Earlier this week, a report detailing financial entanglements among Hillary Clinton's State Department, Russia and 17 companies that had either donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid former President Bill Clinton for a speech reignited the political perlustration of foundation activities that has come to define the nonprofit's public profile.

            Yunus first met with Clinton in Washington in April 2009. That was followed six months later by an announcement by USAID, the State Department’s foreign aid arm, that it was partnering with the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit charity run by Yunus, in a $162 million commitment to extend its microfinance concept abroad. USAID also began providing loans and grants to the Grameen Foundation, totaling $2.2 million over Clinton’s tenure.
           </p>
           <p>
            By September 2009, Yunus began complaining to Clinton’s top aides about what he perceived as poor treatment by Bangladesh’s government. His bank was accused of financial mismanagement of Norwegian government aid money — a charge that Norway later dismissed as baseless. But Yunus told Melanne Verveer, a long-time Clinton aide who was an ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues, that Bangladesh officials refused to meet with him and asked the State Department for help in pressing his case.

            **A series of reports from Dagbladet newspaper have raised questions about Norway’s financial support of the Clinton Foundation.
           </h1>
           <p>
            Dagbladet first reported that Norway’s contributions to the Clinton Foundation are broken up into sub-groups in order to make the combined contributions appear smaller than they actually are. **
           </p>
           <p>
            The foundation, which created by former US President Bill Clinton and has current presumptive candidate for president Hillary Clinton in a key role, reports funds from Norway and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) separately and further splits up the support between the different parts of the foundation, each of which reports its own donors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Norad reports that the Norwegian contributions to the Clinton Foundation have amounted to $89.6 million (747 million kroner) between 2007 and 2015, while the Clinton Foundation’s website lists the support as between $10 and $25 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dagbladet also pointed out that the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which has been an independent organization since 2010, has received Norwegian financial support that is not reflected amongst the list of donations to the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The newspaper then reported that an internal memo from Norad contends that Foreign Minister Børge Brende broke the government’s own foreign aid principles by giving the Clinton Foundation 30 million kroner last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the projects of the foundation was to replace the diesel generators to tropical island nations with energy production from wind, solar or geothermal sources. According to the Norad report, Brende chose to disregard his own declared policies when he and PM Erna Solberg met with Bill Clinton last year and promised to support this effort with 30 million kroner.
           </p>
           <p>
            The assistance to the small and scattered island states is not in line with the foreign assistance strategies that the Norwegian government has set for itself and that were approved by parliament.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-none-of-the-27-countries-included-in-the-clinton-foundations-program-to-replace-contaminated-diesel-generators-are-part-of-the-norwegian-governments-list-of-priority-assistance-countries.">
            None of the 27 countries included in the Clinton Foundation's program to replace contaminated diesel generators are part of the Norwegian government's list of priority assistance countries.
           </h1>
           <p>
            The Foreign Ministry rejects any criticism of the financial support, with ministry spokesperson Guri Solberg telling the newspaper that support through multilateral organizations and initiatives is not covered by government principles in the same way as other assistance.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-norway-is-one-of-the-three-countries-in-the-world-that-gives-the-most-money-to-the-clinton-foundation.-">
            **Norway is one of the three countries in the world that gives the most money to the Clinton Foundation. **
           </h1>
           <p>
            Dagbladet reported that the donations that the Clinton Foundation has received from Australia is also split in the same way as the Norwegian contributions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Swedish contributions to the Clinton Foundation have also been called into question. According to reports from last summer, the bulk of the money deposited in a Swedish arm of the Clinton family's global foundation was transferred while Hillary Clinton was US Secretary of State, and was liaising with Sweden over its controversial business links with Iran.

            For months we've been told that the Clinton Foundation, and it's various subsidiaries, were simple, innocent "charitable" organizations, despite the mountain of WikiLeaks evidence to the contrary.  Well, if that is, in fact, true perhaps the Clintons could explain why wealthy foreign governments, like Norway, are suddenly slashing their contributions now that Hillary's political clout has been erased?
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-as-the-norwegian-newspaper-hegnar-points-out-norway-is-expected-to-slash-their-contributions-to-the-clinton-foundation-by-87-now-that-hillary-has-lost-the-presidency.--after-contributing-roughly-5mm-per-year-to-the-clinton-foundation-between-2007---2013-the-norwegian-government-decided-to-boost-their-donations-to-15mm-and-21mm-in-2014-and-2015-respectively.--ironically-that-boost-in-contributions-corresponded-with-hillarys-decision-to-run-for-president-in-2016...but-were-sure-its-just-a-coincidence.--that-said-it-is-fairly-interesting-that-since-hillarys-loss-norway-has-decided-to-scale-back-their-contributions-by-87-in-2017...hmmm.">
            <strong>
             As the Norwegian newspaper Hegnar points out, Norway is expected to slash their contributions to the Clinton Foundation by 87% now that Hillary has lost the presidency.  After contributing roughly $5mm per year to the Clinton Foundation between 2007 - 2013, the Norwegian government decided to boost their donations to ~$15mm and ~$21mm in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  Ironically, that boost in contributions corresponded with Hillary's decision to run for President in 2016...but we're sure it's just a coincidence.  That said, it is fairly interesting that, since Hillary's loss, Norway has decided to scale back their contributions by 87% in 2017...hmmm.
            </strong>
           </h1>
           <p>
            After a record contribution from Norway to the disputed Clinton Foundation before the election year, is the contribution now in freefall. Financial newspaper can tell that next year's contribution is down 83 percent from the peak year of 2015.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-for-2016-the-planned-payments-to-clinton-health-access-initiative-totaling-35.9-million-kroner-writes-communications-advisor-guri-solberg-at-the-foreign-ministry-in-an-email-to-finance-newspaper.">
            <strong>
             For 2016, the planned payments to Clinton Health Access Initiative totaling 35.9 million kroner, writes communications advisor Guri Solberg at the Foreign Ministry, in an email to Finance newspaper.
            </strong>
           </h1>
           <p>
            It is one-fifth of last year's contribution, when nominating election campaign before the US primaries was in full swing, and the Clinton Foundation came under the spotlight in the US press.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Finance newspaper lay the annual Norwegian contribution of NOK 40 million on average from 2007 to 2013. In 2014, the contribution more than tripled, to 129 million. And in 2015 they increased to 174 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            The money has gone to two of the Foundation's programs, primarily Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), but also the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI).
           </p>
           <p>
            For 2017 it is planned payments to Clinton Health Access Initiative 23 million, Solberg wrote in an email to Finance newspaper. It is further down 36 percent from the current year. By comparison, ran this program 169 million in 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            As Hegnar further notes, Norway was the third largest contributor to the Clinton Foundation after Saudi Arabia and Australia, followed by a number of Arab Gulf states, which is confirmed by the Foundation's website:
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton Foundation
           </p>
           <p>
            But, as the NY Post points out this morning, wealthy foreign governments aren't the only ones backing away from the Clinton Foundation as overall donations plummeted 37% YoY in 2015 just as the "pay-to-play" scandals started to surface.
           </p>
           <p>
            Donations to the Clinton Foundation nose-dived last year amid Hillary Clinton’s presidential run, pay-to-play allegations, internal strife and a black mark from a charity watchdog.
           </p>
           <p>
            Contributions fell by 37 percent to $108 million, down from $172 million in 2014, according to the group’s latest tax filings.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cash plummeted as Hillary Clinton left the nonprofit in April 2015 after announcing her ill-fated candidacy. The foundation became a major issue in the race, with Donald Trump vowing to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only did contributions drop, but so did revenue the Clintons brought in from speeches. That income fell to $357,500 from $3.6 million in 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the time the foundation’s Clinton Global Initiative held its annual conference in September 2015, many donors had bailed, including Samsung and ExxonMobil.
           </p>
           <p>
            With their power base eroded, the Clinton's will need to double down on their efforts to get Chelsea elected to that NY Congressional seat asap.

             There be a direct link between Norway’s enormous contribution to the Clinton Foundation and the appointment of Jens Stoltenberg as new General Secretary in Nato.

            Jens Stoltenberg has just released a book about his carrier that smell propaganda, putting shit on all of his opponents however revealing how he sabotaged the previous labor leader of the Norwegian Labor party. It comes in the same line as rewarding President Obama with the Nobel peace price.

            ANSWER: Norway’s pay-off to the Clinton Foundation was strategic. According to Norad,during the period 2007 to 2015, Norway sent 584 million to the Clinton Foundation. For the next three years, they promised them a further 92 million. These vast donations from Norway appear to have made Stoltenberg the head of NATO and Obama the Nobel Peace Prize.

            The donation bought Jens Stoltenberg a position as the head of NATO on October 1, 2014. Obama was given the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for absolutely nothing. The official announcement on October 9, 2009, cited Obama’s promotion of nuclear nonproliferation and a “new climate” in international relations, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world. Yes, there were 4,950 operational nuclear warheads in 2010, the year the New Start Treaty was signed to lower the amount to 4,700 weapons in 2015. However, the weapons systems are being modernized and better focused for targeting. So that is a joke. He has restarted the Cold War with Russia and has not brought peace to the Middle East or the Muslim world.
           </h1>
           <p>
            The confirmation that these positions were all pay-offs to Norway for huge donations to the Clinton Foundation is in Hillary’s destroyed emails. Others do have them and this is, in part, why Obama used a fake name to communicate with Hillary on her private server so this would all be beyond the Freedom of Information Act. Using a fake name proves (1) he knew what she was doing and (2) it may be the smoking gun that he is part of this whole mess.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rumors from behind the curtain put Obama being paid-off by the Clinton Foundation in the future and they got him the Nobel Prize. So he let Hillary do her thing. The rumors that FBI Director James Comey was paid-off was not true. He did work for some organizations that have donated to or partnered with the Clinton Foundation but not simultaneously. The Clinton Foundation is the new vampire squid taking lessons from Goldman Sachs. Just follow the money.

            Nothing is what it seems. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reports that the Pentagon paid a British PR firm $500M for top secret Iraq propaganda creating false flags and fake Al Qaeda propaganda films. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Now we have Jens Stoltenberg doing the bidding of the military establishment as well. Both NATO and the Obama Administration are preparing for war with Russia. It has come out that the Obama Administration has instructed the CIA to supply heavy weapons in Syria to invoke a direct confrontation with Russia. The preparation for war with Russia is building. This is even being reported in Russia. NATO has now added cyber attacks to the list to justify war. The Clinton Foundation appears to be a giant money laundering machine that may be far worse than anything revealed to date. This is also likely why the Obama Administration is protecting Hillary’s emails at all costs. This is also probably why no indictment. Then you have discovery and a public trial. No possible way. Obama is protecting Hillary for himself as well. It’s all a scam and we are the victims.
           </h1>
           <p>
            Stoltenberg’s installation into NATO is a set-up. Everything is now in place and if Trump wins, Obama can claim, without any proof as usual, that Russia determined the election and call it all a FRAUD and domestic protest would justify Martial Law and off we go.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Clinton Foundation scandals emerged as a major blow to Hillary Clinton’s campaign this past election, as emails released by WikiLeaks and from FOIA requests revealed pay-to-play schemes and overt conflicts of interest between the Foundation and Clinton’s State Department. Though the Clintons and their supporters staunchly defended the Foundation, pointing to the charitable work it produced to defend any criticisms, such claims of corruption were proven correct.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              It now appears that Norway, one of the most prolific foreign Clinton Foundation donors, is decreasing its annual donation from $20 million in 2015 to $4.2 million this year—a significant drop suggesting the foreign government had expected to receive benefits in return for its generous donation. Norway’s move also provides further evidence that the Foundation serves more as a front to sell access to the Clintons than as an organization focused on philanthropy. While the Foundation may have conducted some charitable work, its greater purpose has always been to boost the Clinton brand, market the Clintons on the highly paid speech circuit, and offer donors access to the Clintons and their prolific network of elite and corporate connections.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2015, IBTimes conducted an investigative report revealing foreign governments who gave large contributions to the Clinton Foundation—including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Algeria, Oman, UAE and Bahrain—received exponential increases in U.S. weapons exports from the State Department while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Because neither Clinton will occupy a prominent role in government in the immediate future—curtailing the willingness of at least some big donors to try and curry favor with the foundation by writing large checks,” reported CNBC on November 19. “Because Hillary Clinton is no longer seen as a president in waiting, contributors may look elsewhere and the foundation may have to rethink its scope and priorities,” philanthropy experts told CNBC. The Clinton Foundation refused to respond to numerous requests from CNBC for comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Per the Foundation’s latest tax filings, contributions fell by 37 percent when Hillary Clinton announced her presidential campaign in 2015—and pay-to-play evidence first began to surface. Donations are expected to continue to tank as the market price for the Clintons has dropped significantly now that neither Bill nor Hillary faces the prospect of serving in public office.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to The Daily Caller, the Clinton Foundation only reported five new donors between July 1 and September 30—a low number presumably due to the negative publicity the Foundation has been receiving.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rep. Jason Chaffetz, head of the House Oversight Committee, is pursuing a probe into the Clinton Foundation. Chaffetz told Fox News the probe was unaffected by Hillary Clinton’s loss in the presidential election.
            </p>
            <p>
             Though President-elect Donald Trump recently told The New York Times he would not pursue investigations into Clinton’s private email server or the Clinton Foundation, Chaffetz and the FBI will likely continue their investigations, uninterrupted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Northwestern University Law Professor Stephen B. Presser recently argued in The New York Times that Clinton should be pardoned for her use of a private email server—but not for the ClintonFoundation pay-to-play schemes currently under investigation. The Washington Post also noted it would be a “serious violation of normal procedure,” if Trump were to intervene to stop investigations into the Clinton Foundation.

             , you made my head spin. I've seen bits and pieces of this info since 2016, but to see all of it together in one documented post is awesome. BTW, I keep asking, WHY IS THIS FOUNDATION STILL IN BUSINESS?  Trump? Should we lock Bill in a room filled with thousands of those Japanese se* robots? Would that do the trick?

            <a href="https://newspunch.com/clinton-norway-pedo-ring/">
             they just claim it speculatively

            <p>
             Off the top of my head, after doing some reading, here is what I can tell:
            </p>
            <p>
             Clintons were friends with non-Labour Prime Minister for a long time. Since the 90s. The Clintons helped him into power.
            </p>
            <p>
             On 31 January 2017, he was the first high-ranking politician from another country detained and questioned in the United States as a result of President Donald Trump's executive orders banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations, because of a diplomatic visit to Iran he had made in 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
             At least one labor politician and progress party politician were arrested in Operation Dark Room, where an FBI agent purportedly hacked into one of their systems to reveal worldwide exchange of baby torture and snuff porn.
            </p>
            <p>
             As of November of last year, they were still announcing arrests in the operation, the most recent being babies being tortured on livestream, with 65 of the victims being children in that one case, alone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just before that, a man his 40s, who happens to be a Labour politician living in Hordaland County, was been charged with ordering the online abuse of 61 Filipino children, NRK reported.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, we are still seeing the arrest of politicians who were participating with the Clinton Foundation. They are financially related.

              It now appears that Norway, one of the most prolific foreign Clinton Foundation donors, is decreasing its annual donation from $20 million in 2015 to $4.2 million this year—a significant drop suggesting the foreign government had expected to receive benefits in return for its generous donation. Norway’s move also provides further evidence that the Foundation serves more

              No worries :-). I wasn't aware Washington Pundit was fake news pusher, either. We should  look over their stuff and see what other disinfo they've spread.
