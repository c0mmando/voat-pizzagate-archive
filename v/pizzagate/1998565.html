            Bingo. They have been working on controlling the food, banking and energy/oil industries for a long time, but their current focus is on water and information.

            Everything leads back to Racine, Wisconsin. Shine the light on Racine as it is a main root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption and a gateway to the real elite involved with the Council of 13.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sustainability is not for us, it is for them, and it all began in Racine, Wisconsin. This is the real agenda.

            The something huge that will bust this thing wide open is when the world shines the spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's district.
           </p>
           <p>
            The world needs to know the real truth before it is too late that everything is connected back through a network of corporations, foundations, mafia and religious groups, and secret societies including Freemasons, Knights of Pythias, and Pilgrims Society up to the Committee of 300 and Council of 13 in a global pyramid scheme. They are aiming to control our global resources to control the food and water supplies, energy, governments, industries, distribution channels, money, vaccines and medicine, and most importantly information.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sustainability is not about sustainability for all of us, it is about sustainability for them. This all began in Racine, Wisconsin with the Clintons and many powerful politicians, business leaders and secret societies, and is a central component of the United Nations Agenda 2030.

             What is the initiating kernel, or a time line, of Racine as a social engineering lab? I would like to see a mind map or chronology from you.  Fogdryer has been working overtime with dots. Please connect for stupid broads like me.  (that last part was a preemptive strike for the ass of la mancha)

              Racine means "root" and it is for good reason.
             </p>
             <p>
              It goes way back. Racine was the original Chicago, and is tied to the beginning of the Republican party and to communist factions in America. There is also a large Dutch and Nordic population in Racine (linked with other corrupt communities in Pennsylvania for example), and it began its real prominence following growth of certain industries that linked with the Pilgrims Society through key players such as John Jeffry Louis. Over time it has been infiltrated by various arms of the mafia up from Chicago, and controlled by elite business and political leaders to serve as an experimental hub for the global agenda. The Knights of Pythias, Boy Scouts, KKK, and Rotary Clubs were key affiliations for many local leaders, and they held the only historic Knights of Pythias parade in Racine. Racine played a major role in the Underground Railroad linking ratlines up to Canada, and is built an sacred Indian burial mounds right next to one of the largest fresh water supplies in the world. The criminally corrupt mayor just resigned amid extremely brazen levels of corruption along with many other officials, and was rewarded with a position to control the Great Lakes through the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Cities Initiative.
             </p>
             <p>
              It has since evolved into a global meeting spot and destination for the elite to build their agenda (partly tied to United Nations Agenda 2030), tied through companies including SC Johnson, Case (CNH), Dow, Bayer, DuPont, Monsanto, and many others as part of a global collective.
             </p>
             <p>
              Les Aspin and Jack Lew are major players that mentored the current political leaders including the Clintons and Paul Ryan. They worked together to start corrupt agendas such as Sustainable Development and Community Policing in Racine, and it has now evolved into much more. They use Racine as a playground for the elite (with a fully controlled International airport, harbor and interstate), and as a model for programs to control everything from water and energy to education and religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Their newest initiative to control the investigation into trafficking is called The FIght to End Exploitation. This is tied to the mafia, corrupt churches including the Dominicans, corrupt businesses, corrupt politicians, corrupt law enforcement, Clinton Foundation, McCain Foundation, coalitions and foundations in Racine, and even Ashton Kutcher who is a middle man between the political elite and Hollywood through connections such as Freemasonry and Kabbalah.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine is a weak link that leads back to the evil elite through the Committee of 300 and the Council of 13.
