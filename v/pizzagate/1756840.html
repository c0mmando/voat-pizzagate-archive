<p>I\'ve been doing a lot of digging on Instagram. Before I go on I\'d like to direct you to this page, as many of you likely saw yesterday. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1753003">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1753003</a></p>
<p>As you can see, Kevin Heggs posted an instagram photo in which JA commented. Direct connection between the two.</p>
<p>I did some googling of this Kevin Heggs guy, and this ALTERNATE instagram account came up.</p>

<p>Weird. He has multiple pictures with kids and infants. Old dude with pics of him with shirt off.</p>
<p>But that\'s not the half of it. Look who he follows.</p>
<p>I\'m not going to link but scroll down a few and just look.</p>
<p>ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE MULTIPLE PICTURES OF INFANTS/CHILDREN ON THEIR INSTAGRAM. See for yourself. It\'s weird as fuck. He even follows a lot of young kids, looks around the age of 7-15. Creepy dude. HE ALSO HAS A &quot;REMOVAL SERVICE&quot; with pictures of white vans. Look at the descriptions. Definitely not legit.</p>
<p>Most of them seem like normal people that just post pics of their kids/granddaughters. Why does this guy follows SO many accounts with children posted on them? Could he be hunting his prey? It can\'t be coincidence he shares the SAME name Kevin Higgs, associate of James Alefantis.</p>
<p>There needs to be a full blown investigation into this. wtf</p>
<p>Save pics of his instagram if you can.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Here are some examples of accounts he follows.</p>

<p>Found his facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/kevin.heggs">https://www.facebook.com/kevin.heggs</a></p>
<p>Notice how he is selling barbie dolls. Someone comments &quot;I hope you have something else to play with&quot; This is a fully grown man.</p>
<p>WTF. THIS IS HIM. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMPLrzNDc5g/?taken-by=kevin_heggs">https://www.instagram.com/p/BMPLrzNDc5g/?taken-by=kevin_heggs</a></p>
<p>Creepy to say the least.</p>
<p>Another edit: recent child porn scandal in Leiceister, where this Kevin Haggs guy is from. Can we draw any connection? Let\'s go people!</p>

            Quite the persecution complex you have there. guess we're all shills and you're onto something if people attack the conecitons you've made based on your own research. It must be backlash affirming your confirmation biases! Bunch of numnuts! None of you looked at the "evidence". Enjoy your armchair activism and righteous indignation, you lazy dumbasses. A cursory review of his evidence would have demonstrated what a crock this thread is. The man in question is not the same Kevin Hegg who communicated with James Alefantis, they're different people and the author knows it. he's just diverting your attention from things that might prove fruitful. But enjoy assuming anyone with a family is a creep. I know the way he's presented it, this is the next breeder/abductor on our radar, but, again, just look at the evidence for yourself. Assume the author exaggerated many things and outright distorted others and go check for yourself. I don't make a habit of calling ppl's research garbage, but this is garbage.

            I explained that you've got two different Kevin Hegg's conflated, defied you to explain the basis of your presumption that they're one and the same, and you're still acting like the fact that they have the same name is grounds for suspicion. The onus of proof is on you, not on others who have drawn attention to the fact they appear to be two entirely distinct people.

              This isn't my first post what you suggesting here.
This is Kevin Heggs (connected with JA on instagram)
              <a href="http://imgur.com/ynRipWs">
               Kevin Heggs 1
              </a>
              and this is the other Kevin Heggs
              <a href="http://imgur.com/UL9kFRg">
               Kevin Heggs 2
              </a>
              . 2 Kevin Heggs instagram accounts but not the same person .. I don't say he is or isn't pedogate or pizzagate related.

               Apologies if I was harsh. There seemed to be a shill attack on the OP, and I'm sorry if I caught you up in it.

               Thanks for pointing out that the post is talking about 2 people called Kevin Heggs

            Real quick. I don't have an instagram account and I'm stuck on my ancient phone at the moment, but it seems to me that the K Heggs from the original post is in Toronto and this Kevin Heggs is in the UK. He sells his dolls in £ and there is a photo of found British ID that he's trying to find the owner of. Not saying it isn't something, but does anyone know where the original K Heggs lives?

            I found the Facebook Kevin heggs on Twitter and it's just pics of his son Reggie? But then I found that other Kevin heggs Twitter  (the one from the article you posted) and it seems that she's a woman from Toronto... So idk... That person is definitely up to some shit!!

            Not sarcasm.  I just didn't see anything bad on there other than those other pics I already pointed out.  But I think most people play it safe on Facebook.  His Instagram and his comments are definitely suspect.. Just not his Facebook from what I saw. I wonder if he has a twitter?? I'm going to look..

            It's obvious you triggered some nasty pedo-defenders.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't get upset,anything you post here ,or elsewhere,that gets attacked by these brownstoned sicko's,is a direction The Satanic Pedo's That Be really don't want anybody to look into.
           </p>
           <p>
            Through deduction you can find out what's a problem for the Satanic childkillers,so take advantage of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ignore it,don't let them get under your skin,it's all Rothschild/David Brock's Shill Army Alinsky playbook Agit-Prop operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The more they shill ,the better,because there are people not only listing these shills,but through the tools released by Wikileaks,they can be found ,and will be investigated and processed after the Satanic Cabal falls.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's something David brock isn't telling his workers,they will be dealt with in the future ,that's a promise.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are people who know who they are,so don't worry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't get angry at them,most of them are blackmailed victims,who need help, or perpetrators,who will be hung by the balls(or pussy) in a public square forever.

            Guys this thread has been debunked! here's the original thread

            . Go read me and the author arguing about the validity of his "evidence". Go see him wishing he was a shill, making all sorts of absurd claims about shills not existing, about how if they do they work for soros directly and earn thousands/hour. it's really shameless. it just goes on, there are at least 3-4 different coments which we have a sub-thread in which i draw attention to the flaws in his "evidence". TLDR: not same guy, not same Kevin Hegg, this author knows it too! Here was my OG post that lead to our heated exchange which I would encourage you to go read!
           </p>
           <p>
            "Guys, this is super weak. I don't see any connection. Honestly. I tried to, but it looks like nothing. Please allow me to explain why before accusing me of being a shill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Firstly, the kevin heggs who JA commented on a picture of claims to be a "Hooker/Waitress/Model/Actress" which this guy neither looks like, nor claims to be. Secondly, the kevin heggs JA communicated with has a profile picture in which we can see part of theface of a man with a full head of brown hair who in no way resembles the kevin heggs who you've found. Thirdly, you must really be stretching to see anything unwholesome about the instagram account of the kevin hegg you have linked to; he's a guy, who once posed outside from the shoulders up without a shirt on while working out, once took a picture where he didn't effeminately cross his legs, has a family that doesn't use prophylactics and wanted to start up a rent-a-van service. Wanted to. Now, if you take into account that nothing about this guy's instagram is remotely suspicious unless you've eaten too many red pills to not be biased. The 1st, 2nd and 5th link you posted of examples of children's instagrams he follows look like they are of kids which can be found in the group photos on his own instagram; in so I suspect they are family.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope I'm right, that no one proves me wrong, that this is just some unrelated kevin hegg who has a large family of religious individuals who don't use birth control or believe in abortions. But the evidence you've offered to support your contention that this IS the same kevin hegg James Alefantis commented on the post of is almost nonexistent. "Look at the descriptions. Definitely not legit." Oh? In what way, because I read it and don't understand why you would conclude definitely not legit. Spell out for me please what you found suspicious about it? Is any rent-a-van inherently suspicious? Is anyone proudly posting pictures of their nieces and nephews suspect? " It can't be coincidence he shares the SAME name Kevin Higgs, associate of James Alefantis." Except that it can and in fact appears to be the case! I'm not researching you or what you've contributed, comment and submission-wise, since joining less than a month ago; I'm not eager to smear others for what I consider poorly drawn conclusions, but this could be construed as an attempt to muddy the waters, to show what a bunch of crackpots us pizzagaters are. I would be surprised if there wasn't a link to this thread on twitter being distributed by shill bots to defame us.

            Wake up people. This is guilt by association. Jeff Smith aka werkinonmahnightcheese was inserted at the end so that this didn't look entirely baseless. It's a breadcrumb tossed to the red-pilled. But otherwise there's nothing here. This is how we look stupid. Oh hey, it's a guy with the same name as someone of interest, he must be that guy! He has a family and on his instagram he follows them and displays pictures of some gatherings. He's clearly a pedo! This is really lacking in substance. I think it's both intentional subterfuge and a strawman to be ridiculed."
           </p>
           <p>
            I stand by my remark. Fuck this fake connection. This guy is also a Kevin Hegg, i can see how that might be confusing to some people. But please click the above links, ask yourself if this is not grasping at straws and outright misrepresenting what someone supposedly thinks they see.

             Whoaaaa, stop right there Mr Dubunk. Who are you to say it's debunked when the OP's just discovered it? Who are you anyway? If you're new here, which it looks like, let me give you a tip.
            </p>
            <p>
             We don't de-bunk things here when just discovered, we investigate. This is an
             <em>
              investigation
             </em>
             . For debunks, sans investigations, let me head you in the direction of WAPO et all.

              Who there Mr Debunk Debunk. you don't do w/e you want. I looked at his evidence and I defy you to explain why everyone isn't engaging in a wild goose chase down a false rabbit hole! I'm not one to commonly call someone a sihll, i've done it twice before and I believe in both instances I did not do so merely bc i'm paranoid and eager to disparage others, but rather bc the author refused to answer any questions about why they'd made large leaps in reasoning upon which the bulk of their investigation was predicated. Go demonstrate Kevin Hegg is the same Kevin Hegg, you can't bc they're not! It's obvious even, so if you can't be bothered to check any of the "evidence", don't bother to talk smack about how it still stands on its merit.

               There's an awful chasm of difference between 'they're 2 different people', and 'this thread's been debunked'.
              </p>
              <p>
               Imo there is strange material on these IG's, even if the OP is talking about 2 different IG's.
              </p>
              <p>
               To shout 'debunked' is disingenuous b/c there's nothing to debunk.
              </p>
              <p>
               That you feel you need to direct others in what they should and should not investigate is weird to say the least and shillish at best.

                I didn't see anything weird. There's a distinct tone to the account of the pedophiles we've seen to this point, namely those of Alefantis, werkingonmahnightcheese and their friends. This man's does not share that theme as best as I can tell. I think this is nothing and saw nothing on the guy's page to suggest otherwise. Maybe I'll be eating crow when you guys discover something. But the idea that this man warrants digging on the grounds that he has pics of kids seemingly in his large family on his page, kind of a stretch. Since we can agree he's not the same Kevin Hegg who posted a photo that Alefantis commented on, then why is this guy so suspect despite being so heavily scrutinized to no real end? Why is the author insisting in his multiple posts that this is an "alternate account" of kevin hegg's? Don't you find that disingenuous?

              yes, the girl with black hair in the picture that is "From a Saturday night Halloween party" . the one with him wearing a blue wig and makeup. there is something up with that pic. that girl looks like she is in complete horror. she does not appear to be having a good time at a party at all.

              Who is down voting everyone? Wtf?? It's better to investigate any lead at this point to make sure there is nothing there? Perhaps new eye's will find something that other's didn't??? Just a thought  🙄
