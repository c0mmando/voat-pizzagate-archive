            He's on Hannity at 9.  He'll confirm it.

           <p>
            Or he wont. Maybe it wasn't him. But You have literally know reason to say it's fake, other than it's not verified. Twitter Censors the fuck out of people.  As you can tell by the pathetic suspension of the "Fake" account.  You are also extremely unqualified to be moderating this sub.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're not a shill, Please don't spread information that you don't know, and have not researched.
            <strong>
             If you're a shill, well then kill yourself of course.
            </strong>

           <p>
            <strong>
             Worst case scenario you're a shill, Best case, Incompetent.   Your post history is NOT the post history of someone who should be a mod.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't mean every mod should have an impressive post history.  But your's is extremely bad. It's small, But bad.  You have 3 posts, each worse than the next.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              The first one was in regards to james a. birthday.  Yes, It would be nice to find his birthday.  It'd be very helpful. That being said, That's one of your three posts...
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The second Post theorizes that James alefantis Is adopted, And that because he is adopted... That is his link to the podestas. You calim that Mary Podesta adopted 25 kids. She didn't, she adopted zero kids.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Done, Good theory, but you've made a mistake. You should have then deleted the post or edited the mistake into the post. Instead you double on your retarded "evidence" that adoption is the link between podesta and James. Not the all of the other fucking shit that already links them.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             She was also half Greek. The Alefantis family is Greek.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Uh oh. I'm half German.  Hitler was Austiran, but took over Germany.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             What if the link between the Podesta and Alefantis families is that the Podestas knew each other in adoption circles? Could the Podestas (and this might be a stretch), somehow have facilitated an adoption of James by the Alephantis family?

             Instead of making new accounts which are easy to spot (especially if they are called AnyBot5 etc, lol), it looks like the new tactic is to grab any old news article or video link from the net about pedophilia, post it without any comment as to how it furthers the investigation into pizzagate, and clog up the boards in this way.

             People aren't posting shit that is random pedophilia shit... I know which posts you're referring too, and I could give you several ways each of them are relevant.

           <p>
            PIzzagate, IS NOT about james alefantis, or his fucking birthday, or stupid fucking pizza.  It's the Clinton Foundation and it's network.

             If you're posting a link, please try to explain in your comments why it is worth a watch and why you think it helps further the investigation. Your title should describe what I am about to view.

           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, your post most be easy to find when googling your name...What If I have a new person that seems pertinent to the research? Should I say who it is in the title? So that they get a nice google alert? Not everyone needs daddy and mommy to help spell it out everything for them.

             I am doing research behind the scenes, but I don't post submissions about it to collect voats unless I have something new to say, or to ask a question if I've hit a brick wall.

           </p>
           <p>
            Well Yes, That's the point of this sub.  That is when you're supposed to post submissions.  So you're saying, You are doing research "behind the scenes" but you don't post submissions about it to collect voats. Post submissions about what? your research about other people's research? You obviously don't mean original research, Because you go on to say, Unless it is something new, Or if you've hit a brick wall.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again. You have contributed nothing new, 2 of your posts are littered with misinformation,  about the same irrelevant topic(His birthday is not irrelevant, BUt it's not worth 66% of the posts produced by a mod.)  The other post is you bitching about being downvoted, and giving horrible advice to the users.

            It is a pretty good ruse. If you search him, this twitter account is the second link. I wrote it off after seeing that he said they could basically fabricate video of him denying the tweets and to not believe it.
