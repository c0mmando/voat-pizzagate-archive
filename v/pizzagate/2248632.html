            B U T..President Trump IS NOT.....going after the CIA/DC Satanic rape tortue murder network. No. Nope. No sir. Not even close. Why would he? He is one of them. Tell the murdered and traficked children that  they are winning because the news told a story about Al Frankin pretending to grope breast.

             This guy is right. Sorry, voaters, but Trump is a fucking Mason. You really think that he'd be ALLOWED to be as rich and powerful as he is if he wasn't in on the whole thing? Don't you people get it? Being wealthy, being an "elite," it's not something you just get to do on your own. You have to be brought into the fold, or as George Carlin called it, "The Big Club." You have to know the "rules" of being a member of the upper class, you have to be taught "how the game works."
            </p>

             TRUMP IS ONE OF THEM, HE DOES NOT GO AFTER SATANIC PEDO RINGS

              JFK was also an elite and he came so close at bringing them down. Andrew Jackson defeated Central Banks. Trump maybe a mason but think of his Oct.8 2012 tweet! Would a pedophole tweet anything like this. I bet you anything that Trump is no psychopath and that is all we need, all previous presidents where psycho pedos except Nixon who actually called Bohemian Grove '... God Damn faggiest place on earth' - and he was removed because of it. Trump is the best chance we will ever get taking down the global pedophile scum, use it.

               JFK was set up with his own MK Ultra Sex Kitten (Marilyn Monroe). What the hell makes you think he wasn't at least somewhat complicit with the goings-on? Maybe once he found out about the Satanism/Pedophilia aspect, he tried to jump ship, but I definitely think he had prior knowledge of the corruption and the backroom dealings that were going on in politics at the time. He saw some shit that shook him out of the trance, and he tried to use his position to make real changes. And we all know how it turned out for him, with his wife scrambling to gather bits of his skull fragments and brain matter off of the back of their car after the deep state capped him like a disobedient dog.

              Trump could probably tell you that shitting into your mouth would be good for America and you'd open wide, smiling from ear to ear, awaiting the brown, patriotic sustenance of his ass.

             <p>
              Has everyone here fucking forgotten that Trump was on Jeffrey Epstein's jet several times? As far as I'm concerned, if you're placed on the Lolita Express, you're a goddamn pedo.

               Lol I bet you post on Yahoo articles too. Litterally the same script. "Trump could shoot you and you'd still support him." Also Trump was never on Epstein's Lolita Express, check the logs, it's not that hard.

                Trump, Hillary, Bill, and many other political figures and celebrities were on the flight logs. Hell even Kevin Spacey was on there. I'm not a "Democrat" you fucking cretin, I despise any and all politicians, because they're all PEDOticians. Stop trying to play your "LOL I BET YOU LIKED HILLARY" games, because I hate both of them.

            That page is utterly useless as an analysis, and it shows it right up front.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mere days after the inauguration of Donald John Trump as America’s 45th President, the DHS, under its new director (ret.) Marine Corps General John Kelly (who is now Trump’s chief of staff), released a curious 29-second PSA (public service announcement) video on human trafficking which prominently featured pizza and a pizzeria.....the DHS video can be understood as an unspoken message to pedophiles and child sex traffickers that the new Trump administration intends to go after them.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            First of this new interpretation of that video is hilarious given that everyone on this board thought it showed that DHS was part of pizzagate and was hiding their crimes IN PLAIN SIGHT!
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, John Kelly didn't release a PSA, Homeland Security did.  Do you really think that John Kelly came into DHS and this was the first thing he did?  Do you think he brought the script with him?  Do you know how long a commercial usually takes to plan before it's shot?  Do you think all the approvals and signoffs would happen in mere days and you rush into production.   This is analysis that either completely misunderstands this process or is deceptively trying to fool people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can guarantee you that Donald Trump and John Kelly had nothing to do with that PSA.  In fact, I can prove it.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the long list of arrests, what was Trump's influence on any of these?   For example, the first link I clicked on
            <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/crime/2017/05/02/2-men-face-federal-child-sex-trafficking-charges/101194846/">
             was this one
            </a>
            , two men arrested on state charges.  How would the federal government be involved in this at all?  EDIT:  What's Trump's influence on these arrests in EDO, Nigeria?
            <a href="https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2017/01/23/80-human-traffickers-arrested-194-victims-rescued-in-edo-delta/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Several of these arrests come from annual anti-trafficking programs that have been going on for years. For example this big arrest in CA is part of Operation Reclaim and Rebuild which is timed to coincide with the end of Human Trafficking Awareness Month
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In conjunction with Human Trafficking Awareness Month, Sheriff Jim McDonnell announced details and results from the third annual ‘Operation Reclaim and Rebuild’ enforcement operation, conducted by the Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking Task Force and more than 30 participating federal state and local law enforcement agencies, and task forces from across California.  The three-day, statewide effort aimed at combatting human trafficking took place between Thursday, January 26, and Saturday, January 28, 2017, was conducted in various mediums and met with positive results.

            January has been anti trafficking month since the Bush Adminstration, I believe.   Anti-trafficking awareness and campaigns have been going on for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also this doesn't seem to understand how government works.  Most of these arrests come under Obama's last federal budget.  The federal programs and federally funded task forces until October 1 would be under Obama's budget.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The 2017 United States federal budget is the United States federal budget for fiscal year 2017, which lasts from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017. President Barack Obama submitted a budget proposal to the 114th Congress on February 9, 2016.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            In fact Trump has yet to sign a budget, Congress passed a continuing resolution to keep the government running.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_federal_budget">
             Trump has submitted a proposal.
            </a>
            The proposal raises DHS's budget 7%, but that is mostly for immigration enforcement and to build the wall.   It cuts DOJ's budget, 4%.  A lot of anti-trafficking programs are run from the State Department, including the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and have an annual Trafficking in Persons report.  Trump's proposal cuts State's budget 29%.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a pending anti-trafficking bill that passed the Senate in Septemer and is still in House Committee that Trump could be pushing, but has not as far as I can see.   It has a 50% chance of passing
