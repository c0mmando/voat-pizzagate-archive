<p>Soon after this announcement, they went all crazy with the LGBTQXYZ agenda points and it seemed to be leading to the normalization of pedophilia. So, thinking back I realized that a lot of Crowley\'s rituals had to do with abusing children. There are many links here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> that relate to the probability of the actions of the elilte being a form of ritual, therefore: magick.

<p>Theory:</p>
<p>The pushing forth of these 12 perversions is to rope the globe into unwitting lesser magic rituals through the implied acceptance of the perversions that are required for the magical operation. I\'ve not seen any concrete proof of this memo, but from the fallout of it, we have had:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase in glamorizing the gay lifestyle</li>
<li>Push to sympathize with pedophiles</li>
<li>Increase in &quot;Baphomet&quot; style drag queens, discarding the &quot;soft&quot; trans gender style for the scary-demonic he/she look (see the queer kids stuff at the end of the above video)</li>
<li>Increase in public figures like Richard Dawkins giving consideration to cannibalism</li>
<li>Increase in music videos that show celebrities drenched in blood like Rihana, Maroon5</li>
<li>New terminology introduced from people like Miley Cyrus: Pansexuality</li>
<li>New craze uncovered called the Furries, making bestiality &quot;cute&quot;</li>
<li>Polygamy shoved forth through the Will Smith clan</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I know that they haven\'t broached necro or snuff, but it seems to be just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a list of the 12 perversions anywhere? I think this will tell us where they are trying to drag the public kicking and screaming to.</p>
<p>This post is not to inflame anyone, but to have an honest conversation about the alternate meaning of things that we have sometimes overlooked that the occult has a harness on. I\'ve always felt great compassion for the gay community, but I have been reviewing what I know and have seen and things are starting to add up differently than I thought.</p>

            The abuse is a distortion (both sexually, and lost in translation) of more ancient rituals of using children to do astral projection, possession, and PK events, telepathy, etc.

            I was thinking on these things the other day. It seemed odd to me that they would push pedo stuff before beastialaty. I always thought that the general public would be dead set against adults screwing little children and babies. The way people love their pets and consider them part of the family I thought it wouldn't take much to convince some that sex with their pets, that they love so much, is simply a way of expressing that love. But here we are, these sickos are pushing pedophilia first. I believe there are specific reasons for every thing they do. This line of thinking made me wonder if there may be beings that are not of this world, and some of these beings are evil. They are the real power behind all of this and a part of what they want is to breed with humans. Perhaps the steady push to do more and more disgusting, evil, horrible acts and us to view them as normal and common place, is preparing us for a future reveal of these beings. With the preparations as complete as they can get them the majority of people would accept them and be willing to pleasure them and even worship them. Then practically the whole world could be ruled by these beings. It doesn't matter if you look at this from the viewpoint of religion or see it as like an invasion of space aliens or beings from another dimension it works out the same way, the human population being taken over and made into slaves.
