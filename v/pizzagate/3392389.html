<p>SHE’S the daughter of former Australian prime minister Paul Keating, but Katherine Keating is making a name for herself in the US and has her own television show.</p>
<p>“It’s super-exciting,” Keating tells Vogue magazine of the documentary-style series, launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The series of five-minute interviews is a combination of everything the Keating name conjures up: politics, pop culture, social issues – all packaged with a nod to the younger generation. The aim, Keating says, is to bridge the “disconnect” between older leaders who have a lot of wisdom to impart and the younger generation who could learn from it.</p>
<p>“I want to make politics more palatable, to make current affairs issues more sexy … to try to educate young people about what matters and [that] their voice and vote really matter at the end of the day,” she says.</p>
<p>The well-connected Keating contacted “all my political and popculture friends” to take part in the series, which she hosts. The result is an eclectic mix of big thinkers and fascinating people across all genres, such as former British prime minister Tony Blair, Google chief Eric Schmidt, United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, artist Jeff Koons and model Naomi Campbell.</p>

<p>Keating has announced plans to expand Maverick’s sustainability agenda through multi-year global programs and partnerships. She will be responsible for developing strategies, policies and sustainability initiatives to accelerate strategic growth, and has defined three core objectives: identifying large scale opportunities; overseeing programs that deliver positive and tangible environmental and social impact; turn Maverick into a driving force in the sustainability space.</p>
<p>“My recent experience in media, particularly on the publishing side, has <strong>illuminated</strong> the growing need for corporations to shift their priorities towards sustainability and social impact. I am excited by the opportunity to activate these trends and work alongside an industry leader like Guy. He has given me a broad mandate to oversee sustainability and strategy under the Maverick brand and I look forward to playing an important role within the organization”, said Keating.</p>
<p>Keating also sits on the Berggruen Institute’s 21st Century Council as a New Leader, was recently appointed to the Ambassador Council of the International Crisis Group, she sits on Global Citizen’s Mandela 100 Advisory Committee and serves as Vice-Chair of the Whitney Museum’s Performance Committee.</p>

             The Berggruen Institute was founded in 2010 by Nicolas Berggruen. Formerly known as the Berggruen Institute on Governance, the Institute launched various projects devoted to proposing and implementing new ideas of governance. Today the Institute is composed of the Berggruen Governance Center and the Berggruen Philosophy and Culture Center..The 21st Century Council brings together former heads of state, global thinkers and entrepreneurs to address the problems arising from power shifts from Western-dominated globalization to a multipolar world. The council is devoted to global governance reform with the aim to “build on a convergence of interests in order to create a community of interests.”
