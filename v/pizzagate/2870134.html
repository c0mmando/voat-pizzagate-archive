            Apparently, during the March 2017 bust of a gay orgy involving priests and Cdl. Francesco Coccopalmerio in the Vatican, the Italian police got their hands on a copy of the infamous corruption dossier produced by cardinals Julián Herranz, Salvatore De Giorgi, and Jozef Tomko which identified a "gay mafia" within the Curia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some background: The dossier was commissioned by Pope Benedict in March of 2012 following the "Vatileaks" theft of private papers and classified Vatican state documents by his longtime butler, whistleblower Paolo Gabriele. (Gabriele was tried and convicted of theft in October 2012, but maintained he stole the documents to
            <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9575729/Trial-of-Popes-butler-Paolo-Gabriele-begins-as-hes-accused-of-leaking-Vatican-secrets.html">
             fight "evil and corruption" and put the Vatican "back on track"
            </a>
            . He was
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_leaks_scandal">
             personally visited by Benedict and pardoned December 22, 2012
            </a>
            , just five days after the Pope received the cardinals' 300-page corruption dossier on
            <a href="https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2013/02/21/news/ricatti_vaticano-53080655/?ref=HREC1-4">

            .)
           </p>
           <p>
            According to La Repubblica, it was that day, with the dossier before him, that Benedict decided to step down from the papacy, the first action of its kind in
            <em>
             six centuries
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Though Benedict claimed in his 2016 memoirs
            <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/report-benedict-xvis-memoirs-say-gay-lobby-tried-weild-power">
             he was not pressured to leave the Chair of Peter
            </a>
            , one of the first documents leaked by Gabriele was an anonymous note delivered by Colombian Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos to the Vatican secretariat of state and to the secretary of the Pope in January 2012 detailing a claim made by Cardinal Paolo Romeo, Archbishop of Palermo, Sicily, to a group of Italian businessmen during a November 2011 trip to China that there was a plot in Rome to poison Pope Benedict which would succeed and that Benedict would be dead within one year. Benedict resigned almost exactly one year after news of that prediction was published by Italian newspaper
            <em>
             Il Fatto Quotidiano
            </em>
            <a href="https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/02/10/complotto-di-morte-benedetto-xvi/190221/">
             February 10, 2012
            </a>
            . The paper states:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "During his talks in China, Cardinal Romeo prophesied the death of Pope Benedict XVI within the next 12 months. The statements of the Cardinal have been exposed, as a person probably informed of a serious criminal conspiracy, with such security and firmness, that his interlocutors in China have thought with fear, that an attack against the Holy Father is planned."

           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Romeo">
             Romeo served as papal nuncio to Haiti from 1983 to 1990

            . He also served in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once Benedict resigned, Romeo

             denied his prediction
            </a>
            :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Cardinal Romeo for the first time denied the content of the "forecasts" on 11 February 2013 saying that 'the story published on the pages of
             <em>
              Il Fatto Quotidiano
             </em>
             was the result of mental rantings: they are only folly."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            At the time, Romeo was Archbishop of Palermo, Sicily. Pope Benedict chose his predecessor, Cardinal Salvatore De Giorgi, as one of the three cardinals commissioned to investigate the leaks and produce the 300-page dossier.

           <p>
            In the Church Militant report linked to this submission, Voris says the dossier reportedly documents Satanic Rituals and Freemasonry as well as sexual and financial corruption and abuse of power polluting the Vatican:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Church Militant has learned more about the dossier, although we have not actually laid eyes on it. Some of those who have, tell us that the information is not just about homosexuality within the Roman and Vatican clergy, but also satanic rituals, which, if true, would be beyond explosive.
            </p>
            <p>
             On this point, faithful Catholics here in Rome and other locations of late have been speculating and quietly discussing that the evil which seems to have gripped so many levels of the Church is beyond usual human failings of sin and bad judgment, that there seems to be something directly diabolical at foot.
            </p>
            <p>
             Indeed, Abp. Viganò speaks about the direct work and presence of the demonic in all that is currently going on in the Church. But Viganò isn't alone in pointing a finger at the diabolical.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the past few decades, there has been much argument back and forth about, for example, Fr. Malachi Martin's declarations that satanic rituals were taking place here in Rome involving various members of the hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
             The controversial Roman exorcist Gabriele Amorth — who died two years ago — warned publicly about the very real presence of the diabolical in Rome and the Vatican.
            </p>
            <p>
             Adding to all this, numerous churchmen will tell you privately that among the sinister players at work in the hierarchy are various Freemasons — some in extremely influential positions, hidden in plain view.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aspects of Freemasonry have long been associated with satanism, so the connections between active homosexuals, Freemasons and satanic practices here in Rome shouldn't really come as that much of a surprise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Freemasons have long sought the overthrow of the Catholic Church and infiltration into the clergy and hierarchy of morally corrupt agents — including active homosexuals — is a known tactic used by Freemasons as well as communists, as testified to by former Communist Party member Bella Dodd.
            </p>
            <p>
             So when a number of very public issues begin to collide, they feed this rumor mill, which may very well be true. For example, the staff Pope Francis came out carrying at the opening Mass of the Youth Synod very much resembled a wiccan stang used by witches, the very public display of what looked like a gay pride cross being worn by the Pope at one of the sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Vatican, of course, had quick explanations for all of this in the face of an explosion on social media best summed as — what the Hell is all that?
            </p>
            <p>
             But the very fact that the Vatican had to offer explanations for what even looked like symbols of witchcraft, sorcery and sodomy adorning the person of the Pope shows — at the very least — a completely out of touch Vatican and, in many people's minds, something far, far worse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Additionally, as mentioned, Freemasonry is the sworn enemy of the Catholic Church, being officially, publicly condemned by more popes than any other single thing in the Church's history — even as recently as by Pope Benedict.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet since he became pope, Francis has been lauded publicly — officially praised — on no less than 60 different occasions by Masonic lodges all over the world. And the Vatican has failed to repudiate any of them.
            </p>
            <p>
             This nexus between Freemasonry, homosexuality, satanism and political socialism simply fuels the believability of reports about a dossier and later documents detailing this. If this dossier or additional accompanying documents do emerge and bring this to light, the potential fallout would dramatically impact Pope Francis and his papacy because Francis received the dossier from Pope Benedict after being elected, and according to some sources, actually promoted some individuals named in the dossier.
