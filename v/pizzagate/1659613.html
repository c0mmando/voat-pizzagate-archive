<p>Native children are being kidnapped, placed in private yachts, abused, killed and their bodies taken outside Canada’s twelve mile territorial limit to be disposed of in the ocean by prominent Catholic clergy, businessmen, judiciary, military and politicians according to a former employee of a Vancouver Catholic Cathedral. “The Vancouver police and RCMP appear heavily implicated in child trafficking and protecting these sick and wealthy men” Pastor Kevin Annett told the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State, in investigation for the ICLCJ Court.</p>

<p>Two children were raped and killed as part of the Cardinal inauguration of Quebec Archbishop Gerald Lacroix according to a report filed in 2014 at the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Eyewitnesses claimed Cardinal Lacroix, Catholic Jesuit Superior General Adolfo Pachon and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s senior cabinet minister Denis Lebel participated in the rape and human sacrifice of a five or six year-old boy and a small girl in the basement chambers of Jesuit Headquarters next to the Church San Lorenzo Piscibus in Rome. The Italian mafia Ndrangheta supplied children for an office at the Vatican according to documents filed at the ICLCJ Court.</p>

<p>In 2011, Rev. David Kalamen, Pastor of Kelowna Christian Fellowship in B.C. was stunned to hear that BC judges Mary Southin and Duncan Shaw supported pedophile rights. </p>
<p>In February 2011, there was a parliamentary session to focus on the wording of Bill C-54, a legislative bill designed to increase or impose mandatory minimum penalties or punishment on sexual offenders of children. Psychology experts were brought in claiming that pedophilia was a sexual orientation comparable to homosexuality. Where do they find these experts? </p>
<p>In July 2011, a Muslim scholar, Sheik Saleh Ibn Fawzan Al-Fawzan issued a fatwa defending Muslim child marriage. He gave an interpretation of Sharia law reinforcing that there was no minimum age for marriage and that girls can be married even if they are in the cradle. The only question was whether the child was literally physically capable of bearing the weight of her new husband. </p>
<p>In August 2011, Vogue Magazine (Vogues enfants) promoted lingerie for 4-year-olds and began marketing clothing for children that sexualizes them. Simultaneously, a conference was being held in the United States to normalize pedophilia: “It’s not my fault that I feel this way.” In a twist of focus, one of their purposes was to deal with “society’s negative reactions to a love of children.” </p>

<p>Hockey is Canada\'s Religion - Maple Leaf Gardens is Canada\'s Mecca - And a pedophile palace for Gordon Stuckless, a hockey coach who was charged with 100 counts of pederasty on 18 boys. He got 6 years, which means he\'ll likely be out in less than 5 years. I guess Canadian judges love hockey and little boys.</p>

<p>CANADIAN ROYAL PEDERASTY</p>
<p>The Queen of England Stole 10 Native Canadian Kids In 1964. They were never heard from again, before she took them, she made them kiss her shoes. The one surviving witness died before making it to court. Lord Mountbatten was a pedo who liked to mount and bat little boys.</p>

<p>Frank Giustra is a famous Canadian billionaire buddy to the Clintons who hales from British Columbia ( Where else? ). He owns Lions Gate Films and a music company because that\'s where little dreams are made from. After the Queen, he\'s Canada\'s biggest pedo. While\'s there\'s no &quot;smoking dick&quot;, there\'s a preponderance of circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>IF YOU LIKE ABUSING LIL\' BROWN BUMS, THEN WELCOME TO CANADA.</p>
<p>The Highway of Tears murders is a series of murders and disappearances of mainly aboriginal women along the 720 km (450 mi) section of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada from 1969 until 2011. Between 20 - 40 victims were murdered hitchhiking that stretch of road.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION: You may think this is just a hit piece, and you\'d be right. It\'s a hit piece just like the BBC, Washington Post and New York Times do against pizzagate all the fucking time.</p>',

           The Queen of England Stole 10 Native Canadian Kids In 1964. They were never heard from again, before she took them, she made them kiss her shoes. The one surviving witness died before making it to court. Lord Mountbatten was a pedo who liked to mount and bat little boys.

           Frank Giustra is a famous Canadian billionaire buddy to the Clintons who hales from British Columbia ( Where else? ). He owns Lions Gate Films and a music company because that's where little dreams are made from. After the Queen, he's Canada's biggest pedo. While's there's no "smoking dick", there's a preponderance of circumstantial evidence.

           The Highway of Tears murders is a series of murders and disappearances of mainly aboriginal women along the 720 km (450 mi) section of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada from 1969 until 2011. Between 20 - 40 victims were murdered hitchhiking that stretch of road.

           CONCLUSION: You may think this is just a hit piece, and you'd be right. It's a hit piece just like the BBC, Washington Post and New York Times do against pizzagate all the fucking time.

            Really can't get my head around the whole paedophilia as a natural sexual orientation argument it's complete lunacy how anyone can fall for this virtuous paedophile bs is beyond me.  Homosexuality is between two consenting adults it can't be equated with paedophilia and these morons who admit to thinking about sex with children should be institutionalized for stupidity.  Thoughts aren't crimes you idiots and if you wouldn't do it you're not a paedophile, why would you admit to that unless you are a paid pasty pushing this disgusting agenda, if you wouldn't do it then you are probably suffering from the same mental Tourettes as everyone else in the world that can make the worst possible thing pop into your head at any given time.  Like if you walk past someone standing close to the tracks on a train station platform and for a split second think about bumping into them sending them onto the track, or if your friend asks you to hold something delicate and your mind starts thinking about tossing it against the wall.  And even if you genuinely are attracted to children what help do you suppose you'll get?  Therapy, chemical castration, and prison don't work so if you ask me this is a ploy to give these so called 'virtuous paedophiles' an excuse to act and call it a sickness, sounds more manipulative than virtuous to me.  Anyway that's my rant over but just in case any virtuous paedophiles out there are reading this and have become downbeat about all of this remember Switzerland have had clinic for people like you for years it's called dignitas you should look it up.

            I'm not saying Native children are not predated upon, however, the ICLCJ Court does not exist outside it's website and has no jurisdiction. Beware of any info from ICLCJ.

            reddit is straight up blocking a link I wanted to post with damning evidence against john podesta i tried 5 different sub reddits to post it all within the rules and they will not let it go through they say you are doing that to much try again in 2 minutes wait to minutes then it says try again in 8 after 8 minutes it says try again in 2. They want to censor the truth. I wonder if the reddit ceo is a pedophile otherwise I cant see why they would be blocking this i have ways to force people to see it though they cannot stop me.

             Hockey is Canada's Religion - Maple Leaf Gardens is Canada's Mecca - And a pedophile palace for Gordon Stuckless, a hockey coach who was charged with 100 counts of pederasty on 18 boys. He got 6 years, which means he'll likely be out in less than 5 years. I guess Canadian judges love hockey and little boys.

            I've been looking into Children's Aid Society in Ontario stealing kids here:

            And the Haven Foundation on Gabriola Island being up to something very weird here:

            There is a lot of weird stuff going on in small BC islands. It's a very "leave each other to their own devices" kinda place with lots of new-agey and hippy kinda people that don't ask a lot of questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus all the Robert Pickton stuff with him being the fall-guy for Hells Angels who attended the Piggy's Palace Good Times parties.

            This is something that is so encoded in the bible that I think someone had to see it. We are in what Paul calls the falling away. The bible talks about Satan's seat and where Satan dwells in Rev. 2 with the church of Pergmas. I believe it is telling us that satan put his throne and kingdom in the church. Once our churches got so bad it spilled out into society. It's lawlessness now. We would not have seen this unless God showed it to someone and He did!!! Praise Him!! Satan wants to rule the world and he is being worshipped by millions of people in our churches. This is indeed a very big end time struggle of good and evil. God wins but it gets bad before it's over.

            People should read some of the Malachi Martins statements and interviews about the state of the Vatican and the roman catholic church. This guy was a respected Jesuit and a catholic priest and a secretary of the Vatican council and he basically said that the Vatican was infiltrated by satanists. No bullshit. And he's not the only one to make such claims. And then ask yourselves, how come there is a clear epidemic of pedophilia among catholic priests and why has the church paid millions to silence those claims and has protected those perverts and not even removed them from their positions but rather relocated them elsewhere? Theres some shady shit going on in the Vatican.

             Secret teachings of all ages by manly p hall is a nice start to other sources.
            </p>
            <p>
             Manly P. Hall literally sat in the NY Library for decades transcribing the most ancient and eclectic encyclopedia of the ancient and more esoteric teachings, all in hopes to preserve for future decades.
            </p>
            <p>
             These sources can only point you so far until you need to be familiar with latin, aramaic, greek and  so many other languages if you wish to proceed down a path. 
He does hit some key points on a LOT of topics, I am sure he is not painted in the best light as being a mason himself I just seem to corroborate more from his sources than other new age type shit.

            Recently I twittered
            <strong>
             @JustinTrudeau
            </strong>
            with a  "what are you doing and why"  comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I usually use my phone, but if I use links I go to my laptop for easier access. Within 10 minutes my laptop got an automated voice message stating that my computer is under attack, my credit card, passwords and person info risks being hacked and if I don't phone the help number my computer will be locked down for my protection.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I phoned the number, got a guy who had a definite middle east accent, who asked for the error code and what computer I had. When he found out it was a chromebook (I know, I know, it was cheap and I got it a long time ago),  he said he couldn't help with it and asked if I had another computer.  I said I wanted to know what to do about this one. He said to shut it off.   I said I wasn't giving him that information because he's likely a scam.   He immediately hung up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone sent this info link or other critical information to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/JustinTrudeau">
             @JustinTrudeau
            </a>
            with different results?
            <br/>
            I'm wondering if it was random coincidence considering  Trudeau's  dad, Pierre was in league with  the Immam  Agra Khan and on this forum an article showed Justin Trudeau and family spending christmas on the Imam's  private island..... donated a lot of $$ to Agra Khan foundation which lacks transparency.

            This will make long posts easier to mentally grasp quickly esp in long posts with many links. Also makes it far easier to copy out just the chunk of info from a post that you want... and lightens the attention load on the reasearches as they can grab info faster given the freaking velocity this topic has.
           </p>
           <p>
            YOu could also ad the
            <a href="">
            </a>
            tags to collapse the URLs if you wanted - but I understand that is not always desirable...

            We are so nice that whenever cas comes to take kids, we automatically take cas side. We assume they are the good ones. But look at how hard it is to get your kid back and where they actually end up. Many native families have problems (emotional, substance, etc), it's like they have an unlimited resource. We praise them and think they will actually help these kids overcome their psychological issues, but they often just get put into a worse situation. Blood is thicker than water, but not in Canada, they'd rather give your child to a stranger.

            It's been going on for decades and the Church continued to cover it up.  The alleged murderer here, Richard Lavigne actually taught my 7th grade catechism class when he was assigned to the Precious Blood parish years before this murder occurred.  However he didn't teach our 7th grade class anything about religion he taught us about black magic and Voodoo, he would also bring anyone of the altar boys fishing with him every Saturday.  There was a stir in the parish at the time and we never knew what it was as it was all hush hush back then but he was transferred to a neighboring town where he murdered an alar boy.  Here's the 60 minutes story on it.

            This is a great post and I think we see the same M.O. in the US: preying upon the most defenseless, Children's Aid/CPS stealing children from parents, and the privileged protecting one another.

               I guess but when has anybody ever really changed something for everybodys benifit without putting it all on the line? I am not wearing chains in shackles and being whipped and burned in somebodys backyard today. Thats because of people who were brave enough to bet it all to do what was right and I am grateful to the people of the past who did it. If they would have thought well what if I get killed, well what if my name gets smeared, well what if I loose my job etc and chose not to fight for what they believed in I would probably still be picking cotton in somebodys backyard.
              </p>
              <p>
               So the fear of loosing a job pension securities etc when some have paid the ultimate price which is there life it just doenst seem like a good enough reason to me to not expose the truth if you have evidence of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               If it was me I would risk it all but I wouldnt give the truth to one individual because that can be silenced I would make secret plans if I had something truly damning and truly good to be released on such a large scale that even if I "committed suicide" to much would have been released to be denied and the truth would be in everyones hands so they would not be able to erase all of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its hard to fight back when you are by yourself but guess what these elitist perverts and disgusting people are getting away with it because they are supporting each other and have each others backs to do whats wrong. The thing about whistle blowers etc is they always have to act by themselves a single soldier of honesty cannot combat an army of liars.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thats why anybody who has this evidence and all this concrete information should build there own support network. I just refuse to believe that the only option is to accept this I will not believe that I will just believe a solution has not been thought of yet.
              </p>
              <p>
               I wish I understood computers to the same level that julian assange does or edward snowden if I could understand and if the majority of us citizens could understand we could get our hands on that material miuch easier.
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing with people like asange is they need to be training people to do what they can do so that if something were to happen to them all is not lost. Same thing with snowden why be the only one who can bring the truth to light when you could train other people to do it that forces their hand far more than a single person. Now if something happens to the only ones who can hack and leak this information who is there to pick up the mantle from where they left off?
              </p>
              <p>
               Thats how I feel anyways.

                yes. The old saying, give me liberty or give me death, today could read something like, give me a healthy  world or give me death. I'm working extreme hours because of the inflation-wage ratio, so I feel like I'm a modern day slave to corporate governance. 
When my eyes were opened to just how vile this corporate governance $ rings are I felt like  This Slave Is Rising Up.

                  yes,  and I think the racist  issue is just that,  a diversion  implemented by those funding it  with the purpose of preventing us from banding together.    We already know that the BlackLivesMatter group was instigated by Soros funding, while the Muslim issue has been fanned by all the head political groups.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Trumps first decree didn't have to  come in  banning.  He could have addressed other issues and came at that on a lower key.  Right out of the chute   racism is heightened since  many of the public were getting wise to the blacklivesmatter orchestration toward racism and the pedogate problem.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If people don't get wise to the diversionary racist scams it will be a very long minute. 
What are they hiding?   Aaah, they're hiding behind shields to protect the top group, this has always been their tactic.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Quite a political chess game, sadly we, and our children, are the players.

                 Well thats good all of this gives me alot to think about but I dont know about others but for mer personally. I just cant continue to lay my head down in peace everynight with this happening all over the place. Its like soldiers who join the military because they claim they want to "defend freedom" when thats not what the military actually does anymore. I want to help combat this gross over corruption of government and will not be told there is nothing that can be done now return to your industrialized slavery. I wont be made to accept that answer. I dont know what the answer is just yet but im looking.

            I will show you the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters. With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornications. Rev. 17:,2 Kind of sounds like our days, doesn't it?  How drunk the liberals are on their beliefs! Our churches (false churches) are the whore, Kings of the earth are our government leaders like Presidents and Prime Ministers and other government officials. It's easy to understand when you see it. You can see how the Prime Miniister of Canada are with the whore Catholics on their yacht committing fornications (raping kids and killing them).

            Oh my fucking god it gets worse and worse sharing information is not enough. This information is worthless we are asking the people doing these things to send themselves to jail. It all makes sense now a long time ago something was done to me in the military that I will not speak of ever again. Anyways one day I posted about it on the Internet and the very next day is when I noticed I was being stalked by a white man in a van with black shades. It continued for 1 to 2 years. I thought I was imagining it or loosing my mind but it all makes sense now. Max spiers was murdered for trying to expose a u.s military sex trafficking ring. When I posted what happened to me and what I witnessed I felt like it was an isolated incident. I feel like I was being stalked to determine if what happend to me was somehow connected to this crazy pedophile ring. And if I knew something that could create a problem for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember hearing high ranking sergeants talk about how a little girls vaginas is tighter and feels much better than a woman's and talk of having sex with the dead bodies of children. This is all prior to what happened. When I initially heard it I just assumed that it must be some type of joke that was being made.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel like I'm in the twilight zone with all this being dumped on me. Its shocking but upon the revelation of this evidence so much that never made sense in the world starts to become more clear at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is reality this research is pointless all that will happen is you ask the criminals to arrest themselves it will NEVER happen. The only way is if somebody has the guts to take them out personally without the protection of the law because ultimately the law is what's protecting the crimes of the elite and destroying any civilian opposition that comes out. They steal our money with taxes and protect their evils. If there was a physical action I could take that would bring it all down I would do it but not without knowing it would be effective.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is crazy the only other option I feel could work is to beat them at their own game but do it better. Flood the webs and non isolated areas with indisputable evidence being shoved in the publics face. Use truth propoganda the majority of the country with the truth to counter the social engineering of the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go to websites like dancing with the stars or stuff that has nothing to do with the darkness of government elites spread it everywhere the only way to bring it down is to provoke the human conscious of multiple people. Putting it on voat and forums for critical thinking individuals is nice but it will not be effective unless it reaches a majority of people who are not awake yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have money and power but we have numbers. The only way to win is to increase numbers with awakening of the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whew that was alot it sounds dramatic but it's the truth. You see things like the million women March against trump we need a 100 million citizens March against government murder cover up and molestation of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Somebody has to organize the movement but getting enough believers will be hard. My wifi name being pizzagate is working though because I did it 2 days ago somebody went to the website followed wifi name instructions started reading about it got mad and punched a wall and started arguing with his wife about the validity of it so it does work. So far that's the only small thing that allows me to contribute so I do. If femenist marches pro life marches black lives matter marches and all these other marches about things to me that re beneath this in importance can be done this should be able to be organized.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to find somebody who has organized a big mrch in the past who belives this to be true to help. It has tobe large enough that it cannot be easily ignored and dodged by the elites social engineerng. I will not call it "news" becuase that is not what it is it is social engineering.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have had 2 different police officers approach me days after starting my investigation "claiming" to be looking for somebody other than me 2 different times.
           </p>
           <p>
            No run in prior the only way to bring this down is not with documentation but with somebody that can somehow set up a hidden camera or get the heinous acts on video and audio and share them with the world. That way there is no more lying or persuading the majority of peoplle need to SEE it with their own eyes before they will believe it is real. Even though we are critical thinkers and don't need to see the acts to know they are real with overwhelming evidence most Americans are only focused on Beyonces new album and the size of Kim KS booty or the latest sports news THEY are the ones who need to be awakened. I wish I could find out where one of these locations were I would do my best to get something on tape.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wouldnt be suprised if they really are not selling that many albums and that if secret government funds these celeberities through transactions that look like them come from regular people because they without knowing it aide in keeping the population ignorant to the things that really matter. Look at america prior to the pop culture craz most americans could name the preseident branches of government and elected officials. It cant be done anymore things like the laws that dictate our realities have become second to the pop culture age and it only works in the benifit of our opressors. It was not like that back in the day people were more tuned in to what there government was up to.
           </p>
           <p>
            When kennedy wanted to confront the government for wanting to be to secretive with the information it would and would not diclose with its citizens he was done away with. We are not free we are slaves to a government entity it is the new slavery. Anybody who disagrees with me tell me why those who molest murder kill rape and abuse the most vulnerable amongst us get promotions while lakeisha on 54th and crenshaw gets 2 years in prison for stealing a purse from macys? we are slaves and its time to awaken the masses.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know it sounds crazy over the top and  bit dramatic but sadly its really not. What I am saying is not as crazy as what these people have "DONE". We are not lesser cattle and beings to be hearded manipulated enslaved raped and abused for their personal amusement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most people do not like to read or think so this evidence is pointless for them. Its like people who only read books with pictures in it because it appeals to them more. You have to get the proper video and audio files and release them silence the shills and torch the elitist swine the pillage the virtue of children and desecrate the meaning of life.

            Damn! I remember Kevin Annett being very active on Canadas pedogate, particularly what they were doing with indigenous tribes children with a huge media, gov, police coverup.
Evidently he sent Amnesty International a hefty packet of evidence and yhey sent it back unopened!
Really sad shit.

            Tread with caution.
           </p>
           <p>
            This ICLCJ info may have kernles of truth or more in it, but has also been associated with wild charges and disinfo historically on the internet - same agency led followers on for months a few years back, claiming with rock solid certainty that charges had been brought against the Pope in this court who was going to be arrested and tried on charges related to the deaths of scores of native children in Canada.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was a false claim with apparently no provable basis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edited to add in response to R4R:  In regards to the incident I am speaking about, I am talking about a deliberate and early misleading of a large group of online followers who were following a narrative by a poster who was defined, as this post is, by the trigger words ICLCJ, Native American children in Canada, mass graves, hunting parties, and The Pope.   He took them on a merry ride for a few months, promising, (much like gets promised here) of specific high level arrested connected to a pedophilia ring.  He insisted that the Pope was going to be arrested while attending a specific event, and everyone waited and discussed it for weeks hotly, visiting the website every day, driving a lot of traffic there and giving the person a lot of attention.  Finally the day arrived, and the Pope went about his business as usual.  Nothing whatsoever happened at all and while indeed some crimes may have happened in Canada, it was not clear how much of the claims were a fabrication, how much was real and that meant it was all basically rubbished because of being discredited.  So it definitely did more harm than good.  The bait - the idea the pope had been investigated, charged and was going to be arrested by any organization - was just pure fantasy.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the result is, I say tread with caution and skepticism more than ordinary with these particular claims and look into the sources used as much as digging through what leads are given.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is my duty, like everyone else, to report what memories we have regarding false leads, fake claims and disinfo, as much as it is to add to the investigation.  Our collective memory banks are one of our greatest assets.  So maybe there is something here, but discrimination is called for.  Are OPs news sources really trustworthy?  Guard against confirmation bias.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl:dr - this channel of inquirey is tained by heavy past disinfo, for what purpose unknown.

              I found an example of the Pastor Kevin Arnett claims with ICLCJ  back in 2014 - you can see in the comments thread how eventually the people led on by the claims started to question and quite angrily so.  Their wish to help victims and their honest trust had been abused -
              <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/celebrities/2014/07/pope-francis-found-guilty-of-child-trafficking-rape-murder-2465728.html">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              You can use that to goodle more, it was quite an incident but of course the black maw of the internet allows people to so quickly forget.  There are a lot of smoke and mirrors online.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sure there has been abuse in Canada.  Let's just make sure we chase down real cases.  There are many cases in OP's claim, maybe some of them are solid, but starting out with Kevin Arnett and a very short profile history here sends up orange caution flags for me.   I am glad you questioned me so that I explained myself in more depth.  Thanks.

            I'm not 100% sure about the following story, but it comes from Native communities in Canada. They tell this story about how, after WW2, the Catholic Church in Ireland took in Nazis, then shipped them to Canada, where they continue their abuses. I can't find anything on this specific story, but it's plausible.

            Too much here to digest. I'd rather take each piece of evidence one at a time, to be evaluated on it's own merit.

            Evil people within the country have done horrible things to children. Lumping everyone together is foolish at best and at worst it represents a deliberate attempt to undermine rigorous efforts to expose people who've committed these evil acts.

            Focus on the individuals who've violated people and on hard evidence. Carpet bombing will go nowhere.

            A lot of these low life disgusting and vile pedos have been charged and found guilty in the Court of Brussels.  Look it up.  But of course the are being protected by the Country's Leaders who are also doing the same.  They are all in this together and it will not stop until the Royals AND the PMs and Presidents are exposed for the sick rapers and murders and torturers that they are.  Satanic Devil Worshipers.

            The demons are in the churches. Our churches fell away and Satan took them over. Satan put his seat or throne in the church. The bible mentions this in Revelation 2:13,14 with the church of Pergamus. Satan's kingdom is in the false churches. Only one person was shown the demons and that is me. They are extremely hard to see. I've known they are there for 33 years and the satanic worship in the churches is so hidden that I have no proof of it. The only proof I have are things like it was 10 Baptists that were stealing kids out of Haiti. Also the well known rape of little boys that Catholic priests do. The demons are in the place you would least suspect, the churches. All churches have them. God knows they are there and I know they are there. It has been my mission for 33 years, almost 34 now to tell people that our churches are no longer real churches. You will not see these demons because God rarely lets them be revealed. It will probably be very hard to get high level convictions because these demons are so slick. But not impossible! Christianity is not false, the so called Christian churches are false.

             Besides all the biblical stuff, you are right, but considering what the church has been doing over history I seriously doubt this is new.  They go into the church because it's like a sign that says 'Im good', so that when they do wrong, nobody will believe the victim. These kind of people are attracted to it. I also have to say, it's interesting how the whole discussion is getting religious. There are few things that I consider to be objectively evil, but rape and molestation are definitely the top. Even if there is no God (which I believe), this truly is a battle between good and evil.

              Yes it is a battle between good and evil. Satan wants to be worshipped and he will attempt to get his worship thru what he has done to the churches and the antichrist. All will be required to worship the image of the beast or be beheaded if they refuse to.

             The word of Jesus is not false, but Christianity has always been satanic at its core, as a minor variation of Judaism which is ultimately just Satanism in disguise.

              You can read about the downfall of the churches in Revelation 2-3.  It is spittle hard to understand but the 1st church had a first love and was starting to fall away. Each church just gets worse after that. The 3rd church seems to say that Satan dwelt in it.  The last church, the Laodicean church is so bad there are no longer any real Christians in it. The Laodicean church is a totally demon possessed church at the end, which is where we are today. The church probably started to fall away a few hundred years after all the apostles passed away.

              Jesus Christ started the early church but it quickly fell away and the churches became so bad they are demon possessed which is what has led to Pizzagate. I have actually seen the demons, there are trillions and trillions (really beyond counting) of them. It was not a pretty sight. I've seen at least 10 children sacrificed over the last 33 years. They tried to sacrfice 2 of my children but I got them away from the demons. Most people can't do that. The last church I attended a man, an elder, called around to the church families saying he heard Molech was looking for a sacrfice, the next morning after he called his 8 year old son was hit by a car and dragged 100 feet and died. After that I left the church and never went back. The demons ARE in the churches!!! BEWARE they ARE in the churches!!

            I always thought it was weird that Pope Ratzinger suddenly retired. Now they're saying that Pope Francis is guilty of  child scarfing too. Somehow, I'm not surprised despite his "everyman" mannerisms and unearned reputation for Godliness.

             ' Dutch therapist Toos Nijenhuis testified at the ICLCJ Court that as a child and like Barnett, she was badly abused and forced to witness child murders that involved global elites, claimed childhood torture at Barnett’s same Australian Holsworthy Army Base and like Barnett, was a victim of Human Hunting Parties. Nijenhuis’ perpetrators included former Pope Joseph Ratzinger, Dutch Catholic Cardinal Alfrink and Bilderberger founder Prince Bernhard. Nijenhuis explained to International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State Secretary Reverend Kevin Annett, her witness to child sacrifices as late as 2010.  "

            Canada is next on the radar, so directly tied to the buggering monarchy it's disgusting.  The catholic church, the anglican church all part of it.  Giustra is most definitely a pedo, too closely tied to the witch hitlery for there to be any doubt.

            Very good OP.  The one on the frequent Hot Dog Stand runs for the office in the Wiki Leaks Global Intelligence Files Str at for was also good.  Is it better to research these atrocities and document?  Or How to get to average folk?  I know my skill set is better at the former.  Really horrific news coming out in last 48 hours if you keep looking.  This is a good compilation.

            Well documented and even I am shocked. 2nd in the world!!!??? Outrageous! I just posted somewhere recently that although many countries now are exposing their politicians I have heard through the grapevine that Canada is perhaps the  worst in that NO POLITICIAN get exposed here as the coverup is so thorough. Would love to have more confirmation on Frank Giustra, always suspected this and wonder if he is not involved in the blackmail of politicians in Canada. Up to recently he was teflon. Others took falls for insider trading, the Vancouver Stock Exchange was exposed for corruption and had to fold yet Frank always was 'clean' even though others have pointed out his corruption.

             My Vancouver Canada source told me about how organized crime gangs run the town and that their Ports are controlled by the Hells Angels who all work there, full clearance, and even own the unions. It would make sense someone like Frank would have close ties to get them to take care of his dirty work. I wonder how many Hells Angels in Vancouver are Freemasons? Any chance of finding out? I'm not sure how it works up there to look.

              YES you need to look into the Robert Pickton case! He took the fall for the Hells Angels! Witnesses being intimidated and he just released a book out of prison that was banned everywhere, haven't read it but I assume because he reveals exactly how he was set up.
             </p>
             <p>
              it's common knowledge in BC that Piggy Palace Good Times club was a Hells Angels club and police were tipped off about Pickton for years, even taking a stabbed woman from his property IIRC, and nothing was ever done.

               Canada is about as bad as britian when it comes to this shit. Its citizenry give off this hunky dory goody good vibe but our police force is rampantly corrupt and abuse like this happens constantly.

               It'll never happen in Canada. Believe me. We could have video evidence of Trudeau raping little kids and it wouldnt even register with anyone. This country is DEEPLY asleep.

            What if the Church was always intended to be nothing more than a structure of control and abuse and the myth of Jesus was created to give the false hope of salvation to the downtrodden masses, keeping them compliant,  servile and waiting...  always waiting ?

             I would say that in instances where the teachings of Jesus is even slightly twisted can corrupt. But for Jesus himself, everything that he preached, faith, truth, humility, etc., leads to everything that we consider "moral". In churches where his teachings are followed completely, you never find instances of child abuse, or systematic corruption. Sometimes a preacher may stray off the path here and there, succumbing to a past addiction of gambling or lust, but it's usually an individual at fault rather than a structure of systematic abuse. For Christians, nobody is above Jesus, so that's why we don't have a Pope or anything. We do listen and respect a preacher/priest, but even then are merely advisors in people's lives rather than commanders to die for.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, he tells people to spread the truth, so as to not sit idly by as corruption takes hold. In a way, he promotes warriors and fighters for the cause, but not in the sense of suppression, rather to show you the red pill and let you make the choice yourself. Make no mistake, I am here fighting the good fight

               Jesus wins. His timeline is not your timeline or mine. Time to him is vastly different than this notion of time that we have created. He will come back, probably sooner than most people think, and he will destroy the filth that are committing heinous acts against the good in this world.

               When there is evil, there is always good to fight it. If Jesus was really losing, there would
               <em>
                be
               </em>
               no pizzagate discussion. Hillary would have won. Things would be much worse than this.

              <p>
               You can't merely look at the presumed state of things and be discouraged if it's not favorable. If Trump did this, he would've quit before he even reached the primaries. This is where faith can empower. And the worse things are, the more we should be fighting. Things may not seem "good" by some standards, but they are definitely headed in a good direction!

              Several times in the Bible when a city or culture descends into its eventual destruction, there is a progression of how the people there think and behave. The degeneration we are seeing now (including rampant pedophilia) are a part of this path to eventual destruction.

              Lots of child abuse happening in the Catholic scene. Also #spiritcooking has revealed that there is something more to it than sexualization of children. Much more.

             I don't think this is necessarily true. For instance, Jesus may never have existed but it would be very easy for it to have happenned. During the time he came about there were many 'messiah's. He was just the cult that picked up the most steam. If you actually read what this guy says it is very attractive. But over the years more and more writings diluted the original kindness and humility Jesus called for.  Despite these good things he talked about, many atrocities have been committed in his name. All in the name of some archaic form of virtue signalling too

              Because actual Christians aren't subverted like the top Catholics and what not. I am Christian and I believe his teachings and these people don't practice what they preach. It's sick.
