<p>Jennifer Araoz, the plaintiff, filed her lawsuit in a New York state court in Manhattan.</p>
<p>She had said in an interview on NBC last month that she had been recruited outside her New York City school to spend time with Epstein, and eventually give him massages, when she was 14.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNCQeQuV6O0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNCQeQuV6O0</a></p>
<p>Araoz, who is now 32-years-old, said that she was later raped by Epstein when she was a teenager in 2002.</p>
<p>Multiple women have accused Maxwell of enabling Epstein’s sex trafficking ring by either recruiting them directly or scheduling visits to Epstein’s home.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 57, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, has repeatedly and vehemently denied allegations of involvement in a sex-trafficking network run by Epstein.</p>
<p><strong>The three other people in Araoz’s lawsuit include a secretary, a maid and another “recruiter”, according to NBC news.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Araoz’s case was not mentioned in the sex trafficking indictment filed against Epstein last month but her attorneys told NBC News that she has since cooperated with the FBI and federal prosecutors as part of their investigation of Epstein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The lawsuit is one of the first actions initiated under New York’s new Child Victims Act, which enables victims of child sex abuse to bring civil cases against alleged abusers for the next year, regardless of when the abuse took place. After this year, victims will have until the age of 55 to file civil suits.</strong></p>
<p>While Araoz’s lawsuit states that she never met Maxwell personally, it alleges that the Epstein associate “conspired with Epstein in the implementation and maintenance of his criminal enterprise which, in turn, victimized Ms Araoz”. The lawsuit alleges that Maxwell hired “recruiters”, scheduled appointments with Epstein and intimidated potential witnesses.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of his death, accusers expressed anger that Epstein would not face them in court. They sought reassurances that authorities would continue investigations into others who might have been involved in a trafficking ring that targeted young girls for sexual abuse.</p>
