            ANY and EVERY member of the Jesters is a freemason pedo satanist maggot. They have a little thing they put on their license plates sometimes. ANY and EVERY time you see a "jester", that is a POS that needs a bullet in its satanist maggot skull. Same with shriners

            The Jacksonville Court #90 reported to the IRS that they spent $80,397 in 2006 on “conferences, conventions and meetings” while failing to list an exempt purpose. They also spent $79,984 in 2005 and $83, 250 in 2004 while failing, again, to list an exempt purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also named on the witness list are Jane Does, 1 – 5, who each “has personal knowledge of prostitution, minor prostitution, use of illegal drugs, and/or entry into Indian reservations by Schair and/or his customers.” Jane Doe is described as a minor recruited and/or coerced by Plaintiffs and/or Plaintiff’s representatives for prostitution services for certain of the Plaintiffs’ customers in Brazil during approximately the year of 2000, 2004 and 2005.
           </p>
           <p>
            Five girls gave statements to Brazilian federal police officers who are investigating “minor Indian and other girls living near the rivers in the region of the Municipality of Autazes/AM who became victims of sexual exploitation by North-American foreign tourists.”
           </p>
           <p>
            These girls told the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, Federal Police Department that they were, at the time of the alleged minor prostitution, aged 13, 14, 16. One of the 16 year olds stated that her 14 year old sister was also recruited. All the girls state they were lured onto the fishing boat by someone named "Richard."
           </p>
           <p>
            The 13 year old reported that she was a victim of sexual abuse perpetuated by a group of foreigners, North Americans, who asked for her services aboard their fishing vessel, the Amazon Santana. She was told that her job would consist of doing “the general services of the vessel, such as sweeping, laundry and assisting in the food preparation.” She accepted because her family needed the money and after boarding the vessel with other girls, learned that “she would have to have sex and to drink whiskey and beer with the foreigners.” She also told authorities that she spent three days and three nights on the vessel and that each day she had sex with a different foreigner and that she became pregnant during this occasion not knowing which one of the foreigners was the father and that after the birth of her son, she and her Mother were thrown out their home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Girl 2, aged 14, states that in August, 2005, “Richard” promised to pay her R$200 (Two hundred Reais) but was paid only R$50. This translates to being promised $119.76 but instead paid $29.94 per night. Girl 3, aged 16, states that in September, 2005, “Richard” promised to pay her R$200 to R$300 for 2-3 days work but was instead paid R$80 the first day and R$50 the second day. This translates to being promised $119.81 - $179.71 and instead being paid $47.92 and $29.95. Girl 4, aged 16, states that in August of 2005, she and her 14 year old sister were promised by "Richard" to be paid R$100 per night but were instead paid R$35 each night. This translates to being promised $59.88 per night and instead being paid $20.95.
           </p>
           <p>
            These statements allege the crime otherwise known as “child sex tourism.”

             Guess what other American city closely tied to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption is linked with Brazil, Haiti, Ghana, Norway and other hubs of trafficking and corruption? Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's home district near Reince Priebus and Scott Walker's home areas. It is a cesspool linked with every aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Guess what else is closely linked with Racine? Freemasons, Scottish Rite, Knights of Pythias (Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, etc.), Pilgrims Society and other secret and closed societies that are directly involved with criminal corruption, racketeering, pedo activities, embezzlement and other crimes.

            The Royal Order of Jesters is a secret fraternal group made up of invited Shriners who, in turn, must be Master Masons. The ROJ and Shriners enjoy the benefits of being classified by the IRS as both nonprofit charity and fraternal groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jesters' motto is:
           </p>
           <p>
            "I am a Jester. What I see here, What I hear here, Shall stay here, When I leave here."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Royal Order of Jesters was investigated by the Grand Lodge of Texas in 2005 after they received a complaint alleging that:
           </p>
           <p>
            • Prostitutes were available for Jesters to have their way with
           </p>
           <p>
            • Brothers had sex in front of other brothers
           </p>
           <p>
            • Brothers held oral sex competitions
           </p>
           <p>
            • Potentates, Chaplains, Attorneys, Judges and Past Masters were Jesters
           </p>
           <p>
            • Sex, illegal gambling and alcohol were the preferred order of business
           </p>
           <p>
            The complaint asked the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Texas to investigate the Jesters for:
           </p>
           <p>
            • Actions which disgrace Masonry
           </p>
           <p>
            • Indulging in the intemperate use of intoxicating liquor
           </p>
           <p>
            • Gambling
           </p>
           <p>
            • Profane swearing
           </p>
           <p>
            • Willfully abandoning their families
           </p>
           <p>
            • Cohabiting with lewd women
           </p>

             lol...was at a Mardi Gras parade and here comes the Shriners in their little cars.  Hmmm..just occurred how convenient those little cars are for little children.  Anyway an acquaintance says "I love the Shriners"  First words out of my mouth on eye contact was "They're pedophiles".  My My she went crazy in denial.
