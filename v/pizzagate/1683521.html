<p>The <strong>February 20, 2017</strong> interview of John Podesta by <strong>John Heilemann</strong> in the segment linked below titled &quot;[JP] Talks About a Hacked Election&quot;, IMO, contains more than meets the eye and ear.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GD2pwatfQg4">https://youtu.be/GD2pwatfQg4</a></p>
<p>Of course it was a set piece and his first real and in-depth appearance since the Election in a safe setting to spin all the &quot;Russians Did It&quot; and other nonsense we\'ve been hearing non-stop from the Mockingbird Media.</p>
<p>However, beginning at around the 21:00 minute mark he begins to hem and haw and seems lost or perhaps too cautious as he tries to make his point. He almost becomes inarticulate and is so uncomfortable that he\'s just about unbearable to watch and listen to.</p>
<p>But after listening carefully two or three times it\'s clear that he\'s sending a message especially in light of the recent recent censoring of some of the major alternative media and communications outlets.</p>
<p>After whining about alternative media sites &quot;peddling&quot; &quot;fake news&quot; [i.e., the truth], JP goes on:</p>
<p>....&quot;but it\'s....it\'s....ah....undermining our democracy and I think <strong>the companies themselves</strong>, <em>they\'ve taken some steps</em>....they have a lot of responsibility....</p>
<p><strong>JH: &quot;Companies like F B.....</strong></p>
<p><strong>JP: &quot;Companies like F B, G_ _ gl, etc.....</strong></p>
<p>JH: &quot;<strong>Right....</strong></p>

<p>Hmm....</p>
<p>This interview raised an eyebrow when I first heard it last week. After noticing a major change on the internet the last few days, I went back to the interview to watch and listen more closely.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line is that my gut is telling me that JP was signaling what was about to happen: a concerted and massive attempt to censor the Internet which I believe is taking place as I type.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone else noticing or believe this?</strong></p>',

            You are spending an awful lot of time trying to discredit someone who has been FOR every popular theory surrounding pizzagate from the beginning. Your handle contains no contributions to the pizzagate issue and you implicitly created this account to troll me. So, since I am in alignment with pizzagate and you have NOTHING to show for pizzagate, along with NO EVIDENCE of my alleged 'socking' , what do you actually prove with your words - NOTHING. It's painfully evident you are a single, stalking troll. I am not ashamed of socking to tell you what kind of a piece of shit you are and I'll never back down from straightening out your faulty bipolar logic over the issue either, you are mistaken, wrong, and you will, eventually, understand that.

            Pointless,  you're trying to hard,  this thread stands as a testament within itself and you just keep attacking when your story happened somewhere else and is a distortion and lie....  Go away.

            Your lying to try and sabotage a thread that states its own facts,  what is the malfunction in understanding this?

            You seem to be a professional at highlighting what you think will strengthen your point but it's all silly,  it's a conspiracy forum not a spy game where everyone has to be pc,  people fuck around,  you most of all because all you do is stir the pot.  Every paragraph shows your pathetic attempt at trying to discredit me when this thread speaks for itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have no point. Your sad and your sick.  You need to get a life and stop following people from forum to forum just because you think your right,  but your just ill,  like the rest of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's sad that you think you have to try so so hard to get attention.

            It's disturbing in the sense that you don't see how disturbing it is,  but you use it in a threatening sense,  there's a strange pathology at work in you.  Something tells me I should be a little more wary of you as simply just a stalker. Gotta get fbi on speed dial with sons of sams like this running around.

            Well,  I can see that your not beyond dragging what little I did admit about my personal life into another forum.  Yes,  I'm bi-polar,  but your example is a pathetic attempt at berating me when it is your ignorance that causes the confusion.  See, vi say 'my material'  as in my collation and combination of other resources makes it 'mine' when I still site all the original authors of that material.  You are just too vengeful for some reason to try and get under my skin and discredit me.  This thread has none of those elements you accuse me of,  you are just dragging a one time scuffle in a conspiracy forum.  It's gross dude.  It's really embarrassing that you don't see what a fool you are just coming on here.  There's already 80 upvoats signifying this material has merit.  Your only proving yourself to be not too bright.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see you really tried to muster up as much vitriol to try to make some kind of spectacle here at voat as you did that cesspool called lop,  go back to your home slime.  Your not contributing your trolling you've got very little time left here. Use it wisely.

             So you would like to use my Bi polar MPD crazy papers against me and imply that I'm not credible,  everyone has been affected by mk ultra and if you deny it you just aren't mature enough to see the truth. So guess  guess what,  I'm not,  we are all crazy in one way or another, That makes me peachy because I'm just the looney fucker down the street,  with facts to back it up. I don't have to prove shit to you but I do have to rescue what little credibility I try to acquire to get this stuff out.  I was honest, anf now you want to try and spin it,  just like Intel or a some spiteful bitch. You though,  you just revealed your pathology by making a point to follow me to a serious discussion to bring up forum games you and e. Muffins played with me on a thread?  I was trying to defend myself when none of those other pussies would that also pretend what they know that hang on my threads waiting for more info.  I'm no fool,  I happen to have an idea who you are when we were at lop,  and I can tell you and everyone here THIS PERSON HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BIZARRE VENGEFUL BEHAVIOR  AND TRACKING USERS.  YOU ARE LITERALLY STALKING ME,  YOU SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT?  That's why I left lop,  the owner was giving IP's to the FBI and people like this are TRACKING USERS,  anonymously,  and posting no evidence just vitriol,  I ask you once again....  What's so wrong with this thread? You can't say because that will betray why you've only been a member here for two hours.
            </p>
            <p>
             Are you disagreeing with this thread?  That would mean you are against pizzagate,  so what ARE you doing here?
            </p>
            <p>
             You are very sneaky and manipulative,  I'm sure the rest of this forum can see that too.

            I find it hilarious that you feel so adamant about your point.  I can go and retrieve the thread you mention and I ask you please,  debunk it and tell the rest of the people here how I'm trying to mislead.  Unfortunately all I will see is more snark and no proof.  You act as though goofing around in anonymous mode in lop is some big no no when the place wouldn't exist without all those real turds interjecting their rude,  interrupting bullshit. Please don't try and come here feinging innocence as to how those forums work,  obviously you've survived navigating anonymously for quite some time,  clocking members on forums and following them places,  seriously creepy dude,  serious.  Watch your step.

            Wow, turd bird, talk about shill tactics, you followed me here, THATS DISTURBING. You did the same thing on lop, followed me everywhere, never made solid statements, and always posted in anon. I do agree I socked a few times only to support my position on that thread only, and did it only because I was taking a serious pummeling from anons and members over my own thread almost as a proxy attack about my material, that happens to be cited by well known conspiratorial writers.  No matter what I posted, on my thread mind you, the two of you were there to troll me. I'm being honest here, I only socked once or twice because all you other idiots did so often,  I got pissed and was only to basically tell you two what horrible dickheads you are. Serious. I got so sick of trying to fight your constant beratement with no actual rebuttal of 'my' material I just had the thread deleted.  If you idiots just want to pick and not conduct rational discourse then lop does not need me, even though I contributed massive views to the place. And then you act like its some huge offense when dude, its a 'fun and chat' forum, lighten up. The comebacks I posted were in no way facts that bolstered my position or planted swaying information. Look at the breadth of my material, based on anything you've contributed, which is nothing because you posted in anon on lop, I will let my readers decide what is right or wrong with my work. Ill bet donuts to dollars No one here is saying I'm trying to mislead them.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know, do you even realize what kind of illness it takes for someone  to follow me to another forum to make such a silly point. You are by definition a troll. Its embarrassingly pathetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you can see, what, pray tell, is so unfactual and deceiving about this thread? It's not conjecture or theory its a repost. You really are retarded aren't you. And look at your sock name for here, funny, created just for me. I have a stalker.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hey, most of the stuff I quote from is an ex Black Panther, if you got a problem with his work try and take it up with him, bet he won't be so nice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Help me out some too, show me what materials you've contributed to the world theoretical panopticon? I'll bet its zilch because you are an agent sent to discredit me. You are very transparent.

            I would like to reiterate my personal regard for Pizzagate:
           </p>
           <p>
            I never advocated the relatively heavy notion that actual exchanges of small children occurs at comet pizza, what IS outlined in WikiLeaks and subsequent investigation is a network of very diverse and questionably 'artistically' inclined  people that lean toward the profane and occult also leaning heavily on the type of industrial music in the vein of psychic tv and genesis p'orridge which may or may not be satanically inspired. This kind of environment, mixed with the spook atmosphere, makes for some prime time influence peddling and extortion, not to mention the 'extras' the owner and employees and even frequent visitors, can pick out of the late night lineup.
           </p>
           <p>
            There seems to be an irrational focus on anything child abuse instead of the basics, like perhaps yoichi shimatsu's 10 part series. However, I see that no matter what the flow of Pizzagate is already at magma temperature.

            Yes, and now they are even going after terrestrial radio (see Cynthia McKinney's show being taken off the air, and the coup at that community radio station).

             Could have been a triggered mk... but still more plausible that he was simply mistaken and in need of psychiatric help. No one does that without having underlying mental issues.

            Well, I guess from my sources there have been developments in this Google Blacklist situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawyers from both Natural News and Google have met and as of today Natural News has been re-listed on Googles servers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess it shows there really is pressure on, and, that someone one the other side has a little bit of pull.
           </p>
           <p>
            I for one am all for Natural News because it is one of the only sites built and staunchly for the VACCINE ISSUE, Deniro needs to go ahead with this full steam.

There are some intelligent comments here but ultimately the only thing that is going to happen is a reflection of mob mentality in society that is wholly not too healthy themselves. The powers that be know this about you, that EN MASSE you are an ignorant band of hypocrites and slobs. But the fact of the matter remains that WE LIVE IN AMERICA, where there are a set of principles that we must abide by to make things civil. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE GOLDEN RULE. Yes, people have violated and in some matters worse than others. THIS IS NO DEFENSE FOR THEM, it is a PLEA FOR RATIONAL THOUGHT.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some REAL idiots out there that do call and harass, make threats, and idiots like edgar welch that go and shoot off rifles, these are ALL horrible approaches to a very complex issue. ALL of us have to remember that SOCIETY IN GENERAL EN MASSE does not make good decisions, that's why all of us have to make a conscientious effort to remind each other that violence and threat are never the right answers. Regardless of what these people did or did not do they ALL deserve a fair shake at this thing and if it is ever proven that there is something wrong going on each and every one of them deserves full protection by the law, fair trial, pentinence, and ultimately forgiveness, depending on the echelon of their crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said, what seems astounding to me, is the veracity at which these people are able to push back at the so called 'harassment' that they are receiving. A THOUSAND CRIMES HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY MINUTE, what makes these people so special that they get the time to air out their grievances AND have SO MUCH DONE ABOUT IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY?
           </p>
           <p>
            NO OTHER MECHANISM OF GOVERNMENT WORKS THAT FAST.
           </p>
           <p>
            That really tells me they have got something to hide and they are able to hide it quick.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, you may not believe in Jesus, as I do not as the Bible tells us, but he DID allegedly say some good things.... You have to remember that each and every one of us was a pure vessel once, we were pure. It was this world that filled us full of misconceptions, distortions and lies and crystallized belief systems in you that may or may not be right or wrong, much of it is based on perspective and you do not know what kind of subjective experiences each and every one of us have gone through, so you just do not know. Combine that with the frankfurt model schools and the political and entertainment industry as one big mind conrol experiment our whole lives are one big illusion. It's time to wake up.

             To make another couple of points I know will be missed by the masses who portend to the christians or kind people they pretend to be:
            </p>
            <p>
             These people are counting on you betraying your better selves
            </p>
            <p>
             This 'en masse' kill them all attitude is only going to make them push back even harder because of the above statement and only force them underground faster.
            </p>
            <p>
             People that have been involved with the cult have done things to compromise each other and were born into it intergenerationally, and like us, were once pure vessels only to be filled with the filth that is still distorting their lives and everyone around them, wouldn't they want to receive some kind of forgiveness themselves?
            </p>
            <p>
             It is really time to examine yourselves to truly understand what side of the fence you are on, violence only begets violence.

            It's all there in the recently released David Brock memo where it says among other things that they'd be working with Facebook and Google (one of the quotes was something along the lines of they would... "Help Facebook to understand fake news" - because nothing says democracy quite like a partisan censorship guide huh!) Seriously, if anyone hasn't read it yet, you should. It's on Scribd (I'd link to it but Scribd claims to be down for maintenance).

            This little entry is a testament to some of the harassment I have been recieving in MY altruistic persuit of this matter, having been called a shill a number of times on a very popular site which I have supported (intellectually not monetarily) for a number of years.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I just wanted to record it here as a matter of posterity, since I believe that some kind of feeling must be injected back into this discussion instead of all of this one line psy-op bullshit of who's got the bigger dick etc etc... I'm done playing games with you people.

I can't quite put my finger on the kind of push back you are giving to this pizzagate issue. Since when does any 'conspiracy', even one disseminated by the compromised wikileaks, get so little credibility and then so emphatically denied and categorically dismissed? Especially when there is so much peripheral evidence that has that subtle implication that you, Aangirfan, are so fond of using. Your stance is perplexing.

Who is this AkhaldanSolo, Aang? It's like de ja vu all over again ... we've been through this, his exact same question with almost the exact same answer, and yet he keeps hammering away trying to discredit your arguments with the same crap (disinfo?) again and again? WTF? Like I said before if it looks like a troll, sounds like a troll and quacks like a troll????

            Ahem, yes, let me clear my throat here and give me the chance to let myself speak in the third (imitating a favorite reply of Aangirfan) person since I have become so damn popular here...
           </p>
           <p>
            AkhaldanSolo agrees with bigmouth C.Brennan above (and obviously the opinion of Aangirfan) that if there is no solid evidence and if there are no witnesses or surviving victims with statements than there is, by all rights, no reason to persue this matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ah, but something tells me there is way too much cat out of the bag. Some of us have taken too much risk as it is to persue this matter and may have already gotten ourselves pissed off at by someone, either by saying too much or by being wrong altogether...
           </p>
           <p>
            But hey, that STILL LEAVES, even if all of us go away, Wikileaks and the reason they released those emails in the first place. It WASNT FUCKING US, WE ARE JUST REGULAR FUCKING PEOPLE THAT GOT INTERESTED IN SOMETHING THAT GOT OUR ATTENTION FROM AN INTERNATIONAL WHISTLEBLOWING ORGANIZATION... WE ARE NOT THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE FOCUSED UPON AS DISSEMINATORS OF FAKE NEWS.
           </p>
           <p>
            WIKILEAKS HOLDS THAT RESPONSIBILITY... AND WIKILEAKS IS WHERE IT SHALL REMAIN. If WIKILEAKS is so fucking fake then why isn't Podesta nad Alefantis putting ALL OF THEIR EFFORT at STOPPING WIKILEAKS instead of the PUBLIC who only got interested in it as a matter of COURSE, because we are altruistic and when we hear or see of children in danger you will get flocks of good people wanting to do something.
           </p>
           <p>
            Call us shills call us whatever but until wikileaks steps back up to the plate to explain themselves none of us owe any of you any explanations for why we got interested in investigating this and deserve no harassment unless we are breaking the law in some way. This amount of oddity and all around strangeness is key in understanding that this is no ordinary situation and the pressure is on to absorb as much of the damage that has already been done and there are some very powerful people hard at work trying to stop the influx of truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go ahead and ignore this comment Aangrifan and not print it, but it's going up on that thread word for word, so no matter if you choose to sensor it there will be a record for a whole lotta people that used to come to your site and support you.

            Im surprised that Youtube hasnt been censored yet. Google owns them so you would think theyd have cnesored it by now. If they censored yotube our biggest source of info would be hit.

             It's much harder to censor Youtube. According to a 2014 statistic, over 300 hours of video are uploaded every minute. The software required to sift through that much video content needs to be a lot more sophisticated than text content or blocking results on search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
             Plus, I think they are hesitant to mess with the gravy train. They have a monopoly on the market, and if they do aggressive censorship people will notice and other video hosting sites will rise up. I'd guess that they are content right now to just censor the most damaging/explosive stuff and let everything else fall through the cracks.

            Just watched Resident Evil last night too and they lay it ALL out... the elite have done their so called 'specs' on the planet and they are right about a ton of things, the bio-epidemics that are going to hit the world that bill gates so aptly warns about are most likely going to be a reality. RE talks about how the elite have think tanks that know that, although manmade global warming is a money hoax, the earth IS warming up, simply because we are coming out of an ice age, or we might be plunged back into an ice age, either way models predict ice caps meting and taking out vast amounts of coastline around the world inundating most big cities. So what does Resident Evil do with these evil bastards, they design the T strain to wipe out humanity first. Yeah, I know, Resident Evil style is fucking AWFUL... but... but...

            The truth is there. These fuckers DO have underground bunkers and I wouldn't doubt they are as intricately designed as the raccoon city hive.

           <p>
            I'm REALLY surprised how many voices out there have remained silent, these forums aren't as full as they used to be but it's time the conscientious speak up and get busy.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point is, that interview above starts to make Podesta and alefantis out to be just regular guys trying to do regular jobs blah blah blah blah... bullshit, as we've seen by the PLETHORA of information people like John Podesta and James Alefantis have NO ORDINARY LIVES, they are too busy jet setting around the world collecting odd art or having spirit cooking seminars, creating advant garde pizza shops in lively sections of german cities or the hub of American politics, becoming gq's most influential men or hosting hot dog parties at the white house. Give me a fucking break. These guys have been in politics too long and KNOW how to field these questions and concerns but all of a sudden a few calls from concerned citizens are getting your feathers all ruffled? WHAT ABOUT THE MULTITUDES OF PHONE CALLS YOU GOT FROM CONCERNED CITIZENS ABOUT THE ACTIONS THEY WANTED YOU TO TAKE IN GOVERNMENT THAT YOU IGNORED FOR SO LONG?
            <strong>
             We don't see you all getting so worked up over the safety and concerns of the citizens like that?

             Well lots of pedophiles and rapist and elite reside in hollywood. They probably find great humor in the fact that many of the movies they allow and help fund to have produced seem like "fantasy" while harboring a bit of truth of their intentions. I mean they loose TRILLIONS of our tax dollars all the time and it goes unnacounted for so They probably do have bunkers set up where they can wait out any global [andemic that occurs.

              Ill add to that fact,  if you watch old gi joe episodes from the 80s theres a episode titled theres no place like Springfield. The story goes shipwreck has a secret 
Formula implanted in his brain by a scientist on the lam from cobra. Shipwreck is captured by cobra and cobra 
Creates a fictional city called Springfield so they can manipulate shipwreck with mk ultra techniques to disclose the secret formula. 
Dont forget Springfield is the simpsons hometown.

            " echo system where the fake news is"...........Oh he's shitting his pants, that was one too many "ahs". The other thing is he missed the word "echo", he meant "eco" as in ecosystem.
           </p>
           <p>
            So he's using ahs and is misusing words, he's freaked out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe what he's talking about is Google and others filtering out things like if "John Podesta" and the word "Pedophile".appear in the same search they filter it.
           </p>

            It's meaningless and it shows how desperate they are. They're fucking up more an more now. Just yesterday they couldn't keep their mouth shut and put the Awan Brothers back in the news:

            We don't even know what we don't know.  Information is being manipulated in many ways I believe.  I know Robert Steele has been raising eyebrows, and some question his allegiance, but when I listened to his most recent interview on Victurus Libertas he was adamant that Trump should create a true uncensored media so that our information can no longer be manipulated.  He talks about it at the 7:20 mark:(

             In my eyes, RDS staked his reputation on his recent claims that the big arrests were coming within a week or two. I'm giving his timeline another 7 days, and that's being generous. If it doesn't happen, write him off completely. A lot of the "truthers" are pushing hidden agendas or have other plans.

              RDS goes off into wackoland with his alien talk, etc. Obviously, he is all about HIM:  "If ONLY the POTUS with meet with ME!  ONLY

               I
              </em>

            Yeah, not much coverage of the Natural News Blacklist because Google is LYING straight up on their search engines about not doing it... but the very first result you get for 'natural news' is a FAKE SITE, and then tone of other sites saying how google is not blacklisting anyone... what a binch of fucking fascist posers...

             Google is not Skynet, it is a tool being used to create a Skynet-like AI brain. By mining the data and thought processes of millions, if not billions of people they can create an AI that thinks exactly like a human. This is touched on in the movie "Ex Machina".

            This is bizarre. I realize there are some idiots out there that do call and harass, make threats, and idiots like edgar welch that go and shoot off rifles, these are ALL horrible approaches to a very complex issue. ALL of us have to remember that SOCIETY IN GENERAL EN MASSE does not make good decisions, that's why all of us have to make a conscientious effort to remind each other that violence and threat are never the right answers. Regardless of what these people did or did not do they ALL deserve a fair shake at this thing and if it is ever proven that there is something wrong going on each and every one of them deserves full protection by the law, fair trial, pentinence, and ultimately forgiveness, depending on the echelon of their crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said, what seems astounding to me, is the veracity at which these people are able to push back at the so called 'harassment' that they are receiving. A THOUSAND CRIMES HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY MINUTE, what makes these people so special that they get the time to air out their grievances AND have SO MUCH DONE ABOUT IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY?

            NO OTHER MECHANISM OF GOVERNMENT WORKS THAT FAST.
           </p>
           <p>
            That really tells me they have got something to hide and they are able to hide it quick.
