            <p>
             Got a lot of phrases to use
            </p>
            <p>
             Mockingbird is Social Engineering, promoting what they want you to think
            </p>
            <p>
             Social Media is a Narcissistic Machine
            </p>
            <p>
             ain't that they truth
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone wants to be a star, even for 5 minutes
            </p>
            <p>
             Couldn't watch the Jerry Springer show because how low people would go to get on TV
            </p>
            <p>
             Sure got me thinking on everyone else
            </p>

            This is what shows me how deep and protective this gang is.

            "I prefer the term ‘victim’ to ‘survivor’ because the latter implies my ordeal is over. My ordeal will likely never end. As Dr Reina Michaelson warned, “Fiona, I think this is a life sentence.” I serve a life sentence for crimes committed against me, with the full knowledge and blessing of the Australian government. I am constantly harassed by police, paid agitators, pedophile payroll academics and journalists, DID sleeper cells, perpetrator relatives, fake victims, fake advocates, professional social media trolls, and retired intelligence community thugs hired to do the dirty work of the VIP pedophiles who dare not overtly attack me since that would attract media attention to their role in the international child trafficking operation."

            MacCauly Culkin has very subtlely implied that Chris Columbus (one of Steven Spielberg’s proteges) was one of the three men responsible for the incident that led to Heather O’Rourke’s death. ie the identity of the man who talked about “getting carried away” with her and the “Heather O’Rourke skin shoes” in that interview in 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            I should know because I presented a photo of Chris Columbus to him and asked of this the man who told him “we got carried away with her”. Said deduction leading to the question came from a photo of him with a cigar in his mouth. The interview specifically mentioned cigars.

            Good luck, update after you complete each perp. Write down and deliver to a lawyer a signed affidavit. that you will never attempt suicide...investigate my suicide as if it was a homicide etc.  Keep up the good work.
