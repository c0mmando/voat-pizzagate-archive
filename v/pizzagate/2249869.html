<p>In my post <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2084800/Inside-Obamas-secret-Alice-In-Wonderland-themed-Halloween-party-White-House.html">is an article</a> describing that party that was kept secret for 2 years. </p>
<p>The reason they supposedly kept it secret...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Obamas, maintained that the reason why it was kept so quiet at the time was because the administration was aware that it would be in poor form for them to host an extravagant party when so many were suffering financially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following stood out to me. It proves that the Obama\'s don\'t always list celebrities, entertainers or production crew on the White House visitor logs. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that many members of the White House press covered the earlier trick-or-treating photo op but did not report on the <strong>later party</strong> has left commentators outraged.</p>
<p>One way that the Obamas were able to keep the later party under wraps was by leaving the names of actor Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton off the White House visitors logs.</p>
<p>The records, which the Obama administration posts online in an effort to promote transparency, do not list the two stars who helped host the party that came under attack given the disparity between Hollywood opulence and tough economic times.</p>
<p>Officials dismissed any implication of a cover-up, however, saying that celebrities who visit the White House while working are not considered guests, and therefore not listed in the logs.</p>
<p>‘Entertainers and production crews who are working events are generally not WAVED in since they are not guests visiting the White House, they are working,’ an anonymous administration source told Politico.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Obama\'s were known to love parties and host them often <strong>USING OUR TAX DOLLARS.</strong> They did so much that an <strong>investigation was started.</strong> So if they have so many extravagant parties that go past midnight into the next day, and they leave whoever they want to off the visitor logs, imagine how many SICK parties that we\'ve heard so many rumors about, have taken place with their SICK friends that are disgusting like them. Imagine how much could have happened there and how many spirit cooking parties they had. It could be far worse than we thought. We\'ve seen many photos of the Obama\'s and the Clintons taken with Satanists and pedophiles.</p>

           They did so much that an

           <p>
            Firstly, it legitmizes every appearance of alefantis at the white house - if they kept "working" guests off of the list, then alefantis wasn't simply a caterer at any of the meetings/parties he showed up at.
           </p>
           <p>
            Specifically the DACA/Dreamer event - he was a guest, period.

            Sort of not hard to imagine now how he wracked up soooo much debt and seemed to do so little work.  Hes been like a pig living in the palace, now he needs to go back to his sty, even though that will never be able to payback what he has stolen from America and the world.  It is a little compensation until his Final Judgement, where no one gets a free pass.

             </p>
             <p>
              I think the Obamas were more in your face about what they were doing, with people making excuses as they went along

              I was so worried Hillary was gonna become President

               I am the only one in my life that is into politics. I would go to my room to watch the debates and would be cheering like I was watching a football game 😂 You should have seen me the night Trump won. I had a party for 1 including 🍿 lol.

                Same. I was cheering for trump so loud, in my room, on my own, with headphones on in Australia lol. It's kind of weird that as an Aussie I would know more about American politics and what's going on in your country than a lot of your own people. Sadly our MSM is like yours and despite all the negative propaganda shoved down our throats about Trump I saw something special in him. I believe once he cleans up your country a domino effect will send waves around the World. Which means my beautiful homeland will begin a clean up too. Such an amazing time to be alive. Stay safe everyone.

                No, no he really doesn't. As I showed, he's been golfing almost 80 times already and he's been in office less that a year. That may be a popular right-wing fantasy, but it doesn't stand up to the light of day. Him working that hard is obviously #FakeNews.

                Hell, it took Obama lobbying for YEARS, literally, to get Obamacare passed. Trump can't muster more than a few tweets and well publicized meetings. Don't kid yourself, his lack of effort is at least part of the reason he hasn't been able to get any meaningful legislation passed.

                The government owns all the means of production. They can do whatever they want and don't need to pay anything they just wire fake money into people's accounts. They don't even have to really print as much these days, I imagine.

             I think they were doing it way before.  Think about all those boys brought to the WH during the days of GHWB.  They were probably filming then as well.  Also at the apt. of Barney Frank.  This has been going on for decades.  The WH was  Rape Theater.

               The Executive suites underwent a "near max demo sweep". Not an object in the suites escaped scrutiny.  CIA had months of total access in order to bug the Oval Office before turning it over to Team Trump.

               Something I have noticed in a few pictures of BO is that he is dressed in the same type of outfit in the WH.  He wears a white shirt with a pullover sweater and plain pants in that picture playing ping pong at the WH with a young boy.  Also he wears that same outfit in the pics at the WH at the Alice in Wonderland Party with Johnny Depp.  Others in the family, the daughters and Michelle are dressed in costumes, but he is wearing that same outfit.  I have seen him in that outfit in other pics as well but can't remember now.  Very odd to me. Also, that pic of him playing ping pong in the WH, looks like it could be in the basement or hallway.  Is that in those hallways that Congress use in the basement?  Are these connected to tunnels that kids are brought through, possibly from CPP?  Idk, this has been on my mind for quite some time.  This posting just stirred up memories again.

                I've always heard there are tunnels but I don't know about CPP. Have you seen this? Obama's has his hands down his daughters pants. Who does this?!

                   I only questioned it due to the many who state that their daughters aren’t their offspring.  Have to admit, they more resemble the couple theorised to be their real parents than the Obama’s

                 As much as I distrust and hate BO, I think I have seen proof on here that the pic of him with the hands in the pants is photo shopped.  I saw it on here and I believe that a few others agree.  I don't know what is true anymore.  I certainly agree that he has probably done some really heinous things, but not sure about that one.

                 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=2ZjqH4cP-cw">

                 Just passing this along, for you won't see it posted here.  Also, I am just adding this for discussion sake, again we are awaiting and hoping that this will be confirmed.  But as I have said many times before, Don't Hold Your Breath.

                 So we should publicize this in many of the posts today, to go there and read the report.  Many will not know unless we advertise this, getting the word out, so to speak.  This needs to spread. Someone should tweet it out.  I will check out the posts.

               If you scroll all the way down it also mentions the 1800 Sealed Indictments waiting on the US Federal Court Dockets.  This certainly looks like an interesting week coming up.  Let's hope these two are connected.

                I believe 2200 Marines landed last night at Langley on the QT.  I think they are preparing for the fallout this week starting tomorrow. Buckle up, Carmencita. I believe this is what we have been working towards for over a year now. The Storm is here.

                   According to persons who reside near Langley, a large contingent of Marines arrived at CIA Headquarters in tilt-rotor aircraft and when the Marines deplaned, they were armed and moved quickly into CIA Headquarters!   SO NOW people are trying to tell us we not only are Fake News but conjuring up Fake Witnesses too.   The CIA is guilty of Coining the Phrase  Conspiracy Theory and that is NOT Fake News.

               WOW. Just Holy Wow.  Conspiracy Theorists are claiming the President of the United States is moving to take out rogue elements in the Intelligence Community, at the request of his new CIA Director.  It is rumored that these rogue elements have been undermining the Administration since before it took office last January, and may be connected to some well publicized "incidents" which suddenly resumed taking place this year, (mass shootings / violent protests) after a brief respite once the Obama Administration left office. Edit:  If there are witnesses claiming this happened, and people really saw it, there will be spreading of this.  You cannot put this into a box and put a lid on it.  I hope.
