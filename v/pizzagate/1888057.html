           I was watching The Keepers last night on Netflix. For those who don't know, it's about the murder of a nun, but the story is mostly about sexual abuse in the catholic church. The events occurred in Baltimore, MD.
          </p>

           In the last episode I saw, I think episode 5, there is mention of a man named "Skippy" who is a suspect in the murder.

           John Podesta, who we all know as Skippy, is around the right age. He would have been 20 years old at the time.

           Podesta is also a catholic. The suspect in The Keepers was "obsessed with the catholic church".

            It is worth digging into. The Podesta brothers had taken some time off college to campaign for a man, a Democrat named McCarthy, at the time of the nun's murder. There was a protest that McCarthy promoted about 30 minutes from where the nun was murdered that fits into the same time frame. I believe McCarthy was there, so the Podesta brothers would have been, too.

            <strong>
             Skippy
            </strong>
            is mentioned several times in this book titled "Leatherman: The Legend of Chuck Renslow."
           </p>
           <p>
            It mentions he is "
            <strong>
             gay
            </strong>
            " and is also into the "
            <strong>
             occult
            </strong>
            "
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Skipppy
             </strong>
             was into the occult. And I know that you know that Chuck and all of us were into the
             <strong>
              occult
             </strong>
             , too. So, that was the
             <strong>
              connection
             </strong>
             with
             <strong>
              Skip
             </strong>
             , and he was more serious about it then I guess any of the others of us were.

            And

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Skippy was a real character. He was not a lover but we did have sex. He was a gorgeous boy.

               I find it HILARIOUS that the same posters who go on and on about his ill-fitting suits are designed to make him look larger also insist that he is the same person as some 6'1" or 6'2" guy.

            Is the series/murder fictional? I would up-voat this but I am new and already used up all my contribution points.  I hope others so.  Very interesting correlation you point out.  Does the producer or director link with JP at all?

             No. Not fictional. Documentary of the murder of Sister Cathy Cesnik when she was going to expose a pedofile ring.

             it's a docuseries - not fiction. it's a 7 part series about the murder of a nun back in 1969 but it exposes the whole underbelly of sexual abuse at the time.

            I remember there was that TV PSA commercial about human trafficking a couple of months ago and it was loaded with symbols related to Pizzagate. There was one shot where there was a picture of a pizza on the left and a gate/door on the right.

             I  have seen this before, but relish watching it every time.  Thank you.  She shows her true colors as we well know.  I really respect Matt Lauer for standing up to her. Especially already knowing what a temper she has.  I am sure it is well known.

            Hiding in plain site...these folks have rules and they have to tell us what they are doing.  I think second part of that equation is that we have to agree, either by inaction, lack of attention, or other methods..BTW..I take back my Sovereignty and would suggest we all just take a sec and do the same :-)

             have rules. That's really insightful. There was an anonymous poster on Above Top Secret years ago who went by "Hidden Hand." He or she said some pretty incredible things about the "Lucifer soul group." Apparently, they are here on Earth to provoke us to help us ascend spiritually.

              The McDonalds video was horrifying listening to him speak so freely and openly like that. I used to think there was absolutely no way the Holocaust was any kind of hoax as I had read some people say online. Now I am really beginning to wonder. Is there a separation between the Jewish community as in the Zionists and the Jewish followers who do not know about this stuff? Or do they all truly know and understand this? During the holocaust is that what possibly happened, the zionists orchestrated everything and the Jewish followers had no idea what was happening and complied while the zionists were the masterminds behind it to have the world hate the German or white blonde hair blue eyed race from then on so they had complete control to carry forth their new world order agenda? He eludes to that in the video. Was it a warning or a hint that Hitler was half Jewish because they always have to give us a hint or tell us ahead of time to warn us of their plans? Then brainwash the "goyum" to follow? I know they claim anti semitism at any time for being called out in something. I know 911 was our government and Israel together, many Jewish high level business people were advised not to go into work the day before and the stock markets showed manipulation prior to the event as well. These are facts. Why can't people just let others be to just live, why go to all this trouble, for what??? How true is this video? I heard a beep as in a push button phone while he was speaking so likely the 1990's? So many questions...

             <p>
              <strong>
               Thelema
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Before we attach the labels “totalitarian” or “fascist” to Crowleyites we should outline the main features of the Thelemic worldview.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many Thelemites consider themselves to be divine agents, acting from a “True Will” — while non-Thelemites are mere 'objects' — as indicated in Crowley's dictum, "the slaves shall serve." The “slaves who shall serve” are each and everyone who lives (according to the Thelemic worldview) in dependency: dependants/subordinates, addicts, weaklings — in other words: the enslaved ones.
             </p>
             <p>
              In occult terms the Thelemite is a dichotomist, seeing himself as a superior being or a 'chosen one', while everyone else is as nothing. This sort of Thelemite (certainly, there are exceptions to the rule) lives in a world ruled by good and evil; of course, as a superior being these Thelemites might reach a level that is above that (the “crossing of the Abyss”) — but nevertheless the world below the abyss is only black and white. Thelemites are trapped in such relationships; all are victims and culprits, masters and slaves, gods and sub-humans. And this is mirrored in their language when they describe their critics, ex-members, the (Christian) churches, the government, the administration or whomever they target.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is contradictory to the self-portrayal of Thelema retailed to the public from which new members must be drawn.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not only is the religious-philosophical ideology Thelema totalitarian, but also the emotional attitude, the value conceptions, the opinions about being chosen, the rôle identifications, the projected unfair fate of the Thelemites and the assumption of the justified predominance over non-Thelemites derived from all of these considerations. Viewed politically, this is expressed in all political orientations resulting from an anti-democratic perspective.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Democracy
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1922, Crowley hoped that Israel had to be subjected completely to the Law of Thelema, because he, Crowley the Anti-Christ, nevertheless was the Messiah for which the Jews waited. How does this daydream fit into Crowley's alleged fascist Weltanschauung?
             </p>
             <p>
              Crowley appears to have been a political opportunist, a hypocrite whose chief principle was self-interest. His main political statement can be picked out from his diary entry of May 29, 1923:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               I'm certainly not an anarchist, for the family is the smallest and vilest unit of government: nor a Socialist, for the State is the largest and so the least human unit. I suppose then, that — with Ethyl as without — I want a Patriarchal-Feudal system run by initiated Kings.
              </p>
             </blockquote>

                Yes this is contradictory to the self-portrayal of Thelema retailed to the public from which new members must be drawn. You've clearly fallen victim to the false narrative.

                 Not only is the religious-philosophical ideology Thelema totalitarian, but also the emotional attitude, the value conceptions, the opinions about being chosen, the rôle identifications, the projected unfair fate of the Thelemites and the assumption of the justified predominance over non-Thelemites derived from all of these considerations. Viewed politically, this is expressed in all political orientations resulting from an anti-democratic perspective.

                Crowley could be regarded as a political opportunist chumming up with anyone anywhere, and running the business of his religion (Thelema) for his private amusement. However, the more he failed with his political ambitions and his utopian endeavours, the more he flaunted himself as the founder of a religion.
               </p>
               <p>
                Crowley attracted fanatics from all walks of life. He was a prig (not only in respect of his political views), who had assembled a religion for self styled outsiders. One would be hard put to regard this religion as either philantropical or democratic. Thelema always aspires to turn into a state religion, nevermind of which state, i.e. its founder tried to ingratiate himself with his religion to anything state-like, no matter how totalitarian or radical it was. For him, the main issue was the presence of an anti-christian element. The amazing thing about those efforts is that Thelema and the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) did not want to substitute christianity but return it to its original condition. Thus Crowley wrote in 1944, entirely along Theodor Reuss’ lines that it was the task of the O.T.O "to restore Christianity to its real status as a solar-phallic religion".
               </p>
               <p>
                Crowley  had connections to communist characters. His totalitarian streak could blend with the "right" or the "left," and both "right" and "left" if pursued to extremes verge into shades of the totalitarian. In this sense one can call him a fascist but one could equally call him a communist, and he was neither in the final analysis. However, it is obvious that some misanthropic elements can be found in the biography of Crowley, in the concept of Thelema and in the instructions for members of the O.T.O. and its environment. We will thus concentrate on the most evident examples and protagonists. And who else can be found in this milieu: the occult racists. And the rôle models.
               </p>
               <p>
                Occult organisations are frequently faced with the reproach of cherishing Right Wing extremist ideas; not least because of Aleister Crowley’s distinction between "ordinary" humans who are compared to dogs - and who serve - and a superior class of human gods, who rule the dogs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Crowley's 1937 idea of the commercial utilization of the

                </a>
                and his suggestion to discuss Thelema “as the base for the Nazi new order” [diary entry dated 5th May 1936] indicate the assumption of a totalitarian conviction by Crowley.
               </p>
               <p>
                On the other hand, after the National Socialist seizure of power, more than two dozen Lodge-like organisations, including occult groups, were forbidden. The 1937 circulated decree of the SS Reichsführer was the political conclusion of Nazi propaganda against freemasons and similar organizations. The Gestapo was given the order to dissolve all forbidden groups which they had not already targeted.

                 Well I am impressed at how you can write so much and say so little. Even bothering to copy and paste bits from your first post again, well done. You're free to draw your own conclusions of Crowely anyway you please, but your artistry seems rudimentary.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You seem to be well studied, but somehow you simultaneously seem to have overshot and come up short of the mark.  Perhaps you have fallen victim to your own false narrative.

             Something to do with it, yes, but it takes place in baltimore, and no direct connections are immediately apparent.  Similar story, only this is a true documentary.  Spotlight and The Keepers are my favorite pieces of film in the past year.

            Podesta born and raised in Chicago. Born in 1949. Graduated from Knox College in Illinois in 1971 at age      22 which  was typical for grads back then instead of taking 5, or 6 years to graduate. Law School is 3 years duration if attending fulltime. Podesta who graduated from law school in 1976 took longer , had to work his way thru school. In the 1970s during the hippie days at college at least half the men sported a mustache or beard and long hair. Where are the rumors of him being gay?  Pedophiles are not necessarily gay? Not worth digging further.

             I disagree. John Podesta could very well be gay or bi. There is no way to know for sure. Who was it again that was dreaming of John Podesta's supposed hot dog stand in Hawaii?

             Don't they all like to play dominos on pasta as well as pizza? Sanders says this: "I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place... instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy."
            </p>
            <p>
             So John and Sanders usually send each other pastas and sauces instead of cheese...

             I guess they like both, huh. Imho Podesta is into anything that has for legs and is still not fully developed.

              Still too tangential for me. Yes he is a monster but the connection to the nuns murder is so tenuous  as to be laughable.  Because he was in  Connecticutt in 1970 he might have been in Baltimore??  A mustache seals his identity.  We're letting our hatred for Podesta get in the way of critical thinking.

               Maybe, but then again the surname "Skippy" isn't so common, is it? Why not dig? I think it's worth a try is all I'm saying.

                As I have posted before, "Skippy" was an ubiquitous nickname in the 50s-60s-70s.  It may have to do with loving that particular brand of peanut butter, one's gait, or something else.

              I said in the comments of the other post that Podesta went to Knox and since he studied to be a Jesuit priest he may have spent his summers in Georgetown which is just 42.8 mi. from Baltimore.  I put nothing past Podesta. Nothing. He is vile.
