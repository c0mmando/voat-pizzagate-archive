<h2>The person in-charge of the orphanage that Laura Silsby was given children was awarded by Bill Clinton</h2>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Laura Silsby was given children from an orphanage <a href="https://archive.fo/ox7Fa#selection-423.0-425.82">called Friends of the Orphans</a> during her first attempt of child-trafficking</li>
<li>The exchange <a href="https://archive.is/lMmHp#selection-1093.0-1093.168">took place in Petionville</a>, near the collapsed <a href="https://archive.is/wcYOl#selection-2421.0-2421.202">Fr. Wasson Center of Friends of the Orphans</a></li>
<li>The orphans were housed in a building called St. Helene in Kenscoff, where <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1591337">100 children disappeared after the earthquake</a></li>
<li>Bill Clinton was scheduled to visit Friends of the Orphans <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1588812">2 months before the earthquake</a></li>
<li>Bill Clinton is also the man who <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-25/clinton-silsby-trafficking-scandal-and-how-media-attempted-ignorecover-it">covered up for child-trafficker Laura Silsby</a></li>
<li>Gena Heraty, who runs St Helene, received the <a href="http://archive.is/1Yo4l#selection-1071.0-1071.18">William Jefferson Goodwill for Haiti Award in 2012</a> from Bill Clinton</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>When it was discovered that Jennifer Rayno of Friends of the Orphans had under-reported the number of children in the St. Helene orphanage after the earthquake, something felt strange to me. Wouldn\'t the staff members have noticed if 100 children had disappeared? Then I remembered: <a href="http://archive.is/MgBpT">two of the volunteers had died</a> inside the collapsed Fr. Wasson Center, including Molly Hightower, whose blog has helped us greatly in uncovering the truth of the Laura Silsby case. R.I.P.</p>
<p>According to Molly Hightower and another NPH report, St. Helene originally housed 450 children. Post-earthquake updates only reports that the building was undamaged, and that <strong>ALL 350 children</strong> are safe, indicating an under-reporting of 100 children. This was strange because it matched Laura Silsby\'s plan to steal <a href="https://i.imgbox.com/k87iMAnu.png">100 children</a>.</p>
<p>Molly would not have let this happen. If there was one person who\'d notice the disappearance of 100 children, it\'d have to be the person who runs the orphanage. I found the person\'s on Molly\'s blog: her name is Gena. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5TLuGlL.jpg">Gena Heraty</a>.</p>

<p>I looked her name up and to my surprise, I discovered that she had received an award from Bill Clinton, the William Jefferson\'s Goodwill for Haiti Award, 2 years after the catastrophe. WOW! And it was only the other day that we discovered that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JxfuLzC.png">Bill Clinton had connections with this orphanage</a> before the earthquake, which demonstrated a clear motive to cover up for child-trafficker Laura Silsby.</p>

<hr />
<p>So the link has tightened once again. I don\'t know whether these two personally know each other, but they clearly have a link that\'s deserving of an investigation. It just seems very strange that, of all that\'s been uncovered, that this person would be the one to receive the award.</p>

           So the link has tightened once again. I don't know whether these two personally know each other, but they clearly have a link that's deserving of an investigation. It just seems very strange that, of all that's been uncovered, that this person would be the one to receive the award.

             went nowhere. Also, you provide no evidence for your hypothesis that someone's life is at stake or that this blurry image in your edited link actually has any connection to pizzagate whatsoever. You are jumping to wild conclusions based on zero evidence. Posts like that will continue to be removed by all mods at

               Because you added a corrected link in the comment section, as you well know. And it wasn't any more of a fulfillment of Rule 2 than the original post with the erroneous link. You can't just IMPLY shit. You have to make and argument and show some evidence demonstrating it actually holds water.

                In what manner do you suggest i post a curious photo , one where an employee of CP posts a pik of a an underground tunnel &amp; attaches the words "dead by dawn ", or do you deem this completely irrelevant ? You deleted it from being its own thread and each time i posted it qs a comment. Others saw it &amp; none said it was too unclear, i cant help but think your censoring, as there are plenty of speculative posts here, let the readers interpret it themselves.

            Something that a skeptic may say to counter the importance of this...
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been explaining all of this to my husband. Showing info graphs and all. Something he keeps saying that I'm sure many others will ask is... If there are over 700 orphanages in Haiti, how many others did Bill Clinton visit or have a connection to? We are zeroing in on this one (rightly so), but a skeptic's argument could be that the Clinton's were involved in many other orphanages as well, so it wouldn't be strange that this one has a connection to them as well. Does anybody know of any other orphanages in Haiti that have a connection to the Clinton's or Alefantis?

            Am I missing something? Because if there were only 350 kids after the earthquake, couldn't that mean 100 died? Was the 450 children the count before the earthquake? Didn't children die when Molly died?

            Ok....  I have a big problem.  Please look at the video of the collapse of the Ft. Wasson location and subsequent memorial service for Molly Hightower.

           <p>
            Look at the surrounding neighborhood and the lack of damage to the other buildings.  Now look at the 7 story orphanage in total ruin. Observe the size of rubble and notice the extreme mangling and tangling of the steel rebar enforcement.  Notice what appears to be blast damage to the building next door (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/00">
             @00
            </a>
            :13 ). The windows and window frames are blown inward but there is not a single visible crack in that structure. In fact, I could not detect significant damage to any of the buildings in the neighborhood. The service afterward appears to be completely staged, as well, and the fact that this video was even made so quickly after the 'collapse'...  well, it stinks on ice.  I think we are definitely looking at a demolition or ordnance detonation, not a collapse.  Please share your thoughts

             whole thing looks staged. it would be great to ask someone working/worked in demolition. Maybe they could nut it out from the video. finding the explosives used might create another trail, a tangible one. I'm fairly certain Dyncorp were contracted to Haiti, will need to re-check to confirm.Where Dyncorp go trafficking follows, got busted in 99 for trafficking and other crimes. Went to congress, no charges laid.

             I believe Mayo is her nickname, by the way. So it appears "mayofostercare.ie" could be Gena's website.

            Poor Molly's blog has really been an assest in investigating Laura Silsby. If she is the victim of foul play, and not an earthquake, she deserves justice along with Monica Peterson.

            I think we have all missed looking at the fact that we only have a handful of volunteers but there were supposedly 450 children. Can you imagine how many adults it would take to deal with 450 kids 24/7?? Also, who was paying for the meals, clothes, healthcare ect? 
Second, the orphanage was 11mi from the epicenter and all of the children were unhurt, yet two adult volunteers died? Thats some seriously fucked up odds. One of your articles says the orphanage was unscathed. So how did they die? In other articles Silsby herself is quoted as saying the orphanage collapsed. If we assumed she was telling the truth, the odds that ALL 450 children would be A-OK is impossible. My point is, the conflicting information given makes the most sense when viewed through the lens of a coverup of both the deaths of the volunteers and the stealing of the children.

             This is mere speculation but here in the US the average class size is 26 children to every teacher. In a place that may be volunteer challenged two adults might be the number used to be in charge of say...100 children.  That would bring that number back to the 350 that were supposedly 'all safe' and may be an interesting lead to where the 100 went and perhaps why two adults died in that process. Could they have been collateral damage whilst the children were being taken?

             It was the Fr. Wasson Center in Petionville that collapsed. That orphanage building primarily functioned as an administration office and school. The St Helene's building in Kenscoff is the one that houses the children, and it didn't collapse and it was reported that all the children were safe. Simply, they deducted 100 children from the reports, a day after the earthquake, indicating a premeditated exchange with Laura Silsby which was planned to happen a week or two later.

             2 volunteers died and 2 others were injured in the Fr. Wasson Center in Petionville, which is where the exchange took place according to the police officer who stopped them at their first attempt. I'll add it in to make it clearer. Here's a

               I haven't tracked down all the volunteers yet, but if you read Molly's blog, children were already being sent off to unknown places without an explanation even before the earthquake. The person keeping track of the numbers would be Gena Heraty, who's in charge of St. Helene, so it's not strange that the volunteers wouldn't notice. Here's an example:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Devastation (sic) when I went to the hospital to discover my Jolene girl had been transferred to an unknown orphanage the evening before. I don't know where she is, but I'm trying to find her to force her caregivers to bring her in for physical therapy. She was so close to walking on her own, and they left her orthopedic shoe behind. They ended up doing a complete overworking of the tap tap room, with all my abandoned babies being sent out (including Carmella and Cassandra). Annabelle is the only one still there.
               </p>
              </blockquote>

               But regardless, there probably aren't as many volunteers as you're imagining. Check this out:
