             Thanks for letting me know.  I did mention the "Clintons et al." at the end.  Not enough?  Must I use the word "Pizzagate" in every post, even if the topic is about Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam and her death?  Much appreciated.

              The word Pizzagate isn't required, you just need to make clear how it satisfies the Rule 1 definition of Pizzagate-related material in the sidebar.  Not all things related to the Clintons are Pizzagate related. You can't assume the reader knows the connection. Here's Rule 1:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               1 ALL submissions should be directly related to Pizzagate, and this is how we define Pizzagate. It is the responsibility of the poster to demonstrate relevance. In most cases this will require a Discussion post where you provide a brief explanation of how your content relates to the investigation. Sometimes there will be content (like an article on Pizzagate) where a link post with an accurate, descriptive title will be enough to satisfy this requirement.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Here's the definition of what is Pizzagate Related:
             </p>
             <h1>
              Current Definition of "Pizzagate"
             </h1>
             <p>
              "Pizzagate" refers to the
              <strong>
               independent investigation of pedophilia and child trafficking by the certain members of the global elite.
              </strong>
              The leaked John Podesta Emails hint at deeply entrenched and protected pedophile networks operating with impunity at the top levels of government and politics in and through Washington, DC and the world at large. The investigation initially focused on a group of businesses on Connecticut Avenue in Washington DC and their potential connection to a child trafficking ring. While this investigation began and centers around Comet Ping Pong, it involves multiple businesses and numerous connections around the globe. The name pizzagate is simply an easy to remember convenience, referring to what has been called "Pedocracy" which is the suspected, likely informal, association of elite individuals that use pedophilia to organize, manage and discipline their efforts to dominate or disproportionately influence outcomes in matters of interest. That includes government as well as politics -- executive, legislative, judicial, lobbying, military, intelligence -- as well as media, business, finance, law, medicine, accounting, technology, academia, think tanks, philanthropy, endowments, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Relevant submissions would be any content that can be linked (by the OP in a sourced explanation) to organized human trafficking of children, the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of those children, and/or the systematic cover up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities.

            Many news sources won't report that Sheila Abdus-Salaam is a Muslim because MSM, owned by libs, don't want to sully readers' opinions of Islam.  The absence of mentioning Sheila's political ideology, Islam, in articles was obvious and stupid.  Since she was a Muslim, she knew that the "prophet" Mohammed was a pedophile.  Muslim men are permitted to rape children of both genders and marry little girls, like Mohammed did with his wife, Aisha.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reading this article (below), I wonder if she was murdered for pushing the progressive agenda of the LGBTQ community.  Muslims murder homosexuals.  Sheila helped gay couples with child-rearing rights.  Plus, she's a woman in a powerful position - not a great place to be as a Muslim.  There are over 285 mosques in NYC alone and there might have been a fatwah against her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just presenting this idea, although I know how brutal the Clintons et al. are.
