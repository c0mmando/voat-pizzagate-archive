<blockquote>
<p>After a brief involvement with Marxism in 1939, Parsons converted to Thelema, the English occultist Aleister Crowley\'s new religious movement. In 1941, with his first wife Helen Northrup, Parsons joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). At Crowley\'s bidding, he replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Avenue.</p>
<p>Helen went away for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, encouraged to do so by the sexually permissive attitude of the O.T.O., <strong>began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara.</strong> In 1945 Parsons separated from Helen; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and held various jobs while acting as a consultant for Israel\'s rocket program.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Babalon Working was a series of magic ceremonies or rituals performed from January to March 1946 by author, pioneer rocket-fuel scientist, and occultist Jack Parsons and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. This ritual was essentially designed to manifest an individual incarnation of the archetypal divine feminine called Babalon. The project was based on the ideas of Aleister Crowley, and his description of a similar project in his 1917 novel Moonchild.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning with the first people who inhabited Pasadena’s Arroyo Seco, there have been rumors of a spiritual connection to the place. The Tongva believed water running through the gorge sounded like laughter, which they attributed to the coyote spirit.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the narrowest place in the Arroyo Seco was dammed to control flooding, and it was named Devil\'s Gate Dam, for the demon-like face of a horned figure in the natural rock outcropping. </p>
<p>In the 1940s, a group of occultists became interested in the area and attempted rituals intended to open a portal to Hell.</p>
<p>The group included rocket scientist Jack Parsons (a follower of Aleister Crowley\'s Thelema) and L. Ron Hubbard (future founder of Scientology). <strong>Their goal was to bring forth a &quot;moonchild,&quot; which they hoped would be an Antichrist figure</strong> that would lead a Thelemic revolution. </p>
<p>In the 1950s, after Parsons perished in an accidental explosion, <strong>several children went missing in the area around Devil\'s Gate Dam</strong>. Though none of them were ever found, a serial killer took credit for two of the disappearances 13 years after they went missing. As the man, Mack Ray Edwards, was a construction worker at the time, their bodies were hidden somewhere in the concrete of California\'s freeways.</p>
<p><strong>Two other children seemed to have vanished into thin air, one after turning a corner in front of his parents, and the other while returning to a YMCA campsite. In both instances, the children only left supervision for a matter of seconds</strong> when they somehow disappeared</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of all those &quot;missing 411&quot; stories about people, especially children, vanishing in national parks after being unsupervised for only a few seconds. There are quite a few stories of children vanishing into thin air immediately after &quot;rounding a corner&quot; in a national park.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later, during the so-called &quot;Red Scare&quot;, Parsons, Unable to pursue his scientific career, without his wife and devoid of friendship, decided to return to occultism and <strong>embarked on sexually based magical operations with prostitutes</strong>. He was intent, informally following the ritualistic practice of Thelemite organization the A∴A∴, on performing &quot;the Crossing of the Abyss&quot;, attaining union with the universal consciousness, or &quot;All&quot; as understood in Thelemic mysticism, and becoming the &quot;Master of the Temple&quot;. Following his apparent success in doing so, Parsons recounted having an out-of-body experience invoked by Babalon, who astrally transported him to the biblical City of Chorazin, an experience he referred to as a &quot;Black Pilgrimage&quot;. Accompanying Parsons\' &quot;Oath of the Abyss&quot; was his own &quot;Oath of the AntiChrist&quot;, which was witnessed by Wilfred Talbot Smith. In this oath, <strong>Parsons professed to embody an entity named Belarion Armillus Al Dajjal, the Antichrist &quot;who am come to fulfill the law of the Beast 666</strong> [Aleister Crowley]&quot;.</p>

            Not to belabor Simpson connections, but Parsons comes up in the OJ Simpson murder trial as well. "It began the second day and lasted throughout the Babalon Working. Parsons awoke on the sixth day of the Working, January 10. He heard nine loud, unexplainable knocks. I note a similarity to the nine regular knocks that Whitley Strieber felt confirmed the existence of his Visitors."

           </p>

            Kato in his guest room was startled by three knocks on his back wall, supposedly from OJ returning from the murders, leaping over the fence and slamming into the wall. I'd already noted some Masonic symbolism, like OJ's address: 360 (degrees in a circle) Rock (masonry) ing Ham (Biblical tribe of Ham) and there's a well known, not-very-secret, code of "Three Knocks" in Masonry.  One member of our OJ discussion group was an expert on Masonic symbolism in opera, particularly Mozart, and intended to expand on this, claiming the OJ affair was full of Masonic symbols, but unfortunately died (of natural causes) before responding.

            Parsons is also connected indirectly to Manson. It was alleged but not proven that Charlie attended the OTO Temple in San Francisco, Manson was also accused of making snuff movies either on the beach north of Malibu or in the hills above it. None have ever been found and some say they were more likely regular porn, but some say they are buried in Death Valley where Manson and his family lived later.

              Not much. in the "'Canadian Fashion Tycoon Peter Nygard's Company Files for Bankruptcy' - WSJ" we got into possible OJ connections to Princess Diana via her boyfriend Dodi Al Fayed who partied with OJ and his murdered ex, Nicole, and found that she had an unpleasant encounter with Dodi's bodyguards, because they thought her girlfriends had insulted Dodi, the evening prior to her murder. That sort of thing.

              Way back at the time of the trials, reading about Parsons' Great Working and the nine knocks set me off to look into Kato and his three knocks, which turned up the Masonic symbols.

             Very interesting... I think Donald Trump is actually the 45th descendant of the prophet Mohammad, and his lineage traces first from North Africa, then to the royalty of
             <strong>
              Spain
             </strong>
             before gradually making it's way up to the kings of England, so this makes sense. Here is a picture of his lineage, tracing him back to Mohammad:

             It can't be a coincidence that he is also the 45th President of the USA.

               The Delphi technique is a method of group decision-making and forecasting that involves successively collating the judgments of experts.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The Delphi method or Delphi technique (/ˈdɛlfaɪ/ DEL-fy; also known as Estimate-Talk-Estimate or ETE) is a structured communication technique or method, originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts.
                <strong>
                 The technique can also be adapted for use in face-to-face meetings, and is then called mini-Delphi or Estimate-Talk-Estimate (ETE).

                Delphi has been widely used for business forecasting and has certain advantages over another structured forecasting approach, prediction markets.

But now we must, for you have learned to tamper with a certain power that is not for your Man, mainly that of atomic energy. Our emissaries have already delivered messages to the power of your World, and yet they do not heed.”

               Is THIS the significance of the other 7 wonders of the world? They all have a tunnel that leads to the underground city? Is there really an underground city or is this just a psyop? I have always assumed stuff like this was just a psyop but now I am not sure what to believe.

               Project Blue Beam was the plan to fake an alien invasion using advanced tech that was not known to the general public, including broadcasting holograms in the sky. There was a guy on the David Icke forums when Obama had just been elected who predicted Jared Kushner would marry Trumps daugher and claimed that Kushner was the "head of the illuminati and project blue beam" but later said it was not true that Kushner was the head of the illuminati and said it was some young man who dressed up as an evil clown character from a video game. He also said Rupert Murdoch was running project blue beam.

               He said this was going to become a new religion fused with commercialism, and people would "tune in" to watch the drama unfolding in the nights sky, and they would also purchase products related to this. I believe he said that existing entertainment franchises, like Star Trek and Star Wars, would be portrayed as "prophetic", and our entertainment franchises would be fused with the new religion.

               The triangle is between two major federal nuclear facilities (Idaho National Labs - INL and Pacific Nothwest National Labs - PNNL) along with the Black Rock Desert just outside Reno, home of the satanic/pagan Burning Man ritual site.
              </p>
              <p>
               Both labs have been involved in nuclear disasters which have been covered up to varying degrees, and are involved in various secret projects related to "free-energy" theories.  Some have conjectured alien technologies are being reverse engineered.
              </p>
              <p>
               The triangle covers a huge area, and is largely covered by lava fields.  This makes the land un-farmable , and therefore largely unoccupied.  Except for Boise, there are no other major population concentrations.  Much of this land is also owned by the federal government and restricted.
              </p>
              <p>
               One feature of lava fields are "lava tubes", huge underground natural tunnels that were formed by trapped gasses in the lava as it cooled.  The story is that many of these tunnels have been converted into secret underground military bases and secret federal prisons holding the worst of the worst enemies of America and/or the world ... and that "Burning Man" is more than just a drug-fueled hipster party.
              </p>
              <p>
               Two Burning Man theories are that it is an annual ritual :
              </p>
              <p>
               a) run by the government to keep the supernatual/satanic prisoners at bay, or
              </p>
              <p>
               b) run by satanists to magically assault the underground bases in an attempt to free the prisoners.

                 The triangle is between two major federal nuclear facilities (Idaho National Labs - INL and Pacific Nothwest National Labs - PNNL) along with the Black Rock Desert just outside Reno, home of the satanic/pagan Burning Man ritual site.

                Wait, I think I remember reading about this now, or something that is very similar. Wasn't Epstein somehow connected to the old New Mexico lab where they did nuclear experiments for the manhattan project or something? I have a vague memory of this but can't recall the details.

                 One feature of lava fields are "lava tubes", huge underground natural tunnels that were formed by trapped gasses in the lava as it cooled. The story is that many of these tunnels have been converted into secret underground military bases and secret federal prisons holding the worst of the worst enemies of America and/or the world ... and that "Burning Man" is more than just a drug-fueled hipster party.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Two Burning Man theories are that it is an annual ritual :
                </p>
                <p>
                 a) run by the government to keep the supernatual/satanic prisoners at bay, or
                </p>
                <p>
                 b) run by satanists to magically assault the underground bases in an attempt to free the prisoners.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Now that is an interesting theory. Burning man has always seemed suspicious to me. The effigy burning they do at Burning Man reminds me of the effigies mounds like Man Mound as well.

                 All I know about an Epstein connection is that he had a ranch in New Mexico, but I'm not sure what all was alleged to have gone on there.

                <p>
                 But all those labs are run by the Department of Energy, and are involved in much more than just nuclear research now (though they were all essential to the WW-2 nuclear bomb efforts).

                <p>
                 Yeah, there is too much "ritual" involved in Burning Man for it to be just a hippie-fest (which are notoriously  "anti-ritual" / "anti-authority")

             Please tell me if this is The Truth or if I am going in the wrong direction:
            </p>
            <p>
             At the Foxconn plant in Racine they are building a quantum "water computer" using water from the Great Lakes that can manipulate matter (possibly remotely) with algorithmic equations, similar to how data can be manipulated by a normal computer.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2015/06/08/computer-water-drops-060815/">
              https://news.stanford.edu/2015/06/08/computer-water-drops-060815/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             With a powerful enough water computer, they will be able to "perform wonders" (possibly remotely) such as turn water into wine or lead into gold, or possibly even reanimate the dead. This will allow the anti-christ (that is currently being groomed? could he be Trevor Jung?) to convince the entire world to worship an image of Aleister Crowley and create a worldwide Thelemic religion. The "image" that is worshiped could be anything from a hologram, a clone, or even the reanimated corpse of Crowley himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             That idea, were it brought into reality, sounds profane enough to me to actually cause Jesus to return (which is the answer to your question "What is happening NOW?")
            </p>
            <p>
             I will try to answer the rest of your questions soon, but I can't get the above idea out of my head and I want to make sure I'm not wasting what little time we have left by going in the wrong direction.

The brain activity of an individual is monitored and transmitted to a remote location (e.g., by satellite). At the remote location, the monitored brain activity is compared with pre-recorded, normalized brain activity curves, waveforms or patterns to determine if a match or substantial match is found. If such a match is found, then the computer at the remote location determines that the individual was attempting to communicate the word, phrase or thought corresponding to the match stored normalized signal.

               With a powerful enough quantum computer, a device like that could potentially process and analyze every single persons thoughts in real time. Will the 5G network be used to constantly scan every single persons brain waves in a given area in real time, and send all of that data to the quantum water computer on the Great Lakes in an uninterrupted stream?

               This guy claims that the Q in Qanon stands for "Quantum" or "Qbit". He then explains how a Qbit can be both a zero and one at the same time - using a graph that indicates time and space, he folds the space and time axes together on the paper to make both points match at the same place. He then claims a quantum computer is a "Time warping" computer.
              </p>
              <p>
               He then claims a quantum computer only works in conditions similar to outer space (freezing and airless), so they must be placed in a cryogenic vacuum freezer. Is this why they need so much water from the Great Lakes (7 million gallons a day if I recall).
              </p>
              <p>
               He says google currently has a 72 Qbit quantum computer. Qbits double exponentially so a 72 Qbit computer can be in 16 sextillion states at once. Finally he says if you put a bunch of quantum computers together you get a "quantum internet" which allows you to "send messages from the future".

                During World War II units of the German Army occupied Krasnodar between August 12, 1942, and February 12, 1943. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. German forces, including Gestapo and "mobile SS execution squads", killed thousands of Jews, Communists, and "supposed Communist 'partisans.'" Shooting, hanging, burning, and even gas vans were used.[22]

                In the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and for participation in war crimes. The first such trial took place at Krasnodar from July 14 to 17, 1943. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily carried out in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.

             Great post, thank you. I just noticed your name is EyeofHorus. I believe Crowley was trying to usher in the age of Horus. Is that just a coincidence?

              Not a coincidence, I am very aware of Lucifierians, OTO, Thelema and other occultists misappropriating Egyptian theology and have decided to steal it back. I can see them, their patterns, their agenda better than I ever thought possible. Is the Eye of  Horus a placebo? Perhaps, perhaps not but does not matter.  It's mine now, I own it, and those freaks can shit themselves while I expose them.
