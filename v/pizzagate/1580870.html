Pub Dates: SEP 29, OCT 6, 13, 2011. “</p>
<p>The OTHER FACT from this document that jumped out at me was:
Joseph T. Scheve owned TWO (2) properties: “3518 REAR 11TH ST” (Pegasus Museum building) AND 1644 NORTH CAPITAL ST., NW
So being the curious person that I am, I decided to investigate the SECOND PROPERTY</p>
<p>INVESTIGATION: 1644 NORTH CAPITAL STREET, NW (THE OTHER FORMER SCHEVE/HUBBARD OWNED BUILDING)</p>
<p>Here is what I found to start with:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.popville.com/2013/04/five-years-ago-there-was-the-borf-building-in-bloomingdale/">http://www.popville.com/2013/04/five-years-ago-there-was-the-borf-building-in-bloomingdale/</a>
<a href="http://bloomingdaleneighborhood.blogspot.com/2011/05/borf-building-pop-up.html">http://bloomingdaleneighborhood.blogspot.com/2011/05/borf-building-pop-up.html</a> 
My Google search: <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1EODB_enUS532US532&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=BORF+in+bloomingdale+Washington+DC">https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1EODB_enUS532US532&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=BORF+in+bloomingdale+Washington+DC</a></p>
<p>From the links above:
1.     This place looks similar to the original Pegasus Building in purpose. A funky art space in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood.
2.     Look at the picture in this link (<a href="http://bloomingdaleneighborhood.blogspot.com/2011/05/borf-building-pop-up.html">http://bloomingdaleneighborhood.blogspot.com/2011/05/borf-building-pop-up.html)</a>). Building a third story much like was done at Pegasus. This construction started in 2011 (REMEMBER THAT TIMEFRAME--I\'LL COME BACK TO THAT LATER)</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://5c02.blogspot.com/2007/05/borf-is-bore.html">http://5c02.blogspot.com/2007/05/borf-is-bore.html</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This building was know as the BORF building. It was leased by a funky artist collective who had shows and exhibits there (pretty similar to Pegasus pre-&quot;Pegasus Museum. Pegasus used to be known as Paper Sun which was an underground space used by local bands). </p>
<p>Borf paid zero rent to the landlord (JOSEPH SCHEVE) in exchange for doing building improvements.</p>
<p>AS OF 2008, BORF NO LONGER RESDIED AT 1644 NORTH CAPITAL</p>
<p><a href="http://dcist.com/2008/06/the_house_that_borf_built_is_closin.php">http://dcist.com/2008/06/the_house_that_borf_built_is_closin.php</a></p>
<p>Essentially, they had a rough relationship with the landlord (JOSEPH SCHEVE). Here is a quote from that link:</p>
<p>&quot;In the year that the former bakery and consignment shop has been under the stewardship of Tsombikos (whose father is a contractor), it has seen fairly extensive renovations. Tsombikos built supports in the basement and put down flooring, laid drywall over exposed concrete walls, and installed ramps and other structures throughout the space.
&quot;It\'s been a difficult relationship with the landlord,&quot; says Botelho. &quot;The agreement we had come to was we were going to renovate the space and our rent would be free while we were renovating the space. It was a beneficial relationship for both of us — it was previously abandoned, so it wasn\'t hurting him that we were hiring out plumbers and electricians.&quot;
&quot;The owner is not kicking us out,&quot; Borf Brigader Chuck Burgundy wrote in an email. Rather, Scheve insisted on terms that the group considered odious, including signing a 5-year lease with a clause that would waive the group\'s right to a 30-day notice before eviction.
&quot;We had a nonprofit lawyer draw up a lease, but [Scheve] rejected it because it was too long. His lawyer had a one-paragraph five-year lease that he wanted us to sign,&quot; says Botelho. &quot;We saw that as unrealistic and wouldn\'t protect either side.&quot;
IMPORTANT NOTE FROM THAT QUOTE: 1644 NORTH CAPITAL NW WAS PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED.
ONE NEED S TO ASK THEMSELVES SOME QUESTIONS? What went on in there when it was abandoned? What kind of neighborood was it? (kind of sketchy with somewhat of a criminal element in my opinion)</p>
<p>WHEN WAS 1644 NORTH CAPITAL NW SOLD BY SCHEVE?</p>
<p>From my research, I found the following links:</p>
<p><a href="https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publication/attachments/newspaper-list_2012.pdf">https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publication/attachments/newspaper-list_2012.pdf</a>  (SEE PAGE 21)</p>
<p>This was a MONDAY, JULY 16, 2012 document with a list of District properties with unpaid taxes to be sold at Public Auction.</p>
<p>3101 0080 &amp;IMP TX JOSEPH T SCHEVE G E SCHEVE 1644 NORTH CAPITOL NW $2,568.01</p>
<p>Scheve (his estate) owed $2,568.01.</p>
<p>Next, I found a link to when it was sold.</p>
<p><a href="http://commercial-real-estate.findthedata.com/l/4930150/1644-N-Capitol-St-NW-Washington-DC-20002">http://commercial-real-estate.findthedata.com/l/4930150/1644-N-Capitol-St-NW-Washington-DC-20002</a></p>
<p>From this link, it was sold: 9/28/2012</p>
<p>Total or partial ownership of this property was transferred via a grant deed on September 28, 2012. Ownership was transferred for $399,999, however due to the nature of the transaction this amount is likely not an accurate indicator of the property\'s true market value at the time.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF: </p>
<p>WHO BOUGHT THE PROPERTY? 
WHY WAS A RENOVATION BEGUN IN 2011 ONE FULL YEAR BEFORE THE SALE? WHO WAS RENOVATING IT? 
DOES THE NEW OWNER HAVE ANY CONNECTIONS TO THE PREVIOUS OWNER?
WHO/WHAT CURRENTLY RESIDES AT 1644 NORTH CAPITAL, NW?</p>
<p>(TO BE CONTINUED---PLEASE NOTE THAT I RAN OUT OF SPACE BUT I AM ALSO A LITTLE FREAKED OUT ABOUT POSSIBLY INDICTING A POTENTIALLY INNOCENT PARTY; HOWEVER, THIS OWNER DOES HAVE SOME CURIOUS CONNECTIONS THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME IN CONTEXT OF THIS INVESTIGATION)</p>',

            "WHY WAS A RENOVATION BEGUN IN 2011 ONE FULL YEAR BEFORE THE SALE?"......The most obvious explanation is it was renovated before being sold to increase the asking price. Maybe that's all it is. Why does that time frame make you suspicious?

            The combination of the name of the LLC (1644 North Capitol LLC) and the time it was formed (September, 2011) jumped out at me. An LLC with its name as the address of the property was formed ONE FULL YEAR before it was purchased. According to the JUNE, 2012 document showing the property (still owned by Scheve...whom Alefantis is an agent of his estate) is up for public auction due to unpaid taxes. This is very curious to me. One can (perhaps) logically deduce that the is some connection between Thomas and Alefantis/Scheve. Also, a picture from 2011 (from a link in the above post) shows the renovation in its beginning stages.

             Good work! I didn't have Semera Thomas (just Syga). This link is great:
             <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_dc/EXTUID_4109530">

            </p>
            <p>
             From looking at it, I had a mini epiphany (logic related) that I'll post in a comment. It further (circumstantially) points to a connection between Thomas and Alefantis/Scheve
