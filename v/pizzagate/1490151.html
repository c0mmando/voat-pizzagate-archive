            Wrong - there is plenty here - very relevant - to warrant a formal investigation. Most investigations don't start with "legal proof". There is also a lot of crap, here. No question. And yes, there are trolls here. So - ignore it and them and focus on the other areas being dug into that are more relevant - that is how productive people are moving this past the superficial entertainment. Trying to debunk the entire think is just lazy whining.

            I was just following along with this conversation - until I hit your statement" this as of yet baseless whitch hunt into a pizzaria"   --- if you've done so much "research" then you should know there is more truth than fiction, here. Granted, much of the PG "community" has turned this into a social media game and have very little knowledge of the context for these crimes - but that doesn't negate the underlying screaming red flags that these people and these associations and their communication ---all need to be formally investigated. Yes, there is smoke here. It may not be the same kind of smoke elsewhere, but that doesn't automatically mean there's nothing to look at. The more PG turns heads, the more the associated crimes get attention.

            I'm not saying I agree with the OP but I err on the side of extreme scrutiny with any new legislation. In some ways, there have been very damaging trends (and I'm not on the bandwagon with some ultraconservativeparanoids who are desperate to find "normalizing" in everything they don't like). The late Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer warned of this - particularly legislation that promotes increased funding to child services, which is being used to provide financial incentives to foster parents - some as much as $1M per child. It's obvious what the impact of this has been.

            But some pedos so claim their attachments to children are healthy and that is the problem. They see nothing wrong with it and want you not to also.  There was even a professor at recently University saying it is natural thing, and I saw a post elsewhere this morning by a person claiming that pedophiles are not really bad people.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you have studied this for 15 years (please produce your findings/conclusions here) yet see nothing odd in this wording or how it could be interpreted?  I find that strange.

            Then I can only assume you have been living under a 100ft tall rock lately if you have not noticed how there seems to be a push in the gradual normalization and acceptance of pedophilia and the sexualisation of children, rather than condemnation of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I never said any authority has so far suggested it was ok before, but only that this may be one the first signs towards accepting and legalizing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been however, many authorities in many countries that have covered up child sexual abuse in the past and the present, which is just as bad as condoning it.

            Are you questioning item two? I read healthy attachment to a caregiver as a positive. My mother was incredibly abusive, we did not have a healthy attachment which would be more easily seen as the abuse it was if this was some of the criteria instead of how it used to be, when I was growing up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can see your worry, though, because "healthy" as determined by a society seems to be changing a great deal. There is a troubling element of people who we can see as trying to normalize child/adult relationships. I do think they are a small minority to the rest of us. The scary thing is that elements power and wealth. This investigation has absolutely solidified for me that we as a society need to limit the power of this wealthy immoral group trying to influence laws that were written to protect people to their sick advantage.

             Yes (2) is the one I was referring to.  I know it's general meaning is a good one but it is how it could be interpreted by a certain element, who thankfully are in the minority but that could change given the current lax attitude to csa.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do think we as a society need to take csa and the law regarding it more seriously than at present because I am sick to the core of hearing child abusers getting off with it, as is reported in so many cases nowadays.

             Not fully off-topic which is why I put it here because it may be missed otherwise.  It goes towards more evidence of a seemingly concerted effort to legitimize child sexual abuse.

             If it's legal they don't have to cover it up anymore and suspected csa scenarios like pizzagate will then be ignored.
