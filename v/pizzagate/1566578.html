Here is one such discussion as an example   <a href="https://www.level9news.com/history-behind-pizzagate-satanic-blood-rituals-now-going-mainstream/">https://www.level9news.com/history-behind-pizzagate-satanic-blood-rituals-now-going-mainstream/</a></p>
<p>Therefore I find this report in the Podesta emails worthy of note (<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5523">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5523)</a>) The email itself is a round-up email gathering news from different sources for Podesta to look through - possibly for him to report directly to H. Clinton on if there is anything of interest.  Well on September 15, there was a very strange poem included written by a former top State Department employee under Clinton, who was angry at being &quot;scapegoated&quot; (his words) during the Benghazi cover up, placed on leave and named publicly.  The poem talks about a Queen, Henchmen, Robes, Hoods and Blood Sacrifice, and seems to be a kind of peep behind the veil of secrecy regarding how things operate under Hillery Clinton\'s command.   Or it could just be highly coincidental that this loaded symbolism is how he decided to lash out? You decide.  
</p>
<p>&quot;While on administrative leave, he published poems online: allegories hinting at his post-Benghazi observations and experiences. A poem entitled “Invitation,” refers to Maxwell’s placement on administrative leave in December 2012: </p>
<p><strong>Invitation</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The Queen’s Henchmen / request the pleasure of your company / at a Lynching – / to be held / at 23rd and C Streets NW [State Dept. building] / on Tuesday, December 18, 2012 / just past sunset. / Dress: Formal, Masks and Hoods- / the four being lynched / must never know the identities/ of their executioners, or what/ whose sin required their sacrifice./ A blood sacrifice- / to divert the hounds- / to appease the gods- / to cleanse our filth and /satisfy our guilty consciences…”</strong></p>
<p>In another poem called “Trapped in a purgatory of their own deceit,” Maxwell wrote: “The web of lies they weave / gets tighter and tighter / in its deceit / until it bottoms out – / at a very low frequency – / and implodes…Yet all the while, / the more they talk, / the more they lie, / and the deeper down the hole they go… Just wait…/ just wait and feed them the rope.” </p>
<p>Several weeks after he was placed on leave with no formal accusations, Maxwell made an appointment to address his status with a State Department ombudsman. “She told me, ‘You are taking this all too personally, Raymond. It is not about you,’” Maxwell says. “I told her that ‘My name is on TV and I’m on administrative leave, it seems like it’s about me.’ Then she said, ‘You’re not harmed, you’re still getting paid. Don’t watch TV. Take your wife on a cruise. It’s not about you; it’s about Hillary and 2016.” </p>
<p>In the wikileaks email, archived here <a href="https://archive.is/k6r4O">https://archive.is/k6r4O</a> aside from these poems, Maxwell tells all - he details the document destruction and cover up that took place in the basement of the State Department building, that he wasn\'t invited to, but crashed anyway.  (you have to scroll down about halfway or just search for &quot;blood sacrifice&quot;.)  
</p>
<p>Maxwell was clearly not only whistleblowing, but possibly signalling to the elite and to Clinton personally that he had certain insider\'s knowledge he could go public with.  Possible leverage?  Or just the random fancies of a poetic mind with no connection whatsoever to Hillary Clinton\'s alleged connection to occult practices...</p>',

             What you've already written is clear as a bell to me. No need to change anything unless you feel like it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know the answer to the question you've posed as it relates to your main premise. Was it a veiled threat and/or a direct reflection of what he was operating within?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a very interesting thought and something i had completely missed.  Thanks for lifting it up.
