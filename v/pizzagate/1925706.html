            I will work to make sure pedophilia remains a crime with the harshest penalty.  A mental disorder ends where a child's innocence begins.  If it is an uncontrollable mental disorder, perhaps the pedophiles should practice self confinement.

           <p>
            First off, Is voat going after pedophiles ? Or the people allocating unlimited resources to ensuring pedophilia thrives and continues to grow at an exponential rate. As much as I don't think any pedophile should be "left alone" I really hope this Forum isn't being used to expose the people whose worse crime sexual intercourse with a child.... Do I personally think every pedophile should be castrated and or put on an island... yes.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the Problem with pedophilia, Is no the fact that kids are being abused by adults... The biggest problem is how fucking easy it is to abuse a child.  The people being targeted by pedogate researchers, Should be the people allocating unlimited resources to ensure pedophilia is able to thrive. The people being targeted by pedogate researchers,should be the people who use pedophilia as tool to control and manipulate people in to doing what ever they are told.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedogate is not the place for worrying about solutions to pedophilia itself, because pedohpilia itself is not even the problem were up against. The pedophiles being controlled and committing additional henious acts, either directly or indirectly, have already dug their graves. They fucked kids. There is no out for them, regardless of we categorize pedophilia. This isn't about that.

             well if we categorize pedophilia as a mental disorder, Maybe the pedophiles will feel comfortable coming forward, and the people who control them, will lose said control.

           <p>
            No. That's not how this works.

            Now to what I originally wrote before everything above...

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Pedophilia is a mental disorder.. It's a fact. It's not a conscious choice - it's a developmental disorder.

            so I'll stick to pedophilia.  Disclaimer 2.0:   I might contradict myself by the end of this comment, But I'll start off by saying, Is being an abusive parent, without the sexual abuse aspects, a mental disorder?
           </h2>
           <p>
            Actually, Lets go back to this;
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It's A fact. Its not a conscious choice-It's a developmental disorder.

            <strong>
             Brosif, What does that even mean?
            </strong>
            I understand it stems from childhood, most likely from abused they themselves suffered... But that doesn't mean it's not a conscious choice.  In face, I'd argue its as much of a conscious choice as one could make.  If you are aware of something being wrong/illegal, and continue to do it, you've made a conscious choice. Regardless of what lead you to make that choice.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean,
            <strong>
             EVERYTHING STEMS FROM CHILDHOOD. BASICALLY EVERYTHING.
            </strong>
            Everything other than black and white mental disorders, such as Schizophrenia.. Even shizophrenia can be onset, but it's on disorder that could surface when you're older, even if you had the perfect childhood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Breathing is not a conscious decision.  Fucking kids is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets look at one of the newest accepted Mental disorders... If you're a recovering heroin addict, and you've been clean for 2 years... and you use again- you're making a conscious choice.
            <sub>
             Maybe that's what I should have been debating... The phrase " It's not a conscious choice" versus " what is and isn't a mental disorder"  But based on your phrasing, I have to assume you're saying that BECAUSE it's not a conscious choice, it's there for a mental disorder.
            </sub>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            If you're a heroin addict in the heat of addiction, you're still making a conscious choice everytime you use... but it's A THOUSAND TIMES Closer to being considered " A not conscious choice" as the withdrawals make it nearly impossible to function both mentally and physically, and you will experience extreme pain both mentally and physically if you aren't able to use.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no comparable withdrawal process when dealing with pedophilia, you are much more in control of your decisions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that's not to say that pedophiles don't suffer mental disorders, they obviously do.... But the pedohpilia itself is not the mental disorder, it's just one consequence of that mental disorder.   But depending on which specific pedophile
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only does it not make sense to call it a mental disorder as it's not really comparable to definitive mental disorders...  It lessens the severity of the crimes being committed by the pedophile, It makes it much easier for a pedophile to accept being a pedophile, especially when there is no feasible solution for this "Mental disorder", short of castration...

            We do not let murderous americans free to harm others. Pedophiles ..sickness or not..have no right to be free to essentially murder the innocence of a still developing life.  As long as there are instances where people with power over children continue to abuse it, I will be pitted against it and doing my part in working for justice.
and if shtf there will need to be time for Purge, to keep our future safe by keeping the kids safe.

            This is really not about pedophiles. Do not try to elicit sympathy for them. And to suggest the satanic aspect is "hate-based" and not based on the evidence is fucking ridiculous. No one would've pulled that from their ass, or suspected it. It came from evidence of interest in cannibalism, torture, satanic rituals like spirit cooking, etc.
            <br/>
            And to say " Pedophilia and hate both have the same roots," really? So hate is a mental disorder?

             Pedophilia can be found everywhere - but we choose to investigate these high-profile people, because we have the power to bring them down.

           <p>
            Stop and think for a moment. Do you really think all the people we're investigating are
            <em>
             really

            pedophiles?  Some of them must be, but the majority are using it for blackmail, power, and exclusivity. And money, as it appears they profit from trafficking. Also organ harvesting, embezzlement, and other crimes tied into what we've found. To suggest "pizzagate" begins and ends with "we've found some pedos, let's hunt them down!" shows you haven't been paying attention.
