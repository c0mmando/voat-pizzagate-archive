            I hope that the first thing that happens after the pedogate opens up is that Ben Swanns boss has a big ol I'm sorry and maybe finally some validation for what i believe was the best and actually the only main stream honest reporting on pedo/pizzagate. He deserves that much.

            I also want to add this. When you go to the CBS46 News Team page, Ben Swann is listed with Facebook and Twitter profiles.
            <a href="http://www.cbs46.com/category/209325/cbs46-meet-the-staff">

           </p>
           <p>
            When you click the twitter profile it says the account is suspended. Not that it doesn't exist, but that it's suspended. His Facebook page doesn't exist. It makes you contact the News 46 page. Everyone, I think we should reach out to Ben and really get ask him what is going on. You don't just "Unred pill yourself". Here is his email. His email can be click on that page, so it's already public:
