            Sounds familiar, doesn't it
           </p>
           <p>
            "Consider the case of Craig Spence, a behind-the-scenes Republican powerbroker in Washington. In June of 1989, the Washington Times published a story that sent shock waves across Capitol Hill. It seems that Spence had been operating a call-boy ring that supplied young boys, some of them very young boys, to the Washington elite of both political parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was rumored that a list of influential clients ran to some 200 names, and some of them were publicly identified. On the list were such names as former CIA director William Casey, former prosecutor and current cable ‘news’ talking-head Joseph diGenova, nominally liberal Congressman Barney Frank, political activist/propagandist Phyllis Schlafly, and former Attorney General John Mitchell – who once co-hosted a party with Spence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also connected to the case were prominent figures in the media; on the guest lists for Spence's ‘parties’ were names such as Ted Koppel and Eric Severeid – who had both been close friends of Spence’s for more than two decades. Koppel had first met Spence when he was serving as the ABC bureau chief in Hong Kong and Spence was purportedly working as a correspondent in Vietnam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spence's mansion was found to be overflowing with surveillance equipment, including hidden cameras and microphones and an abundance of two-way mirrors. It was alleged that the ring was part of a CIA sexual blackmail operation, gathering compromising evidence on Washington politicos and foreign dignitaries. In August, following his arrest on weapon and drug charges, Spence gave an interview to the Times in which he openly claimed to work for the CIA and with high-ranking members of the Reagan and Bush administrations.
           </p>
           <p>
            His claims were scoffed at and he was largely portrayed as a self-important blowhard. There are indications though that Spence was involved in covert operations as far back as Vietnam, working under journalistic cover. An associate of his from that time told the Washington Post: “Spence pulled disappearing acts in Vietnam -- sometimes for weeks at a time … Then he’d turn up, refusing to say where he’d been.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In Washington, Spence was known to take his show on the road, giving some of his boys regular late-night tours of the White House. These tours were reportedly arranged by Donald Gregg, the national security adviser to then-Vice President George Bush. Though Gregg adamantly denied the accusation, there were undeniable connections between the two men, including the fact that Spence had once sponsored a dinner for Gregg.
           </p>
           <p>
            The story quickly dropped off the media radar screen, and Washington and the press proceeded to pretend as though it had never been aired at all. According to a Washington Times reporter, the paper trail was quickly covered-up – some 20,000 documents pertaining to the case were sealed by court order. By the time Spence turned up dead in a Boston hotel room less than five months after the story first broke, he was all but forgotten."

             One weird synchronicity was that the famous movie star Errol Flynn was an intelligence asset, who used his large home as a place for entrapping visitors for sexual blackmail, one of the earliest examples of this activity.

            I read Dave McGowan's book Programmed To Kill : The Politics of Serial Murder a few years ago.  A great read.  While it largely deals with serial killers, the first few chapters document elite paedophile rings like the Franklin scandal in the US and Dutroux scandal in in Belgium, as well as the irreparable harm which the Crowleyite paedophile Alfred Kinsey has done to western civilisation.

             Wow.  That book sounds as if it was enough to get him killed.  Imagine that they would be glad to have him out of the way.  I think I have read comments about his possibly being offed.

              I did not know he was dead.  A real shame.  He passed away in 2015, supposedly of cancer.

               He was sick for a long time, yet he kept plugging away with work and research and writing. Brilliant man, we can't let his work ever be forgotten. He "woke" up a lot of people over the years.

                Sad to say, Dave was a lifelong smoker, and he lost the lung cancer lottery like many smokers do. He was diagnosed with the small cell lung cancer that so many smokers get, and it had spread to his liver by the time it was diagnosed. That is not survivable and he died in less than a year.

                 We both quit decades ago.  Yes, we have had smokers in our families that could have added years on to their lives.  Still people do not heed the No Smoking advice.  Sad.

             I was wondering the other day while watching TV why it is that serial killers happen so often in major hit TV shows. It's one of the biggest TV memes of all time: CSI, Bones, NCIS, The Mentalist, Blue Bloods, XFiles... Sounds like I need to read this book.
