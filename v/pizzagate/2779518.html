 Attempted Child Abductions for Human Trafficking (pizzagate)</p>
<p>submitted 19 days ago by lamplight</p>
<p>I\'m posting this because I have been seeing a lot of attempted child abductions in the past few weeks in my area. I am guessing that this is going on in many regions of our country not just my state. Checked out the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children <a href="http://www.ncmecnycr.org/#services">http://www.ncmecnycr.org/#services</a> and found it has very little information about actual abductions. The website has a big spread of gala fundraisers with adults accepting large checks from donors. The only children listed as missing were 2 in Phoenix, AZ. I went to look for Amber Alerts and the link does not work for many states. It appears that there is no reliable source to check for missing children any longer. Can someone tell me who to contact to see pictures of missing children?</p>
<p>This is Pedogate/Pizzagate related because many of these children become abused and tortured victims of pedophiles.</p>',

            This is all a big scam to steal your children. Although there are good people within the bottom end of the industry (like Diana Napolis was), they get screwed and vilified by the higher-ups if they start revealing questionable activity in the CPS.

            A great many are compromised so I am hoping it is a loaded question. Most in here seem to have come to the conclusion that the evidence shows that child welfare organizations are a tool used to traffic children. No oversight, obvious pedo/mind control symbols, often investigated for trafficking. I posted a thread here that was DELETED that showed that the Silsby children were given back to another child welfare organization that Susan Sarandon was connected to. On that same thread, I showed other shady organizations she was connected to, and how many were investigated for trafficking or had the symbols in their logo. Yet it was DELETED.

              refused to edit within 24 hours. Now he plays the victim, as usual. It would have been very easy to edit the post in question.

             <p>
              I think he refused in order to actually
              <em>
               provoke
              </em>
              a deletion, so that he can play the victim card now, and spread his usual vitriol about mods.

            "The only Children listed as missing were 2 in Phoenix, Az."  Wow.  Well that ought to reassure parents, right?  NOT.  We know there are loads more than that.  But why are they not posting them?  That is the question.  Possibly to make people think that they can relax and not worry?  Possibly they can't check for their own or in their district?  Well, yes, with this kind of info they are all runaways, right?  Like the DCPD Newsham says, yes they are all runaways.  We know better than that.

              Do you mean the parents or guardian are not reporting, or that the authorities are not posting them.  I understand that some are too caught up in their phones, binge watching etc. but I don't understand how people don't care about the Children.  The throw away society is throwing away Our Children?  Is that what you mean?  I do get a sense that people that have a lot or are a little better off than some, well they don't seem to care about the poor.  Very sad.
