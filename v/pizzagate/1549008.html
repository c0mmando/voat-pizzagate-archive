            This is all troops in Africa.  I knew a guy from the FFL stationed in Africa and said most of the men in his company were all about raping the local teenagers.  Said it was an awful soulshattering experience and they did way more bad then good there.  ''Twas in the 90's.

            "The peacekeeping missions in the Central African Republic have been tainted by allegations that troops from several countries sexually abused children and adults. But on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch released a report providing new evidence that soldiers from the Republic of Congo had killed civilians.
           </p>
           <p>
            "In the report, Human Rights Watch said it had uncovered new evidence that Congolese soldiers killed more than a dozen people, including women and children, while serving as peacekeepers from December 2013 to June 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The report is the latest in a series of allegations against peacekeepers, who have been accused of rampant sexual abuse, including against more than 100 girls in a single prefecture in the Central African Republic. The United Nations has said it is investigating the sex allegations, which it called 'sickening.'...
           </p>
           <p>
            "The United Nations human rights official who leaked the allegations against the French soldiers — and was suspended for having violated protocol but reinstated — was reported on Tuesday to have submitted his resignation....
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mr. Kompass’s resignation was first reported by IRIN, a nonprofit humanitarian news service that once was part of the United Nations. It quoted Mr. Kompass as saying he was leaving because of a lack of accountability and the 'unwillingness of the hierarchy to express any regrets for the way they acted towards me.'"

           <p>
            "The United Nations is investigating a litany of 'sickening' new allegations that peacekeepers from at least three countries sexually abused civilians in the Central African Republic, including more than 100 girls in one prefecture, the organization said on Thursday....
           </p>
           <p>
            "The allegations date from 2013; implicate troops from France, Gabon and Burundi; and include at least 108 girls from Kemo Prefecture. Mr. Dujarric said 'the vast majority of cases involve minors.'
           </p>
           <p>
            "If they are confirmed, they would significantly expand the scope of sexual abuse committed by international peacekeepers in the Central African Republic, a former French colony that is one of the world’s poorest and most dysfunctional countries, roiled by civil strife for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            "'We must face the fact that a number of troops sent to protect people instead acted with hearts of darkness,' Mr. Dujarric said....
           </p>
           <p>
            "The allegations, the group said, included an episode in 2014 in which four girls were tied up and undressed inside a camp run by France’s Sangaris force, which is independent of the United Nations peacekeeping mission. The girls were 'forced to have sex with a dog,' AIDS-Free World said, adding that each girl was given 5,000 Central African francs (the equivalent of $9), and that one of the girls later died of an unspecified disease.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mr. Dujarric would not confirm such details."

            "A panel of French judges has decided not to bring charges against soldiers accused of having sexually abused children while on a peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic, officials said on Friday....
           </p>
           <p>
            "The lapse at the United Nations in promptly notifying the French led to an investigation by an independent panel that accused some of the organization’s officials of having passed the allegations 'from desk to desk, inbox to inbox' and having failed to meet their core mission to protect the rights of the most vulnerable civilians.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The confidential report chronicled testimony by six children — ages 9 to 13 — who described abuse by the soldiers in a camp at Bangui M’Poko International Airport in the capital from December 2013 to June 2014. Four of the children said they had been abused by the soldiers, while two said they had witnessed the abuse....

            "A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor’s office, Agnès Thibault-Lecuivre, said on Friday that the judges completed their review of the abuse allegations on Dec. 20. The decision to close the case, or bring it to trial, will be definitively made in less than four months, after the judges have received any additional information from groups representing the accusers and the prosecutor’s office."

            "A senior United Nations aid worker has been suspended for disclosing to prosecutors an internal report on the sexual abuse of children by French peacekeeping troops in the Central African Republic.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sources close to the case said Anders Kompass passed the document to the French authorities because of the UN’s failure to take action to stop the abuse. The report documented the sexual exploitation of children as young as nine by French troops stationed in the country as part of international peacekeeping efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Kompass, who is based in Geneva, was suspended from his post as director of field operations last week and accused of leaking a confidential UN report and breaching protocols. He is under investigation by the UN office for internal oversight service (OIOS) amid warnings from a senior official that access to his case must be 'severely restricted'. He faces dismissal.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The treatment of the aid worker, who has been involved in humanitarian work for more than 30 years, has taken place with the knowledge of senior UN officials, including Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, and Susanna Malcorra, chef de cabinet in the UN, according to documents relating to the case....
           </p>
           <p>
            "Entitled Sexual Abuse on Children by International Armed Forces and stamped 'confidential' on every page, the report details the rape and sodomy of starving and homeless young boys by French peacekeeping troops who were supposed to be protecting them at a centre for internally displaced people in Bangui, capital of the CAR.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Donovan, the co-director of AIDS-Free World, said: 'The regular sex abuse by peacekeeping personnel uncovered here and the United Nations’ appalling disregard for victims are stomach-turning, but the awful truth is that this isn’t uncommon. The UN’s instinctive response to sexual violence in its ranks – ignore, deny, cover up, dissemble – must be subjected to a truly independent commission of inquiry with total access, top to bottom, and full subpoena power.'
           </p>
           <p>
            "The UN has faced several scandals in the past relating to its failure to act over paedophile rings operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kosovo and Bosnia. It has also faced allegations of sexual misconduct by its troops in Haiti, Burundi and Liberia....
           </p>
           <p>
            "The boys, some of whom were orphans, disclosed sexual exploitation, including rape and sodomy, between December 2013 and June 2014 by French troops at a centre for internally displaced people at M’Poko airport in the capital Bangui.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The children described how they were sexually exploited in return for food and money. One 11-year-old boy said he was abused when he went out looking for food. A nine-year-old described being sexually abused with his friend by two French soldiers at the IDP camp when they went to a checkpoint to look for something to eat.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The child described how the soldiers forced him and his friend to carry out a sex act. The report describes how distressed the child was when disclosing the abuse and how he fled the camp in terror after the assault. Some of the children were able to give good descriptions of the soldiers involved."
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though some of the children were able to give good descriptions of the soldiers, notice this paragraph from the New York Times article linked above:
           </p>
           <p>
            "'There’s a whole problem about identifying people,' [Agnès Thibault-Lecuivre] said in a phone interview, noting that the case was particularly difficult because it was based solely on the children’s accounts, without independent evidence. 'Are these accusations clear, accurate, detailed, repeated? And, based on these accusations, have we identified who might be the perpetrators?'"
