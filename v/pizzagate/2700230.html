<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Does the way this question is phrased creep anyone else out besides me? </p>
<p>Typically, you\'d see such questions phrased as &quot;Are children welcome at the festival?&quot; or &quot;Will the festival have activities for children?&quot; But, can <strong>we come</strong> with our <strong>sweet little children</strong> is just plain weird.  
</p>
<p>The answer to the question? </p>
<p><em>Yes, kids under 8 are welcome and free of charge.</em></p>
<p>Don\'t forget the pedo saying &quot;sex before 8 or it\'s too late.&quot; <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/646809/posts">http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/646809/posts</a></p>
<p>What is the meteor festival? </p>
<p>It\'s a 3 day long celebration that\'s <em>a visionary and cutting edge musical journey that surpasses borders and distorts time and space themselves.</em> </p>
<p><em>Its location – Open ranges of the Upper Galilee, a promising spot for out-of-body experiences, since the dawn of history.</em></p>
<p><em>Its timing – Just before Rosh HaShana and after the summer heat cools down, for three days and two nights we plan to create an alternative reality and dive right in.</em> <a href="https://meteorfestival.com/experience/">https://meteorfestival.com/experience/</a></p>
<p>Here\'s why Lana Del Rey says she cancelled her concert: </p>
<p><em>In a Twitter message late Friday, Del Rey says she is delaying &quot;until a time when I can schedule visits for both my Israeli and Palestinian fans.&quot; It wasn\'t clear whether it was a direct response to the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement\'s boycott call. Still, it marked a setback for Israel, which aims to prevent politics from infiltrating the arts.</em> <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-after-bds-pressure-lana-del-rey-cancels-israel-show-1.6433887">https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-after-bds-pressure-lana-del-rey-cancels-israel-show-1.6433887</a></p>
<p>I find this reasoning very interesting because most PG investigators know how art and politics intertwine and how politics uses are to conceal their occult activities. <em>cough</em> Marina Abramovic</p>
<p>As PG investigators, we all know how Israeli influence plays a part in child sex abuse and trafficking, and organ harvesting. Is this music festival another way for children to be victimized?</p>

            And advertiser snake-oil speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is your "research"?  Who is this going to bring down?  What children will this help?

              Honestly, how pathetic of a submission is this? Is this the quality of your research?

              I can almost guarantee it's not even PG material.  SOME mod will agree, and so will users, and I'll be sure to make a post about how shameful and useless your submissions are.

               Your opinion doesn't matter, even as skewed as it is. If the members find it to be a worthless topic, they'll downvoat it as such.

               I think the members who've upvoated it would disagree with you? Why do you feel this thread doesn't matter? Are you ok with people bringing their young children to this festival? Can you say with absolute certain that nothing nefarious is going on wiyh children at this festival? Because you are debasing this thread, it sure seems as though you're protecting someone or at least running damage control.

                This is called "shifting the burden of proof", and Jews like to do this all the time.

                The burden is on you to show that there's a reasonable chance that THIS FESTIVAL has something awful planned for children.  It's also a bit embarrassing if there's not someone that will be held accountable or saved from your submissions, is it not?  I would feel that embarrassment had I made such a useless submission.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you know what kind of people do not feel that kind of embarrassment?

              Israel overall should burn.

              I want to know why you're bringing it up if:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Israel is a hub for child trafficking and fucking
             </p>
             <p>
              2) No direct link here despite Israel being a hub for such things
             </p>
             <p>
              3) Nobody will actually get saved or arrested from your research.  Nobody.

               I can think of a few purposes; namely
               <em>
                don't bring your children to the event.
               </em>
               Granted, the whole pitch is a stretch.
With all due respect for thinking more critically than this subvoat has a reputation for, I think this is a fair enough submission if not just for discussing its relation to Israel's hub of activities that you mention.
              </p>
              <p>
               The wording of the Q&amp;A is suggestive, definitely odd, and the background and particulars of the event can support what is implied. We all know there is no hard evidence, but as with the majority of the threads here, it is one of many pieces that correlate implicit messages with a narrative of the culture/place/time/methodologies from the occult.

               I'm glad I read it, because it got me thinking of festivals. I volunteer annually for a three-day festival, biggest in my country. A lot of police show up to help, and random beatings still happen in the middle of a crowd and it's too chaotic to react in time. This has me thinking of all the ways a sadist plans and attends to his target.

                Dear reader:
               </p>
               <p>
                Restaurants that say "kids eat free" want to rape and murder your children.
               </p>
               <p>
                Apparently I'm a monster for not just agreeing with OP when it's pretty standard practice for kids to get discounts or not be charged for lots of things.

               Yes, but srayzie's name wasn't listed as a mod in the sidebar at the beginning of August when she revealed to me in a PM that she is a PG mod. This is also the same time she asked me in a PM what my gender was and admits asking me this in a PM. The thing is, the PMs where she asked me my gender and the one where she secretly tells me she's a mod here are both missing from my inbox. Why will she admit to one missing PM, but not the other? They are gaslighting me saying that I deleted them myself. Um, no. There's some serious fuckery going on and I'd be weary of trusting either one of them. And don't dare politely disagree with srayzie or you'll find yourself in the same boat I and others are in. No matter how many great research threads you present, they'd rather let this board go to shit and ultimately confuse everyone by labeling people shills just because their egos have been injured.

                Can mods really get into inboxes though? I saw someone else commenting about mods checking someone's IP address, but according to several mods that's not possible due to the way voat is set up.

                 I don't know what they're capable of and I certainly wouldn't put anything past them. I definitely wouldn't trust that they're telling the truth about things. Just look how they try to smear genuine researchers. It's a shame really.

                  Well I saw one mod make the suggestion that anyone can start their own sub verse to see what the mods can/can't do, and what they have access to. It may be worth checking out to find out for sure, but seeing that led me to believe what they were saying.

                   Yes, and I did create a sub called
                   <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/CageFight">
                    v/CageFight

                   where people could call out those they believe are shills instead of muddying up the board, but as you can see, the mods think they should have the freedom to muddy up the boards with their drama. "Do as we say not as we do." When I was the mod of CageFight, I really didn't have the ability to do much of anything, but I think certain mods like Crensch have more abilities than we're led to believe. Circles within circles, and compartmentalization is a tactic used often as a means of control online and in real life.

                    You have been an O, Crensch is an O. You said you were not able to do 'much of anything', so why would Crensch? Does he have supernatural powers? To my knowledge, he hasn't.

                     It happened. Check my comments where I stated that srayzie sent me two PMs that are now missing. She admits to one, but not the other. Why would she do this? If I had a screen shot, I would post it.

                     I already admitted that I wasn't able to read inboxes, but how do I know what others may be capable of doing? I've been reading threads from way back when
                     <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
                      v/Pizzagate
                     </a>
                     was created trying to figure this out and many comments made by a particular O are interesting. I'm finding all sorts of things about janitors and volunteers, and how to become such and why the latter aren't able to be used. And this thread is very telling as a rogue mod was deleting important info and changing css, but I'm still digging into what exactly they were deleting. I miss the days when the mods were questioned just as much as the regular members.

                     I think as mods and owners, rather than focusing on calling me a liar and a shill, you should all be trying to find out how inbox messages are disappearing. This should concern everyone in the community.

                       I meant that srayzie admitted to sending me the one PM. Not admitting to deleting it, but just her admitting to sending it after I mentioned it's now missing is evidence that she does admit to sending one of the PMs that are now missing.

                       I understand that mods were chosen by mods who felt they were on the up and up, but who are the volunteers? Why was it stated that volunteers aren't able to be used? The opposite of a volunteer is an employee. Volunteers donate their time while an employee gets paid. Who are the paid employees here?

                       Yes, you've always been friendly and level-headed with me and others. Crensch and srayzie have no problem calling people liars and shills, then stirring shit up. I told them not to concern themselves with who was a shill and who wasn't, so if Crensch insists on flairing shills, he is a danger to the board. No mod should be deciding who's real and who isn't. Why do we even have the up/downvoat system if the mods can instantly ruin someone's reputation? How are you and the other mods even on board with this type of labeling? I dislike those I believe are shills just as much as the next member, but I downvoat them and let them know I think they're acting less than genuine or spreading disinfo and move on. Does Crensch think the members are stupid and need him to point out who they should be weary of? If he has this level of respect for members, he shouldn't be in his position. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Srayzie and Crensch love the drama and mods that do this are a danger to the board and the research as a whole. Period. The only thing I think needs attention is the way certain members use Voat to drive traffic to their Steemit articles as a means of making money. Many of us here happily research for free and it's a slap in the face to the victims when investigators are making money off of what should be a selfless act of helping to bring their abusers to justice.

                         I appreciate your explanation of things, but the PG board is deteriorating because a few of the mods are acting like shills themselves by attempting to discredit good info because they have personal vendettas against particular members. I'd be grateful if we had mods that didn't get caught up in the hive mind and were able to be unbiased. I cringe to think about all the great info that Millennial_Falcon had buried because he didn't like certain members and would declare them to be shills and delete their threads. There were so many incredible researchers here until MF went on the warpath. Seems as though we're quickly approaching this level of mod dictatorship yet again.

                         I'm glad the Flair idea has been scrapped, but there are still mods who were most likely hall monitors back in their school days and now enjoy power tripping here by telling people what they should and shouldn't believe and which members should be accepted and which should be rejected by the community at large. Dangerous stuff. I'm not sure why the sensible mods can't see this. When mods start making lists, the drain plug has been pulled. Maybe there needs to be term limits on mods because burn out and power tripping are serious and trying to intimidate members who don't "toe the line" is not a leadership quality.

            It says on the website, “age restriction 18 and above only” and then the question, “can we come with our sweet little children?”and answer “yes under 8 is free of charge”. So as I understand it kids between 8 and 17 years are not allowed in. About the meteor comet stuff, remember, Kabbalah and Jewish religion is heavily intertwined with the occult and magick so yes I can see them worshipping Saturn and space!!!

             Kaballah is intertwined with the occult.  Judaism is not.  Seek the truth.  Have you ever been to a Jewish ceremony?  I have.  It's like going to any other church on Sunday, except it's in Hebrew, the music sucks, the people are nice, and the food is better.  The message is the same.  It comes from the bible.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've also been to Muslim ceremonies.  Where they separate men from women.  Everyone smells bad.  And they aren't very friendly.  The food is good if you don't wind up shitting through the eye of a needle.

              This: Kabaalah = Mystery Babylon Religion hidden under the name of "Judaism." But all you have to do is just look up "Kabaalah" and you will see that the most common definition of it is "Jewish Mysticism." Mysticism = Magick.

               That's a pretty big jump from mysticism to magic(k).  The Catholic church (Roman and Orthodox) are very heavy into mysticism.  From the little bit I've read on Kaballah, it's about a 1,000 year offshoot of "mainstream" Judaism.  Sounds like a lite version of Santeria.

            It almost sounds like 'pedos welcome'.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been a bunch of articles published in the MSM in the last two or three weeks about sexual harrassment at festivals - so I guess that pedos also like to go there - they probably check the websites to see whether children are welcome, or activities for children are offered, and then go there and prey on children - festivals are always a bit chaotic, so they can hope that parents don't always watch their children properly.

            The format is a three days long music festival with 5 stages, camping under the pecan trees, a diverse and high quality catering area (that caters to everyone!), an open-air cinema, an arcade tent, art displays, and many more activities to be announced.

            The only thing missing is the Hippies Dancing with their Rainbow Beads and the Hart Family.  This could well be something that is at least orchestrated to rope in the children.  Also the Sweet Little Children   Reminds me of Sweet Chicken.  This has always made me cringe.  Idk why it makes me think of something very sinister.  A Sweet  Child    and  Sweet Chicken.  Yes, it could lead to organ harvesting.  Israel is one of the key countries stealing the organs of Our Children.  They have not problem taking them from Palestinian Children.  They hate them but not enough to die.

              I used to do it more often and then let up.  I am back to doing it again.  When you see it, know that things are capitalized for a reason.  Like in this sentence I just wrote someone.

             <p>
              Thank You.Our Children (and I means all of them for I believe All Children are Ours) they are Our Future. If we don't fight for them what does that say about us? Not much.
             </p>
             <p>
              I always capitalize when talking about Our Children, because I want people to think about how All of Them Belong To Us.
