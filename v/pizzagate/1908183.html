             From what I could tell no.  Up until he red pilled he didn't take the satanic thing seriously/the satanic parties he attended were lots of drugs, booze and naked women.  When he saw they were serious using children he backed out.  Was he taken to a ritual and saw what they were doing or did he back out before/can't say.  He was tortured not to reveal names.  Maybe someone here has a more in-depth interpretation.  There is supposed to be part 2/when or if it comes out it will be topic of discussion so no worries over missing it.

              To put it carefully, most people followed a not very mainstream religion. These people, most of them, were Luciferians. And then you can say, religion is a fairy tale, God doesn’t exist, none of that is real. Well for these people it is truth and reality, and they served something immaterial which they called Lucifer.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I also was in contact with those circles, only I laughed at it because to me they were just clients. So I went to places called Churches of Satan. So I visited these places and they were doing their Holy Mass with naked women and liquor and stuff. And it just amused me. I didn’t believe in any of this stuff and was far from convinced any of this was real. In my opinion, the darkness and evil is within the people themselves. I didn’t make the connection yet.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I was a guest in those circles and it amused me greatly to see all those naked women and the other things. It was the good life. But then at some moment, which is why I am telling you this, I was invited to participate in sacrifices abroad.
             </p>

            <p>
             The next part of the interview deals with who exactly the elite were sacrificing, and unfortunately, Bernard expressed that they used children as the human sacrifices. The concept of sacrifices was explained very well during an Alex Jones interview with Sean Stone, director, screen writer, actor, and son of the infamous Oliver Stone:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              If they want to control the Middle East, or the music industry they have to make a sacrifice to these “demons.” Whether it’s children or soldiers at war, they always respond to signs and symbols, for example the pyramid shape, the five sided star, the six sided star, they congregate around these signs. This is why major corporate symbols are full of “Illuminati” symbols. That’s why when you wear those clothes, or buy those products, you are giving power to that entity, you are giving energy to it, you are giving it power over you.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Bernard continued to explain the sacrifices and where he drew the line, stating, “That was the breaking point. Children.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “You were asked to do that?” asks the interviewer.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “Yes, and I couldn’t do that,” Bernard explains. “And then I started to slowly break down. I lived through quite a lot as a child myself and this really touched me deeply. Everything changed. But that is the world I found myself in. And then I started to refuse assignments within my job. I could no longer do it. Which made me a threat.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Though the entire interview is very sobering and informative, the ending is perhaps the most eye-opening:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Humanity is a manifestation of light, that is the true creation. As long as you divide them on political parties, skin color, you name it, then you – from a Luciferian point of view – suppress the full capacities of your enemy, their full power. They can’t stand up for themselves because if they did the Luciferians would lose. This monster, this greedy monster would disappear.
             </p>
             <p>
              “I tell people about this old American general who puts an entire room of people in the dark. The eyes adapt to the darkness but you can’t see a thing. The general doesn’t say a word and he suddenly flicks on a lighter, one tiny light, and due to the prolonged darkness, you experience a manifestation of light from a single point and suddenly everyone can slightly see each other again. And then he says “that is the power of our light.”
             </p>
