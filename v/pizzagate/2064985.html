</p>
<p>This site was first discovered by a 4chan user a few mounths ago and posted here on voat: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1832369">v/pizzagate/1832369</a> by user <a href="https://voat.co/user/Dorfaladin">@Dorfaladin</a>. </p>
<p>As promised (apologies for the delay) I will reveal who runs the site as well as post its database which includes its 7,500 members (350 who have purchased content), as well as records of what was purchased and by who. Included for most members are their first and last name. I won\'t be posting the database just yet though, as I want to finish combing through it and identifying as many pedo\'s as possible before making it public.  
</p>
<p>Some of the members I have identified though are a lawyer and former Scottsdale AZ prosecutor as well as a gun owner living in Oklahoma who has young kids and a wife who works at an elementary school. I\'ve also identified a doctor out of Maryland and I\'ve only just began to scratch the surface so I expect to find many more pedo\'s in positions that enable them to interact with young children.

Example of content purchased.</p>
<p>Now then, the site owner is Brent William or Brent Harracksingh, I\'ve seen both last names tied to some of his accounts. I found his email in some of the DNS records and found some old passwords of his and he happened to be dumb and use the same passwords all over the place.  
</p>
<p>In some of the pictures I will include a possible mailing address and phone number of his. I\'ve reacehed out to him and he claims that they are addresses he hasn\'t lived at in 10+ years but who knows.

            "I am the one who hacked TM4B and that means I have all of your info. Now I was just made aware of a newsletter posted by Brent, (owner of TM4B and wanted for murder). You are a fool if you think what you are doing isn't wrong and absolutely illegal. You're also a fool if you think I'm messing around when I say I will be reporting you to the FBI. I'm compiling a list of each and every one of you and this list contains your first and last name, email, ip address, comments you made, records of every purchase you made.
           </p>

            </a>
            to see your details once I uncover who you are and post it for the world to see. I will find your friends and family and make sure they see this as well. I'll be going through and adding more and more of you to this list every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Want some good news? Yes you messed up and yes you're now in a very bad spot, but there is a way out. If you don't see your name on there yet, you can pay 1 btc to REMOVED or you can go to
            <a href="https://gocps.net/">
             https://gocps.net/
            </a>
            REMOVED to make payment. Do so quickly and I'll skip over you.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you think 1 btc is to much then just consider how bad things can get for you if people knew who you really were.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is nothing cp on the site you listed and some that are 18+ But I have forwarded the email you send me to the FTC and FBI field office in my area

            I have started to investigate everything about this site and even have much more info then you have... ! but strange thing is I have got mail asking me to transfer 1 BTC, now I understood that's it's from you, you ask for 1 BTC which is (4000$) or you will publish all information on public forums, you are using this for own revenue and all this ineradicable work which is done here used by you to get some more cash...
           </p>
           <p>
            you think everyone is blind right ? This community exposed hundreds of pedos in different positions not a big deal to find out about you also, Want to use our power to get money I even not sure if your posting real people info, I will have soon full db and will check myself BTC is anonymous so there will not be names you maybe using fake names to just get from them money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay so I just want to tell that all information which I have collected for site and also collected information about you, soon both will be published after reporting to authorities! your treating about wife and kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh also I remember you was using stolen cards right ? I was thinking from where I remember you, I was fighting there also world is small criminals should be in jail like pedos, I even not sure that your not one of them.

            Hope in future after this no one will be able to use good work for there evil plans! That will be a lesson! I love this community because they are doing work without revenue they want to expose all this evil and your destroying all this because of own good, your EVIL which should be exposed also.

            Example mail I have got on fake email which I have created
           </p>
           <p>
            I have hacked TM4B and now contain all user account and transaction information. I will be releasing all records (including your IP: *) on several online public forums as well as sending your account information and purchase history to the United States FBI where you will be investigated and charged with the purchase and support of child pornography. 
I will find family members, your wife if you're married, kids if you have any, and will let them know about your activities as well. However, since I have thousands of pedophiles to expose, you can remove yourself from my list for 1 bitcoin:

            dcxz584hf8d02ke6axxhc5zlw After you send the payment, reply to this message with proof and I'll remove you from my list and you won't be exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Soon with site info I will post full info about

             Well that's a disappointing revelation.  Karenrussell63 if you are using your work as a method for blackmail and extortion you would be no better than the people you are going after.  (Actually worse, since extortion is a felony, and as despicable these sites are, they aren't illegal.)  What is your response to this karenrussell63?

                 hope you never have accessed with real IP carding forums or this bitcoin store, main thing is sites where you have used cards I'm just communicating with them, I already have given to shops all info which I had about you, lets see who knows what happens. Also your BTC address and coinpayments account also where reported.

                 Hah I just read you have guessed password :D Think about people who can much more then guessing passwords :D if your good carder/cracker you should know very well to not show yourself, why the hell you blackmail so many people :D That's actually fun and stupid same time considering fact that there is so much info about you

              </p>
              <p>
               Hi everyone,
              </p>
              <p>
               Recently an asshole extortionist took advantage of a security hole in our website.  We use wordpress, a very popular website software/script to run our website.  This asshole was just waiting around until a vunerability became known, to be able to take advantage of it.  It's not that our website is insecure or any less secure than other websites.  But sometimes when an exploit is found and made known all across the internet, an asshole like this can take advantage of the exploit and use it to gain access to our admin area before it can be fixed.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you're interested you can read more about the exploit used here:
               <a href="https://secupress.me/blog/wordpress-4-7-4-unauthorized-password-reset-vulnerability-0-day/">
                https://secupress.me/blog/wordpress-4-7-4-unauthorized-password-reset-vulnerability-0-day/
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               It was used for one day, and was actually used to steal our bitcoin sales from that day, we were able to fix the exploit and stop the hacker from accessing our site any longer.  Since the asshole walked away with a day's worth of sales of bitcoin, I figured that would be the end of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               But it appears that the asshole is not only a quasi hacker but also a quasi extortionist.  From the little information I was able to find about him, he appears to be a Pizzagate nut.  As far as the world is concerned, Pizzagate has been debunked and many pizzagate topics / forums have been removed from the internet, such as on reddit/etc.  While I don't know a lot about pizzagate, and some of it is disturbing, I definitely DO KNOW that many of the pizzagate nutters/activists are batshit crazy.  They think every website online is a honeypot and secretely linked to pedophilia.  The asshole extortionist / pizzagate psycho, caught wind of TM4B and waited patiently for an exploit to come around with Wordpress and took advantage of it as quickly as possible to steal some bitcoin from me.
              </p>
              <p>
               But that wasn't enough for the asshole.  Under the guise of trying to 'expose pedophiles' he's trying to demand that we send him bitcoin.  I did not and will not send that asshole a cent.  You should not send him anything either.  First of all, TM4B and all of my websites are NOT illegal and are not even close to being pedophilic regardless of what this asshole or anyone else things.  Pedophilia is attraction to prepubescent girls (or boys) 1-10 years of age, teenage girls are not prepubescent.  Our main focus is showcasing the beauty of models aged 13 to 17, there's nothing wrong with it and nothing illegal about it.  Our website servers are HOSTED IN THE UNITED STATES.  They are not anonymous servers, they aren't darknet servers, they are legal/registered/normal servers hosted with www.100tb.com - if there was something illegal with our websites, 100tb.com / the FBI / etc would shut our servers down.  They have not done so because the FBI has to focus on ACTUAL ILLEGAL WEBSITES that have no parental permission in place, and that cross the boundaries of legal teen modeling into sexually explicit material.
              </p>
              <p>
               The asshole quasi extortionist is simply trying to use scare tactics to get people to pay him money, and the only information he might have is your email address.  Hopefully you are using an email address not linked to a Facebook profile or anything like that, if you are, you should change your Facebook email address and change your email address on our site.  There are many services that will give you a free email address that you can use instead of a personal or work email address.  You should not respond to the asshole quasi extortionist and definitely DO NOT send him any money or bitcoin.  Doing so, will only make you more of a target.  If you just ignore him, he will be left with nothing more to do, if you respond to him or send him money, he will then have confirmation that he can play with your feelings and continue to ask you for more and more money until you have nothing left.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm sorry that this happened, but there's nothing more we can do.  We have tried to find out who he is, and if I ever do find out who he is, I would report him for extortion and get him arrested.  Because while viewing teen model content is not illegal, extorting people and threatening to report them if they do not send money is AN EXTREMELY SERIOUS CRIME and he would be jailed for it.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have added a plethora of more security software, settings and are actively reviewing the security of our website much more than before since this happened.  From my research it seems apparent that I was shut down by various creditcard merchant account companies due to the same kind of pizzagate activists/psychos as this quasi extortionist.  Pizzagate has created some sort of mass hysteria amongst certain types of people that are getting triggered by it.  They should focus on fighting actual child abuse, real illegal websites and leave properly managed legal teen websites alone.
              </p>
              <p>
               The only unfortunate thing this asshole could do, is if he can use your email to figure out your social media profile, he could try to contact anyone you know to squeal to them about you visiting our legal teen modeling websites.  You could easily deny this.  This asshole hacker no longer has access to our websites, all he has is a list of emails he downloaded.  He could have put anyone on that list.  You could say that you have been investing in bitcoin/cryptocurrency and now someone is trying to threaten you to send them money.  This is the ONLY uncomfortable situation that might happen.  This asshole talking about FBI reporting or anything else is complete bullshit.
              </p>
              <p>
               We still need your generous support to keep up with new photoshoots and posting the best teen model content that has ever been created as we have been doing legally for many years.  Thank you for your continued support and we apologize for not being able to take care of this asshole extortionist the way he deserves to be taken care of.  The best thing to do is just IGNORE HIM!

                Not that it matters but just to be clear and I hope this is you Brent, because I want you to know that you were targeted. I did not "wait around" hoping for an exploit to be released. I seen you editing files related to that 0day and laughed because that 0day only applies in a very small % of cases. Actually the only reason I gained access to your site is because you are stupid and use the same password for several accounts.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have a full backup of your site. This includes IP addresses of every member, first and last name for most, records of everything they purchased, comments they made, and yes email addresses. I absolutely will be reporting you and your members to the FBI, but as we here involved with pizzagate know, sometimes matters must be taken into our own hands. And so I will do my part in uncovering each and every one of your members and if the authorities fail to take action, at least they're family and neighbors and co workers will be made aware of their activities.

                 why aren't you responding to the claims that you were trying to extort money the members that you have uncovered?  Were you?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have sent a tip to the FBI's internet crimes division to investigate TM4B, and I thank you for your work digging up this information.  I also included in that tip these accusations that have been made of blackmail/extortion of these people against you.  If you weren't then you have nothing to worry about and my apologies, and if you were trying to extort these people for your personal gain instead of doing it because it right then that makes you no better morally than them.  Using this type of information against people is an extremely common method of blackmail/extortion and is one that the FBI actively investigates.

                 If you did not try to extort these people then thank you for your work.  Your lack of response to these allegations is bothersome however.

                  This person is most certainly trying to extort BTC.  I was led to this very forum as a scare tactic by him to show that he has the information.

                 <p>
                  Here are the 3 emails I have gotten pertaining to this matter:
**July 30 email -

You will be investigated and charged with the purchase and support of childp0rn. I will find family members, your wife and kids, and will let them know about your activities.
Or, you can save yourself and be removed from my list.

                  August 18 email - 
I was just made aware of a newsletter posted by Brent, (owner of TM4B and wanted for murder). You are a fool if you think what you are doing isn't wrong. It is absolutely illegal and I'm not messing around when I say I will be reporting you to the FBI. I'm compiling a list of each and every one of you and this list contains your first and last name, email, ip address, comments you made, records of every purchase you made.
You may look here:

                  to see your details once I uncover who you are and post it for the world to see.
We'll see if ignoring me got you the outcome you hoped for.**

                  I myself did purchase content from the site.  I don't consider myself to be a pedophile by any stretch.  I do however like "young" girls ages around 15 and up.  I like sexually developed girls as evolution has coded in me.  I went ahead and made an account to post the emails.  I don't feel the content is immoral, and definitely not illegal.

                   you are very welcome, but you still haven't addressed my question.  Did you ask these people to send you money (bitcoin)?

                    He absolutely did.  See my reply I just posted.  He is asking for 1 BTC.  I can show you screenshots of the emails if necessary.

                     If you are telling the truth, send the header information from the emails and the bitcoin address he/she was requesting money to be sent to following the directions on this link.  It won't be too difficult for them to find him/her if what you are saying is legitimate.

                    That must be you Brent. Member for 2 days, you only comment on this thread. Your writing style of sounding impartial and supportive even. Yep it must be you. How's Brazil treating you? Running from the cops there too?

                     I am absolutely not "Brent".  (Way to try to dodge the question though.)  I have been a long time pizzagate follower and regularly read voat since finding it through reddit.  This thread was the reason I decided to finally register and post.  You had actually uncovered something really interesting and substantive unlike so many other of the dead ends.  I hope and pray brent is caught and brought to the justice it appears he has escaped from.  I am however disappointed that once again you have still not answered the question.  Your inability to answer this simple question makes it seem like you have something to hide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So one more time for good measure, did you try to get these people you have exposed to pay you money?

                       does it not bother you that he is unwilling to answer the question as to if he was trying to extort money from people, which is a FELONY?  If he didn't, why didn't he say he didn't the first time it was brought up, or the second, or third, or tenth?  I love this site and its members, but I don't want the efforts of pizzagate to turn into some Nigerian email scam where people are only doing the work to put money in their pockets.  The reason I am so interested in this, is if karenrussell63 did try to extort these people, he/she is not a white hat hacker doing this work for the betterment of society and these kids, exposing these people would just be his payback for them not sending him money.  If he/she is extorting people the only people he is exposing are the people who didn't pay him/her.  The poor ones.  The rich powerful people that could be exposed by this might have all paid him off and avoided exposure.  Does that not bother you too?

                        Between the two crimes, exploiting children is infinitely worse than extorting a bunch of pedophiles. Also, are you making a moral distinction between wealthy and poor pedophiles?  Thanks for trying anyway, B-Dawg.

                 I don't care to introduce myself on this ridiculous, racist site.  I did post on there and I've seen nothing but racist, ignorant comments thus far.  All I'm asking is for mods to do their damn job.  You have a member spreading false information and trying to literally extort people.  Yet all of you just make absurd comments and ignore it.  I don't really care anymore because all this nonsense is posted in "pizzagate".  Now that I have learned what that is, literally no one will take any of this seriously.

            Thanks for all your work karenrussell63 uncovering all the backstory with this guy.  If all that is true about brent, that is almost unbelievable that they let him out of custody with an ankle bracelet.  Some of his older sites you found were talked about on 4 chan years ago but nothing ever came of it as I recall.  I don't know if anybody ever figured out who the owner was.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is sad in all of this, is that he is able to run a site like tm4b that appears to be hosted in the US and can't be prosecuted for it.  As despicable as the content he sells is, he skirts the law to avoid getting in trouble here.  It looks like he keeps these girls covered up just enough for it not to be considered illegal content by our crazy government.  He's not the only one either, there are other sites like his that are completely US based that have done the same thing he's doing for years and haven't got in any trouble for it.  Years ago I remember seeing in the news and following the case of a guy named James Brady that got arrested in colorado for his website "trueteenbabes" that was exactly like tm4b and was acquitted of all charges.  Finding out info of other crimes brent has committed like you have here may be the best chance we have to get rid of guys like him.  When you get time you should check out these other sites to see if you can find similar info on their owners:
teenstarlet . com
teenstarletlatinas . com
           </p>
           <p>
            One word of caution I would give, is to be very cautious going after his buyers.  Sites like these seem to be a magnet for identity thieves.  About 6 or 7 years ago I had my debit card info stolen through a hack of a payment processor and had almost $1000 of my money spent out of my account over a few days.  The bank tracked the purchases to porn sites and that was a nightmare to fix.  If you get to aggressive hunting down the buyers that may or may not be the ones who actually purchased the product, in some jurisdictions you can be prosecuted for harassment since the government doesn't see this as illegal, not to mention, ruin somebody's marriage or life if they weren't the one who actually bought it.  You seem to have some serious skills to be able to get the info you're obtained, and I'd hate to see you get in trouble for trying to nail these slime balls.  It's kind of like the war on drugs, focus on the dealers and suppliers instead of the junkies if you want to end the drug epidemic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep up the good work!

            I'm not signing into YT to link to the video.  The Vice News piece "inside the white nationalists" is laughable.  Same groups of people cut from different angles.  Not a single tattoo in sight.  No AB affiliation.  The "producers" of this video obviously have no idea what the real "white power" movement looks like.

            Are_We_Sure....you can continue playing devil's advocate.  But I'll throw this out here for you - exploit all imagery and video on the internet you like - show me one sign/logo/tshirt/tattoo/etc of a chapter affiliation. Show me one use of those retarded logos (not confederate flag, etc.).  The stupid looking ones.  None of this shit as legit.  Anyone who has ever worked around these sorts know they blaze their "colors".  They are inked. They show their chapter affiliation.  Hell, they kill each other over intersect rivalries.

            Oh, and Kessler, the "leader" - Obama supporter and Occupy fag up until 2016.  Gee....I wonder what the fuck happened?  Oh I know - the Deep State hired him to build a fake identity.

             I've seen the ads paying $20 - $25 an hour on Craigslist Help Wanted sections in various cities around the USA to show up at these protests. I've also seen them on Back Stage West aimed at actors and entertainers to be employed by "Crowds on Demand"  out of LA. I've heard the cash paid employees say they needed an extra gig to finance college, and that extra $$$ was given if they got arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
             Protesters for both sides left very similar tour buses only a couple of blocks apart. Most were wearing either ANTIFA or KKK t-shirts which appeared to be manufactured by the same co. I've seen real KKK members as well. Easy to spot at a distance. They would NEVER have listened for 1 second to someone who sounded or looked like Kessler. In fact "the actor" would have been in REAL danger if he'd been anywhere near even a few active in the White Power movement.

             Your argument rests on a pretty big flaw. No one said this represented the complete whole of white nationalism.
You are also trying an argument tactic called "No True Scotsman."
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you accept Richard Spencer as a member of the Alt Right?  Because he was there and leader of this thing.  He's more fashy haircut than a tattoo kind of guy.  Do you think he has been faking who he is for the past decade?
            </p>
            <p>
             Not Hardcore enough for you?  How about head of the Florida League of the South, Michael Tubbs?  He was an Amry sergeant with the Special Forces until he was arrested for stealing guns and explosives for the Klan back in the 1980's.  Is he a True Scotsman?  Because he was there too.

              I love it when self-proclaimed pseudo intellectuals attempt to make an argument that blows up in their face.
             </p>
             <p>
              1) There is no such thing as the "alt-right".  Your use of it as a legitimate phrase establishes that you believe in its existence.  "Alt-right" is a machination of the media, created to try and label and categorize Americans who the left (people like you) deem enemies of its "Utopian ideals".
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Spencer was kicked out of CPAC.  He receives no endorsements from the establishment right. You seem to be making an argument that myself or anyone else is denying the existence of white nationalist groups.  Not the case.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here is Richard's bio - does anyone else here think this sounds like the background of a White Nationalist?  Actually, it does, when you compare it to Hitler's background.  Hitler was a Bohemian as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Spencer was born in Boston, Massachusetts,[12] the son of ophthalmologist Rand Spencer and Sherry Spencer (née Dickenhorst),[13][14] an heiress to cotton farms in Louisiana.[15] He grew up in Dallas, Texas. In 1997, he graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas.[15] In 2001, Spencer received a B.A. with High Distinction in English Literature and Music from the University of Virginia and, in 2003, an M.A. in the Humanities from the University of Chicago.[15] He spent the summer of 2005 and 2006 at the Vienna International Summer University.[16] From 2005 to 2007, he was a doctoral student at Duke University studying modern European intellectual history, where he was a member of the Duke Conservative Union.[15][13] His website says he left Duke "to pursue a life of thought-crime."[17]"
             </p>
             <p>
              Sounds like one of your (leftist) people.
             </p>
             <p>
              3) Kessler - Obama supporter and Occupy organizer in 2016.
             </p>
             <p>
              4) Tubbs - You do realize that the firearms charges against him carried a mandatory minimum of 30-years
              <strong>
               per charge
              </strong>
              involving automatic firearms.  Spencer probably took 100+ years in sentencing.  But yet he is out of prison?  A white supremacist? Really?  No, he became an informant for the FBI, he's on their payroll, and the Deep State brought him out of mothballs for an occasion like this because of his "street cred".
             </p>
             <p>
              You can try all of the philosophical double-speak and linguistic maneuvering, but at the end of the day, you make no case, no point, or state any fact.  It's probably a good thing investigative abilities aren't required for your paycheck, or you'd be eating Ramen.
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh, you may want to watch American History X for a better perspective of how these little sects of white supremacy groups operate.

            I found a business listing for Opulent Media LLC that has Brent's name as the manager. The agent is listed as Chad L Belville in Phoenix, AZ.
            <a href="http://www.arizonacorporates.com/corp/169750.html">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Chad L Belville is a criminal lawyer in Phoenix
            <a href="http://www.lawyers.com/phoenix/arizona/chad-l-belville-1000731-a/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe this is him being mentioned in this post
            <a href="https://aksarbent.blogspot.com/2011/02/us-subsidiary-of-50000000-international.html?m=1">
             http://aksarbent.blogspot.com/2011/02/us-subsidiary-of-50000000-international.html?m=1
            </a>
            in which case he has a history of representing the "adult" film industry. He was also formerly elected county attorney for Worth county, Iowa! His LinkedIn username is chadknowslaw; Voat wouldn't let me post a link to it and I couldn't get it to archive correctly.  According to his profile, he's going by Chad Anderson now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did an Open Corporates search with his name, and found quite a few porn companies with him listed as the agent
            <a href="https://opencorporates.com/officers?page=1&amp;q=Chad+belville">
             https://opencorporates.com/officers?page=1&amp;q=Chad+belville
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: the company physical address given for Opulent Media is the same address as Tiffany Preston Productions LLC
            <a href="http://www.arizonacorporates.com/corp/169750.html">
             http://www.arizonacorporates.com/corp/169750.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Tiffany Preston Productions also has Chad Belville's name on it
            <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_az/L13133540">
             https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_az/L13133540
            </a>
            I did a quick Google search and found that Tiffany Preston Productions is a porn company.

            I'm smelling a cover-up. The coroner, Andrés Felipe Velasco, said Brent had chronic constipation and possible colon cancer. Then, instead of placing him in a hospital, they put him in a senior citizens home with an ankle bracelet. Etc?
           </p>
           <p>
            The article said he paid one girl $600,000. Colombia is corrupt and officials can usually be bought, and it seems like Brent has money. Wonder if he paid his way to the senior citizens home?

             I was wondering if it was a mis-translation because $600,000 seems excessive. I had access to his site for a few days and from that and the db I downloaded he received over $50,000 worth of bitcoin in a 2-3 month period. So he does for sure have money and apparently has hired guns so really anything is possible. I'll post his IP address from when he was accessing his site, maybe it will get to the right authorities and maybe help in tracking him down.
