            Why is it that ever time one of these Senators decides to do something it is a child trafficking mission?  Then they form an organization like the Clintons or McCains and start their own little trafficking business...while Hatch may be on the level, doubtful...this looks like a desperate move of the guilty...folks are going down..

            Who cares? Seriously I only care about the children in my family. If a parent wants to fuck/beat/kill their kid I don't see how this is an issue. They made it.

             Certainly part of it.  There are 7 billion people now in the world.  In 1950 there were 2.5 billion.  About 1 billion live on $1 a day or less, 3 billion on $2 a day or less.  Makes it easier to nab or even buy children.  Parents may (as was the case in Haiti) be told that their kids would get a better life if adopted.

            What do people know about Hatch and this guy Tom Ballard?  I have read on here before about Utah being involved in a lot of the trafficking and also Mormons.  This just does not sit right with me, but I don't know why.  It kind of reminds me of John McCain and Ashton Kutcher and Thorne.  It makes me feel queasy.

             I was thinkinking the same thing. This quote is from Orrin Hatch. I'm almost positive Cathy O'Brien talks about him in Trance-Formation of America as not being one of the good guys.

              Wow.  Thanks for reminding me of that!  Cathy O'Brien, Yes.  If she mentioned him being involved in anything at all as  part of her horrible memories, then he is one of the perverted vermin that we cannot trust.  Another John McCain to be sure.

             Exactly what I was going to say.  Hatch is very right wing and an underwear-wearing Mormon.
            </p>
            <p>
             It does make me wonder, as well, because this looks like a new "War" on trafficking which could
turn out to be just like the War on Cancer and the War on Drugs ... where the "cures" never come,
the problems are only enlarged and we get more of the Cancer and more of the Drug dealing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's also remember that the US government got a lot of help in its genocide versus the native Americans from the
Mormon Church and Catholic Church who ran "Church schools" for the US government who kidnapped children of
natives in order to destroy their culture and families.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were herded into these "Church schools" where they were forbidden to speak in their own language,
their braids cut and their clothing changed to Western European.  They were beaten and murdered and 
of course sexually abused.  And it seems that is still going on in both of those churches.
            </p>
            <p>
             It also concerns me because we see over and again that the heads of organizations are usually corrupt
and there to keep cover ups going.

             Don't like this at all....

              There is much to come that we will not like.  The exposure of the Secret Societies is one.  It goes far beyond Soros and his Society.  I am no longer believing that they are just sick.  They are doing this as you say for a higher purpose.  To control us and a certain outcome.  Their agenda.  That is what I don't like. But we now are becoming aware and that is a good thing.

               Terriffic insight. This is not just about perversion and blind evil, its about warring with nature and the great Creator on every level including changing the nature and sex of people.
They do this to these kids to create "walkins'. Playing God. But everything opposite because they feel man and god rejects them for their nature and what they like to do.
They were doing it in the book of Genesis

              Utah here.  It is a very conservative state except for salt lake city which is centrist/liberal.  The church is a cult and church leaders hold a lot of sway over those who voluntarily subject themselves to that unneccessary power hierarchy.  Although the church zealotry and bubble has been dying pretty quickly since the internet became popular.  I don't know about the highest levels of the church, or Orrin Hatch (don't trust anyone in government that long), but most Utahns and mormons are generally sex-phobic in general, much less pedophilia.  I went on tons of scouting events and what not and never saw anything sketchy.  Most mormon utahns are good decent people, just really naieve and way too trusting.  They lack the imagination to believe people are capable of truly evil shit.  Making them perfect victims.  Most of the degenerates in Utah are ex-mormons who swung the pendulum WAY too far the other way.  Like when you tell kids marijuana is lethal, than they try it, see that you lied, and assume you lied about heroin and shit, and become H-junkies.

               True ... all organized patriarchal religions are cults - yet people surrender their free will to church dictates.
Always amazes me and then they turn their children over to them for another brainwashing.

               Yes, I do think the internet has speeded up an end to male-supremacist religions, but it's taken us...
what, 350 years?
               <br/>
               (More like 2,000 years because these organized patriarchal religions were put in play through violence: 
It was called:   "Introducing the cross with the sword" -- and many nations suffered that experience and 
saw their countries fall to the "cross."

               Good that you've had no negative experience in the Mormon Church, whether physical abuse or sexual, but the Mormon "Church Schools" was the most notorious of the two and both were very physically and sexually abusing of the native children in their care.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many Catholic children were never abused either, but certainly most were under physical threat in those schools.

               It looks very much like the CIA was behind the Jones Town event/mass deaths.

               And John Stockwell -- a very interesting ex-CIA agent who has been whistleblowing on them for decades now -- calls the CIA "Catholics In Action."

               Keep in mind I am NOT saying that there is any basis to "Satanism" .....

               "The Old World Religions were centered in Nature and preceded Judaism, Christianity and Islam by thousands of years.
It was demonized and the old Gods and Goddesses were then co-opted as "Saints" or dehumanized, as well.

              <p>
               "But, of course, there is no devil in the Old Religions and witches certainly do not worship him.
He belongs strictly to the religions of the Bible.  He's their demon, their personification of evil,
their shadow, and, it is time for members of the biblical faith to stop projecting their fears onto
others and simply deal with their own darkness."

               There's no devil, no satan, no demons in the Old World Religions -
It's strictly the invention of male-supremacist religion which required a "god" to
to anoint them as "superior" and devils, satan and demons to scare the hell out 
of those they forced into their religions -- entire nations, actually.
Nor is there a Hell.
That does not mean either that these people do not carry out the violence they
then attribute to these demons.
The evil is within themselves.

            Even the ancient civilization that the Greek were puzzled about and wondering who came first, Egyptians or the Scythians (east of Greece, they occupied a huge territory, their capital being somewhere along a river in central Afghanistan). The legend of Amazons came from the 14 year old Scytian girls who would be someone you would not want to meet, riding on their pony they could throw battle axes 20-25 meters away accurately. Scytian considered children and teenagers equal to the adults and there certainly were no sexism amongst them. Sure their official ritual to become an adult was kind of sick, but that was a tribe of warrior that thrived for centuries, being there when the Greeks were the most powerful and then when the Romans started getting powerful and they had those 3 factions, Scytians were still the most eastern known tribe and fights against them were rare...only Alexander the Great's father managed to push them back way far into Asia...but yeah to be considered an adult you had to decapitate your first kill, take their scalp and pour blood from your opponent in it, holding it like a little pouch and drink it. Despite all that, they would never abuse their own kind and genders were equal, they were advanced in a lot of ways but I said enough to tickle some's curiosities anyway.

              Haha, yeah, read Steve Agner's research on the Scythians. I only knew them from computer games taking placing in the Roman Times, when my turn was over, all the other factions/countries would have their turn and I'd see some of what was happening for each of them, depending on if I had spies on the land on some watchtowers. Back in Rome: Total War, when I still gamed a lot, I haven't game much since that year in, 2007, college became way too difficult in my third and fourth year of that BSc.
