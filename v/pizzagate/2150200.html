<p>&quot;Perverted former publican who led double life on Facebook caught with 45,000 indecent images of boys&quot; from <em>Chronicle Live</em> <a href="http://archive.is/Kqsm7">http://archive.is/Kqsm7</a></p>
<p>Synopsis: Edward Bell of the UK, posted 45,000 pictures of child porn on Facebook over an unspecified number of years. These pictures were broken into multiple categories and included pictures so heinous they couldn\'t be categorized. Yet Facebook\'s algorithm &quot;never&quot; flagged any of the pictures. He has since served his short 16 month sentence (because UK loves pedos). His lawyer David Comb wants us to believe that Bell only did this because he was under stress and had been drinking too much. Comb re-assures us that Bell will no longer be a pedo because his wife can monitor his Internet use and his children have been supportive of him during the entire recovery process.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the same David Comb. <a href="http://archive.is/dEoBM">http://archive.is/dEoBM</a> It was hard to find info on this case other than the two articles above. If that is the same guy I wanted to call him out because to try to get a pedo off light because of alcohol and stress is a terrible excuse.</p>
<p>Facebook has continued to drop the ball when catching pedos. No algorithm is perfect but it\'s pretty hard to have 45,000 images go undetected. My suspicion was that at some point pictures were flagged but someone let the child porn slide through.</p>',

            Yes, they do.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Another choice quote:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             though he was initially charged with 26 counts of first-degree murder, he was convicted of only six counts of second-degree murder. Twenty other charges were later stayed.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            But what they don't say is how and why the other charges were stayed. From wikipedia:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             however, these charges were stayed by the Crown in 2010
            </p>
            <p>
             stayed by the Crown in 2010
            </p>
            <p>
             the Crown in 2010
            </p>
            <p>
             the Crown
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So for whatever reason, the Queen of England had those charges dropped. The profits from his book will go to the defense costs of the publisher's friend, who is a convicted child molester.

            Who were his friends?   He was obviously sharing these for someone to view. There's more going on to this.  Zuckerberg makes me sick.  His algorithms magically filter out Conservatives but don't catch horrendous stuff like this?  Malarky.  He doesn't want Conservatives on there precisely because they call him and his site out on this heinous stuff.

            Not nearly enough time or punishment for his actions in my opinion, as I've stated before these men and women get out of prison and then commit the same atrocities yet again, and statistics prove this.  AND THIS.  There is only one cure for pedophiles, and that is death.
