<p>What child services in the OTO? I immediately thought back to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1774915">this voat post</a> about how Planned Parenthoods and Child Services could be the ones providing child sacrifice subjects to the order. These children have to come from somewhere, right?</p>
<p>So I decided to do some looking around on Google Maps for <a href="http://oto-usa.org/locations/">Ordo Templi Orientis Lodges</a> and their surrounding areas. You make the judgements.
I particularly looked at the Lodges, and only a couple Oasis or camps because the lodge is where the highest initiation takes place.</p>
<p>From Google Maps:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Aum Ha Lodge</strong>
3550 W Peterson Ave #202
Chicago, IL 60659</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyimg.io/i/LydGsy2.png">Photo of OTO Lodge directly connected to Camp Nageela-Midwest</a> which was founded in 2007 and &quot;dedicated to creating a safe, fun and exciting camp program that integrates Jewish values and ideals for kids&quot;</p>
<p>2) <strong>Horizon Lodge</strong>
2820 Thorndyke Ave W
Seattle, WA 98199</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyimg.io/i/y88R9Jf.png">Photo of lodge</a> very close to a Children\'s Montessori School.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Sekhet-Maat Lodge</strong>
7950 SE Foster Rd
Portland, OR 97206</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyimg.io/i/ns4Qutm.png">Photo of Lodge</a> very close to \'Junior Achievement\' child development center.</p>
<p>4) <strong>418 Lodge</strong>
1723 25th St,
Sacramento, CA 95816</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyimg.io/i/LnAzU3u.png">Photo of Lodge</a> very close to Childhood Development Center</p>
<p>5) <strong>Tahuti Lodge</strong> This one was dificult to find, maybe for a reason. It\'s marked as \'Ear Say Inc.\' a Non-Profit Organization with an austere building and no official address. This is the 3rd oldest OTO Lodge.
Located <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7450676,-73.9197444,3a,75y,189.71h,79.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sSAGnNSO8DKY0GAhPFv7dYA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en-US">down this alley</a></p>
<p><a href="http://tinyimg.io/i/NFdtFZr.png">Photo of Lodge</a> (or Ear Say Inc.) across the street from <a href="http://www.amazingmagicbeanslc.com/">\'Amazing Magic Beans\'</a>, a learning center to &quot;nurture and inspire children ages 2-6 years old&quot;</p>
<p>6) <strong>Leaping Laughter Lodge OTO</strong>
USA, 3107 California St NE
Minneapolis, MN 55418</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyimg.io/i/QnwJiaI.png">Photo of Lodge</a> just 0.5 miles from \'Jessica\'s Licensed Family Child Care\' in an obscure place where child care wouldn\'t be a priority. </p>
<p>It\'s important to mention that though this may be shocking, it could all still be circumstantial and none of it is conclusive evidence. I personally think O.T.O. should be the focus since it\'s the cause behind the pizzagate effect. We know <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39459">Thelema</a> is important in the pizzagate circle. We know the origins of Spirit Cooking can <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Marina_Abramovic">(allegedly)</a> be found in the preludes to production of the Cake of Light material, a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley. We know Abramovich is a <a href="http://tinyimg.io/i/OFuFvgb.jpg">high priestess</a> in the order. We know the OTO, did <a href="https://2c-thelema.com/2016/11/04/o-t-o-holds-planned-parenthood-fundraiser/">this weird fundraiser</a> for Planned Parenthood. Why? What can we do now with all this?</p>
<p>Those that live anywhere near these lodges, scope out the area. Question staff at the children center for any suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Please add more and suggest what you think is right. Please look at other locations on your own and share your findings.</p>

            Anything coming from Hoagland is questionable unless it's been verified elsewhere.

             Crowley supported Nazism and this makes sense given his ties to MI5/MI6. 1888 comes to my mind as significant.

            I think you need to replace the word, Nazism, with Zionism. It seems that the stories about the Nazis are mostly Zionist lies. I haven't found strong evidence against the Nazis so far. I haven't looked real hard, but I did look.

            For some reason I'm unable to copy/paste from the article, but it is about a lawsuit that details a case where OTO is accused of being a pedo cult who does commit human sacrifices.

            It's inverted Catholicism.  The dove falling represents Lucifer.

            What did Crowley say on his death bed?  "Sometimes I hate myself" was it something like that?
I wonder of the OTO's position on reincarnation.
            <br/>
            Crowley supported Nazism and this makes sense given his ties to MI5/MI6.
1888 comes to my mind as significant.

            I concur.  It was Alfred Kinsey who introduced the notion sex with babies was normal and he was a follower of Crowley.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just found a giant clue, the OTO(Major Satanic Cult) held a fund raiser for planned parenthood, joke in the article that they offer much more than the usual services.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Another of Kinsey's apparent influences was the occultist Aleister Crowley, "the Great Beast," known in the press as "the wickedest man alive." Kinsey visited Crowley's Thelema Abbey shortly before his death in 1955. Although it has not been established that Kinsey used Crowley as a research source in his books, they shared many friends and acquaintances, such as occultist film maker Kenneth Anger, American Nazi George Sylvester Viereck, and French pedophile Rene Guyon."

            Racine, Wisconsin is one epicenter for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. The system is very connected throughout Wisconsin. See this old article from Racine's paper specifically about taking young runaway to participate in OTO rituals. We need to put the global spotlight on Racine and Wisconsin - it is Paul Ryan's district and it is a cesspool of criminal corruption, racketeering, trafficking and abuse involving the mafia, secret societies, churches and youth programs, prisons and juvenile detention centers, corrupt politicians, corrupt businesses and organizations, corrupt media, corrupt law enforcement, and elite families.

            CHIPPEWA FALLS (AP) - A man claiming to be a priest who told police he had provided sanctuary to two teen-age girls with family problems was sentenced to three years probation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brian C. Knecht, 28, of Chippewa Falls, pleaded no contest Tuesday to a charge of interfering with parental custody.
           </p>
           <p>
            Knecht and Christopher J. Kurschner, 19, were charged in March with the felony parental custody count and contributing to truancy involving two 16-year-old runaway girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            The criminal complaint said Knecht and Kurschner drove the two girls from Chippewa Falls to Texas, looking for an order of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Knecht described himself as a priest in the sect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police said the OTO is involved in hallucinogenic drugs and rituals involving "young juvenile girls."
           </p>
           <p>
            They knew all of this back in the early 90's, and it continues today. Corrupt law enforcement at all levels is a major problem that has enabled this criminal occult and terrorist organizations and societies to continue its patterns of abuse unchecked. Look up the old murders in Racine, then look up the connections with high profile pedo crimes, see the history of secret societies and powerful global connections, and look at what is happening now - there is a major cover-up going on in Racine to hide the corruption and abuse. There is a mass exodus of prominent leaders who are suddenly resigning amid allegations of criminal corruption and abuse.

             This is OT but do you have any thoughts on the Steven Avery case? I'm asking bc it has always seemed to me that that area is corrupt AF and wouldn't have thought twice about murdering an innocent victim to shutdown a guy who was going to bankrupt them.

              There is strong evidence of the same systems of closed and secret societies in Manitowoc as Racine and many other areas throughout Wisconsin. The Attorney General is corrupt or complicit to criminal corruption, and is a Freemason with many ties to the Racine area, including being close friends with the criminal and corrupt District Attorney that the cops covered up for after his drunk hit and run on Main Street in downtown Racine. They run everything, and specifically they run law enforcement. There is much more to the Steven Avery case than "he did it". He is not smart enough to have either pulled off the crime so well, or to have figured out what really happened. As you can tell, everyone in Wisconsin particularly outside of Milwaukee knows how things work. They won't speak up. They won't stand up. They know what happens when you do. The governor is part of a group referred to as the Marquette Mafia, and the network of State and Local police are notoriously corrupt, and are given incentives through broad and unconstitutional Search, Seizure and Asset Forfeiture laws.
             </p>
             <p>
              The corrupt mayor of Racine stated that if you so much as even ask questions about corruption in Racine, "we will destroy you personally and professionally". They make examples of people to dissuade others, and they use the newspaper and other outlets to attack and ruin anyone they need to. They will stalk homes, threaten families, and even murder or attempt to murder witnesses and victims to silence them. What is happening in Two Rivers and Manitowoc is mirrored throughout Wisconsin, and some areas are better at hiding it than others.

               Thanks for the reply. I'm hoping his lawyer Ms. Zellner, can actually shed some light on it. I feel sorry for both families. And I agree, he had no ability to even think up all the steps in that crime.

              Everything posted has been true, and if you have followed Racine at all, you would see there is a mass resignation going on among officials amid allegations of criminal corruption that is linked with Pizzagate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Guess who downvoated you? Why are shills like EquineLuvr so scared of the truth that will be revealed in Racine? The connections and cases are growing daily. EquineLuvr, other shills and those involved know that Racine is a weak point, and they try to discredit the truth that Racine is a cesspool of criminal corruption tied to every aspect of Pizzagate including the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Clintons, Schumers, Weiners, mafia, churches, secret societies, and more.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have EquineLuvr and other shills looked up anything about Racine at all, or do they know it is all true and are trying to discredit the truth? Do you know who lives in Racine? Do you know what organizations and foundations are in Racine? Do you know about the history of corruption and abuse in Racine? Do you know anything about the Zika virus or Polio vaccines, or anything about Sustainability and Agenda 2030? Do you know anything about Racine's links with Haiti and the Clinton Foundation? Do you know about the links to Satanism and corruption in the Catholic Church in the Racine, Milwaukee and SE Wisconsin areas? Have you heard of Dahmer? Do you know who Michael Aquino and the Snake Lady are? Do you know about the kidnappings and ritual murders in Racine? Do you know about the abuse and rigged insider deals involving the prison and juvenile detention systems?
             </p>
             <p>
              We need the spotlight on Racine to pressure Trump and Sessions for an open investigation, and we need protection. The FBI and DOJ are corrupt, and the cases in Racine can prove it. Witnesses and victims are being threatened and prominent officials have ended up dead. Many others are resigning at this very moment as part of the cover-up. Once the spotlight is on Racine and there is some level of protection or bigger visibility, then you will find the mountains of evidence coming forward and the naming of names. Until then we are putting the pieces together, and more is happening each day.
             </p>
             <p>
              This might be a joke to EquineLuvr and others, but for those involved, it is extremely real and extremely scary. This is all true. Racine is a key to exposing the entire network. Why would EquineLuvr and others not want that? There are BILLIONS of reasons why. Watch the interview with Ronald Bernard, and then begin connecting those dots to Racine, Wisconsin.

                This is very true and the most powerful people in the world have ties to Racine. They are currently trying to cover up criminal complaints and corruption involving the mayor that will link right back to some of these powerful people. Help put the spotlight on Racine in any way you can, and we will show the world how this is all connected.

                Yes, in connection with Michael Aquino. There is a rat line between Chicago and Milwaukee, over to the Quad Cities and up to Minnesota. There is also a history of satanic abuse, murders and suicides in the area plus Dahmer, Slender Man, etc., and America's only hope for a Pope is Timothy Dolan who was brought in from St. Louis to cover up serial sexual abuse throughout Milwaukee Catholic churches. Abuse is everywhere. It is an epidemic, and now as a sanctuary city, the area is a haven for undocumented people and crimes. The area is built on sacred Indian burial mounds, there are underground tunnels everywhere, and many haunted buildings including the Freemason lodge in Racine.

                Look up what has happened in Racine in the past few months alone. The corrupt mayor is resigning (last corrupt mayor was arrested on pedo charges). His cousin the corrupt city administrator is resigning (last corrupt city administrator tried to commit suicide after resigning amid allegations of corruption and sexual harassment), many corrupt city council members resigned, the corrupt and criminal District Attorney resigned, the corrupt police chief threatened to resign and got a kickback to stay (the last corrupt police chief resigned after being labeled untrustworthy by the court system), and the city is mired in scandals involving allegations of corruption, bribery, blackmail, extortion, embezzlement, racketeering, collusion, fraud, conspiracy, records tampering, kickbacks, handouts, illegal campaign contributions, big rigging, election rigging, retaliation, stalking, trafficking, abuse, and threats against witnesses to criminal corruption and other crimes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Look into the RICO lawsuit for a glimpse of the levels of corruption. The corrupt mayor commits perjury many times in his deposition alone. His corrupt bar owner friend plead the fifth to racketeering charges. His campaign manager swore to receiving illegal bribes and cash for quid pro quo licensing and development deals. The cemetery director is on record being told to push through back room cash deals for friends, and was fired in retaliation. The real secrets being hidden in Racine involve the more heinous side of Pizzagate. The entire community is corrupt, controlled and complicit. It is a community of blackmail and bribery among secret and closed societies and foundations.
               </p>
               <p>
                The entire story will come out soon, and we need help to shine the light on Racine, so when it does come out, we can tell the entire world what is going on in Racine and how it is connected to every aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

                  This is very real and very serious, thank you for the support. Nothing is happening in a timely manner. The Bushes and Clintons have been involved in corrupt operations for decades. The FBI and DOJ are either corrupt or compromised. We need to take a different approach, and get as many people to put the spotlight on Racine as possible to force Trump, Sessions, Comey and others to start doing something about the network of criminal corruption and Pizzagate that leads to the Clintons, the Deep State, and the secret societies that rule the world with an evil and sadistic agenda focused only on their own power and sustainability.

                 Except of course hundreds of posts that you have yet to be able to dispute any single piece of, including revealing how Racine is connected to every aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption through many secret societies such as Knights of Pythias, Pilgrims Society, Club of Rome, Freemasons and Scottish Rite, Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, Committee of 300, World Business Council, The World Bank, United Nations, Clintons, Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, DNC, RNC, Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Dyncorp, Monsanto, Dow, DuPont, Dutch and British Royalty, Catholic Church and Dominicans, Franciscans, the Irish mafia, the Italian mafia and Sicilians, the Russian mafia, many street gangs, and other hubs involved such as DC, Pennsylvania, Denver, Arizona, Chicago, New York, Ghana, Belgium, Norway, UK, Brazil, Netherlands, and Haiti for a few.

                 What other community under 100,000 shares connections like this linked to Agenda 2030 and sitting on one of the largest fresh water sources in the world? Do you know how many pizza places are in Racine, and why there are so many pizza places in Racine? Do you know that Paul Ryan is personally aware of criminal corruption in his District? Do you know that Loretta Lynch personally stonewalled investigations into Racine, Wisconsin? Do you know why?
                </p>
                <p>
                 We know why. So does Jim Comey. We suspect EquineLuvr knows also. Everyone will know soon enough.

             Magnolia the oldest of trees would carry much interesting memory.
During the Victorian times, the magnolia flowers symbolized dignity, nobility, poise, and pride.
The strength of its bloom is also symbolic of self-respect and self-esteem.
Since these flowers represent durability, strength of character, and bearing, they are widely used in weddings.
Magnolias are also associated with the life force and therefore can be sent over on the occasion of birth.
These flowers also represent a love of nature.

                  there's such a troll/shill infestation that even the most innocent question seems insincere.. yes, that's who I mean. I was just making sure you didn't mean any other drake. and he both raps and sings, but he's more of a singer to me. anyway, thanks for the clarification.

                   i concluded you were sincere bc of millipino being like fillipino so somehow not north american. i likelywas wrong in my reasoning but thatswhy i was trying not to accuse u of anything. it more came across as trolling bc in my head one word drake means the dickhead popstar but of course there is more than one drake and to some people it might not be so instantaneous. sorry for bein rudeor w.e, and yeah it was the "drake the singer" that kind of came off like how my own friendswould troll me so i was confused. yeah he doesnt even rap, never did really.. i heard a new song of his on the radio and i was given another reason to want him dead lol

                    no worries, I understand you. if we were already talking about music, I would be like everyone else and assume you meant that guy just by his name. but when you said "drake's company," I wasn't so sure. can you elaborate on his connections to these daycares and lodges? I need to know this asap so I can tell my girl to stop brainwashing herself with this filth lol
