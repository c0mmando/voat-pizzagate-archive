            Having trouble getting stuff about the pope posted here.  One of the moderators has only been here 23 days (after Pizzagate broke).
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this submission not relevant, even important?  (I get it that connections have to be made but this one is blatant.)

            What's going on with the moderators?  This article on the pope is directly related.  Has been deleted twice and one of the deleters as been here 23 days (maybe showed up just after all this broke).
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the messages.  What can be done to get stuff posted?

            "In 2014, the Italian victims wrote directly to Pope Francis branding Corradi as a paedophile and flagged that he was living in Francis' native Argentina. Yet apparently, nothing was done."
           </p>
           <p>
            This just pisses me off.  He goes on t.v. and calls us PG folks, people who take sexual pleasure out of eating crap.  Meanwhile this kind of evil is going on and he knows it and does NOTHING!  THE ARROGANCE!  When the Pope first entered the scene I really had hoped he would be different.  Nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing leading people astray.  May justice come swiftly for these children.     Excellent find BTW!!  (Side note: I had never heard the word cocrophilia before until I heard it from the pope.  Find it interesting that it is in his personal lexicon).

            Pope sure knows the multi Ireland cases coming out with the nuns and their worldwide centers and institutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting, the Pope made it a priority to meet with popular Youtubers last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting that being a big corp, is what garners meetings, summits, party events versus real individuals that advocate for causes with no support and finances.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at Disney World/Epcot for example. A set of location front, with behind set and underground tunnels. From pope to pres to queen to all, its all just a govt corp now set.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pyramid schematic and masses fawning like fanatics, at ones that do not do crap of what they could in talk or action to benefit world and stop corruption's, wars, crimes, violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            The library of the church, off limits to the populace. So many secrets. Decades upon decades, the elite had so much status, advertising, support, access to resources and proven a big F for failure.

            Things are not solved if not good will intent, but agenda. Agenda, does not lead to "efficiency in movements, " but always high costs, many people and entities paid, making a living.

            Why are ones like Soros, not just taken out and arrested? As if it would be hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope was built up for populace voting to get out of the European Union. Now, its dayed and their plans are to.loophole their agendas in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are even state laws on ballots, allowed to add in unrelated addendums that take away rights, powers, or give more rights to bigwigs?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is Soros, universal commercial code the blueprint allowed that takes away home biz rights in most of USA, abroad, refugee camps, FEMA trailers, etc?/ Basic economics is a life right and consumer plus producer does create jobs, independence, thriving areas?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are refugees to be routed into our countries vs routed to areas and islands that are vacant, and build up their town with volunteers, recycled materials, homes of yurt/shipping containers/minihimes with mentor training and volunteers, and home biz RTS or community markets, so jobs are made, and even tourism is a viable economic stream of income for individuals and the collective area?
           </p>
           <p>
            Clearlt, solutions are not desired by the top echelin , pyramid schematic,; and Public Trust is to be daily violated with distress, burden, impact, fear, panic, peopoganda mind control and political correctness above even local rape victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Emergency EMT cannot even safely go to the slums and projects, all over Europe, as refugee gangs are ruling the areas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are we supposed to bow down and give this unquestioned respect to leaders, including pooe , queen, etc as if they are better than us; and they live with all this entitlement, endless paerues, taxes paid to then, properties given and owned?/
           </p>
           <p>
            We really should widen up and give them the middle finger. Tyrannizing any religion with these leaders of bizarre over respect and entitlement is major mind control, propoganda.
           </p>
           <p>
            How many that are legit would do more good in a month that creates thriving independence and quality of life, than any of these puppets have done in decades??
           </p>
           <p>
            Just the many Ireland cases should be having this pope, clearly speaking up, out casting the pedi crimes and doing something. His doublespeak, guilt ridden, mixed messages are quite revealing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Llook at his list of priority meetings and with whom.

            The MSM sure cherry-picked the interview with the pope half to death, didn't they?

            His full comments regarding the media was this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The communications media have a very great responsibility. Nowadays they have in their hands the possibility and the capacity to form opinion: they can form a good or a bad opinion. The means of communication are the builders of a society. In and of themselves, they are made to build, to interchange, to fraternise, to make us think, to educate. In themselves they are positive. It is obvious that, given that we are all sinners, also the media can – we who use the media, I am using a means of communication here – become harmful. And the communications media have their temptations. They can be tempted by calumny, and therefore used to slander, to sully people, especially in the world of politics. They can be used as a means of defamation: every person has the right to a good reputation, but perhaps in their previous life, or ten years ago, they had a problem with justice, or a problem in their family life, and bringing this to light is serious and harmful; it can annul a person. In slander we tell a lie about a person; in defamation, we leak a document, as we say in Argentina, “Se hace un carpetazo” – and we uncover something that is true, but already in the past, and which has already been paid for with a jail sentence, with a fine, or whatever. There is no right to this. This is a sin and it is harmful. A thing that can do great damage to the information media is disinformation: that is, faced with any situation, saying only a part of the truth, and not the rest. This is disinformation. Because you, to the listener or the observer, give only half the truth, and therefore it is not possible to make a serious judgement. Disinformation is probably the greatest damage that the media can do, as opinion is guided in one direction, neglecting the other part of the truth. And then, I believe that the media should be very clear, very transparent, and not fall prey – without offence, please – to the sickness of coprophilia, which is always wanting to communicate scandal, to communicate ugly things, even though they may be true. And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia, it can do great harm. Thus, I would say that there are these four temptations. But they are builders of opinion and can construct, and do immense good, immense.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's an interesting mixture of the pope actually seeming to slam the MSM, while also revealing that he's way off course even of his own purported religion ("previous life", wut?), total nonsense ("every person has the right to a good reputation" - umm no, not every person, not if they have done terrible things), and also talking about if someone has already paid the price of justice (so like jail time, etc) which is not the case with pizzagate at all. So then all of this was cherry picked by the MSM to misconstrue it as "the pope says pizzagate investigators are shit lovers" in a nutshell.
           </p>
           <p>
            People should just be aware that smoke and mirrors are coming from all fronts. The pope himself is not only corrupt given what he stays silent about, but then also the corrupt MSM cherry picks and distorts quotes from the corrupt pope to spin even more. Corruption combo breaker.

              The pope is a fudge packer himself, that is most likely why he used these terms.  No respect for him or the other useless idiots and old boys club that run the lying catholic church

              This has been known about for decades, how catholic priests and nuns all over the world hurt and killed children, but as to OP's headline question that he knew this story was about to break, we will never know that. Why should we?

             You can't prove a negative is not true.
            </p>
            <p>
             From a professor of logic and specialist on the history of science:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "The claim is sometimes made that “You can’t prove a negative!” But that turns out to be false. When evidence that ought to be present if an hypothesis were true is not present, then the absence of evidence qualifies as evidence of absence. Suppose you were told there is an elephant in your living room. If you go there and find no indications of the presence of an elephant, you are completely justified in inferring that there is no elephant in your living room. " -

             To sort the stuff you need the tools of logic; which are deliberately twisted for manipulation of the public / society. The "Classical Trivium" is used to fool those who are targeted for domination.

             Just last night a correspondent on Facebook thought she knew the reasons around an event which may not have even taken place. She didn't realize she made an unjustified assumption, and just "went to the races" from there.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the process of logic "Who?" "What?" "When?" "Where?" comes before "Why?"

             Once a person has that belief any argument goes no where.

              I would argue that the bounds you've placed on the hypothetical elephant in the living room is such that the phrase "you can't prove a negative" is rendered moot based on the size of the Universe you're including (living room).  The phrase is meant to be used in situations where the Universe cannot be exhausted.  An example :  There are no purple alligators.  No matter how many alligators you look at, you'll never look at all of them.  Therefore you cannot explicitly state as fact, there are no purple alligators.  You can infer it but you can't be absolutely sure.  Hume said even the sun rising was not a sure thing.

               The "Sun coming up" is statistical. Some things such a "Newtons' habits of Nature" are statistical and not absolute.

              <p>
               Still when you notice such "laws" are being broken - such as someone walking through a wall, like Casper the Ghost, then you need to check yourself to make sure you are not asleep.
              </p>
              <p>
               The chance you are asleep or watching a cartoon, in that case, is greater than the chance someone is walking through a wall.

                 Yes. You know it's a dream when the ordinary rules of reality are not in effect. Sometimes it's difficult to tell the difference. It's true.

                  I'll need to ponder this. You may have a point.  I guess what I'm suggesting is when I am not lucid dreaming. the things I see, feel and experience see real to me.  I would even suggest that I feel more in dreams than I do in waking "reality".

               No problem. But the bandied about "Can't prove a negative" is just not true as a generalization.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sometimes lack of evidence points to evidence of a lack.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I still fail to see how lack of evidence relates to Pedophilia vis a vis the Holy Roman Church. Was the person trying to say that, lacking evidence of it [?], one might believe it's not happening?
              </p>
              <p>
               And now we get to the point of the importance of the erasure of evidence and the falsification of history to the big-time State criminals /perps.
              </p>
              <p>
               If something is omitted / erased , one does not know that. One will not even know *that something has been erased, since it is not there.
              </p>
              <p>
               (And why I argued in the rules thread for the inclusion of data, rather than the exclusion. Narrowing the data-field works for those who want to control the Investigation. I've seen it over and over. The large State perps know what they are doing and use the same techniques over and over. )
              </p>
              <p>
               Hence the importance, for these perps, of controlling history - and erasing memory. When they erase it, no one even knows or remembers it was erased.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe that's where "Can't prove a 'negative'" comes in?

              Excellent comment.  And with regard to the use of language in this pizzagate affair, the wording from the Washington Police Department in an exchange with a researcher on why they are 'debunking' this case, in my view, is very interesting.

            A few child rapists here and there are being prosecuted to placate the masses and downplay how pervasive it is.  I hope these guys swing from the gallows.
