<p>So the main point of import was the fact the conversation was speaking about bloodlines, 9/11, a tree house, the resurrection of Plato by way of the pyramids and Jack Parsons.  He said he had prepared a meeting between Winfrey and Wilcock, he had called Ron in Florida.  There was reference to &quot;Moon Walking&quot;.</p>
<p>Also that on 9/11 was a &quot;first&quot;, of it\'s kind event.</p>

<p>Lucifer appears as an angel of light, as Jack did in his formulations in producing the atomic bomb but the atomic bomb is a lie you see, for part of what I was told in 2008, was that people would go through the dualistic process until the new world is born, which is relative to our own technological advanced relating to AI technology.

<p>I have become death (ego) destroyer of worlds...  Taking on his &quot;multidimensional&quot; form.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with pizzagate?  Well, not only were the uranium agency parked outside of Pegasus Museum, which features on the cover of William Milton Cooper\'s &quot;Behold A Pale Horse&quot;...  Which we must speculate bares some relativity to the Uranium One Scandal...</p>
<hr />
<p>Also that, the mathematical representation of a vortex contains the 333,666,999 occurrence which Tesla said was the secret to the universe and indeed it is, he was not wrong in his surmising that he was in communication with Martians.  Indeed that is exactly what Jack Parsons was.  Remember, it does say 616 outside of Pegasus Museum owned by James Alefantis, CEO of Big Cheese LLC which is in possession of both Besta Pizza and Comet Ping Pong.</p>
<p>Inside of Besta Pizza you find The Sphinx and The Pyramids on the wall.  Upon the sphinx there is the &quot;Besta Logo&quot; which if meant to interpret &quot;The Beast&quot; then indeed, the besta logo as a mathematical vortex contains 666, not an evil number but rather related to the movements of Venus, who is the bright morning star, the obverse of Saturn (star of David) - a pentagram.  It\'s mathematically very beautiful, I can assure you.  The Star of David is the Quintessence of The Elements.  Above we find Air and Fire - Below we find Earth and Water.</p>
<p>So, now that we know that...  Let\'s take a look at Las Vegas, since it happened behind the Sphinx of Luxor.</p>
<p>Someone appears on 4chan prior to the event in Las Vegas, specifically saying that there is going to be an event which takes place which will mean an increase in security and a decrease of our rights.</p>

3 Oct 2017 - An anonymous post on 4chan seemed to predict a shooting in Las Vegas weeks before. The posts in the /pol/ forum, which were signed \'John\', speak of revealing \'a little secret\' before warning to stay away</p>
<p>Last Monday 2 October, Sheldon Adelson talked with President Trump at the White House about the Las Vegas mass shooting. The meeting had been scheduled before the shooting took place.</p>

<p>“The disclosure that Clinton Chair John Podesta transferred his shares in Putin-backed Joule Unlimited to an anonymous holding company when he joined the Obama Administration is extremely concerning,” said Donald Trump Senior Communications Advisor Jason Miller in a statement.</p>

<p>In summation, in December 2016, the NSA official Twitter account posted about John Podesta, saying Pizzagate was real. The account to originally retweet the original NSA tweet no longer exists.</p>

<p>In September 2016, Google took photographs inside of Comet Ping Pong and marked them with 93</p>
<p>93 is the equivalent of Thelema and Agape.  Thelema is the Will.
Agape is unconditional love.

<p>Agape was the Chapter of the OTO which Jack <em>P</em>arsons presided over.

submachine guns attack the farm during my remarks, we won't all die,
because I'll make a split-second decision lead us in a well-coordinated and
ultimately totally successful charge against them. This is going to be a

           but I think if we can survive the next month, it will be possible, maybe even straightforward to get our arms around this once there is an actual campaign. I'm definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it.

           In summation, in December 2016, the NSA official Twitter account posted about John Podesta, saying Pizzagate was real. The account to originally retweet the original NSA tweet no longer exists.
