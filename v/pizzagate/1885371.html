            Oh, this is a stretch, Seth Rich's commitment to voters access was profound, I don't think he was distracted from his mission by any kiddie diddling and I am concerned about this forum being distracted from its mission. Time to start a Seth Rich subverse.

             It seems to me that people are grabbing at anything they can to either discredit Seth Rich or his family.  If this doesn't work, let me see, how about that.  I am tired of this and agree we need to stop this and just get back to work.  Are some people trying to keep us busy in another way?  Think about it.  Yes, there are people that are sincerely good at heart.  I am sick and tired of Seth being torn down.  There could be the reason of politics as well.  Some people just don't like that he was a Progressive and loved Bernie Sanders. There seems to be a witch hunt of sorts imo.  Just Sayin'.

             I don't see how this is at all distracting.  People are looking for connections.  Even if none are to be found it keeps the interest in Pizzagate going.  So that is good.  You seem to be in a minority on this

             I'm not sure either and I'm certainly not making accusations of him doing that to kids, but they could have had anything on him to blackmail him. I just don't buy that this young kid had this level of access to data without him being trusted.

            I saw this too. I'm certainly hoping we will see more emails. Am I correct that he said the remaining emails in question cover the exchanges that occurred right after pizzagate broke?
           </p>
           <p>
            I still cannot shake the thought that Seth was maybe part of this group (Podesta and pals) and then turned at some point. Anyone with an IT background knows the guys with access to the data know ALL. Why would they let someone who they couldn't trust near their servers? They wouldn't. And... if they were trying to make him an example wouldn't insiders need to recognize the hit for what it was to be afraid of ending up like Seth? I think they fully intended to scare the rest of the minions they have abused and blackmailed by killing Seth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, I'll point out again that Seth was killed and lived a very short distance from Pegasus museum. It could be nothing, but what if Seth went here before he went home?

             I don't think Seth had anything to do with Podesta and pals. We know they speak in code and have been doing so for decades. I think they've been getting away with this for so long they got careless. I don't think they ever thought Seth would connect email codes to anything, and I don't think Seth did connect the codes to anything. Seth's girlfriend said she thinks Seth uncovered an elaborate scheme by Hillary and company to get Hillary elected at the primaries. THAT'S why he gave the emails to wikileaks, and that's why he was killed. That poor man had NO IDEA what he stepped into, or WHAT he was up against.

              Your thoughts also seem credible to me. I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary. However, I think there are multiple angles to consider at this point and I feel it is necessary to be open to all possibilities. I see a lot of the same posts over and over, but I am only really interested in whatever the truth is. Regardless of how he ended up doing it, the little information we do have seems to indicate that Seth did an amazing thing before he was silenced. His actions were heroic in my book. And even if it turns out he didn't have the best moral character or he made mistakes, I don't care. He was a human who was gunned down. He deserves justice.
