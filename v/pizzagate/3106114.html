<p>If you see a crime, there is nothing wrong with you acting in good faith to report it. This shouldn\'t be used frivolously, on the other hand you are allowed to be a concerned citizen. You are not allowed to investigate crimes yourselves, but you are allowed to investigate probable cause surrounding anything suspicious. You do not have to have all the facts. The law enforcement agencies use news articles as their starting point all the time.</p>

<p>If you know a specific jurisdiction, you can write a letter and send it to the appropriate agency. I\'m leary of promoting this idea to people who would abuse it, so I have gone back and forth between showing what that is supposed to look like. This isn\'t something that should be done on impulse. You should be explaining the facts as you see them.</p>
<p>This isn\'t something you slap together and fire off. It can be easily used as a political tool... <em>cough</em> David Brock <em>cough</em>. On the other hand, the easier this is made for people, the more will do it. Frivolous reporting is unfortunate for everyone and I don\'t want to be accused of any wrong doing or of leading a movement that was intended for abuse.</p>
<p>That being said, this is an IRS Whistleblower form looks like: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f211.pdf">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f211.pdf</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind, a law firm triggered a Congressional hearing with one of these, where they are asking for $40 Million dollars of a potential $400 being recovered. If you explained your evidence, you might not get the reward, but you would bolster the case.</p>
<p>I can show you plenty of samples, but, on the other hand; if you submit this form, you had better READ AND UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE THING because you better be able to say you acted in good faith and you legitimately saw a problem and, preferably, can specify which law was broken supported by business records; which are good enough for court and can be acquired through subpoeana by any interested party in a court case. This limits your liability. Keep your evidence to business records or authenticated pictures; meaning you know where and when the picture was taken and under which context.</p>
<p>The process I am talking about needs to be a conscious act. You have to thoughtfully will it into existence to get results.</p>

<h1 id="md-the-database-is-the-key">The Database is the Key</h1>
<p>A decentralized collection of these spreadsheets allows for a potentially large database that completely circumvents censorship, where your data set can get incredibly focused and find unnoticed details rapidly. You can augment your intellect and take the guesswork out of fact checking.</p>
<p>A keyword database can be used to auto-assign keywords from other articles, because good tagging is what will make it the most useful. With enough data and resources, it would be very easy to create a Linkurion database just like the ICIJ; only better.</p>
<p>But it all starts with the 3 spreadsheets.</p>',

           The Database is the Key
          </h1>
          <p>
           A decentralized collection of these spreadsheets allows for a potentially large database that completely circumvents censorship, where your data set can get incredibly focused and find unnoticed details rapidly. You can augment your intellect and take the guesswork out of fact checking.
          </p>
          <p>
           A keyword database can be used to auto-assign keywords from other articles, because good tagging is what will make it the most useful. With enough data and resources, it would be very easy to create a Linkurion database just like the ICIJ; only better.
          </p>
          <p>
           But it all starts with the 3 spreadsheets.

'Digital attacker' to delegitimize Trump's presidency by emboldening opposition

            "Shareblue, formerly called BlueNationRising, was purchased by Brock in 2015 and rebranded the following year. The confidential memo shows how Brock plans to use Shareblue as the "nucleus" to disseminate information to the public to damage Trump and his allies.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We will delegitimize Donald Trump's presidency by emboldening the opposition and empowering the majority of Americans who oppose him," the memo states. "Shareblue will be the dynamic nucleus of a multi-platform media company that informs, engages, and arms Americans to fight."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Shareblue is positioned to frame opposition research from American Bridge and other progressive groups, as well as leaks and intel from Democrats on House and Senate committees, in our signature punchy, emotive style—and disseminate it directly to our followers in a daily inline persuasion campaign.""
