<p>No, you sure can\'t. And here I thought Jones winning had to do with the smug ignoramus Charles Barkley\'s endorsement, but that\'s me.</p>
<p>I really didn\'t believe there were irregularities in the election. I figured the smear tactics won out, but then I saw a tweet giving the outrageous number of dem voters this time around ... and now this. Why would a court think it in the best interest of Alabama to destroy records? Why?</p>

<p>In final-hour order, court rules that Alabama can destroy digital voting records after all</p>
<p>Alabama is allowed to destroy digital voting records created at the polls during today\'s U.S. Senate election after all.</p>
<p>At 1:36 p.m. Monday, a Montgomery County Circuit Court judge issued an order directing Alabama election officials to preserve all digital ballot images created at polling places across the state today.</p>
<p>But at 4:32 p.m. Monday, attorneys for Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and Ed Packard, the state administrator of elections, filed an &quot;emergency motion to stay&quot; that order, which the state Supreme Court granted minutes after Merrill and Packard\'s motion was filed.</p>
<p>By granting the stay, the court effectively told the state that it does not in fact have to preserve the digital ballot images - essentially digitized versions of the paper ballots voters fill out at the voting booth - created today.</p>
<p>The court will hold a hearing on Dec. 21 about whether to dismiss the case outright. By that point the state will have had ample time to destroy the digital ballot images legally under the stay.</p>

            I just saw Roy Moore myself on my tv news say military votes have not been counted.  So he is waiting for the Final Results.  I too thought things had been finalized but not according to him.

             Military votes are not electronic.
            </p>
            <p>
             This ruling has to do with electronic votes. That's the bulk of what put Jones over the top. And did you see the video I just added to the original post? It conclusively establishes cause for charges of voter fraud:

              Yes, if they voted and should not have, they committed Voter Fraud.  But, what age are these people?  Are they College Students?  If they are attending College out of State then they are still allowed to go home and vote.  Could be the Dems paid for them to travel back or they made that trip by themselves to return and vote.  I remember volunteering last year and it was a big deal for us to get out there and remind College Students to get home to vote or register at their school.  If these were College Students then it may just be legal. Also, if their trips were paid for that is also illegal.   BUT, if not, I agree that an Investigation should Be Launched Immediately.

            And the records will not be destroyed, can't be destroyed, until results are certified.  That could take at least two weeks . . .or more . . .if irregularities are found.   All votes have be counted . . write-ins, provisionals, overseas, military, absentee.

             The electronic votes are what put Jones over the top. And there were 230,000 more of democratic electronic votes in this election and in the mid-term election.

             v/politics
            </a>
            . you have already posted one thread about this with an attempt to make a tenuous link to planned parenthood that really holds almost no water. if you are enamored with politics post it in
