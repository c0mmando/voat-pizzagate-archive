The boat was anchored off the east end of St. Thomas in Christmas Cove, next to St. James Island and nearby is Little St. James.  The Bouis\' claimed it was an ideal location to snag boats from St. John and St. Thomas that were passing through on daytime trips, as well as long-term charters.  &quot;You can order your pizza on your boat\'s hand radio, call it in via cell, or even email it.  Then you can either pick up the pizza in your dinghy, or Pi will deliver it to you if you\'re anchored in Christmas Cove.&quot;  On a busy day, the Bouis\' claimed to have 30-40 boats stop by.  The couple also catered private events.</p>
<p>In 2015, Pi was ranked as &quot;the best restaurant in St. Thomas,&quot; on Trip Advisor.</p>
<p>About the Pizza Pi owners:</p>

</p>
<p>In 2018, Sasha and Tara Bouis sold their pizza boat.  Just like that.  Suddenly. Their whereabouts are unknown.  The new owners are Heather and Sam Samelson, who had this to say:
&quot;Never during our many visits to Pizza Pi did we imagine that someday we would call it our own...Our daughetr, Becca, had worked on Pi, and our family and friends all became raving fans of Pi.  Having recently sold a successful software business and now spending more time in our home-away-from-home, St. Thomas, it seemed that the timing might be just right.&quot;</p>
<p>Samelson\'s background:</p>
<ul>
<li>

He is listed as Strategic Advisor of Golf LIfe Navigators, &quot;assisting in expanding the company\'s capabilities as Golf LIfe Navigators continue their quest to provide innovative ways to connect consuers with the private club of their dreams.&quot;</p>

<p>So, the Pizza Pi boat remains in business which certainly appears to be booming in the waters of the Caribbean.

Just in case anybody is interested...This Sunday, July 28, from 11 1m - 6 pm, there is a Christmas in July Party at Christmas Cove and raft yourself to the Pizza Pi to celebrate the end of a season.  The new season kicks-off November 2019.</p>',
