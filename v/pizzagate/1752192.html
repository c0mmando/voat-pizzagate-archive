Especially in light of the missing DC girls (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/comments/1745638">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/comments/1745638)</a>) and the fact that the DC Police seem to have no good answers and are even making light of this issue, I thought some exposure of the DC Police and their history would be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It has been alleged that a hacker was able to find child porn on the protected section of CPP\'s website and submitted it to the police on 12/1/16, with no action taken by police despite this extremely strong evidence: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1640039">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1640039</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The false-flag shooter operation (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1461475">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1461475)</a>) occurred three days later, with the story evolving from &quot;no shots were fired&quot; (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1461897">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1461897)</a>) to &quot;one shot was fired&quot; to a &quot;magic bullet&quot; somehow went through a padlocked door and hit the computer in the other room in a way to perfectly damage the hard drive [evidence of CP] on the computer (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1474026">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1474026)</a>). The fact pattern makes this incredibly disturbing, but any thinking person knows that a citizen who is truly concerned about children being held as sex slaves would not fire a gun indiscriminately when these same children he is trying to save may be hidden behind the door he is shooting. The whole idea is ludicrous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know that the DC Police lied when they asserted that they investigated Comet Ping Pong. This was proven when a FOIA request (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1525587">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1525587)</a>) forced the DC Police to reveal that they had not conducted ANY investigation despite their public claims, repeated by the LSM, that they had investigated the concerns raised here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The newly appointed Chief of Police for DC (Peter Newsham) appears to be a pedo protector. He is a friend of Comet Ping Pong (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1486167">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1486167)</a>),  having stood by in community support in a photo op…despite conducting no investigation of what we have uncovered. He has a documented history of abuse of power, including alleged domestic abuse and the charging of an 11-year-old victim of gang rape with filing a false report despite the finding of multiple samples of semen on her underwear (<a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/221018540-story">http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/221018540-story)</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was reviewing stories of DC police officers, Marc Washington and Linwood Barnhill, who were actively involved in the production of child porn and in sex trafficking of children. The few locally-produced stories reveal a strong pattern of corruption within the DC Police and a lack of curiosity by the media to actively pursue these stories to reveal the extent of the corruption and coordinated efforts by the pedos who hold power.  This is relevant to pizzagate because a big part of the problem is that law enforcement agencies have been shown to be complicit in covering up these kinds of cases, or, at a minimum, attempt to limit the &quot;damage&quot; of these cases within their own departments. The documentation below also reveals a very low level of interest by the media in exposing these cases and the truth. </p>
<ul>
<li>This article (<a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Police-Officer-Arrested-for-Production-of-Child-Pornography-234261121.html">http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Police-Officer-Arrested-for-Production-of-Child-Pornography-234261121.html)</a>), from 12/3/13, discusses the arrest of Marc Washington on child porn charges involving a missing child. It is the start in a series of arrests/articles that show a pattern that even a seven-year-old detective would recognize.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Police are working to learn whether there may be additional victims, they said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above claim was never supported as Washington\'s camera included 100s of photos of victims, some of whom were clearly minors, yet this angle in the investigation never received any further progression.</p>
<ul>
<li>This article about the arrest of Linwood Barnhill (<a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Two-DC-Cops-Under-Investigation-Another-Arrested-234651521.html">http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Two-DC-Cops-Under-Investigation-Another-Arrested-234651521.html)</a>), from 12/5/13 furthers the story with the following quotes:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A D.C. police officer is being investigated for allegedly “pimping” teenage girls, police sources said, but there\'s no indication that investigation is connected to another officer who was just arrested on child porn charges…In a press conference Friday, Lanier said this investigation is not connected to the Monday arrest of another D.C. police officer on child porn charges. In that case, officer Marc Washington, who has been with the department since 2006, went to the home of a 15-year-old girl who had previously been reported missing, ordered her to remove her clothing and took photos of her, all while he was on duty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this investigation not connected to the other? The fact that the involved officers were taking nude pictures of missing children (a common thread) and pimping them (sex trafficking)…and that they all worked in the same 7th District…gives no indication that these cases and officers are connected in their pedo crimes? The DC Police have to bend over backwards to avoid discovering that these cases are likely highly connected and involve multiple parties…as at least three were identified very early.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During a hearing Thursday, it was revealed Washington, 32, had hundreds of photographs on his digital camera dating back to 2011, many of which depicted women who were victims of domestic violence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote above illustrates the systematic abuse of power by the police of victims of domestic abuse and children who go missing. It also reveals a lack of pursuit by the police and the media to discover who these other victims were, some of whom were identified to be minors. I could find no future mention of the effort to uncover these victims and bring justice related to their cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>This article (<a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Cop-Accused-of-Child-Porn-Gets-House-Arrest-234791831.html">http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Cop-Accused-of-Child-Porn-Gets-House-Arrest-234791831.html)</a>), from 12/6/13, provides evidence of a broader pedo conspiracy by the DC Police that was ultimately swept under the rug by the police department and non-curious media.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Another D.C. police officer is under investigation for possibly tipping Washington off about his forthcoming arrest earlier this week, according to sources, although Lanier would say only that that officer has been placed on no-contact status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous quote shows that the corruption in the DC police was not limited to just one or two individuals and seemed to be part of a broader conspiracy involving others who worked to protect their pedo friends. Also, I could not find any evidence that this other DC officer was ever discovered and revealed. Predictably, there seemed to be no effort by the media to chase down who this other pedo conspirator was as the media will simply reveal the limited information that makes it to them...rather than dig on their own...and will only make these revelations involving those in power if it has approval from TPTB.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This article (<a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Police-Search-for-Missing-Person-at-Hains-Point-235329281.html">http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Police-Search-for-Missing-Person-at-Hains-Point-235329281.html)</a>) on 12/10/13, is about the very questionable death of Marc Washington in the water at Hains Point,  four days after his release for bail. No one seemed to ask about nature of his death and whether it could have involved murder by one of his implicated co-conspirators, something any homicide detective would pursue, especially since at least three cops had been implicated in a potential pedo ring. The lazy article did not even attempt to mention the cause of his death and the possibility that it was a homicide. The online article shows that it was edited four months after initial publication, so why did the author/editor not chase down what happened with the third implicated officer or what was discovered of the victims, some who were clearly minors, who had been found in 100s of images on Marc Washington\'s phone? I did a comparison using archive.org and could not even find a change from 4/21/14 (update date) to the original article as archived on 12/12/13.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This article (<a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Ex-DC-Cop-to-Be-Sentenced-for-Pimping-Teen-Girls-278629421.html">http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Ex-DC-Cop-to-Be-Sentenced-for-Pimping-Teen-Girls-278629421.html)</a>), from 10/9/14, reveals  the following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The judge said she accepted the light sentence -- Barnhill faced a maximum sentence of 24 years -- primarily to protect the victims\' privacy, News4\'s Mark Segraves reported, but also because Barnhill didn\'t abuse his police powers in committing the crimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote above shows systematic corruption at the judicial level. How is it that Officer Barnhill did not abuse his police powers when &quot;a search for a missing 16-year-old girl led officers to his apartment&quot;? Only in an alternative universe would the justice delivered and underlying justification given make sense to any rational person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A third officer was also under investigation for possibly tipping Washington off about his forthcoming arrest. All three officers were employed in MPD\'s Seventh District, law enforcement sources said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above quotation shows that neither the police nor media had any interest in getting to the truth about this &quot;third&quot; police officer who attempted to aid and abet his pedo friend. This article was written over 10 months after the original arrests and story broke, yet it had the same claim that a &quot;third officer was also under investigation.&quot; How could so much time have passed without resolving who this other officer was and their role in the police pedo conspiracy? Why did NBC4 (the author of all these articles) not pursue or follow up on this issue with such basic questions as to why the third officer was &quot;still being investigation&quot; nearly a year later?</p>
<p>In these cases involving the political elite or law enforcement, the answer is simple: The effort is to minimize the damage, cover up what can be hidden, and move on.</p>',

           The previous quote shows that the corruption in the DC police was not limited to just one or two individuals and seemed to be part of a broader conspiracy involving others who worked to protect their pedo friends. Also, I could not find any evidence that this other DC officer was ever discovered and revealed. Predictably, there seemed to be no effort by the media to chase down who this other pedo conspirator was as the media will simply reveal the limited information that makes it to them...rather than dig on their own...and will only make these revelations involving those in power if it has approval from TPTB.

             ) on 12/10/13, is about the very questionable death of Marc Washington in the water at Hains Point,  four days after his release for bail. No one seemed to ask about nature of his death and whether it could have involved murder by one of his implicated co-conspirators, something any homicide detective would pursue, especially since at least three cops had been implicated in a potential pedo ring. The lazy article did not even attempt to mention the cause of his death and the possibility that it was a homicide. The online article shows that it was edited four months after initial publication, so why did the author/editor not chase down what happened with the third implicated officer or what was discovered of the victims, some who were clearly minors, who had been found in 100s of images on Marc Washington's phone? I did a comparison using archive.org and could not even find a change from 4/21/14 (update date) to the original article as archived on 12/12/13.

           </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The judge said she accepted the light sentence -- Barnhill faced a maximum sentence of 24 years -- primarily to protect the victims' privacy, News4's Mark Segraves reported, but also because Barnhill didn't abuse his police powers in committing the crimes.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           The quote above shows systematic corruption at the judicial level. How is it that Officer Barnhill did not abuse his police powers when "a search for a missing 16-year-old girl led officers to his apartment"? Only in an alternative universe would the justice delivered and underlying justification given make sense to any rational person.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            A third officer was also under investigation for possibly tipping Washington off about his forthcoming arrest. All three officers were employed in MPD's Seventh District, law enforcement sources said.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           The above quotation shows that neither the police nor media had any interest in getting to the truth about this "third" police officer who attempted to aid and abet his pedo friend. This article was written over 10 months after the original arrests and story broke, yet it had the same claim that a "third officer was also under investigation." How could so much time have passed without resolving who this other officer was and their role in the police pedo conspiracy? Why did NBC4 (the author of all these articles) not pursue or follow up on this issue with such basic questions as to why the third officer was "still being investigation" nearly a year later?
          </p>
          <p>
           In these cases involving the political elite or law enforcement, the answer is simple: The effort is to minimize the damage, cover up what can be hidden, and move on.

            So how easy is it for a cop to pull up to a kid on the street, tell them to get into the car, they are police after all, and NO ONE bats an eye because it is the police.  They dont take the kids to the station but a drop off.  Think about how easy that would be, crazy simple, way to simple.....

             Right. The stories in this post show that a third police officer aided Marc Washington, tipping him off that they were going after him. This is how they work. The tip allowed Washington to start deleting incriminating photos, and the story shows that this happened. Yet, 10 months after the initial arrests and story, they are "still investigating" this other officer. The fact that Washington ended up dead soon after posting bail fits the pattern (eliminate dangerous witnesses), yet the idea of murder was not even mentioned in the articles. The pedo rings work to protect themselves, and the unquestioning mockingbird media will only report what they are told...with no initiative to investigate further or ask the obvious questions.

             Interesting. I had the same question.  For some reason people tend to get more disgusted when the victims are girls, so if it takes awareness of that element to get more people to join us, we will take it .

            You expect Newsham to help these kids?  He locked up an 11yr old girl that said she was gang raped, medical evaluation showed abuse.  He never went after perps even with DNA evidence.  Then he makes police chief.  He's in thick with dirty people.

            excellent collection of info.  Show this to everyone in your family.  There is so much shadowbanning and shills this movement needs to be grassroots.  Get your family, your church, organization into those.  I woke at least four family to this craziness in the last few weeks.  This display of evidence is very compelling.  Its obvious the media will not show this and the DC police are not going to investigate.

            Very good post. I have come to the realization that the DC police are a big part of the "elite" pedo ring. Now who will arrest a police department? FBI? They have a pedophile as director. DOJ? Again pedos all up in that shit. It leaves people who seek justice and truth with nothing to fight back with. Well almost nothing.

            and what actually have you uncovered as it relates to comet? "weird" and "creepy" art? "tunnels" that aren't there? "CODE WORDS" not a single piece of legit evidence has been produced by you twats. not a single victim or parent. not a single witness, on site or anywhere else. All you have is a bunch of retarded theories. THAT's why there has been no investigation. The whole Comet angle is a a total farce. Meanwhile kids are being trafficked across the ohio and indiana turnpike  at truck stops by INDIVIDUALS. up and down the east coast corridor by INDIVIDUALS and MS-13. dumbasses.

             So the finding of child porn on the CPP website, behind the protected login section, does not qualify as evidence? How about the fact that the little girl with bags under her eyes, who was repeatedly tagged as #carisjames in instagram posts that depicted her being taped to a table, in a room that has all kinds of evidence of abuse (

             , the last image posted of her on 1/31/15), and with many questionable posts and comments (#hotard, #chickenlover)? Where is she now and is she alive and healthy...unanswered questions. What was meant by the "killroom" post (

             </a>
             ), tagged with #murder and "just rinse if off when your done"...all normal seeming and not concerning in the least? Why do the "kid-friendly" bands (

              http://heavybreathing.net/

             </a>
             ) that play at CPP "welcome all ages" when they have heavy pedo messages and imagery throughout their musicYouTube, posters, and communicationsJPG? Your are right...noone of this warrants an investigation. Oh, by the way, it is kind of hard to bring out legit evidence in the form of a victim when the victims are children who are still trapped...or worse (dead/eaten). We should all just move along.

              So the finding of child porn on the CPP website, (FALSE STATEMENT) behind the protected login section, does not qualify as evidence? How about the fact that the little girl with bags under her eyes, who was repeatedly tagged as #carisjames in instagram posts that depicted her being taped to a table, in a room that has all kinds of evidence of abuse (

              , the last image posted of her on 1/31/15),(PARENT OF THIS CHILD HAS COME FORWARD REFUTING CLAIM AND OBJECTING TO MISUSE OF HER IMAGE) and with many questionable posts and comments (#hotard, #chickenlover)? (SUBJECTIVE INTERPETATION NOT ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING) Where is she now and is she alive and healthy...unanswered questions. (NOT TRUE) What was meant by the "killroom" post (

              </a>
              )), tagged with #murder and "just rinse if off when your done"...(FRIENDS JOKING PRIVATELY, INNAPPROPRIATE, YES BUT NOT EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY) all normal seeming and not concerning in the least? Why do the "kid-friendly" bands (THIS IS A LABEL THAT PG "INVESTIGATORS" HAVE APPLIED TO THAT BAND. THE WHOLE "KID FRIENDLY" THING WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. CPP IS A DAY TIME KID FRIENDLY RESTAURANT THAT TURNS INTO A ROCK CLUB AT 10PM BUT STILL HAS ALL AGES SHOWS MEANING IF YOU HAVE A DL OR STATE ID OR ARE WITH AN ADULT YOU CAN ATTEND THE SHOW (
              <a href="http://heavybreathing.net/">

              </a>
              )) CREEPY ART YOU DO NOT LIKE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF A SEX CRIME) that play at CPP "welcome all ages" AGAIN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT AN ALL AGES SHOW IS APPARENTLY when they have heavy pedo messages and imagery throughout their musicYouTube, posters, and communicationsJPG? (THE "HEAVY PEDO MESSAGES AND IMAGES" ARE YOUR SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION,YOUR PROJECTIONS, NOT FACT, AND ARE NOT EVIDENCE OF A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY. Your are right...noone of this warrants an investigation. (NO, IT DOES NOT CERTAINLY NOT BY PROFESSIONALS) Oh, by the way, it is kind of hard to bring out legit evidence in the form of a victim when the victims are children who are still trapped...(HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS? HOW ABOUT EVEN NAMING A SINGLE VICTIM, OR HOW ABOUT A SINGLE PARENT COMING FORWARD AND MAKING THESE CLAIMS? IT HASN'T HAPPENED. or worse (dead/eaten). (NIGGA PLEASE) We should all just move along. (CORRECT)

             Calling people twats won't get you far here but I essentially agree here and understand the frustration. Everyone is talking about this "hack" of CPP as if we have proof that it actually uncovered something. All we have is someone's word and some screenshots of a cop emailing him. And I'll say it again and again... Illegally obtained "evidence" will not be permitted in a court of law. IF it exists and was turned over to LE, it was probably thrown into a big folder marked "inadmissible". How can they possibly accept it? How can they know the person who hacked in didn't plant the CP there? Not that I'm convinced the hack even happened at this point, but I digress.

             Focusing on CPP is doing this community no favors that's for sure. Truck stops could definitely turn something up though. I'd be willing to bet money that it does. You specifically mention the Ohio and Indiana Turnpike. Got any leads? My guess is wherever you see heavy drug trafficking you'll see human trafficking since it's often gang related. Our time would be better spent on investigating these places most local to us and gathering and comparing info on here.

             His handling of the 11-year old victim of gang rape should have been more than enough to disqualify him for the position, let alone even being a cop. He should have lost his shield from that case.

            Wonderful. I also think as we look into DC police it will dawn on people to look more closely at how their own local police might be involved in  human trafficking and/or pedogate. Franklin coverup outlines how it really only takes a few compromised key people to keep the lid on the ring and keep pedogate going for decades. I have always kept this thought in mind as I research pedogate

             Yes. It is systematic. They often have their inside protectors. Sometimes, they can be blatant in sending the message that "we have you covered if you are a pedo," as evidenced when the actual police badge has the universally-recognized pedo or boy-lover symbol:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1612852">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1612852
             </a>
             The irony is not lost that LA County, which has the pedo logo on the Sheriff's badge, is home to Hollywood.

              After all, Hollywood the pedo haven has to be protected by those wearing boy lover badges! They sure do like to rub into our face don't they! - But something tells me, they will soon change the design!

             Depending on when you search, sometimes #missingdcgirls will produce results from today (not mine) and others it will show the most-recent tweet being two days ago!! I just tested this and replicated that the results vary, favoring not showing anything for the last two days.

             Thanks. I am literally being censored on Twitter in the effort to socialize this post. First, they blocked me and asked for my phone number (has happened before). I then noticed that I had zero response to my tweets. I searched the hashtag (#missingdcgirls) and was not surprised to see that none of my tweets showed in results, and the last tweet showing is from two days ago. You WILL NOT find me there despite many tweets about an hour ago. Please help spread the word as Twitter is actively stopping me from trying. It also looks like they are blocking this tag overall in an effort to keep it from trending.

              you can get around this by replying to other people's posts and putting in the # or simply replying to people with huge followings with things like, have they found the #DCGirls.  Things to stir up interest, where lots of people look.  It's time to go rogue and manipulate the system.

               Change your tactics often. Get creative, imagine this is the greatest marketing plan ever put into place.  Some are posting pics with quotes on pinterst.  Try instagram.  Show evidence, not loony remarks.  This tsunami  is just taking off.

                Same here! They are sensoring it big time and given what we saw from Vault7 - we know their capabilities - yet on same twitter pedophilia content is rampant! Nice going. Makes you wander whether we should book tickets to another planet - wait, there might be pizza lovers too.
