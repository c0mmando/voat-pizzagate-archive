            Voat is a goat. Should be obvious that it's control. But so many are in the fantasy land that reddit sucks so the goat is great because they don't censor. And when they do censor it's for the good of the community.  But they have free speech... as long as that free speech stays within the guidelines. Goat apologists... They are usually the ones that fawn over Israel and call everyone antisemitic. And censoring Saudi Arabia is obvious as well since they are the UN Human Rights leaders, and allies of Israel, NATO and the USA. So we obviously can't involve them in this mess. But there's no censorship and free speech is everything here. Until it isn't.

             The only narrative that mod's allow is the the NYT narrative that CPP is center, and that its HQ for clinton to fuck children at satanic party's. This narrative is bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate is about 8 million missing children worldwide and investigating where did they go.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most children in DC that dissapear go to Saudi to be fucked and become household pets (slaves) then post 14 they're shipped to ISRAEL whore houses. Then their organs are harvest after they're warn out the Organs passed back to the world via Tel-Aviv.
