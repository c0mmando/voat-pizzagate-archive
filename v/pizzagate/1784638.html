<p>First of all, I do realize that Anon5 keeps referring to Pizzagate as a psyop.  Consider the fact that he\'s saying that Brock used Pizzagate to cover up the actual pedo ring on the East Coast, mainly the network and the network that connects the east and the west coasts.  We have gotten phenomenally helpful information from this poster, and I think it is a good idea to consider that fact.  Also, keep in mind that the psyop ended up being a bust because we are focused on finding <em>everyone.</em></p>

<p>Here are the main branches of it(others exist, but these are the Big ones):</p>
<p>1) East Coast. (CPP/PG was done to distract from Podesta/DNC/Open Society emails, allowed Brock to get revenge on a Lover &amp; stop people from looking into the East Coast part of the pedo network).</p>
<p>2) West Coast. (If you want to stop the International Network connections for both the EC &amp; WC......look for/at Boats that also use sound proofing &amp; secret compartments)</p>
<p>[The Blue parts of the 2016 Election District Map really show the Networks(Drug,Trafficking(weapons &amp; people),Pedo), so I would recommend you look at that map and start connecting the Blue parts &amp; seeing the patterns.]</p>
<p>Networks are like Arteries &amp; Veins, sending stuff into/around different parts of the networks Domestically importing &amp; exporting. Domestic Networks are connected to International/Global Networks importing &amp; exporting.(West Coast connected to Canada,Mexico &amp; Asia importing &amp; exporting)(East Coast connected to Canada\'s &amp; Europe\'s importing/exporting)</p>
<p>Much like UPS/FedEX/Amazon/Walmart, [Trafficking networks have DISTRIBUTION CENTERS that service a large areas/regions.(Such as clusters of Blue Districts)]. If you bust those, you can bring down whole Regional networks. Distribution Centers are the Heart of the networks, they rarely get discovered because people only focus on the networks themselves interms of busts, not the rest of the Logistical needs(Large buildings like Warehouses,Vehicle/Vehicle types, Routes,etc) of operating big Networks.</p>

            Can i remind everyone that a lot of pg attention came from wikileaks social media posting podesta emails alongside the fbi symbols factsheet. This is since WL is believed to be compromised and started posting bias on social media. Not the usual leak but citing mainstream sources and unusual writing style etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now is WL is truly compromised this enforces the theory the whole comet pingpong theory is part of a psyop.

            Then let's go to work on finding them.  Anon5 also made it pretty clear that the human trafficking networks and the drug trafficking networks are the same.  Same with other networks of illicit activity.  Traveling through sanctuary city areas in a network that flows from coast to coast to coast.

             Incredibly dumb? You are missing the point. These areas in these states are located in the major shipping ports for the US. Washington, Oregon, Cali, Florida, NY, Texas, Chicago via Lake Michigan...I do not find that dumb but more strategic.

             I mentioned this possible connection earlier.  I've since done some research into those closed Walmart stores that have aroused interest and suspicion highlighted by several YT posters for their increased security/secrecy
             <a href="https://youtu.be/FFXYxwdgFnc">
              https://youtu.be/FFXYxwdgFnc
             </a>
             . I found a map of these closures which seems to tie in well with Anon5's maps and those stores still open make for even greater coverage of area
             <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/01/15/walmart-to-close-269-stores-in-us-and-abroad/78840020/">
              https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/01/15/walmart-to-close-269-stores-in-us-and-abroad/78840020/
             </a>
             A bit of research into their history reveals that HRC has very close ties with Walmart and was on the board of directors between 1985 and 1992 and is very close with Walmart's owners the Walton family who were contributors to her campaign fund in 2016.  Her close ties with Walmart were brought into question by Bernie Sanders and others last year:
             <a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/17/hillary-clintons-wal-mart-ties-breed-mistrust-amon/">
              http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/17/hillary-clintons-wal-mart-ties-breed-mistrust-amon/
             </a>
             . Wiki listing describes how their listed stores do not include their many distribution hubs and they have sites and connections that span the globe and would present a ready made logistic solution for the movement of goods/people
             <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart">
              https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart
             </a>
             . Maybe Walmart is worth closer inspection?

            Anon5 is just some dude who spends far too much time in his mom's basement.  He can't spell and is not the sharpest tool in the shed.  People should not be taking anything he says seriously.

             His 2016 comments were pretty intelligent.  He was like a young Theodore Dalrymple with worse grammar.  I have no idea if his new stuff has any validity though.

             Also, he has an archived trove of information on 4plebs from past threads.  All the way back to September 7th, 2016 giving information of the goings on inside the system.  Do check it out yourself, the archive is linked.  Surely they can't all be coincidence.  Happy reading, you've got about 2-3 hours worth.

            Has anyone looked into railroads like CSX? I just thought of this because it would be easy to make rail cars sound proof, there's already proof this has been used before, easy to ship containers overseas and the hubs seem to match the election map.

              It is horrifying. And also used internationally. Trying to think of other distribution type centers with large storage type facilities that can be used. Besides Amazon, FedEx, UPS, rail cars, airports, shipping yards, or food type of industries, I can't think of what else it can be.

            The only way pizzagate and CPP is being manipulated by the likes of Media Matters, is the portrayal of pizzagate as a child sex ring run by Hillary and JA out of comet pizza. They didn't want this to come out, but when it did, they said, 'ok this info is out, how can we obfuscate.' So they made it sound as ludicrous as possible. When we know, that CPP is just a piece of evidence, in a huge network is connected pedophiles and criminals.

             They debunked it because Hillary doesn't run CPP.  She benefits from it.  It's most likely allowed to operate by the Deep State... who gets their way through blackmail and placing the presidents of their choice in office.  Fucking John McCain ran for president vs. Obama in 2008.  Deep State owned that election 100%.

             Well, my understanding about that particular conspiracy theory is that many walmarts have tunnels that connect to one another and large bunkers under them.  if that is correct, you might have something there.

             The thing about the Alex Jones apology is that people took it as his retraction of the existence.  I think mostly what he ended up doing was realizing that Pizzagate is just a finger on the hand that is Pedogate and instead of lobbing off a finger he's going straight for the wrist.

             I'm willing to bet that leaks like this could give some true facts/leads while also saying that Pizzagate is a distraction so that because one thing they said is true it makes the rest of the things they said seem true as well.

             <em>
              after
             </em>
             the connection was made.  Anon5 seems pretty sure of it that Brock used Media Matters to prop up the pizzagate stuff to get back at his ex lover and also distract from the bigger habbenings on the east coast.  Wanted us to focus on CPP.  He even mentioned at one point in the thread that we are still focusing on CPP.  I don't feel like that is the case, but it must be the general consensus from up above for some reason.

              Brock has been pictured with Alefantis since they broke up, they don't seem to be enemies. (picture here from 2015)

             <p>
              Secondly, Brock, by way of Pizzagate investigations, was found to be laundering money, particularly via the Bonner Group. So, he's not really propping anything up.

               I see where you're coming from.  And I think it's important to be skeptical.  I think it's also important to consider the notions without accepting them.
              </p>
              <p>
               For example...look at the climate of things the last year or so.  We have a new thing every month that everyone is talking about.  Who is to say that pizzagate wasn't set to disappear as well?  The comet false flag is a perfect example of that...it happened and then silence.

              My thought as well.  Anon5 seems to suggest that it may be more than one person.  And same with the figurative cucking of Jared.  Kept saying shit about "notice how Jared is in the spotlight and she's nowhere to be seen"

             So they are fighting to keep being "sanctuary cities" cuz deporting illegals would dry up the rape-able children market and probably have some snitches start talking about where the kids are being kept, along with letting police/feds get more aggressive with searching for even possible illegal citizens? If I was a smart man looking for these distribution centers I'd start looking for pedo/hooker bust in certain cities/areas with mass illegal immigrants and map them out and see if they relate in a certain area. then maybe google map it to see if I can find a building that matches a description in the OP. Too bad I'm not that smart

             Now you are starting to think about it. Also I even said in the OP, look for Clusters of Blue Districts because a Disturbing Center is going to be providing for all of them.

              Fishing boats have insulated, partitioned holds to keep the fish on ice, which probably would be more soundproof than other layouts.

            There is something with his writing style that strikes me as odd. Look at his use of capital letters where they do not belong. His capitalization on distribution centers. I have not seen his prior posts, is this just his writing style or specific to this post? Or is he directing us somewhere specific in code?

               True.  I am wondering if maybe Ivanka, with her Human Trafficking work, is going to turn out to be one of the bad guys too.  Right under ol Donnie's nose.

                 Whether by his choice or by someone else's.  I'm starting to get antsy about this, so let's try to focus.  What's the best way to move forward with the information given to us by Anon5?  We need to start working.  Too many of us just sit here and chat about pizzagate but there aren't a whole lot that seem to be doing a lot of work.  Let's get moving.

                   Sounds good.  I need to get myself one of those white boards and some string.  And a printer.  I can't make these connections in my head, and the FBI seems to do well using those string boards lol.

                    I have done investigative work on the side for about 6 years. My system uses color coded index cards/paper and paper clips. Card color groups names of people from one group or a single person when working missing persons cases.  When I make a connection to another group or person, the paper clip matching the other person's card color goes on the side of the card. Easily stashable and private. I have been amazed at how easy it is to miss a connection without a good set up.

                    I plan to cross reference the pageant and modeling agency people with the names found on fucking creepy site from a few days ago.
