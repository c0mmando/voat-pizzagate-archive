            Completely agree. Get to the bottom of it. He also will have answer. His point is about "killing the messengers" Who gets to decide? If everyone believes this will not be exposed you are wrong.

            This is meant to scare and intimidate others who know the truth into silence. By all means, for anyone who knows nothing about these connections, he provides some factual information, but George Webb is not to be trusted. Those who are knowledgeable about the connections, crimes and parties involved, and have followed his videos since Day 1, have noticed his bizarre omissions, mixed misinformation, dilution of justice and accountability, and vast paradigm shifts as he gauges what is being believed and what is not being believed. The entire series started about Eric Braverman, and continues to shift to whatever will keep the fabrication moving forward. He is working backward to justify the heinous crimes and corruption that has created a world of despair and tyranny.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do they have surveillance programs and a list? Is he scaring people so that he remains the front man for the citizen investigation?  Is it all closely controlled? Is he creating a list of those who watch his videos? Yes to all.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to believe Alex Jones, Roger Stone and George Webb care about you and are actively seeking justice and accountability, you are too easily manipulated. It is better than reading the NY Times and Washington Post, but they are giving you false hope and mixed misinformation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is this simple - either the law exists or it doesn't. Either equal protection exists or it doesn't. Anyone buying time and leading others down false avenues should have their motives and credibility questioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Trump and Jeff Sessions begin indicting officials who we know have committed criminal acts, then there is hope. Until then, everyone is being lied to and misled.
           </p>
           <p>
            We cannot wait for justice much longer. Many of us know the real truth. The truth has always been known. The threat to those in control is common global knowledge of the truth. That is the purpose of the bunkers and space shuttles, the illegal surveillance programs, the new global government, and the militarization of police. They know they can't hide the truth forever, they can only muddy the waters enough to obfuscate it while the change their strategy.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are afraid of a real, honest, and charismatic George Webb, and the real truth becoming common global knowledge. What would the world do if everyone suddenly had a revelation that they were lied to and controlled by a small number of evil and criminally corrupt elite?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is all a facade, and pizzagate is the closest humanity has ever been to the real truth.

             Agree with you completely except for the scare tactic, they are keeping track of those watching his videos. That is the ultimate scare tactic to prevent people from watching certain things.  There are huge archived pages of this investigation as well. Pulitzer Prize journalists contributing who have passed contributing.  Patriots contributing, citizens contributing. Govt. insiders contributing.
             <br/>
             He is the voice but only the messanger.
Might not be "all the message" yet but keeps going.
            </p>
            <p>
             Information is better for everyone. Then freedom to decide. "Monitoring" is the scare tactic.
That is the point. Naive to think this is not applicable to everyone.
