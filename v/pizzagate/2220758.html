            Hoffman's number was found in the possession of a French prostitution ring.  The French Amfar Galas may very well be elite sex rings.  I doubt this particular  instance is even close to the worst he has done.

             Do you have a link to any of that info?
             <br/>
             Would be interesting to read.

             Dustin has always been an unlikely leading man.
What the victim describes is very much like Clarence Thomas' constant
and gross sexual references to Professor Anita Hill, actually.
But add in the power play in asking for foot massage.
And "ass-grabbing."
A little man able to dominate a woman.

             Actually, we can see from some of the male victims also reporting
physical sexual abuse that the "trauma" they suffer is very much 
like what the women suffer.  Really no  difference.
            </p>
            <p>
             In order for males to sexually abuse women, the ability of women to
protect their children has to be destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's the role the war on women has long played in de-powering women.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In that sense, women speaking out is part of the "Women's Movement" but
also they are being joined by men speaking out against these men whom we
all fear

            I'm starting to see a pattern here. I almost wonder if we are being false flagged by Hollywood. It seems as if they almost led this charge themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know how these people work. If there will be opposition they absolutely plan to lead it so that they can control it. If there is no opposition they will start it themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            So far these have almost all been cases of "inappropriate behavior" between adults with a few saying that they were approached when still a minor. The cases are many years old and the statute of limitations has probably run out on most of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know that child abuse happens every day in Hollywood and that they keep an entire stable of minors for the specific purposes of sexual abuse and monarch programming. Nobody has come forward yet and said, "This is a list 23 minors that we know are being abused yesterday, today, and will be tomorrow. Here are their names. This is the names of the abusers. Here are the details of what we know."
           </p>
           <p>
            It hasn't happened. I suspect the people involved in the serious and current stuff are being watched very carefully, paid off, and threatened daily. The "outing of Hollywood depravity and child abuse" surface has not even been scratched yet. Will it be scratched?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are we being false flagged? Are a few adults most of whom will never be prosecuted "taking one for the team?" Hollywood oozes money. They can easily pay off a few pissed off adults.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm suspicious.

             Upvote. It's a Hollywood Gambit! The crisis looks scripted! They are pre-empting possible upcoming revelations in order to keep control over the narrative. And when the real pedo bombshell falls eventually, it will pile up on a small mountain of more or less substantiated stories &amp; accusations of sexual misconduct. A desensitized, short-attention-span public is more likely to shrug it off with "oh, no these Hollywood types again". While the pedos themselves will dismiss it as a Russian disinformation and Putin's conspiracy against America. The gameplan is I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy.

              As much as you might like to ignore it ... this isn't just about pedophilia because these children
can't be turned into victims of pedophiles if they have strong Mothers to protect them.
De-Powering females is one of the first goals of patriarchy.
Women are the natural protectors of children.
Males are our sexual abusers of children - confirmed even by right wing women's 
organizations/Family Research Council.
And this is part of the long time and on-going war on women.

               The contemporary city-dwelling white woman, at least in America, is a predator and is fundamentally unwomanly by all historical standards. What we are witnessing is the simultaneous effect of liberal religiosity and the intrusion of Capitalism into the sexes' relationship. The millennial men-women courtship has been replaced by a calculating, clear-eyed sexual marketplace, replete with inferior and normal goods, economic margins and the general violence and backstabbing inherent to the Capital. Women are not marrying up: they're f***ing upward, and the Pedowood actresses are leading the charge. All that counts is the pure Capitalization on one's own sexual market value. Everything else has vanished. Don't blame patriarchy for this.

                Armed --
Presumably you're judging the American woman today by Victorian standards ... or the "Hammer of Witches" protocol for the behavior of females?
               </p>
               <p>
                Are you acknowledging the need for women to work to help the family over the last 30 years or more as Elites took control of the government and economy for their benefit?
               </p>
               <p>
                Don't know what you mean by "liberal religion" ... unless it is making clear that organized patriarchal religions/Christianity exist to underpin Elite patriarchy.
               </p>
               <p>
                The most under-discussed subject in this nation and throughout the world is male violence.
And, male sexual aggression -- including the fact that MALES are our sexual abusers of children.
               </p>
               <p>
                Hollywood is controlled by MALES who have long run the "casting couch" and you're blaming women
for it?
               </p>
               <p>
                In patriarchal societies, women's lives are worth less than a males.
You can see the effects of that all over the world on women's lives, children's lives 
and the reality of male domination in these societies where men hold power by
violence.
Don't blame women for that.
               </p>
               <p>
                Have the courage to face reality.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just when did women burn men at the stake?

               There is a much bigger war - on normalcy and human decency. Men are not the only one to blame for the current state of moral degeneracy in the US. The pervasive pornography, the online hook-up culture, the open relationships, the polyamory and cyber sex have become widely accepted practices by both men and women. None of these abused children went to Pedowood Central on their own. Virtually all of them have been brought there by powerful, ambitious, fame-crazed mothers, ready to anything to see their 8 year old in a movie. Yes, the pervs and the pedos are men. Yet, the enablers are women and they are as guilty as those men. American "females" are not de-powered. But their power has been hijacked by your ruthless political and cultural elites. Women have been turned into a consumerist workforce. Their neurosis have been used against them for profit. Their sexual power, exploited as a marketing tool as it has turned progressively from procreational to recreational. This is now the norm and a right. While your rulers' biggest trick is to sell you this as a "liberation". In fact, it's a form of enslavement, which leads to societal chaos and destruction.

                It is organized patriarchal religion/Christianity which escalates the war on women 
in the "Hammer of Witches" and Witch Burnings ... which aren't the beginning of 
their war on women, but the attempt to totally de-power women by preventing 
them from having any rights whatsoever in patriarchal societies ....
If you don't know the history of this, then do some reading as all rights to 
inheritance of any kind were taken from women, including the right to their
own children.  Even into the 1970's women couldn't get a credit card on
their own or buy a home on their own.
               </p>
               <p>
                Agree with you on pornography -- do you really think that organized industry is run
by women?  Do you think Comcast and Verizon which makes tens of Billions from
the porn industry every year is run by women?
               </p>
               <p>
                Pornography is simply organized propaganda against women as difficult for
women to respond to as it was for "blacks" to respond to "Whites Only" 
drinking fountains, or Jews to respond to Hitler's right wing propaganda.
Pornography is about encouraging sexual violence and disrespect for 
women and it's available even to 11 year old males on the internet.
               </p>
               <p>
                And, I guess you didn't notice, but it's MALES who are becoming addicted
to this pornography -- in ways which are causing them to lose their 
marriages, their family life and their jobs.
               </p>
               <p>
                You have some strange illusions about Pedowood ... and a selective memory
as all of those named as abusers are MALES.
               </p>
               <p>
                But ... Sadly, you're right, women and Mothers have too often trusted men 
in business and personal relationships.
And we often see this in situations where Step-fathers are sexually abusing
children.  It's one of the most common crimes of INCEST in the US.
Not to mention Fathers sexually abusing young daughters/sons.
Daughters are the most frequent victims -- over 80% ... males about 12%.
               </p>
               <p>
                And here you make clear that you are speaking for organized patriarchal religion...
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Their sexual power, exploited as a marketing tool as it has turned progressively from procreational to recreational.&gt;
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Female sexual attraction has only been exploited by males ... in pornography
and in every other way possible.
Where is the female mirror image of a Hugh Hefner.  There is none.
Where is the female mirror image of an industry which equals the harm
done to women by pornography?  There is none.
Where is the female mirror-image of a Vatican devoted to matriarchy?
               </p>
               <p>
                Presume your final rant is about the Feminist Movement .... and liberalism...
               </p>
               <p>
                The only enslavement this nation is being set up for is fascism....
               </p>
               <p>
                Let's make clear that organized patriarchal religion stands against democracy,
against freedom of conscience, against separation of church and state ...
and against a free press.
In other words, the Vatican and Christianity is for fascism.

                The Vatican Propaganda Machine: The Spanish “Civil War” Lesson
               </p>
               <p>
                From George Seldes, the “dean and granddaddy of investigative reporters,” when it comes to issues important to the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, “… there is no free press in America.” Seldes’s extensive study of the Spanish Civil War and the related control of the American press by the Catholic hierarchy is exceedingly instructive for all who are concerned about this freedom.

                In 1931, Spain became the Republic of Spain, a liberal democracy that separated church and state, ended State monetary support for the church and adopted the principles of Freedom of Conscience, Freedom of Religion, and Freedom of the Press. The Vatican feared for the Church’s very survival in Spain. There had been four insurrections since 1835, and it was the Spanish people, the poor workers and poor peasants, who burned the churches because they blamed the hierarchy for having persistently backed the upper class. The latest uprising against the Catholic Church took place throughout the country in July, 1936. One historian described it as “the work of masses of common people, a spontaneous uprising.” The Vatican feared that the liberal democracy with its freedoms would spell the end of the Church in Spain.

                 You seem desperately stuck in the wrong paradigm, sister. I know, it's not your fault that you went to a "progressive" American college. I'm sorry to see what they have done to you.
The relevant split is not men vs. women. We are all in this together - divided and conquered, I'm afraid. The real war is between those who rule and those who are ruled. It's by and large gender neutral, but you'd never be able to see it that way. 
Just to give you an example. You correctly identify Hollywood and the porn industry as being run by males.  And?  Who are those "males"? Do they happen to have something else in common, besides their "maleness"?  One problem with feminists is that they have made their mind already. Inevitably, their analysis starts and ends at appearances and  generalities. 
Another problems with feminists is that they are spoiled children with deep-seated issues, which they exorcise by parading their psychological dramas in a Victimhood Fantasia.
Again, none of this is your fault. Throughout history, when a civilization becomes fully immersed in its decline and decadence, the inhabitants, for want of needs to satisfy, feel the urge to free themselves from the natural order of universal laws and human realities. Feminism is one of these absurdities. Peace.

             Yes well it also give s the impression that it happened many years ago, but not now.  'Also many or most are at the almost adult age, well, she or he was almost 18, so not really a minor.  I just commented this the other day.  They also pick those ages to get a slap on the wrist or a wink wink.  There have not been any 3 or 4 year olds  or 7 to 10 or young teens.  Just a couple.  We know there are many more.  I think it is getting pretty obvious that this becoming somewhat of a dog and pony show.

             I too find it very strange that its all really old stuff, and in the greater scheme of things well... I mean, acting like a dirty old man embarrassing and harassing a 17 year old is not decent at all, but its not totally horrific either like abusing children. Its kind of like they are trying to get people used to it in increments so if something big and more relevant does come out everyone will just go "ho hum... just more of hollywood boys behaving badly."

              It's old stuff because at that time it couldn't have been reported or accepted
with any seriousness.
Even now, we see ongoing attacks on the victims and their stories.
Presume you're also commenting on situations which you haven't yourself experienced.
One of the questions about these "patterns" is whether any of this is connected to MKULTRA programs.
And looks like Hugh Hefner and Playboy may have been part of the creation.
