            I agree, and I'm sorry more don't. I really do think there would be better focus if we didn't post every fucking story of pedophilia or trafficking that makes the news. Besides showing how real it is, it really serves no purpose here. Start a new sub focusing on these issues. This sub should be, "this perv was arrested, here is how he/she is possibly connected to the world governement ring."
            <br/>
            But that won't happen, and your post will probably be deleted.

            I think the people here do an amazing job, its time for people with authority and influence to step it up, or step down and get out of the way. This is an American horror story for real and it needs to exposed and handled.
