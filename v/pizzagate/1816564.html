            Armyseer have you ever heard of a French revolutionary by the name of Robespierre? No? The following is NOT a threat. I harbor ZERO anger towards you or wish you any harm whatsoever. I'm merely providing this bit of European History because evidently you've never taken a European History course in your entire fucking life and aren't aware of the parallels within our little online "interaction".
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_Robespierre">
             Robespierre
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Robespierre was the inspiration behind the French Revolution's Reign of Terror. He was the first one to pull the handle on the Guillotine, to "Pull-It" if you will tee-hee. Would you care to guess who was one of the LAST of the 16,594 to receive a "close shave" during the Reign of Terror? ...........That's right, Robespierre.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you know why? No? He wasn't into letting people "plead their case". Some of the 16,594 were totally innocent and had been falsely accused. Robespierre was kind of like a Joseph McCarthy with longer hair. Both men lost their credibility and in Robespierre's case their life because no one likes vindictive fucks who don't listen to reason. :-D

            This is PA stunt to distance the relationship between trump and wikileaks. If you haven't noticed, Wikileaks have gathered the narrative that they are working for trump, this notion is of course false.

            maybe charging Assange would help get him out of the embassy. He can't stay stuck there forever. If he is charged and can be released on bail it might be better for him. Nobody has said what the charges would be. Could be little slap on wrist or something that is dismissed altogether. Besides, there is no proof JA is even in the embassy anymore and then who is going to explain that?

            "Trump team turns on WikiLeaks"
           </p>
           <p>
            Possibly. Given Gary Cohn of the Vampire Squid is part of Trump's cabinet I could easily see Trump being driven back into the fold.
           </p>
           <p>
            But. BUT Gary Cohn and the Vampire Squid and Wall Street can see the hand writing on the wall. The Deep State is dying folks. If we little peon people can see it from here then it must stink to high heaven from where those guys are sitting.
           </p>
           <p>
            So my take on events is Trump turning on Wikileaks is just part of the current takedown in progress. Trump can't be seen as sympathetic to such an enemy the Deep State has in Wikileaks. The same thing happened with the 59 Thomahawk missiles fired into a Syrian Air Base without hitting anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've got to remember The Vampire Squid got to where it is through smarts AND cunning. If they don't get on the right side of History they're dead men walking and that might even be literally dead man walking. It depends on how much "French Aristocracy" they have in their blood.
           </p>
           <p>
            You may have noticed Lynn Rothschild did something similar about a month ago when she tore John Podesta a new ass-hole on Twitter. She's got to put as much distance between her and the Deep State as she can before the house of cards falls in on itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            As always I could be wrong, Trump may have been turned. He is a billionaire after all. Time will tell. Nothing would surprise me either way to be honest at this point.

            Robert David Steele claims there is a video of Trump raping and murdering a child. That is a pretty substantial claim against the president.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either Trump is compromised, or Robert David Steele is lying, or both. Robert David Steele also claims that Reince Priebus is gay, and that Priebus, Paul Ryan and Scott Walker are hiding deep, dark secrets involving Pizzagate and Criminal Corruption with elite Republicans. We do know that Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus are covering up the cesspool of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption in their home areas of Kenosha and Racine, Wisconsin. Trump still has not distanced himself from either of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why Racine, Wisconsin is a barometer for all involved. It is a known, indisputable cesspool linked to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. We need to pressure Trump for an open investigation into Racine, Wisconsin. This is the way to prove whether he is compromised as Robert David Steele claims, or if he really will Drain the Swamp and Restore Law and Order.
           </p>
           <p>
            Signs point to Trump being compromised either through videos, money or threats against his family. News to Trump - innocent victims, witnesses and families in America are being stalked, retaliated against and threatened for knowing about Pizzagate and Criminal Corruption in Racine, Wisconsin. Is your life and family more important than other lives and families? Does the rule of law exist or not? Does equal protection exist or not? We know Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus are corrupt or complicit to criminal corruption. We know Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe and the FBI are corrupt or complicit to criminal corruption. We know Robert David Steele is claiming Trump to be a child rapist and murderer. We know Racine, Wisconsin is a hub of criminal corruption. What is Trump going to do about it?

              If Trump is compromised, they will do anything to silence Assange. He is the biggest current threat to global corruption. Why would they target a publisher, instead of investigating what he published? Why isn't Trump shutting down the NSA, or using the NSA to Drain the Swamp of corruption within American government first? Why hasn't Trump fired Reince Priebus? Why hasn't Trump called for a special prosecutor for Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative? How much time do you want to give Stonetear and friends to bleach the remaining evidence?
             </p>
             <p>
              Everything so far points to Trump playing ball and making deals with the devil. They will find a few fall guys and claim to have Drained the Swamp. You don't get to his stature without compromised integrity, and it is likely that he cares more about his hair than the Rule of Law. We need to force Trump to show all of his cards,and what he has shown thus far is that he is either corrupt or compromised. The swamp of Racine, Wisconsin will show everyone that Trump is a Fake President who has zero intentions of doing anything about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. From there, we can all align with Ronald Bernard, Julian Assange, or anyone else willing to stand up for the real truth, and begin to Drain the Swamp ourselves.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you can't trust the Clintons, can you really trust their friend Donald Trump? If we know the Clinton Foundation is involved in trafficking and racketeering, and we know Hillary Clinton, Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin may have committed treason, where is the progress? Where is the grand jury? Where are the indictments? Why isn't he speaking to the people telling them he is making progress and going to hold criminal officials and their associates accountable? Why doesn't he just confess that the NSA, CIA, FBI, DOJ and DHS are all corrupt and working to protect corporate interests instead of the people of America?
             </p>
             <p>
              There is no law in America, and there is no equal protection under the law. Those who swore to uphold it are abusing the law under the color of law. This is called tyranny. Even if Trump is not corrupt or compromised, do you think Trump is going to fix global tyranny by himself under threat and duress? He needs a clear path and a push off the ledge, and that path starts in Racine, Wisconsin.

               Well I agree 100%. ( except that corruption is everywhere. Your insistence that Racine is the most corrupt place is somewhat alienating to others who see and experience corruption elsewhere and are equally deserving of Justice. )

                You are right - corruption is everywhere. Racine is just a very weak link to the entire system that can start the domino effect and link to all of the other corrupt communities across the nation and globe. This is not an anomaly. This is a rigged corrupt system of blackmail, bribery, racketeering, collusion, control, fraud, embezzlement, trafficking, and murder. Not trying to alienate others, trying to establish a model and example that can create a domino effect throughout the world. What we know 100% is that Racine, Wisconsin is absolutely a cesspool and swamp linked to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and that the FBI, DOJ, NSA and other agencies have failed the American people in removing the system of criminal corruption that has infested our communities and is now controlling the entire world (or attempting to through a global kleptocracy).

            <p>
             Do you really think he meant that? I think we'd have heard about such a video way before now if in fact it existed. Trump winning was a total surprise to the Deep State. They wanted Hillary Clinton to win so they could avoid the exact can of worms we've all seen very publicly opened in front of 350,000,000 people for the past six months.

             I'm guessing Robert Steele is just putting out disinfo because a takedown is in progress, more 3d chess.

              Who would make up such an extreme and specific accusation particularly about the president? It is suicidal. What if it is just to gauge reaction and to prove no ones cares? What if Hillary was too much of a liability, and Trump was the way to 'Drain the Swamp' by putting a fake front man in office much like Paul Ryan is the front man to cover up the evils in the Republican establishment. What is Trump is the path to cleaning up the mess and destroying the momentum of the revolution, much like Timothy Dolan cleaned up the mess in the Catholic church and covered up widespread abuse. Trump will add to the divide and conquer program, and is compromised in so many ways already, whether Robert Steele's video claim is true or not.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Trump was the real deal before elected, which is extremely doubtful, he surely is not anymore. If Steele's claims are disinfo, let's find out. If George Webb's claims are disinfo. let's find out. The one thing that is 100% not disinfo, is that Paul Ryan is covering up a cesspool of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption in his home district of Racine, Wisconsin. We need Trump to prove he is not a compromised and corrupt puppet by forcing him to produce indictments in Racine, Wisconsin and being unraveling the system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

               I hear what you're saying. Half of me thinks Trump has been bought off or worse like his kids threatened or something God awful like that. I think you're underestimating the 2nd Amendment though. The whole reason it's there is to protect us from what the Deep State is doing. I don't own an assault rifle nor wish to. I think words carry much more power. But I'm in the minority. How many own assault rifles? It's a lot. Sand Hook was a hoax and it shows how scared these people are of assault rifles. They know their Goose is Cooked.
              </p>
              <p>
               Basically if Trump doesn't fix the problem eventually about 10,000,000 deplorables with assault rifles will. There is no other choice. We no longer have a Government. We literally live in a Fascist and/or Totalitarian security state. I don't understand why you think that's not a factor in whether the Deep State comes down or not. The only thing I can think of is you're not American and you haven't read the 2nd Amendment.

                You underestimate the military industrial complex and overestimate the will of the average American.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is more complicated than the threat of the 2nd amendment, and as we can see, our rights are already compromised. Fake news is an attack on the 1st amendment, Sandy Hook and other events are attacks on the 2nd amendment, and laws and practices violating the 4th amendment are now common. This is why they have militarized local police forces and provided surveillance tools. They are prepared, and fellow Americans are increasingly apathetic. They are disorganized. They have families and lives to worry about.
               </p>
               <p>
                The key is information and communication. We need to show America that Trump is either corrupt or compromised. We need to show America that cities like Racine, Wisconsin are a modern form of slavery, tyranny and oppression. We need to show how the nation and world have become a Kleptocracy ruled by faceless corporations with zero accountability. This is why they are making such a push to control information and communication through approved parties - Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is a race to control information and AI. Once they have that, any hope is gone. Plan B and C involves underground bunkers and space exploration. Don't pretend they won't start a nuclear WWIII to avoid the uprising of the masses.
               </p>
               <p>
                Force Trump to show his cards by putting the spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin. From there, we can either begin to Drain the Swamp the right way, or we can create a call to action to organize the masses and take back control of our own world.

                 Don't worry. If you worked in the high tech industry you'd realize we're a long way from the machines taking over. I'd guess at least 1000 years. We still can't build a decent operating system and Computer Science just regressed back to Javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We went from C++ to Java and/or C# and back to Javascript. That's like going from a BMW 7 series to a Mercedes S 500 and then back to a 1984 Volvo SE station wagon. You have no idea how bad it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What you're really talking about is living in a High Tech Police State. That's different. To defeat that all people have to do is realize Muslims aren't the problem, the Deep State is. Vault 7's release did just that. Everyone knows now. It only seems quiet to you right now because Trump has been given 6 months to start the Deep State takedown. I'm about 95% sure the Deep State won't live to see 2018. If it does we'll just have to wait for people to catch up to the Truth. That will happen, there's no question. It's all over but the cryin'.

                  Correct - speaking more about AI in terms of information flow and surveillance. Also, are you sure they wanted to defeat the Taliban? The Deep State will shift their strategy and even if dissolved or reorganized, the kleptocratic agenda at the top is not going away. New puppets replace old puppets. New foundations replace old foundations. Waiting and putting any faith in Donald Trump, Google, Facebook, and James Comey are risky bets. Every day that passes allows them to cover up more evidence, control the narrative, and get rid of more witnesses. George Webb (Sweigart) has some interesting ideas about JTTF that seem logical, whether he is controlled or not.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Let's hope you are right but hedge that bet at every angle including pressure on Trump to openly investigate Racine (and other known areas of corruption that are all linked together), and then follow the domino effect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. If he is not going to start at the top, then we need to pressure him to start at the bottom and keep going up the chain. When will the military and police force wake up and not allow themselves to be used against the citizenry they swore to serve and protect? They may have voted for Trump but will they ensure he follows through on his promise to Drain the Swamp and Restore Law and Order? Why aren't more people coming forward from the FBI, DOJ, NSA, DHS, CIA and other agencies? Are people really ready to stand up and fight to take back control, or do they not even care to?

                  <p>
                   That's like saying why aren't more business in New York's Little Italy going to the police about being forced to pay protection money to the Gambino Crime Family. Yeah it's a little bit of a stretch but close enough. I think when people feel certain that Trump is on our side they'll come forward in great numbers. In fact it will be a massive flood. Right now James Comey and Andrew McCabe are gumming up the works. That's going to change I think pretty soon.

                   Yes. There is no question in my mind. All you have to do is look at the crowds that went to those Trump rallies.

            Yeah, this is the first thing Trump has done that I downright hated. WTH is going on? If Trump doesn't agree with this, he better distance himself from it and get these yahoos in line.
