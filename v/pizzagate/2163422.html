            don't you think if they were "totally forced by Scopolamine" to do it, like, a few of them would come out and say it happened, i mean, that's essentially sexual assault. if they really had a conscience why keep silent while this happens to kids just because of a video you could argue you were drugged and forced for? i'm not articulating this well, but what i mean is basically wouldn't anyone with a conscience take the risk of losing that court case over letting these people

            infiltrating your local ANTIFA, which is run by brainwashed authoritarian extremist liberals who smash windows is a lot easier for obvious reasons than say, infiltrating the cults of generational criminal ruling families with centuries of experience in secrecy, betrayal, and murder.

            Great idea in my opinion. We have nothing to lose in these days. Soon we will all be owned or dead. Who was it that said "we had all better hang together or we we all surely hang separately" ?

            I think physical infiltration and internet hacking are very powerful tactics, but I think combining the two is the best effort. Use high tech to physically enter their spaces.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tiny hidden cameras, drones, hidden audio mics in suspected meeting areas, gps trackers, key loggers installed on suspects, all of the standard spy stuff mixed with today's tech and your bound to find something eventually.
           </p>
           <p>
            Visit your local lodge, plant something and wait. Plant deer hunting HD cameras in the woods during this up coming Halloween. (get ready this time of year is when a lot of stuff happens and the sociopaths get bold)
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember to have back ups of your collected data, cloud and teammates to pass it on if you get in trouble. Kill switches to go live with it. Etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this day and age the walls have eyes, ears, and everything else. Utilize tech and infiltrate. The roachesbhave to come out from under the fridge sometime.

            I couldn't find where it was listed, but I know at one point it there was an official pizzagate policy against being a vigilante. This had a lot to do with the false flag gunman. Any mistake you make would reflect poorly on the whole movement.

            Another note, this was not Stephen Crowder's first undercover video.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here he is crashing a low level pro-union protest.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmNyzvH7H3c">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmNyzvH7H3c
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are two videos where he pretended to be a woman and didn't get caught.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUDtoDAGVE8">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUDtoDAGVE8
            </a>

             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Gcmnmz5S0
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He has pretended to be a disabled socialist and no one recognized him.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjcD4ZBagZA">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjcD4ZBagZA
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He had gone undercover several times in situations that weren't life threatening. He had experience. He had staff to help him with make-up, and escape plans if things didn't work out. My point is that if you were to do this, you need practice and you need help. Just showing up at a satanic temple or child sex ring is not an adventure for an amateur.

            that would be impossible. they aren't as stupid as antifa. you have to go through initiation rites and blood ritual. are you willing to do that? i'm not. there are many who have left the cults and spoken about them.

            Agreed, and completing this task would be nearly impossible anyway. There's a very good reason why these groups make its members disrobe and stay naked or wear a cult approved frock during the ritual ceremonies - this prevents any hidden camera and audio equipment.

            It would be great if this were possible, but it would take years to get into the innermost circles where the most vile things happen. It would be easier to infiltrate the disgusting Furries, which may lead to much darker activities in different groups.

            @ pizzagate007 ,
           </p>
           <p>
            I "get" it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your username says it all.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've been watching a lot of James Bond movies. You're an enthusiastic boy scout who wants to go out and slay the dragons, stop the bad guys, and defend the little people against the forces of evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            OTOH, people who want to go out and perform difficult and dangerous tasks usually do a little searching before they post things to a serious discussion group. And they
            <strong>
             definitely
            </strong>
            should do some searching and thinking before they actually meddle with seriously nasty people who are known to kill inconvenient witnesses (think: Seth Rich, Monica Petersen and Michael Hastings.)
           </p>
           <p>
            A little searching would have shown you how these people screen out investigators:
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's just one example, as related by Nick Bryant, who wrote:
            <em>
             The Franklin Scandal-A Story of Powerbrokers Child Abuse &amp; Betrayal
            </em>
            in 2009:
           </p>
           <p>
            '
            <em>
             The improbable prime mover in my nexus with the state troopers on Highway 81 was a conversation I had in July 2002 with a magazine editor, who said he was looking for “very dark” stories. Never having shied away from dancing in the dark, I pitched him a flurry of stories whose themes included Satanism and Nazism. He resonated with the Satanism angle. I had a simple plan: ferret out Satanists, attend a black mass, and write an article. Over the next month or so, I talked to a gamut of Satanists—not surprisingly, I found them a rather unsavory lot. I quickly discovered that they were either very, very smart or cognitively challenged. Punk rockers are the only other group I’ve encountered with such a marked gray-matter polarization, which I discovered while working as a bouncer at a club in the early eighties.
            </em>

           <p>
            '
            <em>
             I eventually drifted toward a “sect” of intelligent Satanists—I’ve always preferred intelligent and unsavory to slow and unsavory. Anthony was the first of the cerebral Satanists I met. He was fond of black: black blazer, black shirt, black pants, and even black socks and tennis shoes. He, like the other Satanists I came across, was a Republican. It struck me as ironic that Satanists and fundamentalist Christians—groups embracing antithetical religious doctrines—generally share political affiliations.
            </em>
            '
           </p>
           <p>
            '
            <em>
             I evidently impressed Anthony with my knowledge of metaphysics, having studied philosophy in college, lived on the ashram of a genuine Indian guru, and attended groups dedicated to Gurdjieff, Krishnamurti, Zen, and Sufism. Our philosophical and metaphysical conversations ranged from Nietzsche to Eastern mysticism.
            </em>
            '
           </p>
           <p>
            '
            <em>
             After Anthony and I talked four or five times, he consented to take me to his sect’s version of a black mass, which is patterned after the mass of Roman Catholicism. He only had one condition, and it was nonnegotiable: he insisted I partake of the “host.” The host, in Anthony’s sect, is a floury wafer that contains the high priest’s semen and the high priestess’ menstruation. Anthony and I parted ways.
            </em>
            '
           </p>
           <p>
            And if Nick Bryant had gone on to the visit the black mass, before they let him start to find out about the deeper things within the cult, he would have had to perform a criminal act that would make him blackmailable. It's the same method the mafia uses to screen out wannabees and cops: to get in, you have to be "made" ie, commit a crime that they could use blackmail you.

           <p>
            So how could someone
            <strong>
             actually
            </strong>
            get inside info from these people? For real as opposed to action-flick fantasizing?
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/SoldierofLight">
             @SoldierofLight
            </a>
            that hacking could be a good way to go, for someone who has the skills (I don't.)
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think that the old gumshoe technique of finding someone who wants to leave the cult and encouraging them to reveal secrets is good. This can involve a lot, especially to keep them safe, but it has been done.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's an example of a woman who successfully left and Illuminati bloodline family:
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            She faced a number of threats on her life, and had to go underground. She left the illuminati cult about 20 years ago, and was still alive a few years ago, in spite of what you read on the blog set up by a friend of hers:

             Not that difficult to get into a real Satanist party. Accidentally walked into 1 once without realizing it. Almost went to a Vegas fashion show with only Satanic images. Changed my mind when I saw the blatant symbolism. You know there were lots of after parties at the small hotel. Maxim early Halloween Party in Vegas will also have private after parties. Any gay men want to go with me? I'l cut out early.

            This video is bullshit limited hangout. They are ligitimizing that Antifa is real, when in reality it is a manufactred organization with  staged bullshit funded by George Soros. It reminds me of the phony elevator recording of the CNN employee saying they knew the Trump Russian thing was BS, but they continued with it for ratings. Total nonsense. They are Deep State propaganda directed by the CIA, not a biased unprofessional news opperation. This video acts as if Antifa is a ligitimate but violent organization. Fail. And fail of you for posting this.

            No. You don't show up in person, you don't sign up for shit. You hack into one of their livestream members-only pay for view broadcasts and you bounce that footage to someplace enough people will see it that they can't pretend nothing happened. They probably broadcast their horror shows at night, so if you're mirroring the signal to normies, hopefully, no kids will be watching. And then you run like hell because they will hunt you down.

            What youre describing is the Holy Grail of evidence, and it could only come from an identified front location or somewhere affiliated with one, and since it is a demonstrable fact that no one does that better than me, then i guess yall made a big mistake labelling me shill.

            Pretty sure their whole structure is designed to prevent infiltration. Part of the reason for all the torture/rape/murder etc., in the first place is to force people into compromising positions so they can't turn once they're on the inside. The basic deal is you won't be allowed to know/see anything until they ask you to kill a kid or something, and by that point they'll know enough about you to blackmail you into silence if you refuse their offer. Go try if you want. Maybe there are some people stupid enough to get caught but I doubt it turns out well. I'm sure people have tried.

             So even a local satanic cult can't be infiltrated? That's preposterous. With that type of mindset, you'll never be able to do anything. Nothing is impossible

              it's not local satanic cults doing most of this. these cults are CIA experiments and related to the Luciferian mind control cult that currently runs shit. you seem like a really naive person, so i don't think you should be giving advice like this so frivolously.

            Right, the law would let them go and you’d be marked for death. You’d have to leak the footage online or on tv. The whole plan would take a while and an alternate identity to protect yourself and your family. One slip and you’re dead.

            Not if you give it to the police and tell them you infiltrated to get footage of them doing this. But before you give it to the police, you 
leak it online so that the police can't cover it up. Then they'd be forced to act on it. And I'm not saying you have to film the sexual act, you could film them going into a room with the child with them talking about how they'll rape the child. Their words will incriminate them, and then most likely the child is also missing. Therefore, the missing child would be on camera with these pedophiles, which would also incriminate them. I think you get the point
