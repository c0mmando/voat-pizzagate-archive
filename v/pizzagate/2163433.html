<p>Subject: Help for dying patients </p>
<p>Dear Hillary and all. 
We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in the city and according to PIH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it\'s infrastucture needs to be rebuilt. 
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water. 
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol. 
If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication. 
Until this morning when none at the General. </p>
<p>did the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and </p>
<p>Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are festering patients are getting septic and dying. If we had a little help with basic servcices we could stop this. 
I don\'t have cell or email at the hospital. Please coordinate with Claire Pierre or Nancy from PIH. 
Thank you thank you thank you. 
Mark Hyman, M</p>

<p><strong>General, I want to start with you. Just by coincidence you were in Haiti when this earthquake
happened</strong> and you had quite a-- quite a scare there. Te-- tell us what happened.</p>
<p>GENERAL P. K. KEEN (SOUTHCOM): Well, Sir, I was staying at the ambassador residence,
like you said we were there on a preplanned visit with about five of my fellow service members.
My executive officer and I were in the ambassador residence when the earthquake struck.
Three of my personnel were in the Hotel Montana that completely collapsed.</p>
<p>BOB SCHIEFFER: <strong>And you had actually been planning to stay at the Hotel Montana but the
ambassador asked you and another member of your party to stay with him at the residence,
otherwise you would have been in the hotel yourself.</strong></p>
<p>GENERAL P. K. KEEN: <strong>That\'s correct</strong>. And-- and fortunately two of my personnel that were
seriously injured are back in the States being treated, and we are still searching for one.</p>

             GENERAL P. K. KEEN (SOUTHCOM): Well, Sir, I was staying at the ambassador residence,
like you said we were there on a preplanned visit with about five of my fellow service members.
My executive officer and I were in the ambassador residence when the earthquake struck.
Three of my personnel were in the Hotel Montana that completely collapsed.

              And you had actually been planning to stay at the Hotel Montana but the
ambassador asked you and another member of your party to stay with him at the residence,
otherwise you would have been in the hotel yourself.

              That's correct

            It is interesting that the motivation for helping Partners In Health (PIH) is that PIH was also involved in something REDACTED, which probably means classified, and that Hillary was worried that Paul Farmer would speak out about REDACTED, as well as lack of aid.

            </p>
            <p>
             And with the rest of your post, I don't think you refuted why she  made it top priority to address the situation.  She didn't want them speaking out about how poor the response was.  You do realize that this is 5 days later and these are supposedly her friends.  Or is she talking about other 'friends' she is looking out for.
            </p>
            <p>
             And you never did reply why Cheryl Mills calls Laura Silsby by her first name 'laura' when referencing her in emails.  The others in the chain refer to her as 'silsby' which makes sense.  But CDM when passing on the email to H calls her 'laura' .   hmmmmm.

            Rajiv Shah: sounds like he's being groomed for something:
           </p>
           <p>
            USAIDs (CIA cover), Rockefeller Foundation and his private equity firm he founded Latitude Capital.
           </p>
           <p>
            This corporation  has all 6 of it's board members also affiliated with Omeros Corporation. This corporation in 2012 paid off it's CFO 4 to 12.5 million dollars to not go to trial over CFO's allegations that  Omeros , a biopharmaceutical company, fraudulently overbilled the government  2 million dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shah with the Rockefeller foundation is going to spread their philanthropy dollars in 3rd World Countries and at the same time clean up on the medicines they'll sell them.

             Is USAID CIA?  There's so many twists and turns, it's hard  for me figure it all out. Warren Buffet's son Howard moved to my town. For the last several years he's gone pretty much unnoticed by the general public. We were just in the last several months informed that he has been a auxiliary police officer for the last five years. He has the Howard Buffet foundation and strong ties to USAID. According to Senator John DeCamp, told of Lawrence King's ( Franklin savings and loan) holding a fund raiser for Buffet when he ran for Douglas county commissioner. Just this year Buffet has pretty much bought our police department. From firearms, cars, a new police training facility etc. What worries me most is that he's inserted himself into the lives of our children. A new teen facility, train at the zoo, water park, gardens etc. 
Two weeks ago on Thursday we were told that our Sheriff would be retiring and the county board would be voting on a new Sheriff. No vote was taken and Friday morning, we were told Buffet would be swarn in as our new sheriff. The county board director refused to comment and didn't attend the swearing in. 
When I attempted to reach out to our local paper, I was verbally attacked. The community thinks this guy is a God. I think he's dangerous to our community.

              Looks like the old sheriff conveniently "retired" early to let Howard get some experience.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Buffett has volunteered for the sheriff’s office since 2012, when he became an auxiliary deputy. In 2014, he was appointed civilian undersheriff, an unpaid position in charge of special projects. In April, the Illinois Sheriff’s Association presented Buffett with its highest honor, the High Sheriff Award, given out only four times before. The organization said he had logged more than 2,500 hours of patrol, 600 hours of certified training and 70 weapons qualifications."
Don't see where he ever did the POST training? Don't see how he could pass the law enforcement agility test.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder what the "special projects" mentioned were?  Especially as " the last several years he's gone pretty much unnoticed by the general public"
Makes you wonder what his agenda is. It's not like he doesn't have some company or other to run.
