            It's unfortunate that people are calling you a shill, when your track record says otherwise. I know you're just trying to save some innocents, like we all are.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did a quick look at the site, and the images.
           </p>
           <p>
            It looks like the AP site with the menu is just a little site that GoDaddy offers businesses that get their hosting from them and don't have the money or inclination to hire a professional web designer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking over their social media, they have some reviews on some of the normal places - Google, Foursquare, Tripadvisor. None of the reviews really stood out. Their Facebook page is not very active, mostly college age people posting selfies, and pictures of their food. (I don't know that greasy shrimp in a styrofoam take-out container is a big selling point, but maybe that's just me.)
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the other things you mentioned about the website was the page for login.  It looks like that's for a "letsget.net" and that appears to be a service for small restaurants so they can offer their customers online ordering.  Where that differs from the login page at CPP, is that Google has about 1200 webpages indexed for letsget.net (for the different restaurants subscribing) and the CPP has just a login with no way to sign up. The Axis site does have a way for new people to sign up.

            </a>
            Not saying there's nothing going on here, but based on the website, I'm not seeing anything that raises a red flag as far as Axis Pizza goes. I'm on the fence about the poster at the bus stop, but I'm open to new information..
           </p>
           <p>
            The other things that crossed my mind is the Axis Pizza owner has a construction background. Does it look like there's a basement there, or any suspicious building going on?  That's the only other thing I can think of that might be worth looking at if you're in the area.

            This is probably obvious but I just looked up "google billboards" to see what other google sponsored billboards might look like.

            The "when the craving for pizza is real" part doesn't look like it's in the same google-esque font to me. And the addition of the dog with the pizza eyes looks off as well. You could certainly make an argument than it's a regular google ad, but it could easily be an ad for something else pretending to be a google ad.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is not a real ad, what is it for? If it's information it seems like we could figure it out. But if it's some kind of marker, that might be more difficult. Say, it might be something like a bus stop, but for trafficking.

              Not the kind of bus stop I meant. I meant like, stop here and then move on to your real destination, which is PG-related. Interesting that I got downvoted.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think you're on to something. If it were nothing, people would just be like "meh" and move on. They wouldn't fight you and try to shut you up.
             </p>
             <p>
              What's up with the hearts on Axis Pizza? Could that be saying that each one is not just actual food?  I know a little bit about marketing, and you wouldn't put something confusing like hearts on a food menu. You'd put regular bullets, or if you were going to put graphics, it would be something directly related to the food you're selling. Tomatoes or cheese wedges or something. The arrow in the "axis" graphic is also a little weird. Does that mean something? If you were going to make a graphic there, you would make it directly related to your product.
             </p>
             <p>
              Take "Little Caesar's Pizza" for example. Their logo is a Roman guy with two pizzas. Their marketing deal used to be that you bought two pizzas for the price of one. So the guy said, "pizza pizza" to indicate that. The mascot/logo tied into the name and the phrase, "pizza pizza" tied back to the mascot/logo. There were no unexplained graphics. The fact that this Axis Pizza has graphics that don't make sense means that they are being marketed to someone who understands them. Either the hearts and arrows make sense locally or it's some other, hidden meaning.

            Walnut is supposed to mean girl from many interpretations. It can have other meanings, but I do not assume it is random.

            Pennsylvania is a huge hub for trafficking from what I have discovered. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is pizzagate related. I can't really tell though, you've analyzed it better than me so far.

            I looked at the google advert you posted. It isn't anything. College kids eat a lot of pizza, they look for where to find it on google.

           <p>
            Ditto on the number 33. That's just a coincidence.

              It's an ad for Google. They're trying to get college kids in the area to use Google to search for things like Pizza etc.

             <p>
              It's not worth pursuing at all. It's totally innocuous.

               <p>
                And I don't think you're a shill either. I think I told you that didn't I? My point is you can't just start tracking down any reference to Pizza wherever you see it.

            Be intersteing to know what kind of pizza you can find at that garage. I've saved the images and I have enjoyed your posts. Cheers.

              PROMIS was the 80's, why are you conflating it with pizzagate? I've looked into PROMIS quite a bit and I think you're trying to confuse people here and send them on a wild goose chase. Upload your damn pic and quit acting stupid.

            Could it be possible that it's an ad to encourage people to search on Google for pizza because it's getting close to Superbowl and a lot of fans like to eat foods like pizza while they watch the game?  I hope that didn't come off as snarky. I just am trying hard not to fall into the trap of thinking that
            <em>
             nothing
            </em>
            can be taken at face value anymore. Investigating all of this can start to warp one's mind. Plus, I didn't see the ad, so I'm just working off the description.

            "We should check local restaurant (pizzerias), homeless shelters, etc.".......With all due respect but  you sound like a shill trying to discredit us. This isn't about looking at random pizza parlors and homeless shelters on the eastern seaboard for pedophiles. That would be kind of silly don't you think? We're more about tracking down leads from Wikileaks emails that point to some sketchy doings in the halls of power in DC not unlike the Franklin Scandal 20+ years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Randomly chasing down references to Pizza isn't the way to go about this.

             Don't forget many college campuses are romancing the idea that pedophilia is merely a sexual preference. And minions can be a way in to the powerful.

             It definitely could be nothing. It's just a slightly odd advertisement. You will see. How can I discredit you guys when I have literally supplied nothing of value on this specific submission?
            </p>

             Btw do you know if voat can support images? Like can I upload a file to voat?

              " How can I discredit you guys"........They've sent an army of shills to voat in order to discredit us, send us on wild goose chases, sweep for leads and other bull s*** tactics to sweep this thing under the rug. It's actually been really bizarre and greatly diminished my faith in government.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't think you're a shill actually. You're just innocently trying to help. It's all good. No worries. The best way to help is to track down leads from the Wikileaks emails. If it started in Wikileaks then it's worth pursuing. Just looking in general for Pizza restaurants is way too large a net to cast.

                "I am risking my life taking those."........Whoa there nelly. Now you sound crazy. 
My advice to you is move on, try another pass-time. If taking a picture of an ad at a bus stop is freaking you out..........

             I'd also add that those part of a conspiracy (or conspiracies) like this would most likely cease using pizza as a codeword for new activities due to the light this investigation has shown on this particular method of "hiding in plain sight."

             But if you've got something, anonymously upload it through proxy/Tor browser and we'll vet it like anything else.

             Easy to copy photos onto Word now, and of course print out in case you ever have to scan to share again. I can help reach political activists who know about all of these nefarious/evil money making atrocities.  They as well will help to spread it.
