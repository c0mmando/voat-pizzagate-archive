<p>The Standard Hotel is now owned by Goodwin Gaw, of Gaw Capital. They also own the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel which hosted a notorious nightclub for underage actors. In April of this year NakedHub was taken over by the WeWork company. One of their locations is in the China Town area of DC. Previous voat posts have already made the link between WeWork, BYT Media Inc and Alefantis.</p>
<p>...Adam Neumann (Hebrew: אדם נוימן‎; born 1979) is an Israeli–American billionaire businessman. In 2010, he co-founded WeWork, along with Miguel McKelvey. He served as an officer in the Israel Defense Forces.</p>
<p>..WeWork\'s founders have been content to stay quiet about their story until now, swearing investors to secrecy. No longer. Over the next 12 months the company expects to triple its membership from 14,000 to 46,000 and expand to 60 locations from 21 today and 9 just a year ago.  ..

Police say the incident took place at the Hutchinson-Whitestone Motel  .. They don\'t ask for ID from their regular customers? Uh huh.. According to comments on that article the motel has a very sleazy reputation.. ..I can\'t find much information on the motel apart from the fact that the manager is Luis Pichardo and then there was this odd video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40Fw80pilNc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40Fw80pilNc</a> Check out the logo of the spa mentioned.

            Do Alefantis collected all those toys and arrived at WH at 2 pm. All that time that went by till the evening event. Scares the wits out of me. Think about the  bribing he could do with all those freebie playthings. Are those records still avail? If we found out what time he arrived he must have signed in. What time did he sign out. Was he in the upstairs living quarters near the bedrooms? Nothing would surprise me.

           <p>
            I am familiar with WeWork, but did not know there may be a PG connection, so I'll start there. Besides tiny plug and play offices for startup wannabes, they have endeavored to change the office leasing game with high profile space (Salesforce Tower in SF) and begin working with corporations (IBM &amp; Microsoft). On top of that, they have a WeLive branch which has begun trying the residential space model, as well as a DAY CARE, SCHOOL, and their own FARM.

Once heralded as a wunderkind, WeWork announced last week that Neumann would be replaced in his role by two other company executives. Among the actions that raised alarms:
             <strong>
              Neumann tapped company stock to get a $500 million personal loan,
             </strong>
             and he had to return $6 million that WeWork's parent company paid him for use of the word “We.’’

             Among Neumann’s reported wildest dreams was creating WeWork Mars — an office space on the red planet. And at a company event in 2018, he said,
             <strong>
              “There are 150 million orphans in the world. We want to solve this problem and give them a new family: the WeWork family.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             According to a New York magazine story from June, Neumann recently told a person close to the company, “When countries are shooting at each other, I want them to come to me.”

            A pilot program of seven students is
            <strong>
             currently running inside a Chabad school
            </strong>
            in New York City, including the Neumann’s eldest, who is in first grade. The school will embrace experiential
            <strong>
             (hands-on) learning
            </strong>
            , so kids will spend at least one day a week on a
            <strong>
             $15 million farm in Pound Ridge the Neumann’s recently bought
            </strong>
            . (The kids recently brought back vegetables and started a farm stand to sell them.)

            Imo BGCA are probably changing Children’s lives on military bases. Not for the good. We have had posts and comments regarding rapes in Columbia on a military base and here in the US of  A as well. Military bases and Kids are not a good mix.

             Not sure if anyone archives the ZH resignations, but I have seen a lot. and I would probably imagine they are mostly all the same as  Resignation.info
            </p>
            <p>
             Search domain www.resignation.infohttps://www.resignation.info, but I am just not sure those two are connected. Zh is into business. Business is related to money/currency so there might be some important names to add that slip by. I was just thinking earlier that Business, Politics, and History should be one class, and last a fifth of a day from K to 12.

            Not sure about the others, but JUUL CEO is under serious pressure due to youth deaths caused by vaping.  MO has huge stake and was already facing serious market cap decline, causing the board to take some drastic steps, like forcing JUUL CEO resignation.

            I lived near the Whitestone hotel. It’s very funky. You pay by the 4 hour block. When I was 20-22 I fucked a chick there. Probably had cameras in the rooms. Back in the 70s-90s hunts point was a big trucking and commercial zone and truckers would fuck prostitutes and get drugs there. The motel is a byproduct of that era and whoever runs it probably has deep ties to the local coke and heroin gangs and probably even police connected.

             It'll go stale before anything significant happens. You must know this by now. These things aren't going anywhere any time soon.
