            These news sites are just parasites feeding off each other. Pizzagate didn't originate with fake news and we all know that.

            I like how they call it a "fake news report", as if Alex Jones read it aloud on his show and everyone started believing it. I don't know how it broke necessarily, but when it broke it was everywhere. The internet was already on fire over Spirit Cooking.
