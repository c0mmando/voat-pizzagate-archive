             It's because this unlike almost every other case of this type, it was looked into immediately after the incident was alleged to happen.  No charges were brought in NY and no charges were brought in CT because it both cases the authorities believe no abuse happened.

               You are going further than the judge did.  The Judge never said he believes the abuse happened.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Mr. Allen's relationship with Dylan remains unresolved. The evidence suggests that it is unlikely that he could be successfully prosecuted for sexual abuse. I am less certain, however, than is the Yale‚Äê New Haven team, that the evidence proves conclusively that there was no sexual abuse.¬†¬†
...
I agree with Dr. Herman and Dr. Brodzinsky that we will probably never know what occurred on August 4, 1992. The credible testimony of Ms. Farrow, Dr.
Coates, Dr. Leventhal and Mr. Allen does, however, prove that Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.
...
After considering Ms. Farrow's position as the sole care‚Äêtaker of the children, the satisfactory fashion in which she has fulfilled that function, the parties' pre‚Äêlitigation acceptance that she continue in that capacity, and Mr. Allen's serious parental inadequacies, it is clear that the best interests of the children will be served by their continued custody with Ms. Farrow

            So the family court documents regarding the Allen/Farrow custody proceedings are available online for anyone to read.
           </p>
           <p>
            Allen wasn't charged or convicted criminally regarding his sexual abuse of 7 year old daughter Dylan, however he lost all custody and visitation to her because of the legitimate concerns of his inappropriate behavior with her. That's a really big deal!

               "The Yale-New Haven Hospital Child Sex Abuse Clinic‚Äôs finding that Dylan had not been sexually molested, cited repeatedly by Allen‚Äôs attorneys, was not accepted as reliable by Judge Wilk, or by the Connecticut state prosecutor who originally commissioned them. The state prosecutor, Frank Maco, engaged the Yale-New Haven team to determine whether Dylan would be able to perceive facts correctly and be able to repeat her story on the witness stand. The panel consisted of two social workers and a pediatrician, Dr. John Leventhal, who signed off on the report but who never saw Dylan or Mia Farrow. No psychologists or psychiatrists were on the panel. The social workers never testified; the hospital team only presented a sworn deposition by Dr. Leventhal, who did not examine Dylan.
              </p>
              <p>
               All the notes from the report were destroyed. Her confidentiality was then violated, and Allen held a news conference on the steps of Yale University to announce the results of the case. The report concluded Dylan had trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality. (For example, she had told them there were ‚Äúdead heads‚Äù in the attic and called sunset ‚Äúthe magic hour.‚Äù In fact, Mia kept wigs from her movies on styrofoam blocks in a trunk in the attic.) The doctor subsequently backed down from his contention.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Connecticut state police, the state attorney, and Judge Wilk all had serious reservations about the report‚Äôs reliability."

                None of that shows any shilling for Woody Allen.  You're showing some people disagreed with their findings. Other did not.
               </p>
               <p>
                It doesn't show that they changed their findings in any way because the accused was Woody Allen.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's lots there that goes after their methods...."No psychologists or psychiatrists were on the panel."....but doesn't say they changed their methods to because of Woody Allen.
               </p>
               <p>
                I presume the CT police referred the case to them because they had more expertise than the CT police.  I would presume they had more expertise than a Family Court judge too.

                This part sounds like they are reaching for a way to discredit the conclusions.
               </p>
               <blockquote>

                 Dr. John Leventhal, who signed off on the report but who never saw Dylan or Mia Farrow......the hospital team only presented a sworn deposition by Dr. Leventhal, who did not examine Dylan.

               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Are they speaking of a physical examination?  Because I believe the Yale Team based their report on several interviews with Dylan, are they saying Dr. Leventhal wasn't part of those interviews?
               </p>
               <p>
                Does it matter if Leventhal wasn't the one conducting the interview?   it doesn't mean he wasn't aware of the interview or didn't say see the videos of the interview.  For example, not every cop involved in a case needs to be in on all the interviews and the prosecutors are often not on the interviews, but they can still write up a report based on those interviews.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wasn't this report made public at the time?   Let me see if I can find it.

                 It seems the whole report was not made public.  It seems only the intro and the summary pages were released.....it jumps to page 40.

                 The part that sounded false to me seems to only include part of what was asked of the Yale Team. The report says
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Two major questions posed in the referral were:
Is Dylan telling the truth and did we think she was sexually abused?
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 It mentions the interviews they carried out.  Dylan Farrow was interviewed by "Ms Sawyer and Dr. Hamilton" in Sept, Oct and November  of 1992.  Mia Farrow was interviewed separately in those months as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In December Mia was interviewed by "Ms Sawyer, Dr Hamilton and Dr Leventhal" and the video of this interview was reviewed with Mia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So Leventhal did interview Mia, but the bulk of the interviews and all the interviews with Dylan were from Sawyer and Hamilton.   I wonder if anyone alleges they disagrees with Leventhal's sworn statement or with the report.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These pages do not show who signed the report, but it is written in a collective voice.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  we interviewed.....we met with...It is our expert opinion.....our opinion was reinforced.......while we can conclude....we cannot be definitive.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 So there's nothing that I see that says the opinion wasn't unanimous or that they behaved any differently than they normally would.

                  And a Mia Farrow Fan.   She's great in Broadway Danny Rose and Radio Days and Hannah and Her Sisters and .....OMG, I just remember Rosemary's Baby was directed by Polanski.....wow that's weird....I was thinking it was Cassavetes, but he was just an actor in it.......anyway she's really good in that.

                  I like their work.   They are both however fucked in the head.....that was part of the trial testimony of the child psychologist who worked with them, by the way.   Remember all the Soon Yi stuff happened first.  This was all out there and public. The allegation of this incident came up in the middle of these two breaking up.    Four days before this allegation, the child psychologist testifed that Farrow was raging against Allen the Soon Yi thing calling him Satanic and Evil and then asked in all seriousness Farrow asked the doctor if she thought the Farrow should marry Allen.   That's not a rational person.  Allen is, of course, not a disinterested party, but he claims in the middle of all this she was asking about getting fitted for costumes for his next movie.   He made that claim months before the custody trial and the pyschologist seems to back that type of thinking up.

            Gosh. What about the adopted daughter that he married. Maybe there is a reasonable explanation for that. ‚ÄúOops, I slipped and fell and accidentally had an intimate romantic relationship with an underage girl that I was supposed to protect and be a father to. My bad. Nothing to see here.‚Äù

               Soon-Yi Previn (born circa October 8, 1970) is the adopted daughter of actress Mia Farrow and musician Andr√© Previn, as well as the wife of filmmaker Woody Allen.

                That is the current status of their relation, and not in contention as to the facts. It seems that there was a period where Farrow and Allen were married and another wherein they shared visitation rights, during which Soon-Yi was a minor, and it has been stated that Allen had been inappropriately involved either her. My question is about whether or not any of this occurred at a time when he was married to Farrow and thus acting as a literal or figurative guardian in the household. Either way, it indicates a breach of trust on the part of an adult and toward minor in the home, because he now has a relationship with his ex-wife‚Äôs daughter. That is in NO WAY normal.

                  I have been forced to read more about it. I confess, much of what I thought to be true about this deserves re-examining. I cannot confirm if their relationship resulted n marriage or not. I can‚Äôt tell if they had kids together, or if they just raised each other‚Äôs kids together. It seems their relationship ended because of some scandalous photos of soon yi. I‚Äôm not sure how old she was in the photos. It seems the relationship ‚Äúofficially‚Äù started when she was 21. There are comments from some family members indicating that it started before as ‚Äògrooming‚Äô. I am starting to see a lot of unverifiable, ‚Äúhe sad‚Äù, ‚Äúshe said‚Äù type of stuff. I‚Äôm ready to leave this alone for awhile and just wait and see how it turns out. I pray for justice, if it applies. I guess that‚Äôs all I can do. God knows what happened, though it seems maybe we can‚Äôt for sure. I find some elements very disappointing, however: Woody‚Äôs comment for TMZ and his characterization of the daughter that accuses him... those statements made me more suspicious. The sources are too numerous, and I‚Äôm losing track in the morass of reporting and comments. The truth will come out when it‚Äôs ready, I guess.

             Soon Yi Previn's father is Andre Previn, Mia Farrow's previous husband.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was not adopted by Allen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soon Yi is much younger than Allen but was an adult when their affair began.

            The fact that he married his own adopted daughter (she was also young at the time) says it all. This guy is a sick, demented child rapist.

             He never adopted her, she had been adopted by Mia prior to his and Mia's relationship. However, it's still highly inapropriate for him to start a relationship with someone who was so young and whom he had known since she was a fairly young child. Additionally, she is the sister to his bio son as well as his two adopted children with Mia. I just wanted to clarify the soon to adoption thing, but not trying to dismiss your overall comment

             Yes, and there were those photos he'd been taking of her. No telling when the affair began. But there's nothing to see here ... move along.

              Thank you for clarifying their initial relationship. However, I do question when their affair really began. Especially in light of his daughters claims as well as claims of nude photos of one of the young girls being found in the home. I certainly would not allow this man to get near any of my children.

              <p>
               We are still talking about Soon Yi here.  She was grown woman at the time of these photos, 19 or 20.  She was not a young girl.
              </p>
              <p>
               We actually do know when their affair began.  She was home from college and previously had never spent much time with Allen alone.     Mia asked her to take Soon Yi to a basketball game and that's when they started.
              </p>
              <p>
               I went to college in NJ, right in the NYC media market and remember everyone was following this pretty closely.  This broke just as we were returning.  I had a few journalism students in my dorm.  They would break down which reporters were "Team Mia" and which were "Team Allen."

               I believe even Mia said the affair started after Soon Yi came back from college and Mia encouraged Woody to take her to a Knicks game.
              </p>
              <p>
               I remember when the gossip columns got that picture of the two of them at Knicks game that was a big story.   One of the gossip columnists in a memoir talked about getting a picture of Soon Yi at college because there weren't many current pictures of her and it was not publically known where she went to college.  They looked through the photos they had and saw her bag or her sweatshirt at an R on it and they went to Rutgers and other local colleges and then found her at Rider.

               This is kind of the basic facts of the case.  Allen's relationship with Soon Yi was skeevy but not illegal.

              <p>
               You can look at any of the news reports from when this came out to find her age.    Lots of the NY papers from back then are online.

               I just did a search and here's an article on Woody and Mia from the year before the scandal broke.  So this is not rationalization afterwards.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                She and Previn had three sons (Matthew, Sascha and Fletcher); then they adopted three orphan girls -- two Vietnamese (Lark and Daisy) and one Korean (Soon Yi). After their divorce, she adopted a Korean infant (Moses Amadeus Farrow), who has cerebral palsy. In 1985, Allen and Farrow adopted a newborn girl from Texas (Dylan O'Sullivan Farrow). Two years later, they had their own son (Satchel O'Sullivan Farrow, named after Satchel Paige, the baseball pitcher and a hero of Allen's; the last name was chosen because the couple didn't want one Allen among two Farrows and six Previns).
               </p>
               <p>
                .....
Allen and Farrow very much lead their own lives, while continuing a relationship that is the longest either has had. By any standard, it is not a conventional union. They are not married, neither do they live together; their apartments face each other across Central Park.
