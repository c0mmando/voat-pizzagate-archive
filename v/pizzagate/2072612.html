             for the update! Any and all info is how we can unravel these sicko crimes. "No Motive" - That's kinda the jagged pill part of this: No Motive......The mirror is saying this about the crime -

             "Antonio Williams, who turned 25 today, has confessed to murdering his sister and her two cousins in a crime so horrific that cops are being offered counselling."
If, this case is that bad, what is it? Disembowel ? decapitation? 
there's a lot to wonder.. i guess that.
and this is kinda weird: "Williams, who stayed in the house after carrying out his brutal crime, was taken to the police station where he admitted to killing them."
He did this crime and just sat there.....???
and then gives a full confession to boot,huh? 
Our Pedo-rapist Antonio earl jackson live @ the Same address of this crime.

              The whole thing is weird. They're only releasing very sketchy details. They only say he was there. So was he asleep? The mother came home at 7 in the morning, so he killed them and went to sleep? And he never acted strangely before this?
             </p>
             <p>
              So many questions and not enough answers. Those poor children. And the two-year-old, can you imagine what seeing this will do to her? If grown men need counseling, a baby doesn't have the skills to process this type of evil. Thanks for the post. Let's keep on this story to see if there's anything in the coming developments.

               ! On one hand the police are saying the girl's bodies just had "trauma",and then the other saying "nightmare"; "Counseling for the Police officers is provided" ? which is it? Went to sleep? maybe. In his mug shot he doesn't look like he was up all night. ( So was he the fall guy? ..with confession too?)
" And he never acted strangely before this?" - I wonder about this, i bet he has a rap sheet loaded with priors, like assault.But is HE the murderer? or is he a Todd Kohlhepp in the making?
or a patsy?
was he there alone,or with others  there to make a kiddie rape snuff film?
His confession is too simple, the fact that he was there alone watching these kids to too simple.
If the snuff film makers wanted to film and livestream it, WITHOUT having the signal go through the telcom network, they call their old pals at the police Dept. to just go site near the residence using their 'Stingray'! all data goes thru them and not the network.

                All great points. Most especially I'm stuck on why he was the babysitter. I find it impossible to believe he wouldn't have exhibited abnormal behavior before this ... that is if he's guilty he would have.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is just tragic. And why was the two-year-old spared? Because she couldn't talk and say what happened and the others could?

                    It's unbelievable! If the police don't investigate, it's obviously part of the cabal. This must go on all the time. Reminds me a little of Jon Benet Ramsey case in that her body was found in the basement.

                      And I had the same theory about JonBenet ... that she was streamed or videoed. Remember that her father was alleged to have a porno operation. I think John Mark Karr was in on it and told them what to do with her. I don't think her parents knew she'd be killed, but they definitely were renting her out. Could be the same type of thing happened here. Don't want to say the mother was in on it because it's very easy to get access to kids.

                It is unusual. Usually they give details. I've read pretty horrific details. It's in very exceptional cases where details are withheld.

                   That's  ridiculous-its  too  early to even  know if those arrested are  guilty, the  police  under  pressure  often  round  up numerous  suspects,  if for  no other reason to  demonstrate they are "on it," they  may  have  other suspects, the  police  do  not release details when their is an  active  investigation so  they do  not  want to  tip off said  suspects, when they do they  dole out  some  limited details at a time-now  go back to your scratching pad, kitty

            WTH? So many questions.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Investigators are interviewing family members. It remains unclear whether the children were related and who was taking care of them. Their names and ages have not yet been released.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What do they mean it's unclear if they're related? Didn't it just say they had their names?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             While neighbors were shocked by the violence and expressed fears for their own children, police said the violence was confined to the home.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Why are they so positive? They state they don't know if they're related, if they were being watched, who the hell they are, BUT they're positive the violence was confined to that home?
           </p>
           <p>
            Must be they have regular people keeping these kids. This way they don't have one big warehouse. They're being taken care of and then not! Probably somebody paying to spend "raw and uncensored" time with them got a little too nutso and actually slaughtered them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is so disturbing. Everybody's going to need counseling after this.

            I find the name change to be interesting, if David Antonio Earl Johnson (registered sex offender at address) is really Antonio Williams (reported as arrested for the crime) then why did the police say his last name was Williams and not Johnson? Do the local police in Clinton, MA have a policy of not reporting pedophiles names?

             Great point about his name!! Could the name change represent an alias?; Was he a police informant? Was he the fall guy,and other people were there,and he's covering for their crimes,or did he do it with ...'them' ?

             , it is confirmed this killer of 3 girls under 10 is a Pedo-File!. Yeah that has everything to do with pizzagate. Furthermore, he's a convicted CHILD rapist! So why is HE with kids under 10..AT ALL? The neighborhood looks nice..so how is this scum living/visiting there??

              Well this is  certainly a  capital  crime,  but  it  appears  to  be the  work  of  an individual, at  least at  this  time; Pizzagate is about high  level  government  sanctioned sex slavery, managed  by  the  CIA

              I see he has a  pedophile history on  the  update-this is  certainly significant; at this  point  it is not  a  Pizzagate story but  as evidence is  released it may turn  out to be part  of  organized sex slavery,  but it  appears  to  be an  isolated case, at  least  at this  point, thanks  for  the  FYI

               Isolated case?,,,,,lone wolf..i've heard it all!
How come Ron Cassie says the opposite ??? 
"What is common in Maryland, however, is the sex trafficking of women and minors. In 2014, 396 survivors of human trafficking came in contact with the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force. Of those, 381 were victims of sex trafficking, including 364 girls and women.
              </p>
              <p>
               “We are talking about 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds who are being sexually assaulted, raped, up to 20 times a day.”
In fact, the number of survivors identified by the state trafficking task force nearly doubled from 2013 to 2014,

                Calm down, I'm not the  opposition  here,
its easy to  get  emotional and go on  the warpath  with every  story,
Pizzagate is  about ORGANIZED ELITE PEDOPHILIA/SRA, 
isolated means  this (at  least at  this  point) is a sicko individual who has  a  past of criminal  pedophilia-not part of the  larger  Pizzagate,
he  is still a  suspect at this  point  and  has  not  been  positively  identified as  the perp in  this case

             Dead kids tell no tales. I bet they were afraid the girls would talk or something like that. That's the only reason I can think of for sparing the toddler.

"The Decree sisters are from Palm Street in Newark, NJ. They are the daughters of the suspect’s mother’s cousin.

            The mother of Nadira and Williams returned to her home in Clinton at around 7:30 a.m. Friday after working an overnight shift and leaving the girls in Williams’s care. "

            PERP: Antonio Williams, 25, of Clinton, has been arrested on three counts of first-degree murder and other related charges in the slaying of the girls. Williams is the brother of Withers and a cousin of the other two girls.

-Police said -  "Williams remained at the scene after the slayings." So, why didn't just they just put him in the car and leave? The official arrest wasn't until later that same day?
- Why did police use police tape around that block, if the main suspect was in the house?

The Cochran Firm, D.C. investigating new allegations of child sexual abuse at James Ryder Randall elementary school in PG County
;
"The Cochran Firm, D.C. is investigating shocking new allegations of sexual molestation by a PG County school aid aboard a bus last year. The four victims were Pre-K special needs students from James Ryder Randall Elementary School in Clinton, Maryland, some younger than five-years old."
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             "Parents kept in the dark about abuse by PG County School officials
According to PG County School officials, the abuse aboard the school bus was caught on a surveillance video inside the vehicle. Officials asked parents to identify their children in screen shots of the video but were not shown the footage in its entirety, according to media reports.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            One of the most disturbing aspects of the case is the fact the abuse took place back in November, 2015 but parents were not notified until August 2016. PG County Schools claims it has only known about the abuse since May 2016 when it alerted Child Protective Services which subsequently handed the case over to police in June.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even worse, the alleged perpetrator is walking the streets. Police have made no arrests and the bus driver and supervisor are on administrative leave while authorities continue to wring their hands over the situation."

            Perspective: From the police and officers accounts of this crime it sounds like hannibal kinda damage ' Nighmare' &amp;  “one of the most difficult scenes” .This says that these kids were sadistically raped &amp;murdered or connected to Satanic sacrifice or both. the home is close Andrews AFB and WASH DC.
I bet this Perp had a rap sheet a mile long, so ...how he get near these kids? Where did the kids come from,,no omission from the cops yet.

             Look up:
1. Sex offender registry. Notice which ones are not monitored and were sent to institutions versus jail.
2. Addresses where offenders live and amount of people listed living at addresses and real estate companies.
3. Old Conagrau factory location shut down and what offenders live near by. Connection of Boystown to Conagrua. Factory shut downs in other states. Review Boystown websites very carefully. Review various country foster adoption, including medical frail children, such as deaf and genetic.
4. Institution staff complaining of dangerous jobs in MD.
5. News on offenders being mental/ nurse institution routed vs jailed. History of institutions in MD. 
6. List of missing children and locations. Ones with mothers routed down drug addiction and mental routes.
7. Legal cases, courts and judges. 
8. Boystown jobs on craiglist. Tallahasee, FL is one of the states.
9. Boystown and others in Miami immigrant/migrant routing via age/gender/etc. Facebook sites of jails and institutions comments by family members and attorneys. Note the countries of origin.

            How this relates to pizzagate: Media already appears to downplay  the severity: goes to media cover up; Children are brutally killed in a sadistic/pedo way (Update) by a convicted pedo rapist : WHY IS HE WITH KIDS?????? CLOSE ENOUGH TO KILL?????? - (Aug18 2017)
           </p>
           <p>
            UPDATE: Aug 21th 2017 : BOND HEARING OUTBURST : Antonio Williams says,  'I'm not the one you're looking for’ and 'he's here.'
           </p>
           <pre><code>  “He’s here. Here’s here. No. No. No. No. I’m not the one you’re looking for,” Williams continued."
</code></pre>
           <p>
            "Williams continued his outbursts, saying "I'm not going!"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Williams, who celebrated his 25th birthday behind bars on Saturday, seemed disoriented as he was led into the stuffy, crowded courtroom by deputies. He was heard yelling, 'I'm not the one you're looking for’ and 'he's here.'
The venue was packed with furious family members of the three deceased girls, among them Nadira and Antonio's sobbing mother, who stood up and repeatedly told her son, 'Mommy loves you, reported Fox 5 DC.' 
"The victims’ incensed relatives jumped to their feet and tried to lunge at Kelley, prompting deputies to intervene and physically hold them back, reported WUSA9.
Meanwhile, three deputies struggled to hold Antonio down at the defense table as he continued raving, heaving and crying, while prosecutors and lawyers tried in vain to calm him down.
The tumultuous bond review came to an abrupt end when Judge Patrice Lewis ordered the suspect to undergo a mental competency evaluation, to be completed by next Tuesday.
As Kelley and her family members were led out of the courtroom, she exclaimed, referring to her son, ‘He needs me!’
"The two fathers of the slain children lashed out at Kelley, hurling expletives at her and saying, 'your daughter needed you. F*** you and your whole family. I hope you rot in hell!’

            UPDATE : Aug 20th 2017 : HIGHLIGHT MSM NARRATIVE
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish to highlight the possibility of 'gas-lighting' : 
1) 
Very few articles about the murder of these 3 girls explain that the mom found 1 or all alive, most describe the kids as "found dead already".The timeline of events are: mom finds them upon returning to the house after finishing her late night work shift,sees the girls alive &amp; bleeding out, runs to call 911@ 7:30/37?am(we need a recording of that call btw),Cops show up @ 7:45am and pronounce all the girls dead. Why is this important? This info can be reverse engineered to the approximate 'kill time' of the murders. These girls were all brutally stabbed, 'knifed' (
            <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4281700/first-pictures-emerge-of-little-girl-stabbed-to-death-along-with-her-two-young-cousins-by-her-babysitting-">
             https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4281700/first-pictures-emerge-of-little-girl-stabbed-to-death-along-with-her-two-young-cousins-by-her-babysitting-
            </a>
            &lt;Says thesun uk ) ,then how long would it take for 3 girls under 10 ,all under a 100lbs. each, take to bleed out?an hour..? Less than that? 7:00am, 6:30am? Here's the article saying the girls were - "suffering from stab wounds" - (suffering,sounds like alive to me) " found the three girls suffering from stab wounds in a basement bedroom. The mother called 911 immediately," Link to quote:
            <a href="https://www.pulseheadlines.com/brother-killed-6yearold-sister-young-cousins-maryland-home-prince-georges-county-police/66228/">
             https://www.pulseheadlines.com/brother-killed-6yearold-sister-young-cousins-maryland-home-prince-georges-county-police/66228/
            </a>
            and here's a typical MSM article saying the 911 call came in at 7:37am and the girls were found dead: "Around 7:37 a.m., 911 dispatchers received a call after an adult family member entered the home and founds the girls dead," link to article:
            <a href="https://kynt1450.com/index.php/2017/08/19/three-girls-under-age-of-10-found-dead-in-maryland-home-police-say/">

            </a>
            2) "Neighbors says three adults lived in the home, and cops hauled off two men in handcuffs" -
            <a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Police-3-Children-Dead-in-Clinton-Homicide-441005143.html">

            </a>
            video @ 1:05 minutes
.....Hmmm....these other MSM articles say that the killer was home alone ...Which is it? - " was left alone by his mother, Andrena Kelly"
            <a href="http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/three-girls-under-10-have-been-found-brutally-murdered-inside-clinton-maryland-home/news-story/d63d55c">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            MANY QUESTIONS: Here's a few: Why didn't the 2 year-old get killed too?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did the murderer ALLOW the mom to make the 911 call, without putting up.... a fight?
           </p>
           <p>
            Who was the other man in handcuffs?
           </p>
           <p>
            In Williams' court room outburst denying he was the killer....Saying "he's in the courtroom.."
 Who was in courtroom at that moment???

             Unbelievable, this is horrifying and it's VERY troubling when reports are so varied in cases like this, then add in the raving defendant screaming that it wasn't him and that the real perp was IN the court room, smells like a coverup. Also, some advise, in the future, instead of "sharing a link" select "discuss" so you can accually present your case in a post and not in a comment that could get buried. Keep up the great work!
