            Your questions spur a lot of thoughts for me, so I'll attempt to put down my take on it.  Thanks in advance for getting back to basics and asking some good questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would CIA assets make such mistakes?
           </p>
           <p>
            a.  Hubris - untouchable during democrat admin 8 years, they expected another 8 years at least and end game of world domination very soon, like a decade.  CIA literally knows it can shape our entire cultural reality - if you have not read this please do - it explains that "modern art" was sheparded by the CIA to use as a cultural weapon.
            <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html">
             http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            b. Podesta, Alefantis made Inferior micro- intelligence decisions ultimately because of mind control, drug use-prescription, ritual, recreational or a combo, being kept in a bubble, need to know basis of intel given to them, unable to comprehend "normal" life completely -like an alien or AI intelligence trying to be "human".   Many small mistakes add up to some doozies.  Marina less so, because she can cover herself always under the banner of freedom of expression for artists and even religious freedom.  I'm not sure she really made any mistakes if her objective was to normalize satanic ritual culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            c. Normalization of sick culture - Kill Room, taping girl, really were just jokes to them.  They are shocked other people see it as sick because to them that is the "light" stuff.  Chickenlovers, etc just their lingo, say it all the time, revel in it in song, art and conversation.  "This is how we do" - Katy Perry.
           </p>
           <p>
            d.  Some amount of breakdown in cognitive ability to me is present in Podesta specifically, I have no sympathy for him but he really seems pretty broken and tired to my view.  Even his arguments in interviews on his own behalf seem rather rote, going through the motions.  He is so used to getting a free ride, and Hillary was supposed to be a coronation, and he is used to security supporting him on every level.  Thus he doesn't live in a reality where he believes he really needs that much of a password.  So he does a super easy one even he can recall with his cloudy brain.   And we come full circle back again to a form of hubris.  The hubris of an overused tool.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything has worked so long for the CIA, like any monolithic organization it's been rotting from within.  Any reform from within is stopped because everyone has carved out their own little fiefdom.   Read "Acid Dreams" to get a mindblowing idea of how LSD became a very important part of CIA culture, not just for experiments but many key agents themselves practice mind expansion, even very seemingly straight arrow types, since the 60s.  It was a club within the club, and It never stopped.  Think of the off the wall, bizarre genius of Hunter S. Thompson and his strange exploits and death and you get just a taste. (In my opinion, Hunter S Thompson was at least in some points of his life a CIA asset)  In many ways there are a lot of cowboy operators in the CIA.  Spooks are paranoid.  Trust doesn't come easily.   You have many operators, need to know basis, an overt drug/sex/blackmail culture, more paranoia, and many many groups operating with different motives and agendas under the big umbrella we all refer to as The CIA for shorthand - there are going to be some misfires, mistakes and unfixed problems that just continue to fester until we've got what we've got today.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA is a victim of it's own success and excess - unlimited funds, unlimited hubris, soulless operations, rogues, warlocks and sickos like Aquino mixed in, and something gonna to give.  Thankfully we happen to be witnessing some of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Added:  tl;dr - The CIA is like a rich junkie.

             Thank you for that breakdown, it all makes sense to me, and I agree with your points. Abromovic does seem to be the most careful and thought-out of the bunch.

            You seem to be under the mistaken notion that the CIA recruits the "best and brightest". They don't. They seek the morally compromised, the cruel and the power/money hungry.

             I think the CIA recruits at college campuses.  They look for those they can compromise and hold their feet to the fire for their weaknesses.  It keeps them in line for years of dedicated service.

            A CIA "asset" is not a CIA "agent." An "agent" is someone who officially works for the CIA and gets checks that say "CIA" on them. An "asset" is someone who is used by an agent in some way.

            You are holding the CIA up on some high pedestal to which they do not belong. Their greatest success is their control over the MSM. Which they likely used tax dollars to acquire in the 1970s. Nearly every other operation the CIA has been involved in has been outed at this point, they just succeed in keeping it off the morning news shows. Sure there are some operations that are still secret but those of us who know which way the wind blows can smell the stench.

           <p>
            I'm not entirely convinced all these people are CIA but podesta and brock are most certainly assets if not agents. There are also other secret societies and organizations that are affiliated with the CIA so this may be more of a web than a monolith.

              I see abromovic as more of a bohemian grove type priestess figure for their old time pagan death cult. Alefantis gets cover from brock...but who knows, maybe they are all assets.

               My guess is the CIA and it's myriad organizations are a lot more "cowboy" than most would expect.  A bit slap dash even.  So what an "asset" is can be anything from someone who carries a message occassionally, to someone who produces consistent messaging, and along those lines for all the various deeds that need doing.

               I admit I am just a very amateur speculator with some heavy reading and some decent intuition on my side, but only that.  This is an arena I find fascinating - an entire culture within a culture.

            Has anyone looked closely at Marina? I mean really closely? Look at her hands, her ring finger length,  her Adam's apple and then her face.  Draw your own conclusions, but if what I'm seeing is in fact true, it changes everything.

             CIA is the strictly business side of things... many in it have a niche cult club of comparable rites and intermingle with others, but the big nastiest larp outside and direct.  It's not the pentagon or the prez directing.  They are being manipulated with intel for the most part.

            To err is human. To be involved in a network of evil and global criminal corruption is inhuman.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the concern with George Webb and others - they know the information has leaked or will leak, so they are getting in front of it, much like how Alex Jones covers conspiracies after the facts have already been exposed, and are doing what they can to muddy the waters, dilute the truth, justify the criminal corruption as a 'necessary evil' to maintain order, and that they are sorry and won't do it again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump must be forced to fully drain the swamp or it will continue. The truth has always been known by some. The only way for real change is Common Global Knowledge of the truth. This is why they need to dilute the real truth with fake news, muddy water, boogeymen, the Zika virus, and the Kardashians. This is why they are parading Ashton Kutcher out in front saying "nothing to see here", we have our man on the case. It is all a game to them. They are just moving the chess pieces around and shifting their strategy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The key to solving the entire puzzle is not some distant and abstract crime ring. The key lies in Racine, Wisconsin. Everything is connected there and it is very real and will start a domino effect to prove how everything is connected. You cannot indict a ghost. We must start with a real community with ties to every aspect of this global ring of trafficking and corruption.

            1) Intelligence agents (and assets) are not James Bond, but incompetent government employees.
2) Criminals are not evil geniuses, but are the dumbest elements of society.

             Difference between average joe and CIA is how far they are willing to go, how good of a liar they are, and whom they are willing to serve.  Beggars can't be choosers, they don't get the best and brightest, they make do with what they get.

             The really smart ones get recruited to the private-sector front companies.  And CIA is not monolithic, everyone isn't going to be cleared for the compartmentalized drugs and pedo activities done in the name of 'national security'.

            <p>
             Alefantis is creepy as hell, though.  Can't help but be reminded of Shaw and Ferrie in JFK.

            Whoa so the celebrity dinner was like an interview for the pedo club. I assume their reactions were analyzed in detail.

            OP, hubris makes people do shockingly foolish things. He probably considered himself untouchable ... by those outside the club.

            My current theory is that JP is not necessarily in the provider or seller side, but more like a customer. Alefantis however is the salesman. Comet Ping Pong is a honeybot or "the cash desk" and that's why they use so obvious pedo signals. It's like adverising. They need to tell to all pedophiles that "hey, we are one of you, we sell kids, come here". But they don't want anybody, they want the important people. The people in key positions of society. CIA helps him with that by using their connections and introducing James and his "family" to right people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next step is the delivery / shipment phase. Epstein island was one of those. They fly the customer (Dyncorp connection) to place like Epstein island, filled with hidden cameras, offer them the product and record the act. Mission complete. Now they have a footage of the target doing horrible things and they can blackmail that people for rest of his life. After that the target is very valuable and CIA will help him to get highest position in society if not already are. After that every horror they do is covered up. Overlooking their crimes and personal sins are the sacrifices CIA makes to keep their puppets in power. Years and years of this overlooking makes these sick people feel themself like gods who can do anything they want without consequences, so some of them will take it to the absolute limits. Just look e.g. Ted Heath.
           </p>
           <p>
            Abravomivich could also be a salesman. She has connections to highest rank people like royal people etc. and she is like a magnet to weird people. It all matches.
           </p>
           <p>
            My next guestion is that is the CIA doing this or is it just a tool, filled with those "customers".

            Hi - I wrote the big CIA thread post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are my answers.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             I think that James Alefantis is second generation (or beyond) MK-ULTRA brainwashing. In other words, he's so far embedded in CIA corruption, evil, rituals, and abuse, that is has a completely warped sense of reality and an impaired sense of danger.
            </li>
            <li>
             See above.
            </li>
            <li>
             I don't know if Podesta is a CIA asset. He could be a customer of the CIA, rather than a merchant/asset.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            One thing you will find is that a lot of this evil is old (Kissinger, Soros, Clintons), and that this older generation has no real skills with the Internet or emails.

             Dude, really well researched post. Thanks for sharing what you know. It's clear why JFK wanted "to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds." Trump has to play it smarter. The openness of emails ruins CIA today ie. Hillary/Benghazi/Podesta

            When you do illegal, shitty stuff long enough, you begin to think everyone around you accept it as you have and that you won't get caught.
           </p>
           <p>
            How many idiots out there post on Instagram showing pounds of pot of rolling massive blunts bragging about it? Why do shitheads brag about how many times they have drove drunk and not got into a crash or been caught? Because when you do these things enough without consequence it becomes normal to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one ever said these people are smart. Just because you are a CIA asset does not make you CIA. It just makes you a pawn with protection that is liable to bring the whole thing down. Part of me thinks all of this posting about "kill rooms" and the pic of the girl taped to the table is a cry for help and that they want to be outed so it is over with. If you really want to traffic kids or do bad shit to them and not get caufht so to can keep be be a sick fuck, why post anything at all? If I wanted to make a living dealing drugs I would never ever state what I was doing to anyone other than who needed to know.

            I think people that engage in this type of depravity thrive on living on the edge, the more they get away with it, the more over confident they become. It is part of their narcistic personality type, they literally think they are untouchable. The adage pride comes before a fall, is especially fitting when you consider these elites, actually cultivate a sense of pride. I recall pride is one of the seven deadly sins!

            None of us would even notice this stuff unless it was brought to our attention last year. So why? Because they could, and they have gotten away with it for at least twenty years.

            Same said about Barack Obama....A man who can't prove he is a US citizen rolls into town and become president....but no one of substance speaks against him...maybe they had some pizza dough trapped between their fillings.

            Why?  Because Hillary was a 100% sure thing to be President and they had absolutely no fear of prosecution, even if/when they were found out.  President Trump is a massive black swan event, everything happening now needs to be viewed in that context.

            1)2)3) Because they got sloppy, complacent and cocky. They've been also trying to desensitize us too rapidly to their perverted views. And with social media most people are looking to connect. When you have a bunch of sick perverted satanists they need to seek out others like them because they can't relate to normal folks like us.There's way too much information to hide now, though.

            They reached the tipping point in history where all the negative and terrible things they have done have caught up to them. The internet, information processing, wikileaks, social media, Donald Trump, BREXIT, truthers, investigative journalists and the failure of MSM all converged and pushed the truth out faster than they can scrub or censor it.
           </p>
           <p>
            This goes way beyond CIA, but it's a good place to start. There is a colossal spider web of global NGOS and charities involved in all of this.

            These evil deviants never intended to hide anything.  They are/were in the process of TRANSFORMING society into their own sick and twisted image.  Everything has been overt, intentional, and systematic. 'Our world is better than yours' is a comment I saw time after time though the IG accounts of those who had a degree of separation from COMET.  Lot's of satanic shit and the frequency of 666, too. Their plan to gradually and fundamentally transform the world places them at the top of the power structure. With most of the intel services, politicians and media in their back pocket, they have little to fear.

             Yes.  In the future, they have 99% already achieved, the very concepts of freedom, spirituality, and self defense will be incomprehensible to the slaves who love their slave plantation masters.  The few remaining people, mainly old, who understand what is going on are nearly impotent, purged from positions of power.  We failed to do anything about the Fed, JFK, RFK, MLK, the USS Liberty, SRA in the 1980s, the Franklin scandal, Waco, OKC, Ruby Ridge, 9/11, the GFC, Sandy Hook etc, etc, etc.  Pedogate or Pizzagate is our last stand.  If we loose this one our grandchildren will be little more than microchipped cattle.

              No! they are not going to take colors from me too.   (I'm not arguing with you or your statement, but banishing their hubris to think they can OWN a color given in nature by the creator to a flower, which is also a color of ascension and artistic creativity and a lot more)  They do not own the colors granted by God to all of us - I will fight for colors alongside the other fights!  I'm tired of red being misused symbolically too - our very own blood shows it belongs to humanity.

             Optimism with Trump should be limited. The only way he will really drain the swamp is if he is forced to due to Common Global Knowledge of evil and criminal corruption with real accountability and full disclosure.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were trying to bring everything out in the open so that everything is gray, not black and white. If you mix enough colors everything turns neutral. Although it is possible Trump may do the right thing, think about the alternative - that he is another Paul Ryan deal maker who sweeps in at just the right time like Ashton Kutcher to cut deals and cover everything up. Will Trump lock Hillary up, or say how great she is and that she has 'suffered enough'?
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember the devil's greatest trick was to deceive others into believing he did not exist. The barometer for truth and justice is none other than Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's district (with good friend Reince Priebus). Everything ties back to Racine in one way or another and it is a cesspool of evil and criminal corruption. If Trump does not drain that swamp, he has no intention of draining the bigger swamp.

              Nobody doubts he isn't on the inside... At the top it's all internal warfare over sustainability... and there are those who fall away from the fallen even from time to time...  It's a terribly mixed bag of nuts and very hard to call...  We have to go hard at their infrastructure and kingpins... We have to tare it the hell up and hard, never relenting, never being satisfied.

Rubio seems comprimised....stories out there he is a coke head and possibly a pedophile....

            Another strong reason for all of this is that they are following the steps to make it so they no longer have to hide what they do. They're bringing it out in the open in calculated ways intended to lead to acceptance. The old 'if you can't beat 'em, join 'em' philosophy.

             There would have to be a war, not because they would cause it, but because the general public would never accept it.  In spite of the MSM saying they do.  There would be millions of lone wolf workplace violence attackers and hate criminals organizing and attacking until the whole thing comes down.

            Remember they have had many "assets" do these things. Remember Franklin cover up, and so many others. Got shut down and whistleblowers silenced in more ways than we imagine.Permantely. They even now take flights together, tail numbers on planes and helicopters. The list is endless. Even asset planted journalists have spoken out but they are gone now. Assets are used, protected, &amp; if exposed in horrible ways they are gone.

            the fact that everything you listed hasn't lead to any official investigations proves they know they can get away with anything. They need to advertise themselves first of all, 2nd of all they get off at hiding in plain sight.

            I read an article in 2007 now gone, that the CIA goes into countries before we bomb them, to set up the orphanages for the wayward children left without parents.
It said they are not caring for the children, they are setting it up to traffic and sell them. They are just another commodity of war. CHA ching!$ And it's always contractor DynCorp as they always get caught.
I used to get angry at president after president for giving them contracts! Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            I learned from George Webb after 14 yrs. that when the CIA was being set up, they themselves set up DynCorp to work for them in this horrific way. 
CIA should be disbanded as they don't work for u.s
They work for the Pentagon and not with our tax dollars. Just black money in kids, drugs, etc.

              Everything connects to Agenda 21 and secret societies intertwined across governments and associations - see Racine, Wisconsin and the Zika Virus, Sustainability and the Knights of Pythias for just a small sample of how everything connects to Racine. It is an experimentation lab and playground for the evil and corrupt elite much like DC but on a smaller more tightly controlled scale. It is the key to solving pizzagate and draining the swamp, and it is Paul Ryan's district.

               Ever wonder why so much of this world is 'upside down'?  Because it has been 'inverted' by occultists/Satanists. Satanic inversion is the term they use.  Medicine that keeps people sick and addicted.  Education that destroys ability to think logically.  News that lies to you constantly.  Investment advisors that are actually trying to take your money.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have to expose them as sociopaths and occultists.  That is all.  There is no cure for sociopathy, which is why they fear exposure so much.  Once you are identified as a sociopath, there is no more playing the victim (a real specialty).  IDing them as occultists is important because it reveals their modus operandi and goals.  The goal is essentially to turn people into human livestock.  Slaves that do not know they are slaves.

              I dug up an old 1987 scandal concerning UNICEF Brussels office and child abuse.
To my surprise another VOAT commenter found out that secret services were involved.
