            I think you need to watch this 28 minutes video to understand how bad Soros is. You haven't even scratched the surface yet, unfortunately.

           <p>
            Here are some facts to remember and take note of.
           </p>
           <p>
            1-
            <strong>
             Hungarian Jewish man who escaped the holocaust by posing as a Christian Godson to a government official bribed by his father during WW2 and who, at age 14, not only watched hundreds of thousands of Jews get shipped off to the death camps, but who was also sent there to confiscate their property.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            When asked if it was difficult, George answers: "No. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don't see the connection, but it created no problem at all. There was no sense that I shouldn't be there. If I wasn't there, of course I wasn't doing it, somebody else would be taking it away anyhow. Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt."
           </p>
           <p>
            2-
            <strong>
             Amasses billions through ruthless business deals to then donate most of it to the advancement of his personal globalist foundations.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In Russia, he pledged a hundred million dollars to scientists who might otherwise have sold their expertise to bidders like Iran or Iraq. 
"I am one person who at one time engages in amoral activities and that the rest of the time, TRIES to be moral."
           </p>
           <p>
            3-
            <strong>
             Destabilises governments by buying and selling its currency.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Answers to no one, makes huge bets on whole countries and economies. Plunged much of Asia into a depression. Has been blamed for the financial collapse of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and Russia. Is proud of it and repeats with a snug smile:  "All of the above."
           </p>
           <p>
            4-
            <strong>
             An atheist that thinks the world needs to be protected by people like himself who are playing a game.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "I'm a player and I think all players should be regulated. There has to be rules of the game."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Soros hedge funds operate off shore in the Netherland Antilles to avoid scrutiny by the 'Securities and Exchange Commission'. So even while Soros tells Congress and the Treasury that hedge funds must be regulated to stop the global crisis, he is avoiding the rules.
This man is a carnivore of the first order and he says he is basically there to make money. "I cannot and do not look at the consequences of what I do".
           </p>
           <p>
            5-
            <strong>
             He donated to Haiti, a country that has less money in the bank than he does.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Went to Haiti with Hillary Clinton to take a look at some of the projects his foundations is funding. Helping hospitals in particular. No comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            6-
            <strong>
             Gave South Africa's Mandela advice on how to reduce the exposure of financial speculative attacks. This is the old "stop me before I kill again" approach
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            "Whether I or somebody else does whatever is happening in the market, really doesn't make any difference to the outcome. I don't feel guilty because I'm engaged in an amoral activity which is not meant to have anything to do with guilt."
           </p>
           <p>
            7-
            <strong>
             Soros is responsible for both the Ukraine and Georgia crisis.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            He was banned from his own country, Hungary and in 2015, Mr. Putin did disband every Soros related political action group in Russia.
           </p>
           <p>
            8-
            <strong>
             Soros is a puppet master and a member of the shadow government.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros founds and funds RADICAL liberal groups such as Moveon.org, the Open Society Institute and Foundation, the Ella Baker Foundation, the Apollo Alliance, the Center for American Progress, the notorious Students for a Democratic Society and Media Matters among many, many other radical groups and foundations.

                I like the new design, but personally, l prefer the background color of the original card (dark salmon/pink color). I find it a little easier on the eyes. That's just my opinion. But for the rest it is really great :D

                She is but there's not a great deal on her. Basically she's one of the more damning characters in the pizzagate saga but I wouldn't worry bout it right now as there are more important people to get to.

             No plan, but some suggested for crowdfunding, production cost would be around few dollars per deck (1000 first order)
            </p>
            <p>
             Other idea is providing the cards to the "meaty trumps" company and they could produce them.
(they already made this kinds of decks for UK)
            </p>
            <p>
             Producing the cards brings other difficulties...
            </p>

             Suggestions always welcome

              You might have to try a multi-pronged approach and see what sticks to the wall. The layout, content, information, colors, etc. are all very eye-pleasing which means they can get normies' attention right away. Since your intent is (correct me if I'm wrong) to inform and raise awareness, it would even work for the rest of us to print them out on 8x10 paper. Walmart (evil as they may be) does very good quality printing at low prices. We could leave them in common areas such as bulletin boards, waiting rooms, tape them to bus stop shelter walls, etc. My guess is there would have to be no more than six cards for an 8x10 sheet of paper. When you're ready, if you could post them as print ready artwork (high-res .jpgs should be fine, or as a PDF) then we as individuals could download them and spread the word far and wide.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit to add: Even if we don't cut them up we can post them as sheets. On the back we could hand write where people can find out more about the cards if you end up making a website or something.

                An individual 4x6 print shipped to one's home is as cheap as .09 each. An 8x10 is $1.79 and would have probably six cards on it, maybe 8.

                  The downside to that is that the impression it gives is that the card manufacturer (you) is just trying to make money and doesn't necessarily give a shit about the message. And you know how well that worked for Pizzagate gear. You might go a different direction so that the emphasis is more on the message. Such as something like, "Find out more by collecting all X (total number available) cards in the deck. Go to [website].com."

                    Ahh. Thought it was another slogan idea or what to write on the back of the cards, lol. I'm a long ways from the closest Walmart or else I'd run down there and print some out.

            Slogan idea: Reach out to the truth. Expose the shadows hidden from plain sight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Persona 4 reference to the game's central theme. Great fit given what these cards seek to do. Given that in P5, the shadows of evil people reflect the sick desires said villains hide from the masses, we can make a reference to exposing shadows too.
           </p>
           <p>
            The icon idea could be used to indicate the type of villain someone is. Politician, "philantropist", corporate executive, banker, entertainer, media, goon, the possibilities are endless.

              If you hide them in an ornamental way you're just passing on that logo/message/evilness. You're helping to normalize it. However, if you include it and with an explanation of what it REALLY is, you can help break the cognitive dissonance.

            The Soros score for cockyness is not correct: It should read "TTR", Through The Roof. The dude thinks he is God himself and is on record stating he feels god-like.

              Hey.  Hi.  I also think Soros should have a higher score for cockyness as well.  He is between the Deep State and the Rothschilds and I think of him as pretty cocky and frightening.  Would not want to be in the same room with him.  For some reason I would expect evil to pour from every pore.

                Clintons physical threat is at 70 however her and bill are killing machines they've got about 100 murders of informants and people who used to work for them that know all their dirty secrets. The Clinton charity is a fucking joke full of corruption. Please change the 70 to 110!!!! It would be more accurate. One phone call and the Clinton henchmen will gangstalk you, throw you in jail or "suicide" you.  Love the cards btw!!!!
