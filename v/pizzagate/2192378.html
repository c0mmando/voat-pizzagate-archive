            Yes that is why the sodomites that were "born that way" propped up Barry Hussein from Kenya/Indonesia to self-identify as President.  They liked him because he was raised by a trans-nanny and also showed a willingness to groom young children, including sending his pretend daughter to intern with Weinstein.

            Yes, transgender is the gateway to having children self-determine sex. They're screwing with the child's mind all to get this end game. It's sick, sick, sick. Complete perversion.

            That is exactly what they intend to do. And, they are starting younger than 9 or 10. I read an article somewhere, don't remember where, in which a doctor at a clinic for gender dysmorphia (gender confused) said her youngest "patient" was three or four years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            You read that right. They want a word in which a 3 year old supposedly declared that it wanted to be transgender. This is already in places in the U.S. Today, this is happening. There are parents sitting in clinic waiting rooms to see the "doctor" because their 4 year old made the declaration that it wanted to be a boy instead of a girl, and they give these kids hormones.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck posting about gender "therapy" abuse though because Mil Falcon has bluntly stated, and I could go back and screen cap it, that discussions about gender changing hormones is not related to pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thats right, our mod said threads about gender hormones have no place at pizzagate. I'm not making this shit up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I tried to post about this and Mil Falcon deleted it along with threads I tried to post about Planned Parenthood being involved in it.

             And now they have a new law in Canada that allows the government to take children away from parents that don't go along with their children's transgender identities. I am not sure whether it implies that they refuse to "treat" their children with hormones. Probably.

              That is exactly what they have on their minds. They want it to be considered parental neglect/abuse if you don't follow the transgender "diagnosis" and give your child hormones.

            How can we as a society accept that little kids can take sex changing hormones? It boggles the mind.

             Those who've trangendered as adults strongly advocate 100% of everyone also wait until they're at least 18. Bodies are still developing making the transgender process far, far more risky.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also there are many who end up much, much happier keeping their bodies of birth completely intact while simply assuming the opposite identity. Choices of clothing, hairstyle, facial hair or waxing, makeup, etc create the illusion of the opposite or desired sex. However the change isn't near as drastic as surgery and there are far less serious side effects.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there are those who naturally prefer dressing and appearing as somewhat unisex at least temporarily.  You'll notice this has always been common in the arts community especially when jeans and t-shirts became standard cheap and practical outfits for women. Again no real need to go through as drastic a decision as surgery. Plenty of Western names will work for either sex like Randy, Sandy, Terry.

             Polanski has been accused of pedo behavior with at least 4 different little girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             Monsanto has authorized Sweden to manufacture weed killer/insecticide to use in CA and FL crops. It's still illegal to use in Sweden due to seriously harming the reproductive capabilities of bees and butterflies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Monsanto knows it also makes men far less masculine, seriously interfering with testosterone levels. You'll see more babies actually born with gender characteristics of both sexes as a direct result. TPTB want a docile population that desires far, far fewer offspring. Population reduction achieved.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't forget pedos preferring the very young don't care of their victim is male or female. Secondary sex characteristics haven't yet developed in pre-teens. So the child naturally appears somewhat unisex. Note the heavy trend towards unisex professional teen and young adult models as well.
