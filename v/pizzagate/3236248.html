            LADY ASTOR AND THE "CLIVEDEN SET"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Nancy Astor was the first woman to sit as a Member of Parliament in the  House of Commons."
           </p>
           <p>
            "After marrying Waldorf Astor she moved into the Buckinghamshire pile of Cliveden.
A right-wing, upper class group of intellectuals that came to be known as the ‘Cliveden Set’ formed around her and developed their own form of fascism whilst supporting the appeasement campaign of Neville Chamberlain. Although Nancy herself said she supported German rearmament there is some dispute as to how deep the Nazi affiliations went with her and her Cliveden coterie."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Nancy and Waldorf used Cliveden for entertaining on a lavish scale. The combination of the house, its setting and leisure facilities offered on the estate—boating on the Thames, horse riding, tennis, swimming, croquet and fishing—made Cliveden a destination for film stars, politicians, world-leaders, writers and artists. The heyday of entertaining at Cliveden was between the two World Wars when the Astors held regular weekend house parties. Guests at the time included: Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Joseph Kennedy, George Bernard Shaw, Mahatma Gandhi, Amy Johnson, F.D. Roosevelt, H.H. Asquith, T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), A.J. Balfour and the writers Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, and Edith Wharton. The tradition of high-profile guests visiting the house continues to this day, largely due to the house’s conversion into a hotel."

            Meghan Markle, a Fatal Duel and the Affair That Rocked Parliament: Inside England’s Cliveden House
           </p>
           <p>
            "Meghan Markle is in the middle of renovating her future residence, Frogmore Cottage, and as a member of the royal family, she has no need for a hotel room. But before she tied the knot and became the Duchess of Sussex, she spent her last night as a non-royal at the extremely regal Cliveden House in Berkshire."
"The second Duke of Buckingham built Cliveden House as a hunting lodge in 1666 for his mistress, Anna Maria the Countess of Shrewsbury, and he fought a duel on her behalf with her husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, in 1668, which ended in the Earl’s death.
However, Cliveden House’s most scandalous claim to fame is that it’s where the Profumo affair began. John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War under Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, first became entangled with the teenage girl Christine Keeler, who was also linked to a Russian spy, at the home’s swimming pool in 1965; it culminated in Macmillan’s resignation."

            CLIVEDEN/PROFUMO AFFAIR (CHRISTINE KEELER)
           </p>
           <p>
            "Keeler was raised by her mother, Julie Payne, and stepfather, Edward Huish, in a house that was made from 2 converted railway carriages in the Berkshire village of Wraysbury.
Keeler couldn’t attend the school as the school health inspector said that she was suffering from malnutrition and was sent to a holiday home in Littlehampton.
At a dress shop in London’s Soho, she found work as a model at the age of 15.
On April 17, 1959, at the age of 17, Keeler gave birth to a son after an affair with an American sergeant. However, the child survived for just 6 days.
In the summer of 1959, she left Wraysbury for London.
While in London, Keeler initially worked at a restaurant in Baker Street as a waitress.
She also worked as a dancer in a topless club in London where she met an English Osteopath and artist- Stephen Ward. It was Stephen Ward who introduced her to Profumo, at Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire in 1961.
When one of her lovers, apparently in a jealous fit, fired a gun outside Mr. Ward’s home, where she was staying, led to court proceedings that surfaced many of the details of the Profumo affair. Ms. Keeler also had to serve 6 months in prison for perjury."

             Art in Embassies links to Racine, Wisconsin and the beginnings of the Illuminati with Adam Weishaupt.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Lest anyone start to think so highly of the Republican party – think again! It was started in the early 1850s by Horace Greeley and Charles Dana – both associated with the New York Tribune and regularly published the works of Karl Marx – at the Racine WI Communist Commune! The Racine Commune was one of 50 Communes started by the American Association of Unions – itself Communist, of course. Our present day Republican Party was not named in honor of our Republic but rather in honor of the first Republican party – Started by Violent Illuminist, known as Jacobins!"
            </p>
            <p>
             "It really all begins in May of 1776 – in Bavaria where Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati Order. If you look up the planks of the Illuminati (a bit difficult to do because it is supposedly so secret as to not even exist – we all know the line from the movie “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil”; “The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince us he doesn’t exist.”) you will find that those planks mirror the planks of the communist manifesto. Since that set of “principles” came some 60 years before the manifesto, the truth is the Illuminati spawned the commies and Marx – if he actually wrote the manifesto actually softened the Illuminati planks."
            </p>
            <p>
             Part of the Connection to Art in Embassies and Racine "The Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art ("The Johnson Museum") is an art museum located on the northwest corner of the Arts Quad on the main campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Its collection includes two windows[1] from Frank Lloyd Wright's Darwin D. Martin House, and more than 35,000 other works in the permanent collection.[2] It was designed by architect I.M. Pei and is known for its distinctive concrete facade. President Deane Waldo Malott established the original University Art Museum in 1953. The A. D. White House was renovated to house Cornell's art collections.[3] The current museum, constructed in 1973, is named after its primary benefactor, Herbert Fisk Johnson, Jr., a Cornell Class of 1922 graduate, head of S.C. Johnson &amp; Sons ("Johnson Wax"), and a former member of the university's Board of Trustees."
            </p>
            <p>
             "In addition to continuing its support of individual exhibits of American art to foreign nations, the USIA and the Department of State also embarked on new programs designed to acquaint the world with American painting. One new initiative involved working more closely with U.S. businesses that owned large art collections in order to facilitate their exhibition overseas. More spectacularly, the State Department established the Art in Embassies program in 1964, which sought to turn U.S. embassies into small art galleries."
            </p>
            <p>
             "In 1962, Edward R. Murrow, who was then director of the USIA, proclaimed a 'new and, I think, significant development' in terms of art patronage in the United States. This was the 'increasing interest of large corporations - Big Business as an institution, as opposed to the big businessman as an individual - in giving financial backing to our performing and creative arts.' As the 'interpreter of America to the rest of the world', Murrow was particularly excited by this development. 'The mere fact that profit-motivated corporations in a price-directed economy find good reason to subsidize the arts speaks eloquently against those who see in our system only the grossest materialism.'
            </p>
            <p>
             "HE WAS PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THE OFFER BY S.C. JOHNSON &amp; SON, INC. (THE FLOOR WAX GIANT) TO SEND ITS LARGE COLLECTION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART AROUND THE WORLD, SPONSORED BY USIA."
            </p>
            <p>
             So, in summary, Racine, Wisconsin is a main root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption across every aspect of the network that is directly tied through Art in Embassies, political parties, major industries, freemasons, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Pilgrims Society and other groups involved at the highest levels around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is directly linked to the Council of 13 and Committee of 300 through Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Reynolds and Johnson blood lines with connections to British and Dutch royalty among others. This is why corrupt Boy Scouts Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus yield so much undeserved power. They are the front men along with others like Ashton Kutcher covering up the real true evils that we now know as Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             DANA HIRED KARL MARX. Marx's mother was a Rothschild relative.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Dana was “the most valuable of Greeley’s assistants,” wrote Greeley biographer Jeter Allen Isely. “He was a man of broad, general intelligence, a hard worker, a good administration and an formed and charming conversationalist.” Isely wrote: “Immediately upon joining the Tribune, Dana went abroad to cover the 1848 revolutions in Europe, where he came under the influence of the socialist Pierre Joseph Proudhon, and where he met Karl Marx, whom he subsequently engaged as a London correspondent for the Tribune. Dana returned to New York City in 1849, and until the Civil War was regarded as the ‘rising hope of the stern and unbending’ Radicals.’ His style was concise and firm. He was well versed in several languages, and enjoyed expounding foreign economic, political and military complexities.”
            </p>
            <p>
             BROOK FARM : "CHRISTIAN" COMMUNE
"Charles A. Dana was appointed managing editor of the Tribune by Horace Greeley in 1849 after Dana returned from an extended trip to Europe. Dana probably met Greeley at Brook Farm, an experiment in Christian socialism where Dana was resident in the early 1840s and where Greeley was a frequent visitor."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Dana then sought to go into the cotton-trading business with George W. Chadwick and New York Congressman Roscoe Conkling, who had been defeated for reelection that fall. But when Dana arrived in Memphis to conduct his business, Dana instead recommended to General Grant that he shut down this cotton trade completely — effectively destroying Dana’s own business interests. It was at this point that Grant issued his infamous order to “Refuse all permits to come south of Jackson for the present. The Isrealites especially should be kept out…” According to Grant biographer William S. McFeely: “Grant was fed up with the cotton speculators and the greedy suppliers of goods to his armies, but rather than attack the entire voracious horde, which included an astonishing assortment of entrepreneurs — among them Charles A. Dana and Roscoe Conkling, for example — Grant singled out the Jews.”

             MORE ON BROOK FARM: NOT IN RACINE
"In 1839 Dana entered Harvard College (now Harvard University), but poor health and lack of money forced him to leave in 1841. From 1841 to 1846 he lived at the utopian Brook Farm community, where he was one of the trustees, but, when his ideals for social change were unfulfilled, he left it and went to work for the Boston Weekly Chronotype. The next year he joined the staff of the New York Tribune, and in 1848 he wrote letters from Europe on the revolutionary movements of that year. Returning to the Tribune in 1849, he became its managing editor and actively promoted the antislavery cause in the paper."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Brook Farm, formally The Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education, short-lived utopian experiment in communal living (1841–47). The 175-acre farm was located in West Roxbury, Mass. (now in Boston). It was organized and virtually directed by George Ripley, a former Unitarian minister, editor of The Dial (a critical literary monthly), and a leader in the Transcendental Club, an informal gathering of intellectuals of the Boston area. He was aided by his wife, Sophia Dana Ripley, a woman of wide culture and academic experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the articles of agreement, Brook Farm was to combine the thinker and the worker, to guarantee the greatest mental freedom, and to prepare a society of liberal, cultivated persons, whose relations with each other would permit a more wholesome and simpler life than could be led amid the pressure of competitive institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
             The project was financed by the sale of stock, a purchaser of one share automatically becoming a member of the institute, which was governed by a board of directors. The profits, if any, were divided into a number of shares corresponding to the total number of man-days of labour, every member entitled to one share for each day’s labour performed. Among the original shareholders were journalist Charles A. Dana and author Nathaniel Hawthorne, who served together as the first directors of agriculture. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson Alcott, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Peabody, Theodore Parker, and Orestes A. Brownson were among its interested visitors."

              INTERESTING BLOODLINE CONNECTIONS:
             </p>
             <p>
              Sophia Dana Ripley, co-founder of The Brook Farm (influenced Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson) was descended from Francis Dana, a U.S. Continental Congressman, signer of the Articles of Confederation, a leader of the Sons of Liberty and a judge of the Supreme court of Massachusetts.
             </p>
             <p>
              She and Charles A. Dana also had a common Dana ancestor.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Gibson Girl" artist and publisher Charles Dana Gibson descended from Francis Dana's sister. James DeWolf, the powerful Rhode Island slave trading family founder, was his great grandfather. (See JAMES DeWolf AND THE RHODE ISLAND SLAVE TRADE.)  Charles' wife, Irene Langhorne, daughter of a ruined southern planter, was his inspiration and model for the "Gibson Girl." Irene's sister Nancy became Lady Astor after marrying Waldorf Astor (English branch that built the Waldorf hotel) who descended from John Jacob Astor. J.J. Astor made his money in the opium and fur trade, which was invested in Manhattan real estate. The Astors became very powerful in New York, and the English branch became entitled gentry.

             This is the clothing industry which uses "models" and global sweatshop labor.....
            </p>
            <p>
             "PVH Corp., formerly known as the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, is an American clothing company which owns brands such as Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, IZOD, Arrow, Warner's, Olga, True &amp; Co., and Geoffrey Beene. The company also licenses brands such as BCBG Max Azria, Chaps (men's dress shirts until 2020), Sean John, Kenneth Cole New York, JOE Joseph Abboud, Michael Kors, and Speedo (the latter under an exclusive perpetual license from Speedo International for the North American market). PVH is partly named after Dutch immigrant John Manning Van Heusen, who in 1910 invented a new process that fused cloth on a curve."
            </p>
            <p>
             "PVH has several sourcing facilities worldwide, located in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, Thailand, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Taiwan. The corporation employs over 12,000 people worldwide"
            </p>
            <p>
             TRUMP CONNECTION:
"PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants."

By 2016, she was a has-been. She dared to do a show about vaccines and autism. AFTER THAT HER CAREER WAS OVER.
