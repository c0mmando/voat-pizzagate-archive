<p>&quot;We\'re independent Marxists who respect the struggles for self-determination and progress of oppressed nations,&quot; says WWP. </p>
<p>&quot;To disseminate its message to the public, WWP publishes the online newsletter Workers World. Advocating socialist revolution and the abolition of private property in the United States, WWP is a staunch supporter of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il ... it backed <strong><strong>Saddam Hussein</strong></strong> in his pre-war conflicts with the United States. WWP also supported the Soviet invasions of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. During the Cold War it always sided with the Communists, <strong><strong>against America</strong></strong>. In the 1960s, Marcy himself led demonstrations against the Vietnam War and called for the victory of the Vietcong.</p>
<p>With a membership of approximately 2,000 people, WWP has been extremely effective in organizing the massive anti-war rallies of recent years, some of which have drawn hundreds of thousands of participants. It is the driving force behind Ramsey Clark’s International Action Center and International ANSWER; WWP activists run both organizations. Several key ANSWER officials — including Brian Becker, Sara Flounders, Teresa Gutierrez, Larry Holmes, and Sarah Sloan — are WWP members. </p>
<p>WWP was also a Cosponsoring Organization of the April 25, 2004 &quot;March for Women\'s Lives,&quot; a Washington, D.C. rally advocating unrestricted access to taxpayer-funded <strong><strong>abortion-on-demand</strong></strong>. 
As a political party, WWP has run its own <strong><strong>candidates</strong></strong> for U.S. President and Vice President in every election since 1980. These candidates have included Dierdre Griswold, Teresa Gutierrez, Larry Holmes, Gloria LaRiva, Monica Moorehead, and John Parker.”</p>
<p>And from Wikipedia:
“ANSWER characterizes itself as anti-imperialist, and its steering committee consists of <strong><strong>socialists, communists, civil rights advocates, and left-wing or progressive organizations from the Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Filipino, Haitian, and Latin American communities</strong></strong>. Many of ANSWER\'s lead organizers had ties to the International Action Center, and Workers World Party at the time of ANSWER\'s founding.”

<p><strong><strong>Soros ties to Media Matters</strong></strong>: “So far this election cycle, the billionaire investor has donated over $25 million to Clinton and other Democratic Party members, with more expected before November. Soros has also funded <strong><strong>Media Matters</strong></strong>, founded by David Brock, who operates on behalf of Clinton in several dubious capacities—like running the Correct the Record SuperPAC, which hires Internet trolls to spread pro-Clinton ideologies on the Internet.”

<p>“… <strong><strong>The organization that funds ANSWER is Media Matters, founded by David Brock and John Podesta, both Clintonites.</strong></strong> It is staffed by members of the Marxist, Workers World Party, and specializes in anti-America rallies and immigrant rights protests.

<p>Alliance for Global Justice- $50,000 donations in 2004 and 2006 from Soros’ Open Society Foundation.</p>
<p>Alliance for Global Justice shares its address (1247 E Street SE Washington, DC 20003) with these other foundations/groups:</p>
<p>Code Pink</p>
<p>Mexicans Without Borders</p>
<p>Nicaragua Network (pro-communist) </p>
<p>…and…</p>
<h2>A.N.S.W.E.R. (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism).</h2>
<p><strong><strong>Tl;dr:</strong></strong> Worker’s World is funded by A.N.S.W.E.R Coalition. </p>
<p>A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition is funded by Media Matters (Podesta/Brock) (and <em>possibly</em> Soros?)</p>
<p>Both groups (WW &amp; A) have indisputable ties to terrorism, communism, and a whole bunch of other shady shit (Pro-N.Korea shit/Osama bin Laden shit. Shit in general).</p>
<p>Media Matters is funded by George Soros.</p>
<p>ALL THESE RIOTS AND PROTESTS GOING ON NOW ARE BACKED BY NOT ONLY HILLARY’S SUPPORTERS/COMPADRES/KIDDIE DIDDLER FRIENDS (Brock/Podesta/God only knows who else) … but they are all backed by George Soros (surprised, right?)...just like we assumed but hadn’t been able to connect the dots. My dots may be scrambled but they all still connect. </p>
<p>Will focus more on this in the next few days; I have a fucking migraine from staring at this screen.</p>',

My dots may be scrambled but they all still connect.

            Man, I skimmed and will read more in depth when I'm not distracted but I watched the docu yesterday Everything is a rich man's trick- someone posted it here, anyways. The end talks about how there is no one left for the US to hate/fear and that US needs an enemy to continue the gears of our slavery/their wealth so that is why they have been shipping Muslims in and poking the bear on both sides to stir up trouble. They still want their next big war.

                  I think the very basic assumptions at the beginning of pizzagate are false.   I think we are miles apart from showing that Podesta was using coded language in his emails.

             If I did not connect the dots clearly enough for you, I apologize. Are you an expert on this? It sounds like you are- so if you could let me know who does fund ANSWER and provide a source that would be great. I will make sure to "Correct The Record", so to speak.

              AreWeSure-&gt;don't waste your time with this chomo-&gt; caught him/her saying "crisis actors aren't a thing".  That's so idiotic or shill I don't know where to begin, except maybe here:

             <p>
              So every time you see AreWeSure posting, please let people know not to engage with a liar/idiot/shill for this entity is just here to consume your time and draw your focus away from digging.

              Here's my expertise.  Soros would like to see Democrats in the White House.   ANSWER doesn't help that cause.  In fact, the bigger ANSWER is, the more that cause would be hurt.
