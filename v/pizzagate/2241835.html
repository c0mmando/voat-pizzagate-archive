<p>If you\'ve been following the leak of Don, Jr.\'s tweets to Assange, a new twist has been added. Now people are speculating that Don, Jr. leaked HIS OWN TWITTER EXCHANGES! Why? To get the above titled information out! </p>
<p>Here ... here\'s the claim that the link contained this info:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LizCrokin/status/930327589708644352">https://twitter.com/LizCrokin/status/930327589708644352</a></p>
<p>BREAKING: Wiki sent Don Jr a link that currently claims Seth Rich was their leaker, John Podesta had him murdered &amp; Podesta is a pedo‼️🍕</p>
<p>From Ann Khait: </p>
<p>BOMBSHELL: Wikileaks messaged Don Jr that Seth Rich was their leaker &amp; claims John Podesta had him murdered! <a href="http://www.wlsearch.tk">http://www.wlsearch.tk</a> </p>
<p>The entirety of the Don, Jr. message: Here is the entire chain of messages with <a href="https://voat.co/user/wikileaks">@wikileaks</a> (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak. How ironic! 1/3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These responses are contained IN Crokin\'s tweet. Just keep clicking to open (if you\'re confused). </p>
<p>Crokin\'s claim is amended by this tweet: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PGAngie1/status/930333748184326144">https://twitter.com/PGAngie1/status/930333748184326144</a></p>
<p>She means that she stated that it &quot;currently claims&quot; the info, which it does. Plus it is the link provided in Trump jrs email. Another fact. yes it is def news worthy enough to at least sound an alarm &amp; investigate how long that site has said that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now here\'s the tweet where it\'s alleged Don, Jr. leaked his own tweet. It\'s from Anna Kait again: </p>

<p>This looks like a coordinated leak. The timing for the media to cover this, Don Jr. tweeting his DMs, Donna Brazile and Elizabeth Warren distancing themselves from Hillary Clinton, President Trump making a huge announcement. All a coincidence?</p>

             It just fucking screams fake. And it repeats, not one, but two almost identical paragraphs. Seth Rich seems like the kind of guy who would proof read his death note.

            First of all there is no such thing as a "private twitter tweet" because of all the data surveillance. Nobody in their right mind at that level of government would send truly sensitive information through a tweet and expect it to stay secret for more than five seconds.

             It just proves how crazy Feinstein is to think that the POTUS or any other person would be nuts enough to put incriminating evidence in a DM. Not even Pedosta did that. They were using the DNC servers, but whoops!!! Those messages were copied!!!!

            I think this is CIA disinfo, because of the changes to the site in the archive, the reuse of known public images of Seth, and reuse of the "my/his name was seth rich" meme.

             Don't know what is inaccurate. I'm posting other people's tweets. If you know so much, tweet them and correct them. I felt it's a compelling subject and that members had a right to make up their own minds about what was going on.

              <strong>

               I made no claim, and since you used that as a basis for complaining, yes!
              </p>
              <p>
               There was no claim made. None! All I did was post tweets on a subject that is completely relevant to pizzagate. The subject seemed to have sent you into a tizzy. Maybe next you'll be alleging to have been seduced by Roy Moore!

               THE OFFICIAL WIKILEAKS SITE is confirming this is their correspondence with Don, Jr. The link I gave was IN THIS ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. It was taken out and dispersed by other accounts, but if you'd READ (do shills read? Probably not), you'd find that to be the case!

               You're blocked and eleven months wasted in building up any sort of credibility because if you had credibility, you'd have also complained about an identical post made another member here. It means I was targeted and targeting proves you're a shill.

              I never said the site was "fake;" I said the title of the post was inaccurate and misleading.
             </p>
             <p>
              That website was SENT to Don Jr. in
              <strong>
               OCTOBER 2016
              </strong>
              . And if you look up the history of the site, how it appeared when he got it, prior to Don Jr. releasing the photos, the site was potentially a WL dump site.
             </p>
             <p>
              HOWEVER, just this morning -- NOVEMBER 14th 2017 -- when traffic was being flooded to the site because of publicity of the link,
              <strong>
               the website was CHANGED to the Seth Rich materials
              </strong>
              you see now.
             </p>
             <p>
              So when DON JR got the link, it was not Seth Rich/Podesta related.
              <strong>
               THAT'S MY POINT

               Next question would who set up the site and why would Wikileaks use it of they didn't have control over it? Not like them to use something that could be manipulated to make them look bad. Did you see Mega Anons post from yesterday? Maybe this is part of the plan and Wikileaks changed it to get the news out?

                I had the same thought. While WL does mirror their site elsewhere for protection and to safehouse the backups, I am unsure who would have set this up originally and if WL ever had control of it. The registrant for the domain I believe is in Amsterdam.
               </p>
               <p>
                Neat if it WAS really Seth or somehow proved who killed him...but I am wary that the site only uses TWO pictures of Seth that are the ONLY two pictures out there for him. The kind of mind that would do this kind of multi-level bombshell reveal would likely be able to prove its legitimacy without a reasonable doubt.
               </p>
               <p>
                And if this is WL way of revealing this info to the masses, why not just come right out and say it?
               </p>
               <p>
                It was a fun way to spend the afternoon, but I haven't seen any evidence to prove with finality that this is real. Until then I take it with a grain of salt and applaud the creativity.

                 I don't think for a second that Seth set that site up, it would have been there from the jump. I also don't believe that Wikileaks would link to a domain that anyone could be controlling. Their enemies could set them up too easy like that.

                 This might be a government psyop, but it seems far too advanced to be a LARP. The picture over Hong Kong right as AF1 is flying over that area, all the coordination with happening events, IMO this person has inside info. We shall see real soon..

                  I believe the phrase we're looking for is...
                  <strong>
                   Tick Tock
                  </strong>

                  My biggest fear in following these kinds of links is wandering into a honeypot. If honest, non-pedo researchers can get swooped up innocently, the enemy can claim the same. If one of us is compromised, all of us are compromised.

            lol what a load of shit. It's funny, so many people see through the horse shit that is spammed here on voat, but that's clearly not a problem to you shill faggots, it's pretty clear that the whole point is you "muddle the field" as it were, flood voat with insane crap to make outsiders convinced this site is nothing but a bunch of crazies. It wont work.

               Since when would Wikileaks use a site they had no control over to get their information out? Why would they take a chance like that to ruin their perfect record of no bullshit? Did you get sick of the Don Quixote spinoffs?

             If you believe any of this is credible, you better be a shill. Either way, we don't need you here.

             I wouldn't know how Seth Rich would write a death note, but I am pretty sure he would proof read it. I'm also pretty sure that to get hired at the DNC you have a modicum of tact and wouldn't write a death note as if it was a shitty intro to a spoof comedy.
            </p>
            <p>
             To anyone unsure if this is legit or not(you really shouldn't be, honestly), just read the "death note" again. It's as if a teenager wrote and put it together. It repeats two paragraphs, the way it is written is almost cheery, there are no details our community don't already know, no personal details or anything.
