<p><strong>The pedogate web runs deeper than we ever imagined.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watched a documentary titled \'Montauk Chronicles\' (2015) over the weekend. It connected so many damn dots, all the 100k per year missing children, pedogate, elite connections and the rest. If you\'ve been researching things for over a decade, the amount of dots this documentary will join is staggering. Many of the links in it line up exactly with completely separate research I have done in many fields. I was expecting some edgy stuff about the philadelphia experiments but this blew my mind. I like to debunk things and couldn\'t debunk this, sadly.</p>
<p>This was simply the best documentary I have watched in a very long time in regards to the pedogate stuff, CIA and the rest of the shadow govt incl MK Ultra, Monarch etc. Keep in mind there are likely many of these places. Another thing; watch an Open Secret then this in the same week..</p>
<p>Word of warning though; If you\'ve ever been subjected to child abuse, even abductions or anything similar in your life proceed with caution, it is very accurate visually depicting those types of events. Took me a long time to get my head over watching almost identical sequences to much of what I experienced as a kid, (thankfully?) the latter type. E.g. literally describing the next sentences in the documentary watching it first time with a friend, including stories recounting a chair to them towards the beginning of the documentary. The fragments of memory that are there are freaky as all fuck and it was quite unsettling to unearth much of them again and actually understand more of what was happening. It\'s hard to figure things out with only tiny, short glimpses of events to recount from. I have also had similar experiences with high trauma events, e.g. decent motorcycle crashes, concussions etc so it makes sense. It\'s like your brain tries to protect you by burying shit.</p>
<p>If you really care for it, brush up on NLP/body language before watching. This is part of my work, the subjects in this video either were extensively trained and practised for the interview, or were almost totally telling the truth. The few times one or two lied seemed to be because of something they were not proud of.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed in the old, deleted thread, especially for your awesome feedback + support for one and another along with this movement. Ten months ago, pedogate was still a conspiracy to most, whilst some of us have known about it for decades. Montauk has been the same but for over 30-40 years. Sometimes we have to look to the past to learn the future. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Camp Hero in Montauk, there are still security guards patrolling the compound, even though it was abandoned in the 70\'s.
3ft thick concrete was poured into the underground access of the compound and evacuated suddenly.
We uses to sneak in there when we were teenagers. Take our trail horses on the back side and crawl through the fence.
The entire barrack was left just as it was in the 70\'s. Still dishes in the sink, curtains on the walls, etc.
They left in a hurry, and still don\'t want anyone to know what was underground.
Speculation include Nazi tech, aliens, underground complex, etc.</p>
<p>There is a large communications satellite right in the middle of town. About 5 miles away is the bunker. Going in through the back you see several underground entrances that appeared to at one time have airlocked bay doors. Those doors had huge &quot;bolts&quot; (don\'t know the tech term) in the sides that would extend outwards into the sides of the tunnel. You can tell that\'s how they were constructed because there was a bay door that was scrapped behind the complex. It reminded me of a fallout door.</p>
<p>The concrete was poured over those doors I believe. And no, it\'s solid, thick and unmovable. You wouldnt have time to chemically alter it bc of the patrols. One guard in a white, unmarked windowless transit van type vehicle, circling around 24/7.</p>
<p>The horses used to get spooked too. We had to leave them to graze up on a hill overlooking the camp.
My friends and I were just being stupid teens, but the whole place had a very scary vibe. You can tell something bad happened (happens) there.</p>
<p>Montauk is a hub for ET activity as well. I never believed in UFO\'s, etc. Until I actually got to witness one come over the horizon on the beach, hover above us, then pewwwwww, disappear at light speed away from us. The entire beach seemed to rumble.
We were at a bonfire, and there were hundreds on the beach at that time. People were freaking out...screaming and running to their cars. Us locals were used to it. We commenced our teenage drunken bonfire, lol.
The town is mum on the camp. Yet you can find all these little souvenir and book shops that have all the Montauk Chronicle books.</p>

            The "aliens" are already here and they are your government and the subcultures around us are hiding under the guise of "Satanism" and its not only pizza places serving up human flesh and blood around the world...

             TBH the reptillian stuff looks like a meme that is used at that workplace. I've seen similar but different (horse heads, fox heads etc) and the rest at various bars and well before all the MLP/furry? mainstream stuff, especially a bar where the logo or theme is an animal or similar.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have played in various metal bands and have dabbled in occult and the rest. One thing to realise is occult practice is mostly about self empowerment, will etc. It's not negative or bad to others unless the individual wishes to, just like driving a car, you 'could' run over a few people a day if you wanted. But that's not a very nice thing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             We used to have private metal burger nights and cook massive meat patties with pentagrams in them, called 'intolerant burgers' aimed to piss of vegetarians. Being young and dumb was fun sometimes..  so I would also take some of that stuff with a grain of salt. it's really all we were doing just commercialised and is again, not uncommon in my experience. 
We have a massive, nationwide pizza chain here called 'Hell' which would probably be featured in your post if you knew about them, because they market themselves with this stuff and shock value. I know someone who used to own one and was one of the nicest guys ever and definitely not a pedo. He did sleep with some younger girls who were employees(18-19 and up - 16 is legal here) but he was also in his 20s at this time.
            </p>
            <p>
             But who knows with this stuff these days, especially what you have posted. We have seen so much hidden in plain sight.

            i watched a youtube doco on montauk last night and probably what struck me the most was the mention of aliens. it seems like our government has been communing with life from other planets and not always in a good way. i'm going to keep researching this subject as it connects with all aspects of cia and mk ultra mind control, child abductions, torture, kidnapping and all those gruesome things connected to paedophile rings

             I have watched a couple of bits with Dr Steven Greer. Feel like something he has been saying, more so recently is relevant to Pizzagate about free energy and aliens and CIA was formed to cover it up.

             I don't know the validity of his claims as MSM says he is a fraud but then again they tell us PG is a lie.

             It's what is called a tracker to help locate seeds/peers in a torrent. Actually it appears to be out of date and adding

             </em>

              During the Hampstead case, there was a lead to women who were attending the "art" shows (torture scenes) of people alleged to be connected with the cult.  One of these women posted on her blog that she was a psychiatrist for the abused Montauk children.

It seems so many damn adult institutions that deal with kids or work with kids are rife for suspicion. I wish it wasn't the case, I'd love to have faith in fellow mankind, but alas...
Thank you for the fascinating little connection there.

                Shortly after the story hit the internet, some autist managed to capture the school removing teachers

                OFSTED the regulating body of schools in the UK had an oddly close relationship with Christ Church school, which is interesting considering schools rated outstanding no longer require routine inspections

             I immediately thought the same with it being a 3 month old mod. However on closer look plus considering their POV, if you check the original thread, I didn't make the magnet link as clear as I should have and the mod had never seen one before... which I do find unusual at least for a place like this.
This said I was trying to be discreet with it. Ah well.. lesson learned.
