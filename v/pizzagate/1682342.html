<p>He arranged the Chinese side of the deal, masking a multimillion dollar payment as a mining project which was immediately sold to PowerChina, a state run enterprise. The Australian middleman who was responsible for playing go between was Malcolm Raymond Scott James ( <a href="https://archive.is/0jZrV">https://archive.is/0jZrV</a> ) He sits on the board of Moko Social Media Holdings and is the executive at Tianshan Goldfields, which was the Australian shell company set up to facilitate the deal with China. James was uniquely placed to sell influence in Shareblue back when it was named Blue Nation Review. ( <a href="https://archive.is/1xzLd">https://archive.is/1xzLd</a> ) Moko still hold\'s a 20% stake in Shareblue</p>
<p>The Chinese aren\'t the only ones fucking you over though! Our old friends the Jews, the Arabs, the financiers in the City of London and even Mexico is pulling strings in Shareblue! Peter Daou is the CEO of Shareblue\'s holding company. Look at all of his clients! <a href="https://archive.is/bNhaI">https://archive.is/bNhaI</a></p>
<p>Well well, did you know that PR Newswire and Bloomberg are both owned by a UBM plc in the City of London. Fair and unbiased, I\'m sure. <a href="https://archive.is/p2WKA">https://archive.is/p2WKA</a> <a href="https://archive.is/TRF9V">https://archive.is/TRF9V</a></p>
<p>He also works for OneVoice International, a part of the PeaceWorks Foundation.

<p>Here\'s a sample of who is involved:</p>
<p>Rockefellers, the UK Labor Party and that cunt Jeremy Corbyn, The Crown Family Philanthropies etc. Crown Family doesn\'t even hide who they love to support <a href="https://archive.is/AyzAs">https://archive.is/AyzAs</a> The PeaceWorks Foundation is run by Daniel Lubetzky, a Mexican Jew who loves to play up the Jew side and hide his Hispanic roots because he works with the Cartels to influence American politics. He founded KIND snacks and is a billionaire. <a href="https://archive.is/0Gt22">https://archive.is/0Gt22</a> Here he is helping expose Hezbollah\'s involvement in the drug trade in South America. So helpful to his Latino friends and also to his pals who don\'t like Iran! <a href="https://archive.is/J4joC">https://archive.is/J4joC</a></p>
<p>PeaceWorks has offices in Tel Aviv, Ramallah, and London and they do business with Israelis, Palestinians, Egyptians, Australians, Turks, Indonesians and Sri Lankans. <a href="https://archive.is/l4ni8">https://archive.is/l4ni8</a> <a href="https://archive.is/lrvfb">https://archive.is/lrvfb</a></p>
<p>Lubetzky is working with China to push Shareblue because he thinks they can cause fractures such as Calexit which he will benefit from. But let\'s be honest, the Chinese will fuck him and all the Hispanics over and send them packing once they get their way.</p>
<p>Want to stop this shit? Some people have already been doing some digging around online to find where Shareblue might be located. I will give you a few leads: <a href="https://archive.is/pWWzB">https://archive.is/pWWzB</a></p>

Frank Giustra and Denis O'Brien (Digicel - both Clinton Foundation funders) receive funds from the corrupt liberal left Australian Govt, dished out by Julie Bishop, the Australian Foreign Minister, who works for the UN theocracy for the globalists and their New World Order.
