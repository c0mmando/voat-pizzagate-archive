             That post was great.  What goes around comes around.  We get so caught up everyday with so much information and Boom we are on to something else.  Thanks for posting that.  Evidently you made an impression for some people knew about it in today's post.  We have to keep going and keep posting.   The more we do the quicker it will take hold.  The Mason and Societies Posting is very important.

            I'm gonna try to read what I can, but, by the look of things you lot have found something I must have skimmed or plain not seen. If CH.I.P is intended for nefarious purposes, by all means, shine a light on it until we can be sure one way or the other.

             After nine months of pizzagate posts the world is upside down. So many posts are about a seemingly benign program that turns out to be some horrific scheme when you focus on the details. I won't mind (I would like) to be wrong in these cases but the circumstantial evidence just keeps piling up where it can't be ignored.  We have to look at anything involving children because that's where the pedophiles will be too.

              I truly apologize if you felt I was trying to derail, I'm just of a peculiar understanding that 'the good guys' already won(see my Ed Gein thread for somewhat of an explanation) and that the rest is just a shit show of arrests and exposure and etc.

               Its okay, there have been so many cases where I took a stance like yours and was then convinced. I don't mind being corrected or wrong. I can't imagine all the masons are pedos but I think that this program enables those of them who are to exploit it, if that makes sense to you.

               I wish, the good guys have an uphill battle. I think there is so much grooming and  drugging going on that many kids are not even aware of being molested, especiallly if it is by a relative or family friend. And then there are the kids stolen for satanic rituals who probably never return home.

                You are so fucking correct about the grooming it's kinda surreal - or at least was up until yesterday(my time).

                However, it DOES seem that the head has been cut off and that what we can expect to see going forward is the floundering of "the rest", which certainly isn't going to be pleasant in it's entirety.

             It may be that back when you did this, these programs weren't so corrupt &amp; widespread yet. It says that the photos are Polaroid which typically self-develop without copies. I think you should not worry. Your kids are probably old enough now to be aware of some of the dangers out there without being overly paranoid.

              Ok your right , they are well aware of the dangers . It just creeps me out . I'm sure they have never been stolen or abused , that wasn't my concern . Just the fact that they had their info and then having knowledge of CIA spying etc , my mind was racing ! All I know is , people that aren't awake are not going to think twice about this service!

               If they have ever gone to school or a doctor or have had any kind of normal life, then info about your kids is out there anyway to some degree, but its programs like this run by masons that put it in dubious hands. Your airport day probably wasn't masons.

             ACCEPTANCE OF PUNISHMENT AND CHANGE IN BELIEF.

            Abstract : Subjects were asked to indicate whether or not they were receiving ESP messages, which were presumably sent for 12 successive transmissions. Half the subjects received shock when they indicated nonreception. It was predicted that shock would introduce conflict and 'nonreceivers' who accepted this shock would experience dissonance. This dissonance might be reduced by rejecting belief in ESP. A high latency of response for females indicated that they did indeed show this conflict, and these subjects did reduce their beliefs in ESP significantly more than did the other subjects. Nonshocked females and males in both conditions showed little conflict and less change in belief. (Author)

            About 15 years ago I was at a local airport , where they have an official " airport" day every year for the kids to come and check out the planes and other attractions! There was a booth ran by the local police department and they were offering a similar service. Not knowing at the time , I had my kids fingerprinted etc. I haven't had time to dig into this info yet but wth ?? Did I put my own kids in danger 15 years ago, by having them fingerprinted ? And I still have the ID cards they gave me ! Does that mean they have had access to my children since then?

             I can't answer that. Its possible that there are people out there with good intentions and your kids' info wasn't stored. Obviously they can't abuse every child. If its been 15 years without incident, then I wouldn't worry now.

             I am afraid it is already in the works.  We must stop them before this becomes a mandatory reality.

             has been talking about the Mark of the Beast for quite some time.  Also, he tells us of Amazon and Fox Conn and they will start as voluntary and then become mandatory.  Think about it.  If they  are threatened with loss of job and have a family, what will they do?  This is a harsh reality if we do not fight really hard by exposing them.

            The chip has been changed from RFID to EFID to confuse people. It is tied directly to HRC up through shawdow govt. including Arts in Embassies program. We have made numerous posts on this but they are deleted usually. The chips have already been found in trafficked kids. There was a provision placed in the Affordable Care act requiring this to be implemented by 2017. They are behind. Government healthcare real prurpose is to chip and place genome sequencing in everyone. You don't want to believe me it is already happening in other countries. The end stage is for placing microchip under the skin. This is already happening. If you think these Masonic orders are collecting info for the good of your child you are foolish.

            can you find the posts we made about this in regards to EFID? A top Clinton Donor was in charge of the program and Soros was funding it.

             Offer to be implanted in the forehead or right hand by any chance! Bible: Revelation vs13:ch16 - The Mark of the Beast
vs16 And the second beast required all people small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a
             <em>
              'mark on their right hand or on their forehead'
             </em>
             vs17 so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark—the name of the beast or the number of its name.
18Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and that number is six hundred sixty-six.  - (the barcodes used on our goods in the shops are designed around 666 -  when the barcode first came out it showed the 6 under the 3 longer lines - beginning middle and end - but because people were spooked and more aware in the 80s/90s of this they removed the numbers - not suspicious at all!). Check this picture -

            I think there is a strong possibility they are compiling catalogs of the children for selling purposes.  My understanding is international buyers can select the children they want and pay high dollar for a custom order. Also, these groups could be selling children locally as well. I would love to prove one day that they are ordering specific children online.

            For anyone that does not believe these programs exist here are three  websites of chips already in these states.  Check your state I am sure there is one, or coming to you soon.  Missouri

            OK that last one, the Illinois one, directly proves that the Masons are sponsoring that program.  Yikes!   EDIT: Had to add this from the Illinois Program.  The Freemasons of Illinois hold and fund the entire cost of identification workshops for families all around the State of Illinois. These are called ILCHIP events. They're sponsored by local Masonic Lodges and held at neighborhood functions or community schools. We put together everything parents need to help the authorities find their lost child. It's the most comprehensive program of its kind ...and it is FREE OF CHARGE TO PARENTS.   Yes, Free of Charge, you guys.  Step Right Up and  Implant Your Kids.  Just think even though your kids might never be taken or kidnapped, they still get to know exactly where they are any given moment of the day.  Now there isn't anything wrong with that now, IS THERE?

             Thanks a good question. They claim to delete it, but what happens when they "forget" and all that data gets used for nefarious purposes. When those kids grow up all their finger prints are already collected to hack their iphones or what have you. And I'm sure there are no confidentiality breaches for a voluntary submission of info meaning no legal recourse if its ever used against them.

              OR they use their FREE CHIP to track your child for abduction when the elite, after looking through their catalogue of photos, wants to buy your child for whatever sick or depraved thing they want to do. ps. We knew about all this 'CHIP' in the 1990s Barry Smith a New Zealand preacher warned about the New World Order etc., FANTASTIC man and very well informed, if you do look at these 3 combined videos on Free Masons, please keep in mind that he is a preacher and quotes from the Bible where it describes what the heck is going on now!  At 5:20 mins he shares about his wife and how he came to be teaching on this subject then ff to 14 mins he starts to explain about the NWO. If you do watch keep in mind it is from an old film and not HD quality lol - Barry Smith 15th August 1997 - New World Order - Free Masonry

                I am busy watching this video now and it actually mentions ALL the elite we mention here in voat! Its very comprehensive and the latest 'star' to make an appearance is Sally Quinn, the self professed Occultist.  Rothschild is praising at the Washington Post whom she was the head of at the time he praises them! The WHOLE video is great, but WaPo is mentioned specifically at:- 1hour 37mins 37seconds - Demonic Agenda of Illuminatti 2016-2020 World War-III -

                 <p>
                  Washington Lodge No. 3
By: Brother, Stephen Curria, Master
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We supported our hometown by participating in their Warren Holiday Festival. We gave tours on Friday and Saturday, November 25th and 26th. On Friday, we participated in their parade. On Saturday, we also sponsored a Flu Shot Clinic. There were over 100 people that visited us. It is by this active community presence and partnership that Washington Lodge No. 3 will become the powerhouse of the community that it once was.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At Washington Lodge’s December meeting, we were pleased to receive our Right Worshipful District Deputy Grand Master, Robert Ellston and his Grand Master of Ceremonies, Worshipful Keith Moan. They were accompanied by a very large suite of visiting officers from the East Bay District, his mother lodge members from Mt. Moriah No. 8 and other distinguished brothers. They were received in kind by a large committee of Past Masters from Washington No. 3, led by our Senior Past Master, W\Robert Sinclair. We were proud to show off our newly cleaned and restored murals in the east and west. The program of the evening touched on a part of what will be a grander lecture in April. I spoke on the process of Egyptian mummification and how it correlates to the murals on the wall in the Temple. I was overwhelmed by the ovation I received as well as the compliments on a fine program. This gave me even more drive to deliver my Magnum Opus (Great Work) at the April 2017 stated meeting, where we will receive the Most Worshipful Grand Master, and his suite for his official visitation to the East Bay District.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For those that were present at my lecture on Egyptian mummification know that I am a bit of an Ancient Egypt buff. There is a tradition in Ancient Egypt that dovetails with Masonic lessons. In Ancient Egypt, the work on a Pharaoh’s tomb/temple began immediately after his ascension to the Throne. This work continued his whole life, ever building and ever expanding, until the day the Pharaoh dies. Is it not so with Freemasons? We construct our “house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens” all our lives and only set down our tools when we are called to our Celestial Lodge. The work of a Freemason is similar to the tomb builders of Egypt, we must never cease work on our own personal temples until the day we get called home.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We held a special communication in December, where we raised three new Master Masons. I stood and presented the Working Tools of a Master Mason to our newest Master Masons. This small part of ritual really got me to thinking, have I been using the tools as well as I should? I would like to say yes, but I know I have failed along the line and for me at least, therein lies the lesson. It’s not that you have used a tool incorrectly but it’s that you try again, ever straining for that perfect measurement. Is our Ashlar ever perfect? I would say no. We could work on the stone with our square, all of our lives and it would never be perfect. It can only be the best we can make it through the pursuit of perfection.

                  At our Christmas Party, we enjoyed a festive time! The Yankee Swap proved as much fun as it was exciting and the food was delicious! There is some debate as to who received the best gift from the swap and those that were there, know my opinion.

                  Man all these 'hidden societies' are all coming out in the open now, it really is time for all to be revealed.  Truthers need to get ahead of them and expose them. I want VIDEO evidence of them released to the public.  This is the only thing that will REVILE the public into outrage, they have had 10 months since President Trump got into office to destroy their vile evidence but I HOPE AND PRAY that some of the good guys have copies, ie: JulianAssange, RonPauls son, that navy seal, even the AwanBros maybe even some of the sickos could turn on eachother and expose. There is EVIDENCE that will expose these sick perverts to the world, no matter how difficult for the public.  IT HAS TO BE DONE! - I heard that 80% of Pres.Trumps White House is still Obummer holdovers :'( this is bad.

              I am thinking that they could just CHANGE the data to make your kid out to be "NOT YOUR KID".
              <br/>
              Now, if your pet is chipped, there is a central site that stores the info tying the chip number to the pet's owner.
What if the site 'messed up' and when your lost, chipped-pet is found, the data shows it belongs to John Podesta, instead of you.

               That is one of the scariest thoughts ever.  I don't even want to go there, but we must consider all possibilities.  Horror of Horrors.

               ...What do you think of this possibility really?  Is this possible. This chip thing is like a Very Bad Horror Movie.  Night of the Living Dead. I am going to pray longer and harder.

             I would assume the masons(behind it) until such time(if at all) that CH.I.P is endorsed by police departments in their respective states/jurisdictions? Just speculation though.

            Reading the quoted text, it doesn't sound forced and indeed, if this were a play at messing with kids, it seems illogical to provide a service which aids in the recovery of missing children... (especially if said missing children, are registered with CH.I.P before being abducted)
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not exactly comfortable with chips being installed in the human body, but, I'm not seeing implication of such a thing at all, let alone any attempt to force CH.I.P upon the unwilling... am I missing something in the linked post/article/whatever?

             Is this something that you would participate in? If you had a young kid would you bring them to a masonic lodge to be fingerprinted and videoed? I think that it is setting your kid up to be a target.

                IF there comes hints of making this enforced by law, then I'll start to panic again - but really, I cannot see many people volunteering for this anyway, for exactly the reasons you speak of.

                  Let's assume for a moment that everything's above board... maybe it's their way of making a good-faith gesture considering how far the masons have been dragged through the mud in all this - due to the actions of a few sick and perverted individuals?

                   Any bunch of guys interested in collecting photos of young kids is the first suspect/s in my mind if one of those kids later went missing. If they've been dragged through the mud, then why are they even going here, seems they would want to keep themselves away from all activities involving kids, not get deeper into it. It seems like you are defending them.

                    Defending them? Not a chance, I'm in no hurry to defend a group which isolates women from it's membership. (though it is worth noting that all-female lodges now exist and that the OTO accept(s/ed) men and women equally)

                    Fair points are being raised, I'm not trying to shit on those at all. It just seems most illogical to me, to be so public about the service offered, if the intent is to facilitate further fuckery.

                     This kind of stuff, with everything else going on,  it can't possibly be a goodwill gesture. Maybe the lower level masons are thinking it is but the upper levels will take that info and any kids in it are as good as fucked. This is another version of NCMEC, Amber Alert, CPS, etc...

                         did a piece on chips as well.  That is why I have been DEMANDING that people keep posting about the MASONS every single day.  They are behind this.  Think about it facial recognition I am sure is in the schools now when kids use their tablets.  1984 IS HERE FOR OUR KIDS.

                       Yes, please stay skeptical. And when they come up with some "success stories" of finding missing children because the Masons provided photos and finger prints and that justifies the program becoming mandatory, everybody will think its a good idea.

            <p>
             The Masonic Medical Research Laboratory (MMRL) is an internationally recognized biomedical research institute founded by the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons in the New York State in 1958. The MMRL is an international center for genetic screening of inherited cardiac arrhythmia diseases, especially those responsible for sudden cardiac death, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and is actively involved in the development of safe and effective drugs for atrial fibrillation, thus addressing one of the greatest unmet medical needs facing our society. The Stem Cell Center is focused on creation of human models of disease, thus enabling the development of innovative therapies and cures.
