            I still think comet is guilty, but I also feel like they are only a small piece to a much bigger issue. I think there is drugs there to.

             Comet was like one of those gravel pits on hills - a quick place they could throw the investigation while they clear up - sure the people are guilty, but these people think in these terms 24/7, deception, it's second nature - maybe they lead false trails, but they wanted people to chose the concrete box ‚Äî I am sure the other location has been used.
