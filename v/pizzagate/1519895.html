<p><strong>Omaha: A Fragmented Timeline of Events Beginning in August, 1983 by David Holland: <a href="http://davidshurter.com/?page_id=1134">http://davidshurter.com/?page_id=1134</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Willie Thiesen / Godfather’s Pizza:  A single pizza restaurant which became a national chain (which after changing hands a few times was run by former Federal Reserve Officer and winner of the Horatio Alger (a pedophile who wrote books for young boys) Award, Mr. “9 9 9” Herman Cain) under the guidance of Omaha millionaire Willie Thiesen.  It has been alleged that the Godfather’s in Omaha’s Old Market area was a location associated with occult activity and extreme child abuse.</p>

<p>From <strong><a href="http://deadlinelive.info/2011/11/11/penn-state-child-sex-abuse-scandal-mirrors-omahas-franklin-horror/">Penn State child-sex abuse scandal mirrors Omaha’s “Franklin” horror</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Cain is focused on rebuilding the ailing Godfather’s Pizza, based in Omaha, and promoting “Pizzaology,” he and a group of investors actually purchased the franchise from Pillsbury. As he notes in his bio This is Herman Cain! he writes that in September 1988, “we closed on a leveraged buyout and we are now the heavily in debt owners of Godfather’s Pizza, Inc,” with help from CitiBank. Were there any other lending institutions or investors from Omaha involved in that process? We are not sure. The New York Times, at the time, interviewed Cain about the Godfather’s purchase. Cain told the Times that “he and his management team were investing much of their own net worth in Godfather’s.” At its peak, Godfather’s had 911 restaurants, interestingly enough. Perhaps Mr. Cain will release all that information since it is not detailed in his book and questions are being asked about this time of his career.</p>
<p>The failing Godfather’s Pizza chain, that third-rate chain with the mobster theme, was started by William “Willy” Theisen, a “wild” man Cain would obviously have known. As they say, you are known by the company you keep. But reading a recent Omaha World-Herald overview of Cain’s Omaha years, Theisen’s marketing director for Godfather’s, Tim McMahon, said that while Cain was charismatic, he “simply doesn’t register as a significant force” in Godfather’s success, this despite the Cain campaign’s rhetoric. Cain does not mention Willy Theisen in his biography, despite the man having started the restaurant Cain claims to have saved. It sounds like there may be bad blood between Cain and Theisen. But that’s only speculation.</p>
<p>Moving on, during Cain’s “Omaha years,” Lawrence E. “Larry” King, it would be revealed, was, according to a December 1988 New York Times article, being investigated by the FBI and IRS after money – $39 million, all told – was found to be missing were noted in the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union overseen by King. King would be sentenced to prison. He is now out of prison and believed to be living in Virginia.</p>
<p>Then there is King and Franklin’s link to the distinguished Catholic orphanage on Omaha’s outskirts – Boys Town – where young boys were ferried out to rich and powerful pedophiles., allegedly including judges in the region. Sounds like what we’re finding out in regards to Penn State. The priest who ran Boys Town during this time and up to 2005 refused to cooperate with any investigators looking into allegations.And remember the film Boys Town with Spencer Tracy? It turns out it is a favorite of another presidential candidate and friend of Cain – Newt Gingrich. And note Gingrich’s bizarre reference to Oliver Stone and cannibalism and his desire to see Macaulay Culkin in a remake.</p>
<p>Cain was in Omaha for 13 years. It was during this time that a shocking June 1989 report in The Washington Times appeared, headlined “Homosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush.” A lot of things end up happening in Washington. A lot of secrets in that city by the Potomac. A lot of once-good people have been compromised and controlled as a result of what really goes on there.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the boys allegedly forced into prostitution by King was Paul Bonacci. He was one of the young male prostitutes that is known to have toured the White House back in the ‘80s and featured in that aforementioned Washington Times article from June of ’89.</p>
<p>In 1999, Bonacci won a $1 million lawsuit against King, with the federal judge believing Bonacci’s testimony against King was truthful. At the same time, a grand jury had already said the sexual-abuse allegations that came up in the case was “a hoax” and never happened. And everyone went back to sleep.</p>
<p>Back in 1990, the lead investigator for the Nebraska legislative Franklin Senate Subcommittee, Gary Caradori, listed Godfather’s Pizza founder Theisen as one of the people he wanted to interview on behalf of the legislative committee.</p>
<p>In Caradori’s notes he had written that Willy Theisen is “alleged to have used a substantial amount of cocaine with numerous people in the Omaha area.” And in another part of Caradori’s report, a man named Richard Cottage, who worked for the City of Omaha, allegedly had “information reference photos depicting drug activity and sexual activity at a party hosted by Will(y) Theisen.” It is not clear if Theisen was ever questioned. He reportedly remains in the pizza business in Omaha.</p>
<p>During this time, leading up to the death of Gary Caradori, the FBI was allegedly intimidating victims and harassing investigators, as noted by author Nick Bryant. The Department of Justice is corrupt, says Bryant, and they helped cover up the Franklin Scandal.</p>
<p>Caradori’s investigation would end abruptly, sadly. He would be one of many mysterious deaths linked to the Franklin Scandal, according to author Nick Bryant. Flying back to Lincoln, Nebraska from Chicago in July 1990, Caradori’s plane broke up over Ashton, Illinois killing him and his 8-year-old-son. No cause was ever found and at the site of the wreckage, in Lee County, Illinois, a witness said child pornography photos were found at the scene of the crash.</p>
<p>Caradori had allegedly met with Larry King’s photographer, Rusty Nelson, while in Chicago. As author Nick Bryant notes, Caradori got incriminating photos from Nelson and flew back with them.</p>
<p>Writes Bryant: “The pictures showed who the adults were and who the kids were. I (Nelson) gathered that the purpose was blackmail and it was political. The contents of the pictures, and the events surrounding them, would be an instant end to a politician’s career.” That evidence was allegedly taken away by persons unknown, and never seen again.</p>
<p>State Sen. Loran Schmit, the chairman of the legislature’s Franklin committee, which Caradori was working for, told the Associated Press after Caradori’s death that “he had no doubt there were people who wanted to see Caradori dead.”</p>
<p>“They got their wish,” Schmit told the AP. “They question to be answered is whether it was a coincidence.”</p>
<p>Cain, as we said, was in Omaha during King’s heyday in the late 1980’s. What does Cain know about the things King was involved in? We have been unable to find Cain mentioned, linking him to any of this and we are not alleging Cain was involved in anything illegal or wrong. However, noting Omaha’s size and that he would be a known figure, particularly among Omaha’s minority community, the question should be asked by the media.</p>
<p>We do know the power elite of Nebraska, including the influential Omaha World-Herald newspaper, were accused of covering up the details of the child-sex scandal, which included allegations of drug trafficking and the laundering of money for the contras in Nicaragua. It’s wild stuff. While people came forward and gave their eyewitness accounts of what they saw and experienced – much of it shocking and horrific, as noted in Bryant’s book The Franklin Scandal – federal and local law enforcement did their best to cover up crimes for very powerful people.</p>
