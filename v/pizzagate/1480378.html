<pre><code>The Magic Circle is a British organisation dedicated to magic. Its headquarters are in London, and professional magicians who wish to join need to have known two members for a sufficient period of time. These two members then act as referees on the candidate’s application form and propose him or her as suitable for membership. Following the receipt and processing of the application, the candidate is invited to an interview, usually at the London headquarters with the examinations secretary. If the candidate proves suitable and sufficiently knowledgeable, a performance exam is scheduled. This takes place in front of judges, and the candidate must demonstrate skills to members in a rehearsed act. The final stage is by vote of members of council, who approve the candidate as a member. There are approximately 1,450 members (including Charles, Prince of Wales)[1] in 41 countries. Members must be at least 18. 

Membership 

Membership of the Magic Circle requires the applicant to undergo an interview and to pass a performance exam to show proficiency and skill. The alternative to the usual performance is a written thesis relating to magic. Members of the Society use the letters M.M.C. after their name . Members may take a further examination to achieve the degree of associate of the Inner Magic Circle. The designation A.I.M.C. shows this higher membership. The A.I.M.C. degree can also be attained through thesis, and in rare cases, examinees taking the M.M.C. exam are awarded the A.I.M.C. degree. Those who attain an A.I.M.C. degree as a result of a performance examination are given the A.I.M.C. with silver star. Within the society, there is a number of members never exceeding 300 known as the Inner Magic Circle. ...... continued.

<pre><code>The 9th Circle: Child Sex/Sacrifice Cult Initiation  
“The Ninth Circle Satanic Cult, a child sacrifice group composed of global elites, appears to be routinely raping, torturing and murdering children” it was announced yesterday by the ITCCS. Recent court filings against the international child kidnapping ring go to court April 7.

 Named as chief defendants for the Brussels Common Law Court trial were Pope Francis, Jesuit Superior General Adolfo Pachon and Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. Among possible Ninth Circle Satanic Cult members named by witnesses who would testify at the trial were former popes Joseph Ratzinger and John Paul II, UK High Court Justice Judge Fulford and members of the British Royal Family.

“Queen Elizabeth had direct involvement in the kidnapping and death of aboriginal children and Royal Family members appeared to regularly participate in Ninth Circle Satanic Cult rituals at the Mohawk Indian School in Brantford Ontario Canada” yesterday’s announcement proclaimed.

 According to two affidavits filed in court, not only did different witnesses see Ninth Circle Satanic Cult members commit murder, but claimed the brutal killings of innocent children continued today, some in sub-basement vaults.

 The international court was set to consider:

 · Testimonies of two former Mohawk School inmates who both say they were present at the Ninth Circle Satanic Cult murder of a 5-6 year-old girl at the Mohawk Indian School in Branton Ontario Canada.

 · A copy of the ‘Magisterial Privilege’ that was filed within sealed archives of the Vatican library. The Ninth Circle Satanic Cult operated according to this canon law statute dated Dec. 25 1967. It was said to document that before each new pope assumed office it was mandatory that they participated in Ninth Circle Satanic Cult rites. The document referred to ceremonial murder of newborn children and consumption of their blood.

 · Testimonies of two witnesses who claimed they saw former Pope Joseph Ratzinger, Dutch Cardinal Alfrink and Prince Bernhard take part in a Ninth Circle Satanic Cult murders in Holland and France, one of a little girl in the fall of 1987.

 · One of those witnesses was Dutch therapist Toos Nijenhuis who in this video interview with Kevin Annett, discussed seeing Ninth Circle Satanic Cult murders as late as 2010. At least one of those murders involved former Pope Ratzinger.

 · Testimony of Anglican church researcher Leona Moses, whose 2011 interview with Kevin Annett and Mohawk elder Cheryl Squire could be seen in this video.

 · Testimony of a former Argentine civil servant during the 1970s Dirty War who took extensive notes of meetings between the now-Pope Francis and Junta military officials. Pope Francis’ fast ascension to head the Argentine Catholic Church was a suspected result of his agreement to traffick missing political prisoner children from Catholic orphanages.

 · Testimony of a police-accredited investigator.

            a snip from the email you've linked:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             And to ALL of you, thank you for every meal, email, phone call, visit, book group night, walk, "cultchah" indulgence, and every other form of support that got me to a recovered emotional and physical state going back to the trauma of Francis's illness and death, and those two very mean invasions of my brain.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            cultchah indulgence.     Did she get the wording correct on that one?
            <br/>
            two very mean invasions of my brain?
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember reading about a book group store close to Besta Pizza.
            <br/>
            What was the name of it again?   Who was it related to?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are there any links between Podesta and  these people and Abrahamovics  groups / friends and circle?
She's already  made it clear that she hopes her words are understood.
            <br/>
            so ummm,  no,  not a big jump there.

            Mary Podesta is John Podesta's wife. The book group does sound fishy - I have followed that lead before. It seems that the email for "pain for her pain" is sent out by Tamera Luzzatto after Mary was involved in a car accident of some sort. I agree that Tamera's praising of Mary may be a little over - it seems like Mary may be the leader of the "book club". I think I came across an email with photo of this book group actually, need to locate that.

            Truckee is a town just north of Lake Tahoe and just a few miles inside the California state line from Nevada, on the transcontinental railroad, and one of the coldest places in the United States (the elevation is about 5,800 ft.).  It has an airport that is kept plowed in the winter, when possible, and sees many private jet operations per week.  It is about a 20 mile drive to Incline Village, one of the wealthiest communities in California.  Locals refer to surrounding communities as being part of "Truckee" itself, when they may not be, including nearby ski areas.  If anyone can identify the house(s) in question directly, or any potential reference to it by ownership (either ownership in the name of a Podesta or a related corporate entity), I would be in a position to drive by and see what I can see.  The state of California does not permit persons to search for property ownership over the Internet -- they require the person wanting to perform the search to appear in person, according to state law, "in order to protect the privacy of public officials."  That is, the elite get special privilege and protection, since the law recognizes they need protection -- most likely because they are guilty of something.  I will not be in a position to get to the Placer County Assessors Office until late spring.

            Isn't Truckee near Tahoe where Podesta had a house or vacation? There was a vintage Tahoe travel poster and a whole thread of creepy babysitting service. This was an early thread so maybe I'm confused.

             I wonder if the thread was archived.    There appears to be a  Truckee California and a Truckee Lake Tahoe.
             <br/>
             I think that Luzzatto's admission that she's not sure if she's worded everything  aptly  etc   is a red flag that she's talking in code and hoping it's understood by John Podesta.

             Differentiating between  friends and  another circle would explain that    J podesta's is not alone.

              It was a babysitting service in Tahoe thread with a pedo logo. I will try to look for it.
