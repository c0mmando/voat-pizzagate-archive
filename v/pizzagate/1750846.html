            Miley is an MK Ultra Sex Kitten and her parents happily let her be sold for sex they liked the money they also got to enjoy sex with other kids and probably with Miley and her younger sister Noah. The whole family is satanic. All of Miley's videos and photos are staged by her handlers they know what the symbolism means. Miley is probably not fully aware of what the symbolism is all about. She's been an alter for a long time in an altered identity from her  Monarch sex programming. Go to VigilantCitizen.com he has some great articles about the illuminati symbolism in her videos.

            I found the article (below) on her some time back that confirms her fascination with all things pizza related. I'm not entirely convinced however that this isn't just a contrived representation of her for PR purposes and if this is the case it begs the question, why and how is it possibly related to pizzagate? Either way we know from her public conduct and stage antics that she's one messed up youngster who certainly has some skeletons in her past.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also take note of the photo of her lying on the bed and under a rainbow light on her wall. Under the Rainbow is sometimes symbolic of being 'under a spell' or under control through Monarch Programming and I wouldn't be surprised in the least if she's been or still is a victim of trauma based mind control and SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse). The same symbology also features in Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' as a costume rental shop by the name of 'Rainbow' which has a basement and requires anyone entering it to pass 'under the rainbow' which is displayed as the shop front sign. Once inside, Cruise's character discovers the young teenage shop keepers daughter is engaging in sexual acts with two old Asian men, curious indeed!

           <p>
            Further things that I've just noticed, confirming my suspicions that she's a Monarch victim and part of the Illuminati plan are the inverted triangle/pyramid in the 'Good Vibes' sign hanging from her ceiling and her choice of books, 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Alice In Wonderland', 'Hans Christian Andersen' etc... These texts are drenched in symbolism and occultism and the reason why they're so often referenced by researchers into this subject matter. Monarch Programming and trauma based mind control is all about creating a dissociative state in the victim and essentially multiple personalities which is a means of controlling the individual.

             In the Kubrick movie, when the hero Dr. is "Under the Rainbow" and he and the father [of the young girl played by Sobeiski] catch the underage girl with her clients, there's a Pizza on the table. FWIW.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kubrick was meticulous in details..
            </p>
            <p>
             Also the last scene in the movie where the two parents [in real life "$cientologists" ] are arguing in a toy store, it looks as though their little girl is abducted, while they are distracted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Kubrick's daughter, in real life,  was said to have been estranged from him, after she herself joined $cientology. Many connections to $cientology with "Stanley"

              That's because Kubrick was exposing that NASA were built on occult foundations, Jack Parson the rocket scientist, was at a time, friends with L. RON - he was a member of the OTO, the agape chapter.  Agape refers to unconditional love.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is rumoured that Peaches Geldof was murdered by the OTO for her exposure of the suppliers of children to disgraced Lost Prophet member Ian Watkins.  Interestingly...  Ian Watkins has since been allowed to open a twitter from jail.  Jack Parsons, CEO of twitter, was caught tweeting about satanism.  He is on the board of directors for Disney, who are speculated to be part of the MKUltra program and include subliminal sexuality in children's entertainment content.  A fact which was parodied by South Park.

            To me the miley pizza pictures tell the story of a victim. I'm not saying she hasn't done anything wrong, but I have to think she has been wronged, probably greatly.

            Please stop this disinfo. People are allowed to like pizza and kids from the 90's had pizza pushed on us so much (MAYBE that part is pizzagatey) from all the shitty microwaved foods and super colorful commercials on CN and Nick. Pizza was a huge part of our culture and still is, especially for those of us now who just left or are still in college.

             It's the older people, in general, who are more likely to be ignorant.

            <p>
             The younger people are the hope since they are the ones who are most likely to be able to learn.

            I definitely think she is involved in all of this.  In fact I remember hearing about how when she performs at concerts she encourages the fans  (mostly younger kids) grope her private area's on stage. I saw the actual footage of it.  I'm pretty sure you can find the video on YouTube.  Let me see if I can find it for you.
