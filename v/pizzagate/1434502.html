Sorry guys, this article is NOT about Twittergate, but I mean to say that they choose to focus on ordinary citzens for this matter.</p>

<p>NO mention of Pizzagate. Of course not, right? Let\'s attack the ordinary citizens instead of investigating both groups. Typical of the incorporated, business owned broadcasted news. </p>
<p>It legit <strong>makes sense</strong> that there would be a conspiracy out of this, and the MSM is also trying to turn &quot;conspiracy&quot; into a bad word, related to the crazies. </p>
<p>Conspiracy means: 
\'A secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.\'</p>
<p>And when Alefantis accuses us of being conspiracy theorists, in a statement to the public via the MSM, you\'re goddamn right that we are theorizing that there is major unlawful and harmful activity going on. We want answers, and that\'s as simple as it gets.</p>
<p>Seriously, what the fuck is going on right now in this country? I have genuinely never seen something this deep be uncovered like this, and that\'s probably most definitely due to the internet... but why can\'t we make this louder? </p>
<p>These events are unfolding in weird succession...
It\'s this combination of Monika Petersen, Wikileaks, Julian Assange going missing, the Clinton Foundation being linked to this pedophile network Pizzagate scandal and all the deep involvements including the NCMEC and the odd \'rubbing it in our faces\' with their public display via artwork in their homes and weird ass social media posts that are now private or taken down?</p>
<p>It\'s been too fucking long right now, they have probably most definitely already covered their tracks by now so that when it finally hits MSM, like you know it <em>eventually will</em>, they will find no evidence because they will just fill in the tunnels and explain it away as some previous fill in by the previous owner if asked about it. </p>
<p>What can we do to push this harder? We need to hit this hard on and fast, ask questions, get answers and get the truth. There\'s people fucking worried for their lives for posting about this on the internet because of how serious and deep this is. And NOBODY is talking about it in and of our main social groups.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theory is the new \'news\'. It\'s not fake news It\'s all up to the investigation of the public through social media like Voat. 
Broadcasted, money-backed news is the real \'fake news\' because the money and power behind it talks through the speakers in the newscaster\'s ears or the words on the teleprompter. </p>
<p>We the people have the power to determine through a collective and thoughtful democracy which ideas are worth investigating and that should be the real news that catches our attention.</p>
<p>Everybody please discuss this with your family during your thanksgiving night, tomorrow, every day and with everybody you encounter. This is the most important thing right now.</p>
<p>Shed the fear of coming off as crazy. These matters are WORTH investigating. Be passionate, be strong, be factual.</p>',
