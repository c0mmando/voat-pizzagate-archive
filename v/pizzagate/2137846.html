<p>This is the story of hundreds of students sexually abused by staffers, and emerging from decades of silence today. <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/05/06/private-schools-painful-secrets/OaRI9PFpRnCTJxCzko5hkN/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Bottom">http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/05/06/private-schools-painful-secrets/OaRI9PFpRnCTJxCzko5hkN/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Bottom</a></p>

<p>Inside the link is a drop-down box menu which lets you select a specific school from a list of five dozen private schools in New England that have faced reports that their staff sexually abused or harassed students and explore the claims.</p>

<p>I checked out a few of the schools to see if there are any connections to elites.</p>
<p><strong>One of the schools is Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, NH</strong> (not to be confused with Phillips Academy in Andover, MA) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Exeter_Academy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Exeter_Academy</a></p>
<p><strong>It has ties to the husband of the former governor, current Senator from New Hampshire, Maggie Hassan</strong>, who was given her start in politics when, in 2002, Democratic Party leaders recruited her to run for the New Hampshire Senate; and, in 2008, NH Senate President Sylvia Larsen chose Hassan to serve as Senate Majority Leader, the number two position in the New Hampshire Senate. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Hassan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Hassan</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hassan’s husband, Tom, was in the midst of a six-year stint as principal of the elite school in 2011 when Rick Schubart, a longtime teacher, was forced to relinquish his post after an allegation that he had an improper sexual relationship with a student beginning in 1977, according to The Boston Globe, which first reported the scandal last week.</p>
<p>Phillips Exeter disclosed the abuse allegation to police and a state agency at the time but did not go public with the allegations. Schubart, though, retained his emeritus faculty status at the school. Schubart and his wife donated to Maggie Hassan’s 2012 gubernatorial campaign, and he was listed among dozens of prominent local figures serving on a steering committee for her campaign. In 2015, a second former student came forward with abuse allegations from the 1980s against Schubart. His emeritus status was then revoked by Phillips Exeter, he was barred from campus and school events, and the police were again notified. </p>
<p>Yet as in the initial incident, the allegations against Schubart were never revealed to students, their families or the public. No criminal charges were ever filed against Schubart, the Globe reported. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/hassan-ayotte-new-hampshire-scandal-221651">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/hassan-ayotte-new-hampshire-scandal-221651</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Hassans did not live in the Governor\'s House when she was governor and he was President of PEA, so you would think that she would have been more in tune to the abuses.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hassan\'s husband, Thomas, was Principal of Phillips Exeter Academy from 2008 to 2015, and as of 2016 is the president of School Year Abroad.[58] When Hassan\'s husband was Principal of Phillips Exeter Academy, the Hassans did not live in the Governor\'s Mansion, instead living in a colonial mansion on the Phillips Exeter campus provided to them as part of her husband\'s employment. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Hassan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Hassan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What about Sylvia Larsen, who helped advance Maggie Hassan\'s career? She has ties to <strong>WISCONSIN and advocates</strong> for kids in several ways.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>graduate of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Larsen worked for seven years in the Wisconsin state Senate</strong>. In New Hampshire, she served as the legislative liaison for Gov. Hugh Gallen. Past professional experience includes positions with the New Hampshire Historical Society, the New Hampshire Disability Council and the New Hampshire Council on World Affairs.
<strong>She sponsored laws establishing the Land and Community Heritage Investment Program (LCHIP), Healthy Kids and workforce housing opportunities. Through her career, she co-sponsored legislation to raise the high school dropout age.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Now a look at Phillips Academy at Andover, Maryland</strong> (not to be confused with PEA just discussed above) which also has stories of abuse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Academy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Academy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An independent investigation into possible sexual abuse at an elite boarding school has uncovered several cases of sexual misconduct by faculty members, the school announced on Tuesday.
The review at Phillips Academy identified five cases in the 1970s and 1980s in which &quot;former faculty members engaged in sexual misconduct involving students,&quot; Head of School John Palfrey said in a letter to the school community. <a href="http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Phillips-Academy-in-Andover-Finds-5-Cases-of-Sexual-Misconduct-">http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Phillips-Academy-in-Andover-Finds-5-Cases-of-Sexual-Misconduct-</a></p>

His expertise is advising donors and families about strategies to effectively maximize their philanthropy in concert with overall financial, estate planning, and wealth transfer goals.
Prior to joining Andover, Mr. Lockerby was the Vice President for Development at Boston College and directed its $1.5 billion comprehensive campaign.
