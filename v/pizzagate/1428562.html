We were all talking and people were moving in and out... the bbq in the back yard.  All of a sudden, this little kid says, &quot;(my name)?&quot; 
and I said, &quot;Yes?&quot; Then she looked me in the eyes. Dead in the eyes.... and grabbed me by the crotch and started squeezing 
and rubbing with a smirk on her little face.  An Unmistakable Sexual Assault.  ...party over! ...done!  Looked at the wife and head nodded her 
out the door. I didn\'t tell my wife why I wanted to leave so suddenly... I couldn\'t.  But, of course, you can\'t keep anything from your wife.<br />

<p>She didn\'t get mad or anything.  In fact, she went out of her way to befriend the kid and they became real close over the years.  It was

pedophilia and my wife thought it was best to keep it hushed up. As If... the shame brought out upon those who commit pedophilia is worse
than being the victim of pedophilia.
