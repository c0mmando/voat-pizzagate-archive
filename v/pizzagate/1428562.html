<p>My wife was sitting in the same room and the little girl was on my lap. A gathering. 4th of July or something.
We were all talking and people were moving in and out... the bbq in the back yard.  All of a sudden, this little kid says, &quot;(my name)?&quot; 
and I said, &quot;Yes?&quot; Then she looked me in the eyes. Dead in the eyes.... and grabbed me by the crotch and started squeezing 
and rubbing with a smirk on her little face.  An Unmistakable Sexual Assault.  ...party over! ...done!  Looked at the wife and head nodded her 
out the door. I didn\'t tell my wife why I wanted to leave so suddenly... I couldn\'t.  But, of course, you can\'t keep anything from your wife.<br />
When I told her what happened, she was shocked.</p>
<p>She didn\'t get mad or anything.  In fact, she went out of her way to befriend the kid and they became real close over the years.  It was 
like it never happened. My wife never told me anything about why the kid did what she did.  If she ever learned anything, she kept it to 
herself.  Women are better at hiding secrets from men than the other way around.

<p>This was a long time ago. Things change.  People die.  New kids are born...</p>
<p>All these events are in the past.</p>
<p>But years later, these days.... I wonder if that poor kid was involved in one of those pedo situations. Maybe she was a victim of
pedophilia and my wife thought it was best to keep it hushed up. As If... the shame brought out upon those who commit pedophilia is worse
than being the victim of pedophilia.
