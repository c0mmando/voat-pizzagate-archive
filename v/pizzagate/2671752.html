               From what I understand, he went to a dinner there once. I never heard he flew on Epstein’s plane either. We don’t know the details so I’m not going to judge him for that. He hates pedos. He’s tweeted about it since 2010.

                  <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/09/the-friendship-between-trump-and-a-billionaire-pedophile-that-nobody-wants-to-talk-about/">
                   http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/09/the-friendship-between-trump-and-a-billionaire-pedophile-that-nobody-wants-to-talk-about/
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That Trump’s friendship with Epstein has been given what largely amounts to a pass from the media may be due in part to Epstein’s more prominent ties to Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Epstein’s ties to Clinton and Prince Andrew have largely overshadowed his ties to Trump.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Clinton allies have yet to makes Trump’s Epstein ties a campaign issue.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then again, any attacks on Trump over his ties to Epstein would almost certainly guarantee that Trump would bring up Clinton’s own documented Epstein ties, including flight logs showing that Clinton took at least 26 trips on Epstein’s infamous private sex plane, dubbed the “Lolita Express.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To the extent that Trump’s representatives have been asked about his ties to Epstein, they’ve tried to downplay the two billionaires’ relationship.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Last January, Trump attorney Alan Garten told Vice News that his client had “no relationship” with Epstein.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In a statement to The Daily Caller on Sunday, Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said that “Mr. Trump only knows [Epstein] socially through the Mar-a-Lago Club, one of the finest private clubs in the world.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But Trump talked up his friendship with Epstein before the latter’s arrest and public fall from grace.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Similarly, a 2003 Vanity Fair profile of Epstein named Trump as one of the “businessmen who dine with him at his home,” and several other articles have pegged Trump and Epstein as friends.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And when FBI investigators looked through Epstein’s private address book, they found 14 different phone numbers for Trump, including numbers for his security guard and houseman. Epstein also had numbers for Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his ex-wife Ivana.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When put under oath, Epstein admitted that he had “socialized” with Trump. But Epstein chose to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights when asked: “Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?” Epstein similarly pleaded the fifth when asked about his relationship to Bill Clinton.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Trump rode on Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane at least once, according to the deposition of Mark Epstein, Jeffrey’s brother. That number pales, however, to Bill’s 26 trips on the “Lolita Express.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In June, Trump was accused in a lawsuit of raping one of Epstein’s 13-year-old sex workers. Trump’s attorney has called the lawsuit a “publicity stunt.” The case is scheduled for a hearing in mid-December, after the election.

                   Ok. So how does that show that Trump is a pedo? He even said that Epstein loves  young beautiful women. He wouldn’t have said that if he knew they were underage. That would bring attention to it. Clinton flew on Lolita express 26 times. Everyone chooses to focus on Trump who wasn’t even a regular there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The media will spin everything they can to make Trump look bad. Even the picture of his little girl on his lap... there is nothing wrong with that. These people are sick. If all you’ve got is this, then you’re mind is set. I get so many people that are actually interested in the truth. I don’t have time for the close minded ones.

            I do not believe Q is who he claims to be anymore. Alex jones says the handle was hacked/hijacked and I think that’s clear from the content and quality of later Q posts that Q is now a larp to misdirect people.

             I don’t know much about Q but I’m really suspicious of anyone anonymously trying to help especially one with such insider knowledge.  We could all be taken for a ride, who knows, but it’s good to have differing opinions.   People ln here get so fucking upset when you mention Q.

                I don’t know what that means.   There’s just no reason to be rude to someone else because they believe in something different.  That’s all I’m saying, and now you are being rude and spiteful to me.  What a nice person!!!

                 I'll happily absorb the karma burn for that one. Alex Jones is a CIA asset, and You're whiteknighting someone who is whiteknighting a CIA asset.

                  Idk why you are using all these ridiculous words and phrases.   I’m not whiteknighting, but I saw you call another user ignorant for not believing in Q and I thought it was rude and disrespectful and I thought this sub was better than that.

                        I have never blocked anybody so i'm not sure how to do it myself. The Voat culture comes mainly from the chans and its a pretty rude place to hang out. When people set in on you like that just try to ignore it, don't feed it, until it goes away.

                        probably has the nicest and most well mannered people on voat but you still have some Chan kids that cut their teeth in the Chans here too.

                         <br/>
                         I got all day to keep telling you that your parents should've aborted you and shot the doctor at the clinic afterwards just to be sure.
                         <br/>
                         Because you're too fucking stupid to know which way is up, let alone know who is/isn't a troll.
