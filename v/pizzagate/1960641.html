            Far more than you know. Oil and energy in general is where "it" all started in the 1930's and 1940's.  Funded it all... the 4th Reich we see erected around us today.  If you want to know many mysteries of Babylon, Energy is a good place to start.

            And therein lies the answer!  You are a liberal who views oil companies as "evil."  That bias blinded you to logic, reason, and objectivity.

             Thank you for your opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thought I made myself particularly clear with this paragraph, right up front.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              First of all, what's documented is documented and everything else in this is speculation. Until proven guilty, they be innocent.
              <strong>
               My suppositions are of a rhetorical nature on the possibility.
              </strong>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Here's what's not speculation: an oil company with a dock spanning state lines. Care to lend your learned opinion on the whys? I've worked with warehouses and shipping and am familiar with bills of landing. So, with a dock spanning a state line raises a red flag to me. Seriously, I'd love to know what you think about that documented tidbit.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also documented that a head honcho of NuStar is in a private club with several of the supposedly rape-happy Bush clan. It's not outside the realm of possible that the elites use their private club time to wine, dine, and deal their way to bigger fortunes. Actually, after watching the insider views of the elites via Jamie Johnson's documentary, I'm pretty sure the gathering of wealth is what facilitates these gatherings.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oil companies are a necessary evil at this point. When the populace acts as collateral damage so those jerkoffs can keep plugging all those leaks tainting precious groundwater, then yeah. I take issue to that. I'm a liberal, but I'm also woke, and grew up the spawn of ranchers who grow the food you eat. Oil doesn't make corn or rice grow. Not great for cattle, either (although that's another huge environmental impact in and of itself).
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't defend the elites and their callousness. Fuck, they can afford to hire mercenaries to attack American citizens trying to protect their water (and after seeing the gov not give a flying fuck about Flint, they should be protecting their water) they don't need you white knighting for them because some random chick off the internet thinks they suck, or as you interpreted it, "evil."
            </p>
            <p>
             Your reply was a complete and utter fail. 
Thank you for trying, though.
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean, from what I read you also think toddlers can offer quite a lot of help on Canadian farms. That, sir, is amusing, and for that I'm upvoating your reply as a gold star for participating.

             Personally, it's hard for me to look at oil as a win when we've spent 20 years in a sandbox, when those funds could have gone into infrastructure of the US... OP may have a different view, but oil isn't as great as you seem to think it is when we have shit like Flint and DAPL going on, and fucking up the drinking water of Americans.
            </p>
            <p>
             And one can't deny the influence oil money has in the government and how that's detrimental to a nation as a whole.

             <p>
              Reread my post.  I never said that oil was "great."  I merely stated that OP evidently believes that oil companies are "evil."'  I won't debate the pros versus cons of oil energy here because this isn't the venue for it.  This is a PG research subforum.

              "methinks you doth protest too much"
             </p>
             <p>
              My only "protest" is that OP supplied NO HARD FACTS, ZERO EVIDENCE to support his/her thesis.  Speculation is fine IF it is predicated upon FACTS.  ZERO facts of oil companies trafficking children were provided..
             </p>
             <p>
              It's OP's assertion so the onus is on the OP to make the case.

                Yes but you used to be a nail, just hammered so hard you're a washer, your job here (Mr. I used to work in the legal field) is to present plausible deniability, do you even feel pedophilia exists or that its wrong.?
