For this post, 2 reasons will be presented to demonstrate this normalization trend, The Rene Guyon Society and Sexology Organizations, and BTW, the surname Guyon is part of Hillary\'s family tree.  Will get to that later.</p>
<p>The Rene Guyon Society is a national organization of persons who are vitally interested in promoting legislation that would permit adults to have sex with children.  The group\'s motto reflects its attitude: &quot;Sex before 8 or it\'s too late.&quot;</p>
<p>Additional information about the society is contained in the book, &quot;Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior,&quot; 3rd edition; by Stephen T. Holmes and Ronald M. Holmes; copyright 2009.  Here is what the book says:</p>
<p>The group\'s statements repeatedly assert that none of the members of the society has anything to do with breaking the sex laws on children. Children, however, should be allowed to involve themselves with older men, especially members of the society.  Because children suffer from too much &quot;body guilt,&quot; they should be encouraged to have sexual intercourse and other forms of activities to rid themselves of this &quot;body guilt.&quot;  In addition, adult males suffer from body guilt and should be allowed to have sex with children but don\'t because of their guilt.</p>
<p>The way to eliminate body guilt, both as a child and as an adult, is for children to have sex with adults, preferably those who are members of The Rene Guyon Society.  At one time, the national spokesperson for The Rene Guyon Society was Tim O\'Hara whose real name is Jonathan Evan Edwards.  The Society was named for a former French judge in Thailand who authored several books and papers dealing with hunan sexuality.  (Rene Guyon 1876-1963).  It was formed in 1962 by several couples during a lecture on human sexuality.  
</p>
<p>The Rene Guyon Society push for punishment of laws prohibiting pedophilia (we are experiencing evidence of this today).  For example (the following info is graphic), they want adults to be able to perform anal sex on children as young as 4.  They also say that children performing oral sex on adults will end thumb sucking.  According to their beliefs, men should be able to have sex with girls as young as 10.  
</p>
<p>They believe that if laws restricing child sexuality are not changed, there will be more youth involved in prostitution, contracting venereal diseases, and committing suicide.(are we not seeing evidence of this now, the most recent news being Milwaukee\'s teenage syphillis epidemic).  State rape laws should be changed to allow parents and guardians to give their consent for their children to have sex.  Newsletters have contained slogans such as, &quot;Children keep family sex secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>Membership #\'s in the Society are unknown and the actual validity of this society is questioned.  Verification that it does exist IMO overrules the negatives.  It is alleged there are more than 5 members, 1 member, 2,000 members, 8,500 members, etc.  The Society is supposedly headquartered in Beverly Hills, CA.

<p>While researching Rene Guyon\'s biographical information, resulting in little to no information, who pops up immediately?  Hillary Clinton and the surname &quot;Guyon.&quot; 
The digging started.  It became confusing.  After a few hours, specifically stating with credibility that Rene and Hillary are &quot;related&quot; can neither be established nor ruled out.

<p>When speaking of normalizing pedophilia, I believe that a definitive correlation exists between The Rene Guyon Society\'s philosophies and agenda and those of &quot;Sexology Organizations&quot; across the globe.  Take a look at this list.  Really?  How many of them do we need???
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sexology_organizations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sexology_organizations</a>
Quite a few have Planned Parenthood leaders as founders.</p>
<p>Focusing on one entity, &quot;American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists&quot;(AASECT),  led me to South Shore Sexual Health Center in Quincy, MA.  In more of a subtle not-in-your-face way, South Shore\'s goal is more likely than not the same as The Rene Guyon Society.</p>
<p>First of all, let\'s describe &quot;sex therapy.&quot;  It is a strategy for the treatment of sexual dysfunction when there is no medical etiology (physiological reason) or as a complement to medical treatment.  It is a form of psychotherapy.  It requires rigorous evaluation because sexual dysfunction may have a somatic base or a psychogenic base.  Any licensed mental health counselor can practice sex therapy.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_therapy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_therapy</a></p>
<p>South Shore is all about sex therapy.  AASECT oversees all of its clinical training.  According to South Shore, &quot;Who goes? - Anyone and everyone!  We frequently treat couples, individuals, and even work with adolescents.&quot;  They speak of their &quot;team of certified sex therapists.&quot;  Only 2 appear on their website.</p>
<p>Their explanation of an individual\'s sex therapy visit is contradictory.  On one hand they state, &quot;Sex therapy tends to be focused and brief, so one can generally expect anywhere from 5-12 sessions on average usually about an hour long.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, they state, &quot;Rather than attending therapy in a more ongoing way, busy clients are offered the option to participate in 3 -90 minute intensive sessions that take place over the course of a weekend.  These sessions allow for quicker movement through an issue or issues at hand.&quot;</p>
<p>South Shore offers a plethora of courses at its site, most lasting for 2 hrs., with all courses meeting the requirements of AASECT.</p>
<p>Here are the names of a few courses:
▪Poronography and Masturbation
▪Sexual Orientation and Queer Theory
▪Working With Children, Adolescents, and Families 
        Around Sexuality
▪Developmental Sexuality - From the Womb Until End-of-
        Life, Our Sexuality Never Stops Evolving and 
        Changing
▪Diversity and Lifestyle: BDSM and Kink and Everything 
       Else</p>
<p>Consider the course, &quot;Sexual Abuse and Exploitation&quot; -  explanation of its content:
&quot;Takes an in-depth look at the argument for and against decriminalization of sex work, breaking down the different categories that exist under this umbrella and looking to understand the feminist perspectives related to this field.  Sex trafficking is differentiated from sex work with current facts and stats regarding its prevalence, examined in detail alongside analysis of some of the major implications of treatment with those who have been victimized.&quot;</p>
<p>Here\'s another, &quot;Pedophilia&quot;:
&quot;This course introduces students to the vast array of theory and perspectives concerning the development and/or origins of pedophilia.  The course exposes students to voices from those who have been outspoken about pedophilia, both those within the community and those who advocate for a new approach to therapeutic treatment.  Treatment modalities, then controversy, are explored at length.&quot;</p>
<p>The speaker for this course is Evelyn Resh, MSN, MPH, CNN, a practicing nurse midwife, certified sexuality counselor, author, and Director of Sexual Health Services and Programming for Canyon Ranch, Lenox, MA.  Her 2 books - &quot;Wonen, Sex, Piwer, and Pleasure; Getting the Life (and Sex) You Want&quot; and &quot;The Secret Lives of Teen Girls.&quot;
<a href="http://www.sssexualhealthcenter.com/">http://www.sssexualhealthcenter.com/</a></p>
<p>Last but not least, South Shore has a Facebook page, and it\'s a doozy.  One post is titled &quot;Help Protect Your Child from Sexual Abuse.&quot;  Steps for protection are given.  Here is Step 4:
&quot;Explain that no child, teenager,  or adult can touch their private parts, that they should never touch another person\'s private parts even when asked, and that they should not view images of private parts.  Explain that if any of these things happen, they have the right to say \'no\' or \'stop\' and then must tell an adult.&quot;</p>
<p>The above tells me that if a child has the right to say no, the child also has the right to say yes.<br />
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ssshealthcenter/">https://www.facebook.com/ssshealthcenter/</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe it is fair to say that The Rene Guyon Society exists and poses as the frontrunner for the normalization and legalization of pedophilia.  It is also fair to say that since the formation of this society, a tangled web of organizations and treatment centers have arisen, with many of them more likely than not, in full support of The Rene Guyon Society\'s philosophy.</p>',

            </a>
            : Thank you for this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to ask you to add a sentence
            <em>
             at the top of your post
            </em>
            (after your first paragraph) that the Rene Guyon Society is a possibly mythical society, and that it doesn't seem to operate at present.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might want to cite the Wikipedia article about the society:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The René Guyon Society was a possibly mythical American group that is said to have advocated sexual relationships with children.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Guyon_Society#cite_note-wallace-2">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Guyon_Society#cite_note-wallace-2
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            When you've added a note that the society may have been fictitous, please delete the sentence 'The Rene Guyon Society is a national organization of persons'.
           </p>
           <p>
            This way, it will be clear from the beginning that the existence of the Rene Guyon society is debatable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you!
