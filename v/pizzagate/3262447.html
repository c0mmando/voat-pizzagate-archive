Be warned, for anyone who was born during the mid 80’s or earlier, this can be a very emotionally painful lead to look into. For me, I was a fan of her work when I was a kid. 1/1/2018 was the day Pizzagate became PERSONAL.</p>

<p>This chapter digs deeper into 1985 Twilight Zone, fine tunes the timeline, and links to the Heather O’Rourke Case.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_(1985_TV_series)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_(1985_TV_series)</a> The production company connected to the 1985 Twilight Zone was MGM. The same studio where Steven Spielberg found Heather O’Rourke. </p>

Episode airs 1-2 months afterwards on average. Knowing Judith was first molested at age 7, her birthday was 6/6/1978, the average production times of a 45 minute drama, and the air date was 9/27/1985, its possible to deduce an approximate time frame of the assault. I believe the date of the crime was somewhere between 7/19/1985 and 8/26/1985. Spielberg’s role was passing her around (still a culprit) rather than being the rapist.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws:_The_Revenge">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws:_The_Revenge</a> Production began on 2/2/1987. Filming moved to the Bahamas on 2/9/1987 and lasted for 38 days, ending 3/18/1987. The final filming resumed on 4/2/1987 and ended on 5/26/1987. </p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Phi Deguere Jr.. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.</p>
<p>-The Murder:
Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Sid Sheinberg, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Basically, it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death?</p>',

           Takes about 8 days to film a 45 minute drama. Episode airs 1-2 months afterwards on average. Knowing Judith was first molested at age 7, her birthday was 6/6/1978, the average production times of a 45 minute drama, and the air date was 9/27/1985, its possible to deduce an approximate time frame of the assault. I believe the date of the crime was somewhere between 7/19/1985 and 8/26/1985. Spielberg’s role was passing her around (still a culprit) rather than being the rapist.

           Found the locations in which the show were filmed. By process of elimination via watching the episode, Canada and Disney Golden Oak Ranch are not the site. I suspect the crime occured in MGM Studios in Culver City, CA.

           Comment about the term “Concrete Angel” possibly being as a form of taunting. Given the planted butterfly above, this is highly possible.

           Production began on 2/2/1987. Filming moved to the Bahamas on 2/9/1987 and lasted for 38 days, ending 3/18/1987. The final filming resumed on 4/2/1987 and ended on 5/26/1987.

           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Phi Deguere Jr.. Judith's mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder:
Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Sid Sheinberg, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Basically, it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
