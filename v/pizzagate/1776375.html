            Interesting article. I myself was abused from 5 to 8 by adults, and then as a preteen was pandered to my mother's friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am in a position to offer personal experience: This will work on minds that have reached higher stages of cognitive development, but most kids who are abused are in Piaget's second stage, the pre-operational stage, which starts when the child begins to learn to speak at age two and lasts up until the age of sevenish. (physical age does not always match developmental age.) Pre-operational stages, both intuitive and symbolic function, aren't able to manipulate certain things to this point. Looking back with adult awareness I was, as by definition, retarded in my social and personality growth by what happened, but I also later lived with one of my abusers (mom) who was angry her partner was taken from her and she blamed me for "seducing" him (stepdad, thought was dad)
           </p>
           <p>
            Seducing a child is done way differently and a kid cannot manipulate mental processes or the higher, critical  thinking the way we do now. I was being groomed, didn't know it. This is the stuff they don't tell you. How they do the grooming. It's little ways to make the kid feel special, focused on and all in a positive way. At first it is always a positive way. Pavlovian conditioning, right? A sneaky little treat no one else gets. Favored things over others. Front seat car rides. New clothes. Attention. Attention. Attention. Reading books and secret whispers. Always looks innocent. Then the touches start. Brush the hair with fingertips. Rub the small little back. The shoulder. Leaned down close and held me by the neck, so it was like a little cave. Verbal affection then it graduates to more, like an accidental brush of thigh. At first a giggle from a tickle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe gut instincts warns some of the kids. I didn't know but I knew something was making me not want it. At time I was uncomfortable with a thing, or two, but accepted it as "what is reality" because that was all I knew. I thought everyone's daddy made them massage that part of him as he laid on his bed smoking a cigarette.
           </p>
           <p>
            People do not get how it is. They get mad at the idea of it happening, but this stuff happens right under your noses. The kids do not even know it is bad, because so many parents never have that talk to a young kid about how their body is theirs, and God's, and no one has a right to touch it in certain places, because their body is special and safe until they grow up and fall in love. 
Honestly, no amount of talking to (me as)  a child after the fact about how this was wrong or that was improper did not really process through until 12 or so, (when my personal being pandered was at its peak).
           </p>
           <p>
            I told an officer myself at 8 and ended the first round. The state gave my mother back her kids and we survived with an undiagnosed bipolar borderline schizophrenic until each of us got away in our own ways. That situation changed me at 12  in a new way at that stage and at that point was when the ink blots and bullshit might have made a difference. What 8 year old can word or acknowledge such horrors properly to some strangers asking them shameful, embarrassing things that they took part in, either willingly or not?? Even as a child there is that shame, aching and deep enough to scar in its own way, that kept me from talking it out to a helpful manner. This is something no professional training can understand as an experience. It is like animals and comparing how they exist to an archaeologist and to a zoo keeper. Each one experiences the event a different way and in separate stages of understanding.. This stuff affects development and a child often regresses in social and behavioral manners. It is an event that kills the old child in figurative ways, and replaces it with an alternate reality version. No matter what parents think..if the child was abused while young, please, as one who lived it and struggled, have them see a counselor/therapist/psychiatrist/psychologist when they are older, too, because their own sexuality is going to fuck with their heads, and then encourage them to see one again when they are ready to have kids, because they will have fears and concerns and it will help to work through new mental development stages that even adults attain at separate times in life  (Piaget, etc.) and see to any personal cognitive dissonance about what happened to them as they face it on teen/young adult/adult stage. It makes ripples. They, and parents/caregivers/therapists need to be ready for it.

            "As Illuminati programmers, we were taught"
           </p>
           <p>
            You're an Illuminati programmer? Dude why are you shilling for these people? This post is pathetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            This post is called "gas-lighting". The shills want to throw doubt around when they're not pretending to be Nazis or warning Pizzagate was brought to you buy space aliens who told them the earth is flat.

            In the Astor chapter, the Todd family is mentioned.  When I saw it before, I wondered if it connected in any way with Sweeny Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street.  And then there is the Sondheim musical and a film with Johnny Depp!
