<blockquote>
<h2>The former Clinton campaign chairman is among the victims still recovering from a vile conspiracy theory that ended in gunfire</h2>
<p>...Podesta is easily forgiven for having little time for his tormentors. Since 2016, he has been the victim of a deranged and viral conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate. The theory — which has its roots in the emails stolen from his personal account by Russian hackers and dumped online by WikiLeaks — claimed that Podesta was a pedophile and that he, Hillary Clinton and a Washington, D.C., restaurateur named James Alefantis ran a child sex-trafficking ring from the basement of Alefantis’ pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong.</p>
<p>On its face, Pizzagate was insane, with zero basis in reality. Yet in the frenzied days after Donald Trump’s election, it caught fire on social media platforms including Twitter, YouTube, Reddit and 4Chan, metastasizing into a story so twisted and bizarre that it radicalized online trolls and traumatized others who, through no fault of their own, had gotten sucked into the conspiracy...</p>
<p>Even after the arrest, Pizzagate lived on. The day after Welch stalked into Comet, Michael Flynn, Jr., the son of Trump’s first national security adviser, tweeted: “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story.” An Economist/YouGov poll in late December 2016 found that 46 percent of Trump voters and 17 percent of Clinton voters thought Pizzagate was real. A few months later, a small rally of Pizzagate believers took place outside the White House. Protesters have stood outside Comet carrying blown-up photos of Alefantis’ god-daughter taken from his social media accounts. Strangers online have threatened to torture, rape and kill him.</p>
<p>“I’ve been through a lot of Washington shit in my life,” Alefantis tells Rolling Stone. He grew up in D.C., and dated David Brock, the notorious conservative journalist turned Clinton loyalist, for 10 years. “This is not my first time at the rodeo,” he says. “I had never seen this volume of specific, directed attacks.”</p>
<p>...Podesta claims he wasn’t overly concerned about his emails getting released: their contents, he now says, were “relatively much ado about nothing.” It wasn’t until after the election that he realized those emails had become fuel for a horrific conspiracy theory. In his career, he says he had never been on the receiving end of something like Pizzagate. “It’s painful and crazy,” he says. “I’m pretty grizzled. One big difference is you’ve got somebody sitting in the Oval Office stoking the conspiracy. That’s pretty different than what I’ve experienced in my years in politics.”...</p>
<p>...As the threats became more violent, Alefantis repeatedly contacted the D.C. police and the FBI. He estimates he called the bureau three or four times and described a situation that, he admits, sounded insane. The FBI largely told him to call the police. “They were essentially like, ‘If you get a specific threat, let us know. Thank you, goodbye.\'” When he asked what qualified as a specific threat, the FBI said, “A date and time when they’re going to come.” He says the local police visited Comet on multiple occasions but there was zero specific action taken by the police or the FBI as the threats escalated in the weeks after the election. (The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>
<p>But the onslaught proved too much for him to handle on his own. Through a friend, he got in touch with Mike Gottlieb, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner. (David Boies, one of the firm’s founders, is the renowned litigator who has faced criticism for his work on behalf of Harvey Weinstein and the fraudulent blood-testing company Theranos.) Alefantis and Gottlieb met on a Friday in early December 2016, and Gottlieb agreed to take on Alefantis as a client. That Sunday, Welch walked into the restaurant, guns in tow. (Welch did not respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment.)...</p>
<p>After Comet was back up and running, Alefantis and his lawyers set out to stop the spread of Pizzagate. “For me, at some point, I was like: My name is totally destroyed,” Alefantis says. “I just didn’t want anyone to come shoot us up again.” </p>
<p>The response from the social media companies ranged from helpful to utterly dismissive, Alefantis recalls. Even before he’d hired lawyers, Alefantis had gotten Yelp to suspend Comet’s page after his staff had reported the abusive reviews. Facebook was responsive to Comet’s complaints. YouTube, however, refused to so much as acknowledge its role in amplifying Pizzagate, saying they were just a platform, that they weren’t an arbiter of truth and falsity and told Alefantis to get back in touch if and when he could get a court order finding the videos that promoted Pizzagate to be defamatory. </p>
<p>The only real strategy, Alefantis realized, was a legal strategy. He would have to get aggressive with the loudest proponents of Pizzagate, people like Alex Jones, host of InfoWars, who had run multiple broadcasts with titles like “Pizzagate Is Real” and “Pizzagate: The Bigger Picture.”</p>
<p>Gradually, in the months after the gunman showed up, Jones and others seemed to bow to legal pressure and backed away from Pizzagate. On March 24th, 2017, Jones published online and read on-air a lengthy statement in which he apologized to Alefantis, announced that he had removed past broadcasts about Pizzagate and admitted that those stories were based on “an incorrect narrative.” Neither Alefantis nor his lawyers would further comment on any interactions with Jones or on any possible settlement.  
</p>
<p>Podesta says he considered litigation as well. But suing the Pizzagaters would be extremely difficult given that he was a major public figure. He pushed back against the trolls on Twitter, but that didn’t make much difference, either. </p>
<p>This past September, Alefantis traveled to New York City to attend a therapy session with his ex-boyfriend. Alefantis and his ex had broken up as Pizzagate was raging, but they had decided to see a therapist together. During their session, Alefantis assured his ex that, almost two years later, the nightmare had passed. “Things have moved on,” he recalls saying. “You’re safe. Everyone’s fine. It’s all over.”</p>
<p>After their session, they headed for the subway. A stranger approached Alefantis on the street and began taking pictures in his face and screaming at him.</p>
<p>“I’m going to my kid’s school right now!” the stranger said, apparently fearing for his child’s safety.</p>
<p>“Don’t engage, James,” his ex told him.</p>
<p>...the trauma remains. He’s been called the most despicable thing you can say to someone. Even in liberal circles, people jokingly refer to him as the Pizzagate guy. He’s figuring out what the ordeal means for his future. “Previous to this, I was out in the world and I had nothing but glowing Google hits and my restaurants were easily reviewed,” he says. “Now, it’s nothing but filth, basically. When I go into a business meeting or do a new venture or go into a new relationship with someone serious, there are major issues. It’s destroyed my name.”</p>
<p>Pizzagate has left him with some pretty big scars, Podesta says, but he worries more about the victims of viral conspiracy theories who don’t have his thick skin. “As a person who’s pretty hardened by a lifetime in politics, I sometimes think, ‘Well, how would a normal person even begin to live with this?\'”</p>
<p>He catches himself from sounding too woe-is-me. “I’ve had the honor of working for a president,” he says. “I can’t bitch too much about my life. It’s been pretty good.”</p>
<p>“The pizza’s still good at Comet, too.”</p>

            I notice the one thing these freaks never do is directly deny the allegations, something like "I would never intentionally harm a child" or "Pedos are disgusting and being accused of being one is my worst nightmare" or "those who know me know that I am completely innocent and would never harm a child" - Instead they lash out as if they have been exposed rather than stridently denying any wrongdoing. 2 years on and no high profile people identified have been charged let alone investigated.

            We are almost in 2019 and still nothing. Probably because this is a cover-up, not an investigation. The same authorities that cover-up don't then investigate. They know what happens there, hence the cover-up. There is no PG ivnestigation, it's a cover-up.

            I didn't read all of that shit but the first paragraph was SOOO fucking obvious of how deranged
            <em>
             IT

            was! Literally lie after lie after lie and trying to be covering his ass but failing so miserably. The audacity and GALL they have to call

            I happened to listen to this call-in chat show by Lift the Veil last night and someone called Chris phoned in and shared that he had been sexually abused by TONY PODESTA (statement at 1:30:55) and that there is a basement at Comet PP!  - Yellow Vests, Tariff Man, Phone Calls

            (Start of his call at - 1:24:30 for call) btw still unverified as of now since it was only last night I heard it.

             JA said they put the canned tomato sauce in the basement, for one.  And secondly, when other adjacent "storefronts" have a basement, as is documented, the units in between have basements as well.  Common construction practices.  They didn't build the 5000 block of Conn Ave one unit at a time.  It was all built at the same time, meaning they excavated basements for all units.

              I believe it has a basement 100%, I've got into a habit of adding disclaimer at the end of my statements online hahaha -  Btw, like I have said a million times, all the police have to do in these buildings is to take in a cadaver dog - its indications of death would be off the charts - but they don't want to find the truth.  Wish we had a truther who was a police man with a cadaver dog, slip a jacket 'Guide Dog for the Blind' on it and go into any of these suspected places! There will be your answer!  - I wish they would have done that regarding the Hampstead Children Satanic Church - it has now all been conveniently renovated, I heard wooden floors replaced because of 'age' or something like that.  But a dog could still detect death.

              FOIA requests were sent out by Titus Frost and Bigfish (the hacker) but the DC Freemason police/FBI keep stalling and not answering the request it just sits and goes nowhere. The hacker, Bigfish(?) on Twitter is actively involved in Pizzagate. Ray doing what you mentioned above and see where it takes you but be warned that the hacker was gang stalked and on their watch list. Interpol is likely infiltrated by the same Luciferian satanic groups of people also. They are everywhere at this point and they are hunting the people reporting the issues rather than the issues themselves. If you have a secure and safe way of doing so, then by all means do it, try it but be warned.

            Wow, is this a "Podesta Speaks" interview or an "Alefantis speaks" interview? I can't believe the lengths the mainstream media will go to protect and defend this incident and why now after all this time you would think that this article would only lend MUCH more stress to the issue for those involved and would you would think they would want to just move on with their lives but no,
            <strong>
             this article shows much more than that, it shows a confrontation, it shows contempt for pizzagates existence altogether
            </strong>
            ,
            <em>
             this is a demon backed into a corner in an attempt to take just one more bite at you before it is consumed
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Rolling Stone is fooling NOONE and it is evident on all social media platforms.
           </p>
           <p>
            This issue should be a non-sequitur because they have ALREADY dismissed it so fervently so MANY TIMES that this article MAKES NO SENSE. if it's false and it's done it's time for healing and not more attention. THIS SIMPLY LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER CASE OF ''THOU PROTESTETH TOO MUCH''.
           </p>
           <p>
            The simple fact that Rollinfg Stone wants to continue to report on THIS ISSUE when many horrible things occur in this world on a second to second basis when the mainstream media does not have the time or resources to cover every incident every day that has a much more drastic effect on the worlds population than say a story about a lonely pizza shop on connecticut avenue in washington dc and a single incident shooting where no one was killed but go ahead with the story anyway say a hell of a lot. In fact it says everything. The Stone has ALWAYS been a vanguard for that kind of 'edgy' reporting. It was the same thing with the E. Howard Hunt story, told you a bunch of intersting details about the JFK assasination and may have eve told you part of the truth, of course E Howard Hunt was one of the bum cia spooks there at Dealey Plaza, but Hunt certainly didn't throw much light on the fact that Rafael Cruz AND George Herbert Walker Bush was there as well and that the JFK assassination was complete RITUAL organized with many facets, goals and projections with as many as 7 shooters all ready to make sure the President was DEAD. That's the kind of reporting we can count on from Rolling Stone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doesn't matter anyway your ENTIRE gig is blown apart, Dave McGowan and Miles Mathis blew the lid off of your Lubavitcher Bob Dylan and your dumb hippy experiment along with your luciferian satanist Rolling Stones and Tavistock Beatles, you ALL are just so DONE telling us whats hip and cool.
           </p>
           <p>
            You fucking idiots only have ONE entity and ONE thing to blame for you misery, YOURSELVES Alefantis and Podesta, your karma isn't done serving you. The SECOND one you can blame INSTEAD OF THE PEOPLE THAT DETEST YOUR LIFESTYLE (not the homosexual one the one where you let children attend all night Heavy Breathing seminars) is WIKILEAKS...
           </p>
           <p>
            ...do you GET THAT.... WIKILEAKS... NOT the population that began to investigate you what we were doing was only a logical conclusion to HINTS that WIKILEAKS GAVE US!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Are you trying to DEMONIZE the population for wanting to make it SAFER FOR CHILDREN?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            is that what you are doing ROLLING STONE is telling the American People they are WRONG?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Are you telling the American People they are WRONG for investigating HEINOUS CRIMES and wanting to make it safer in this world for THEIR CHILDREN?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            It REALLY REALLY seems that way the way you wrote this story and continue to ignore the facts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep fucking yourselves assholes.

               Wow...look at that body language. He was literally
               <em>
                pushing the question away with his hand
               </em>
               . Stuck to his prepared talking points really well, too. Good for her for asking, whoever she was. His playing the crowd to laugh at her was classic. I hope she didn't succumb to the shaming, because that could be a powerful redpill.

            Bit of a misleading title though isn't it?  Because it was a fluff piece all about that pedo Alefantis with some gloating by that wrinkly ball-sac, Podesta.

             Yeah the Rolling Stone title was total clickbait, and Podesta's quote at the end was a direct troll of us. Podesta trolled Assange, too.

            Well, judging by what I've seen of Alefantis since Pizzagate broke, it doesn't seem to have stopped him from doing much. He's still out in public all the time, still travelling all the time, still involved in business ventures etc. So spare me your boo-hoo's Rolling Stone, that isn't reality. We
            <em>
             know
            </em>
            there's something here and we
            <em>
             will
            </em>
            get to the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S: I don't take that to mean they broke up because of Pizzagate, or even that they are 'in counselling' because of Pizzagate either, just Fags with issues.

             NY Daily Mail didn't give any reasons for the brouhaha either....this type of thing is helping US to ignore MSM. Maybe why so many are waking up? Their propaganda arm of news is not working ? Good journalism used to give opposing sides and was supposedly neutral.

             Benjamin Freed and Jessica Sidman of the Washingtonian wrote: "Acting DC Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters Sunday evening that Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong and did fire at least one shot into the ground. Police added that the Welch's car is registered in North Carolina. Welch made no vocal threats or demands during the incident inside Comet Ping Pong, police say." (Newsham is the one who had his picture taken with Alefantis in support of Comet Ping Pong. Did not investigate pizzagate allegations.)
            </p>
            <p>
             SO, WHEN DID HE FIRE INTO A LOCKED CLOSET SUPPOSEDLY CONTAINING A COMPUTER HARD DRIVE? If Welch was truly investigating for "trafficked children", why would he fire into a closet that could have potentially been hiding children? If Welch believed there was a basement in Comet hiding trafficked children, WHY WOULD HE FIRE A GUN INTO THE FLOOR? False flag?

             WAS THIS PART OF A PLEA DEAL? Before driving to Comet: "Edgar Maddison Welch struck a teenager with his car, sending him to the hospital by helicopter, in October 2016, according to a report by WBTV.

            </p>
            <p>
             The incident happened about 7:30 p.m. in Salisbury, North Carolina, the news station reports. Kenyatta Belton, 13, suffered head, torso and leg injuries after he was truck by Welch’s Buick LeSabre. (HE DRIVES TO COMET IN A PRIUS)
            </p>
            <p>
             Witnesses told the news station that the victim was walking with several other friends when he was struck by the car.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We was walking down the road, just a normal walk, and this one car had the full road,” Belton’s friend, Sean Lankford, told the news station. “We was pretty much on the white line and he wiped out one of my friends and he had the whole road to turn into even the whole other lane, even in the same lane he could have avoided him.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “My friend is really really badly hurt, it’s just a normal walk gone bad and one car made a big difference,” Lankford told WBTV."

             Note: ONE witness. Welch pointed gun in his direction (assault with a dangerous weapon). Witness fled out back and called 911. Does not mention anyone hearing gun shots. States "unlawful discharge of a firearm." DOESN'T SAY WHERE OR HOW MANY OR WHEN. DOES NOT MENTION EYE WITNESS TO THIS. The door, lock and COMPUTER TOWER is only listed as DAMAGED and is taken into custody. IT IS NOT LISTED AS SEIZED EVIDENCE. A pizzagate researcher had reported a few days prior that they had hacked Comet's website and found cp. When was the tower "shot" ?

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Mr. Cohen. When you were at the FBI, did you have any reason
to investigate the people who propagated stories that Seth Rich 
57
was murdered by folks within the DNC or other democratic
operatives or any of the people that talked about this pizza
operation, the pizzagate thing? Did you ever investigate the
people that started those conspiratorial stories?

             NY Daily Mail also did a big conspiracy theory story yesterday. Noose must be tightening. This is also positive..."The FBI largely told him to call the police. “They were essentially like, ‘If you get a specific threat, let us know. Thank you, goodbye.'” Police and FBI must not be allowed to cover for him anymore.

              Yep, PG has been cropping up all over recently. Only the Q related threads talked about it and even then quite sparingly.
              <br/>
              It does indeed feel like something is up yet again. These idiots were always terrible at hiding their consternation.

Other commenters have called him out. LOL!

               LET'S NOT FORGET JOHN PODESTA'S HELP IN COVERING UP HILLARY'S EMAIL SCANDAL.
Obama slipped and said he only learned about Hillary using a private server for govt. business email when he heard it in the news.
Podesta email shows they knew Obama had email from Hillary that was not state.gov  OOPS!

            I think it is interesting that no article about Pizzagate, 'the vile conspiracy theory' mentions Voat nowadays - neither the RS article, nor other MSM articles I have read in the past months.
