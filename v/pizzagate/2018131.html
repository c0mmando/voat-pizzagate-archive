            Not long ago Justin Bieber surprisingly made a guest appearance at Hillsong, a Pentecostal megachurch in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that one of the founders of Hillsong, the late Frank Houston, who was the father of the current pastor Brian Houston, confessed to the sexual abuse of a boy in New Zealand and is known to be guilty in many further cases of sexual abuse of children.  Also Fiona Barnett on her podcast Pedos Down Under (which is on Youtube) interviewed Deb the mother of two children who were victims of this Frank Houston and who witnessed the murder of another child in satanic ritual conducted by this Frank Houston.

            Reading the comments, I have to say..... Wow.....
Ive worked with, and toured with major pop stars; including several who have been accused of these same illuminati, soul selling, breakdown, programming scenario's...One huge pop star I toured with, recently recommitted herself to Jesus Christ.... I was married to one of her band members, and her tour manager is my cousin.... During those five years, I became good friends with her.... (I have also sung with many other A listers... dated very famous rock stars..... acted and did work as an extra/day player, in T.V. and Movies; made it to the finals on a singing tv show competition. And my childhood best friend; a famous actress; won an academy award LAST YEAR...we grew up together..... lots and lots of friends in the entertainment industry.....and many tales I've yet to tell.....)....
The pop star I'm talking about recently gave herself to JesusChrist.
It wouldn't be hard to figure out who I am referring to...
And if I have to, I'll prove it. But dropping names isn't my reason for this post.
I mention my associations and experience for credibility.
I understand why people here believe that everyone at this level is a Satanist/Luciferian.
In many cases, thats probably true; although I suspect some of these kids have either been born into it; sold into it; or manipulated into it; innocently never really grasping the depth of the contract until it was too late, and at that point the options are slim.... but it's really just a certain kind of person that get's beyond a certain realm in that business.... unless, as I said, they were already affiliated by birth. These "Disney Kids"  are operating in a highly functional, post hypnotic trance... They don't know anything.
Just that there is fame a fortune at their fingertips, and smiling faces with contracts , offering them the world on a string.
..... 
When I first moved to Los Angeles, back in the early '90's, I remember a pizza place that was crawling with under aged famous kids who would be there until very late at night; and did very weird things..... Drew Barrymore, and Balthazar Getty were among them.... It was called Domiani's, ( I can't recall the spelling... they were open very late; across the street from a famous Hollywood deli...and I was there.....I remember being only sightly older than these kids, but they had pagers, ( a '90's gadget...pre cell phone....lol)... the pagers would vibrate; they'd look down at them, and either run out the door, or meet someone in the rest room.... I thought it was drugs.... maybe it was....but what struck me was that it was almost always middle aged or old men heading into the restrooms with them..... This was a very long time ago, and I have no evidence now, beyond my own recollections.... But it's one of the things that creeped me out about L.A.; and looking back, I do shudder... This is just one story of so many.....
I know what this young man has been going through.... I was also prodded and pushed; made to allow the advances of creepy industry men, AND women, and that ultimately was the reason I left....
Justin Beiber has got trauma in his past, and people pulling on him constantly..... He's a cash cow for the people who pretend to give a shit about him.
Hillsong is a New Age fake Christianity black hole..... but his belief is sincere....
           </p>
           <p>
            This young man is going through Hell.
He is surrounded by nefarious soul sucking assholes.
From Braun to "Bad Boy" .... nothing but evil , self serving perverts.... even his own family and so called "Friends".... are on the take.
Please try not to be so dismissive of these kids.
Can you imagine how isolated and paranoid they are?
It's not funny when someone realizes their whole existence is nothing like what they thought; that their dream is actually a nightmare....and  their memories are bullshit
Its devastating...especially if the price they paid was more than they had to give.
Don't ridicule him. Pray for him. He's alone..... in a room full of strangers......and he has nobody to turn to...
They're all in on it. It's impossible to leave.....
And they do not fuck around.

             i agree with you. money and fame are no substitute for a stable loving home environment. these kids think they are going to get the world and all they end up with is a never ending nightmare and their life in danger  :(

            Not buying this narrative.  However, Daniel Day Lewis just mysteriously retired and said he didn't want to go in to details, he just wants to do other things. I found that to be close to impossible to believe. So who knows.

            Justin Bieber can change his life for Good by doing one thing to show the world the real Truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Justin - the "ROOT" of all Evil is in Racine, Wisconsin. We forgive your trespasses, and if you really want to help, you need to expose Racine and the real agenda of Total Global Enslavement through the Mark of the Beast (mandatory chips and vaccines)
           </p>
           <p>
            Agenda 2030 began with Racine as the model for Sustainability and Community Policing. It is much more than that, and it is being directed by Pilgrims Society, Trilateral Commission, CFR, Club of Rome, Black Nobility and others leading to the Council of 13.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know the Truth, and if you want to be saved Justin, you need to shine the light on Racine, Wisconsin for the world to see.

            When you realize pizzagate is real, run Justin...
 This is probably more fake Hollywood stuff, look how mk ultra'd his eye is, they will reprogram him if he gets to much out of line.

              Good question. Lentz was featured on Oprah. All I need to know to run in the other directions. I could almost swear his name came up in connection to #pizzagate before. What the hell happened there? It was a connection someone made. Too much to remember.

               I know I've come across Lentz a few years back on ATS, specifically about Bieber and Hillsong. I'll see if I can find that particular thread. But I also feel like I've seen that name here, too, and perhaps didn't fully digest it.

                  I actually feel sorry for Bieber. I believe he's such a toy that the handlers pass around. He's totally manipulated and probably has no say in anything. He's probably been passed to this Lentz guy. Very sad. Bieber was looking for an Australian wife. Probably want Bieber to produce kids. I hope it doesn't happen. Or maybe they'll have him adopt some.

            Bieber has been involved with this Fake Church for a number of years. This is
            <strong>
             NOT
            </strong>
            the first time his publicity team has done this. He has cancelled tours before because, "Well, Hillsong."

            I know I will be called names but Justin started out singing gospel songs as a little boy. He has struggled between these two worlds ever since. In the past 6 months he has been seen in the audiences of evangelical churches many times, As well as hanging out with Hillsong and spontaneously singing hymns. So it does not appear a one day decision at least.

            If at all true, his programming temporarily mal-functioned and I'd predict a period of convalescence after which he re-emerges as an "upgraded," er...I mean downgraded, version of himself.

            And every step of his fake "re-dedication to Christ" is choreographed by his handlers.  To get attention, publicity, generating more money.  He is not going to be an asset against evil.  Maybe when this all comes out, but not now.

            Hillsong Church is a cult. No different than any other. Bieber has been involved with this "church" for quite awhile now. In fact, he pulled a similar stunt a few years ago with "dropping tour dates" to "find Jesus" with this group.
