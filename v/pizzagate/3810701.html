<p>Unfortunately, I cannot provide for any source-able information since this matter is evidently highly suppressed by the authorities, specifically being on the part the British Government.

            This went downhill as soon as I posted the email and it got tagged by the mod. People have jumped ship and decided to ignore or refute the credible and sincere approach of my disclosure. That is incredibly frustrating and unfair.

             While you may be sincere, Vigilia, you are certainly not credible. McCann was taken as a toddler. Where would she learn Morse Code? From her slavers? That one fragment of this story destroys it's credibility. Add on the fantastical "pheromone ESP" stuff and you have moved into the realm of mocking those who have spent years here documenting and researching the facts about the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sorry you find challenges to your story frustrating. It is not, however, unfair.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you have a look at the submission rules in the sidebar, you will note that we have two subverses -- one for serious research and one for indirectly related and/or purely speculative material. Rule 2 requires every major claim be supported by linked evidence. To satisfy that requirement, you would need to show that McCann knew Morse Code, that pheromones can traverse continents, etc. Obviously, that is not going to happen. By all rights, this submission could never qualify as a serious research post. Posting it here to the main board and expecting it to be treated as such is grossly selfish. It gets people's hopes up for McCann and then crushes them. It exploits people's good will to make them look like fools. It wastes their time and distracts them from real research. It subverts the purpose of this board.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your expectation that the submission rules created by the community to protect all the research here not apply to you is what is unfair.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please honor the mission of this research subverse by posting all future submissions that do not meet the standards of this board to our speculative sister-sub,

               I think there may be another explanation for your experiences you may want to look into. An aspect of mental health/illness that is almost always overlooked. If you can, I recommend a thorough read of
               <em>
                Introduction to the Science of Mental Health
               </em>

Yes, I have made calls in the past as a result of delusions because I was suffering from an undiagnosed condition and did not understand what I was going through, but ever since I realised that I suffer from a mental health condition I have clamped down on irrational behaviour as I realised I was becoming a liability. I acknowledge the errors of my ways in the past in dealing with my experiences. In any case, without regard as to my previous or current state of capacity, it is unprofessional to ignore serious intelligence and complaints regarding a high-profile missing person; it would be extremely foolish for the police to further ignore this.

             This has nothing to do with schizophrenia. It appears that yet again people jump with the mental illness option as soon as they realise that I suffer from something which is actually very common. It is wholly unfair and downright offensive.
            </p>
            <p>
             I specifically brought this to the attention of the police as it is unlawful prejudice if of an official capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
             I repeat, this is not on the part of affliction, these are genuine sensations and communications from a living person.
            </p>
            <p>
             I expect nobody on this forum to believe a complete stranger, but I most certainly would expect the police and thus a court of law to exercise due attention to the details I have provided. Alas, this will never reach court and hence my going public.

              . Like I said, I'm going along with this as mental exercise, if not because I want to believe you have genuine powers and intentions. I believe what you discuss, sounds ''crazy'' but is possible. However here we also have to entertain the possibility that you may be here to discredit our forum or this subject matter, and will therfore be scrutinized. You have to understand that starting a letter off with a statement about mental illness is a poor tactic at least, and a red herring at the worst. If you are telling the truth, eventually it will prevail.

               I'm not here to discredit Voat. I'm a white hat, I vouch for freedom and health, not the suppression of such or the promotion of agendas against. When it comes to children, that is even more important. This is certainly an area which requires scrutiny, I understand that.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for the letter, I've had contact with the police in the past so they're aware of my history. As in mental health that is, not crime. Thus, I had to reference it and make it clear that I'm experiencing something which has seemingly never before been documented.

             From around August/September I began to notice women reacting to a smell I have been giving off, particularly in pubs. I am not talking about a hygiene problem, I realised this was something else entirely. I eventually came to the conclusion that it is a pheromone. How I have come to give off an active pheromone I do not know, this is unheard of and it would probably require an endocrinologist to ascertain exactly what has occurred. It may be something to do with excessive tryptamine use between 2012-15, it could also be genetic. However it happened, that is the situation I now find myself in. I am in no position to identify this specific pheromone, but I do believe that it is a neurosteroid which acts as a potent aphrodisiac. I won't provide the direct links here in case I trigger the spam filter, but you may find these terms on Wikipedia, which are relevant to the release and detection of hormones related to mating...

             On the 16th November I was sat in a pub alone and was pondering about this thing. I came to the conclusion that what I was experiencing is a form of telepathy, so I decided to give it a test. The first person I thought of to try this out on was Madeleine McCann. I closed my eyes, clasped my hands together, pictured Maddie in my mind, prayed to God that she's alive and knows Morse code, and said Amen. Lo-and-behold, I immediately got a very distinct smell. I made a link with her. I blinked hard at her, she blinked back. I blinked again, she blinked twice. I then blinked using Morse code

             A response would be greatly appreciated. I'd actually like the tag to be changed to "unverified", as what I have described is an honest testimony. I would never mislead anybody with regards to child trafficking.

             Thanks a bunch. Surely I've been here long enough to establish that I'm a sincere poster. Do you honestly believe that I'd involve three constabularies for no reason? If it was bullshit, I'd have been arrested by now and I haven't been. I'm being 100% honest. Heck, I'll even give you the link to my Facebook profile if it helps.

              Well whatever. There's nothing I can do to convince people on a forum. What I can do, however, is undertake a brain scan to show activity which would support my claim. I'm convinced that parts of the brain would light up, potentially showing Morse code. I obviously can't do that here, but I would challenge the authorities to it.

               I'm not against you though. I recommend everyone judge what they read for themselves and come to their own conclusions, and based on my experience with mental health, it seems very delusional.

            From your email:
           </p>
           <p>
            "After 6 weeks we started to become close, we would often fall asleep together, feeling each other's warmth and breathing together. Prior to this I wouldn't get too comfortable with her due to her age, but we seemed to find solace in one another."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Ever since I broke her off I have had no end of random females coming in. They have not left me alone ever since I departed from that two-month relationship, they are constantly making me smell sex. Most of the time a dog is involved. It has now developed into a situation where anal sex is going on - I can smell it, it is unmistakable. I cannot lie down at night without somebody being there; I cannot feel horny alone without somebody trying it on with me. Almost every single time, I can smell a female. It has not stopped in over a week."
           </p>
           <p>
            "I have been questioned with regards to my mental health, which I interpret as the police simply believing it is a symptom of schizophrenia. Yes, I do suffer from such but I challenge the police force, or indeed a psychiatrist, to find another example of somebody experiencing what I am. Good luck. Yes, I have made calls in the past as a result of delusions because I was suffering from an undiagnosed condition and did not understand what I was going through, but ever since I realised that I suffer from a mental health condition I have clamped down on irrational behaviour as I realised I was becoming a liability."
           </p>
           <p>
            Based on this information you've given, it strongly seems to me that your condition is resurging. I believe you need medicine. The process by which you are receiving instantaneous communication doesn't make sense as smells cannot operate in the way you've described----and you even admitted it was "unheard of" to be able to communicate by smell over long distances, and you're right. There's never been evidence of such I've ever encountered. Even polar bears' smell is limited by how fast particles move throughout the air, and brain disorders which affect smell and taste do exist and can be treated. Delusional beliefs never seem delusional to the person having them, until they are cured and can look back on what they've experienced with a clear mind.

             Yea I didnt see a lot of this yesterday. But like OrdoTempli said.. I was also LARP'ing along. Did have hope, but I hadnt seen these emails yet either.

             I believe he believes this is real, but so much to consider.

             The brain is powerful beyond what we can comprehend, &amp; if suffering from serious mental health like that, it can make u believe literally anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a friend who works in a mental health hospital &amp; have heard stories of things crazier than this that people truly believe is going on.

              Yeah, I've studied and heard of cases more bizarre than this.  I'm pretty sure Madeleine is dead based on analysis of the parent's statements. If he does really believe this stuff and it's not trolling, I don't blame him. Delusions have limitless potential for what they can make you believe or assume. I noticed in his email many illogical assumptions were being made that were characteristic of delusional tendency to link things together that do not logically flow from each other.

            As per this subverse’s rules (see side bar), you will need to put in a relevant link as per rule 2.

            rules regarding witness accounts get kinda murky. Which is a MASSIVE pain in the ass given this board could REALLY use them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the interpretation is that witness accounts auto cover rule 1, but just need a relevant link to the material connected to comply with rule 2.

             Claims of remotely channeling a Vulcan mind meld via pheromones and vomeronasal organ (VNO) across continents hardly counts as a witness account imho, more like a fantasy LARP or more likely in this case, something to do with self admitted mental illness.  I'm not saying that mental illness should be the sole reason to be skeptical but it should be considered in evaluating the claims in the post (claims of remotely smelling and communicating with Madelaine McCann in coded messages and OP's claims of developing a one sided relationship with the underage perception, but to OP's credit, he claims he broke it off when she wanted to engage in bestiality and have him involved.

              I agree, past history with a mental health disorder should certainly be taken into account. I won't deny that.

              But as soon as I disclosed it I got attacked.

              This is no fantasy. What I am experiencing is torrid and it's abhorrent. I could not possibly make this up, and nor would I push an agenda of such. To do so in Maddie's name would be an outrage.

             <p>
              I speak a truthful testimony, such that no public authority has ever been willing to hear. I have been systematically ignored by them. They are ignoring this because they know what happened to her.

               Basically you've presented a situation where the most reasonable explanation is one of two scenarios, and in both, mental illness is the most relevant factor.  There's really nothing more to discuss, people can either view you as a tortured soul experiencing a disturbing and abhorrent period in your life or they view you as someone who would troll the board with a story that exploits the image of Madelaine McCann in a very sick and outrageous account that only an unstable and abhorrent personality would find gratifying in any way.  It's unreasonable to criticize people when they attribute one or the other reasons for your post.

                The problem isn't that anybody is speculating about my well-being, it's the assertion. I find that extremely offensive, an attack on my person.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is absolutely nothing gratifying whatsoever about what I have had to go through over the past few months. Yes, you are right, I'm a tortured soul now as a result of it; it terrifies me.
               </p>
               <p>
                I've already made it very clear that I would never disrespect this board, any other outlet or indeed individual, which is advocating for the well-being of the victims of trafficking.

                Make what you will of my testimony, I cannot make up other people's minds on the matter. But please do not insult me by suggesting it matter of fact that I am exploiting this subject, that it is purely on the part of mental instability or that I enjoy it.

                 I just laid out the two most logical attributions that an average person will come away with from reading this thread.  It's easier for me to take you at your word over the tortured soul scenario, if nothing else, due to benefit of the doubt, but I can't logically rule out the alternative.  If you are seeking support, you can still discuss your experience on the other sub, as Vindicator kindly pointed out, but your experience does belong on this sub, there is not one claim that can be substantiated in regard to the identity and current circumstance of Madelaine McCann.  You yourself have admitted that this person you believe is communicating with you may be untruthful, which leaves the possibility that, even if people take you at your word that you are communicating with someone remotely, that person could tell you they are the Queen of England and there would be no more 'evidence' to support it (though clearly your experience as you have described it relates to sexual abuse, your descriptions sound as if you are the one experiencing abuse, not some other person in another country).

                    I'm not sure, it was a subtle smell. I have made and received contact with many people since that first time reaching her in November (I had never even considered the possibility, let alone attempted it prior to that). At times I genuinely get confused as to who is firing at me. I know Maddie's smell so I will generally recognise her, but if the smell is subtle enough it's difficult to identify it. Note that everybody has their own unique smell and it gets stronger with age. So I may also mistake the smell for somebody of a similar age.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'll also tell you this, and again I'm being absolutely honest here. Right or wrong about my interpretations as to the information I have received via Morse, there is no mistaking the smells. Last week I was rudely awoken in the early morning by the smell of gunpowder; subconsciously I became alarmed while not fully awake, and although I have never before smelled gunpowder (I'm English, we don't do guns here) I knew instantly that's what it was. Shortly after, I could smell the oily, metallic and powdery barrel of a gun. I ain't shitting you.

             We usually add an "Unverified" flair to personal testimony that cannot be corroborated. If it can be corroborated, then no flair. I'll add a flair to this. Thanks DK.

             What kind of stupid question is that? She wasn't even four.

             For what it's worth, though, I think she is actually happy doing what she's doing. It's her life, she's used to it.

             No, it's the result of me reaching her in the first place. Hitting a woman with this pheromone activates it and gives them the ability.

             I explicitly reached out to her in a way which I, and probably nobody else, had never tried before. I got a response, and an SOS to boot.
            </p>
            <p>
             She's very clearly currently involved in a paedophile network, which fits perfectly into her disappearing in the first place at such a young age.
            </p>
            <p>
             She's not the only one I've contacted either. I won't name her, but I put Maddie in contact with somebody and they got talking.

               Trauma programs tend to get stuck in that feedback loop. Poor thing. What will save her will likely feel like her deepest fear, worst pain, and losing what she loves most, or finds peace in. Thank you for doing what you can to reorient her internal compass.

               Have you looked into the various deprogramming methods? Tread lightly as there are usually "suicidal" tendencies / triggers placed near 'the truth' - like a self destruct mechanism.

                I guess we could compare this with MK-Ultra. It's probably not too dissimilar, she certainly must be traumatised whether she realises it or not. We're clearly talking about persistent condition for one to believe that what they are involved in is perfectly normal behaviour.

            Is she, at the very least, being somewhat decently taken care of, in terms of food &amp; shelter?

             Back in November when I first reached her, the first thing she sent me was an SOS and she was regularly sending it over the course of that day. Once she realised I was trying to help her, she stopped sending it. From the second day, she has not sent once since. She has not since suggested that she is in trouble, but I know that she is right now but she will not acknowledge it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think she eats a great deal, but I'm guessing that's down to her own choice. She does eat, yes, I regularly smell Middle Eastern food. But she hardly sleeps.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am entirely confident that she is not being hurt, but she is being exploited no less.
            </p>
            <p>
             No, it's not "G" for "George". I've asked her quite a few times why she would do what that network is telling her to do, and she would simply respond with "G". It's pretty obvious what that means.

              You must be in close proximity to her, at least to smell middle eastern food? Right? Or did I read that wrong?

              Stockholm syndrome is no joke, my God. It is amazing to know she is alive &amp; at the same time horrifying to know she has likely been living in hell for 13yrs.

               Nina, I think you are talking to someone trolling us. Where would McCann learn Morse code? She was abducted as a toddler. The guy openly admits to being schizophrenic. He is playing on your heartstrings.

                Why should my being schizophrenic have any impact upon the credibility of my report? If on the part of an official capacity, that would amount to unlawful prejudice. I'm playing on nobody's feelings, I simply ain't that kind of guy. Without regards as to the factuality of it, what I have said is precisely what I have experienced for the past six months and has been presented honestly.

                Attacking me for being affected by a very common condition is uncalled for.

               <p>
                Suggesting that I am acting nefariously has, quite frankly, deeply upset me.

                 Simply by claiming to offer information on the current status of a missing child plays on the heartstrings of pizzagate researchers, VP. You would have to be pretty narcissistic not to realize that. Many of the people on this board are survivors or friends of survivors. They identify keenly with abductees.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When people's emotions are triggered, they often lose critical thinking ability. This is a fact that shills have frequently taken advantage of on this board, posing as survivors to gain a following, only to distract people from useful lines of inquiry. James Alefantis himself had an account here which he used to try to keep people from investigating his disgusting pizza place and art venues.  Cutting through LARPy BS is why we have Rule 2, which you ignored. So don't get all self-righteous about how upset you are for being called out. The reason we have so much excellent documentation of elite crimes against kids is because we vet stuff. Why should you be any different?

                  Fair enough, I understand how something so sensitive can affect people who have been through traumatic experiences. If I have caused hurt to anybody then I am sorry for that.
                 </p>

                  I'm not expecting to be treated any differently or for my posts to be excluded from the rules. I neither willingly nor knowingly ignored the rules; I submitted my experience sheerly out of abundance of necessity as I feel it is important to the cause itself and the individual of concern. I believed it was valid and reasonable.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There has been no attempt or intention by me to mislead, discredit or insult.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What actually happened here is that I snapped. I kept quiet about it for 6 months, but I couldn't take it any more; I had to talk about this. Please forgive me for being upset about my experience.

               You read it wrong. It works instantly and remotely, anywhere in the world. No idea how it travels so fast, but we're talking about real-time communication no matter the distance.

               We can smell what we're eating, smelling or any hormones we're giving off. That's how I know that she smokes cigarettes and takes drugs. Suffice to say, I can smell her having sex.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yes, she's conditioned and seemingly doing what she's been used to doing since she was very young.

                Am I understanding correctly, you can smell her due to proximity, yet you think they monitor her (thoughts?) from afar?

                Neural link and brainwave monitoring is quite possible technologically, and reoccurs in the realms of MK Ultra and greater agenda to much not to be a handlers M.O. Does she believe this is the case?

                   Indeed. But I can't do this alone, which is precisely why I'm doing this. It's pretty clear that the authorities have no intention of helping her, as was the case 13 years ago and so it continues. The only option is thus forcible public disclosure.

             I'm not interested in any theories regarding adrenochrome. If that's what it was about, she'd probably be dead. Suffice to say, it was most likely to do with sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             Believe what you want. What I believe is that it's her and that she's actively being exploited.

              I'm not talking about adrenochrome. There was a theory around 2016ish claiming she may have been taken due to the fact that she has the same genetic disorder as George Soros, who also has a  Coloboma in his eye. You can see both maddies and soros' eyes here:

                   Well, let me just tell you that she's illiterate in English and speaks in abbreviations, so it's difficult for us to engage in a worthwhile conversation about stuff like this. We go by body language, as that's literally what it is. That is to say that I can judge her demeanour by her smells, as she can with me. I know that she doesn't want to talk and that I'm here posting about it (meaning she's not alone). In any case, I almost completed spelling out "coloboma" in Morse and she gave me a nod.

                   As for royalty, she has made mention of them a few times. Her by name, and her home as well.

                      Yea I'm curious how she learned how to code &amp; why she would want to if she has such intense Stockholm syndrome.

                       Somewhere along the lines, she learned Morse code. Not all of it, she struggles with some of the letters, but she knew enough of it in advance to be able to communicate.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I don't know much about DID, that's a long Wikipedia page and too much for me to read right now. But I will tell you this...
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       She has a very good memory, enough to learn Morse and to remember a ridiculous amount of IATA codes. Whether or not she remembers much from her childhood I do not know, I've never probed her about that because I don't believe it would be prudent. She probably remembers a lot, though.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I can however assure based on experience with her that she is caught between her heart and mind; she is broken, but she has a good energy as well. This tells me that she is split.

                        Right. Yes that makes sense. I'm happy to hear she has a good energy at least.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Yea, I wondered if she had split personalities because of the age she was taken, the clear trauma done to her wouldve allowed her mind to split if she was capable  of it &amp; because of the Stockholm syndrome, yet learning morse code &amp; then also reaching out.
                       </p>
                       <p>

                         Well, at least she communicates with me. I genuinely question her motives with me though, but I wonder if it's more them than her in that respect. I believe deep down she wants to break free from it.

             I'm not aware of the parents exhibiting a guilty conscience. I'm most certainly not disputing it, but I would like you to provide a link for this. I know Kate refused to answer a series of question so they must have had something to hide.

             What I see there are people who do not look as though they've just lost a 3-year-old member of their family. Frankly, it's as if they just got away with a bank robbery and can't contain their joy.
            </p>

             I actually believe that they wanted people to believe she's dead, without their explicitly acknowledging it.

             Well, I have never seen or spoken to her. I have been in contact with her since November using Morse code. Given that I explicitly tested something which I had never, ever tried before, and did so with Maddie and that I got a very distinct response, I quickly concluded that it must be her. Given how the relationship has unfolded over the months, more specifically since February, I am therefore absolutely adamant that it is indeed her.

               Yes, this is a form of remote viewing. I've never experienced hearing sound telepathically, in fact I don't even believe it would be possible over great distances. Somehow though, a pheromone can traverse the world in an instance and can carry smells with it which thus permits for sensory cues to be sensed remotely.

               I'm talking about firing a pheromone at a woman, a neurosteroid, which activates the vomeronasal organ and thus allowing for an exchange of pheromones between two or more people in a manner which I can only describe as

                 I began to notice women reacting to a smell around me. It's not about hygiene, as I could be perfectly clean; I was giving something off. I started to notice that they were becoming aroused by this smell, so I began to experiment. I would see a woman at the bar in a pub with her back to me and in my own head I'd get horny with her - then she'd suddenly begin to flirt and turn to look at me with sex eyes without even noticing me prior. This became a regular pattern and I eventually started to explicitly get women horny as fuck in pubs. There have been countless times when I have literally mind-fucked women in pubs, I'm talking about lewd behaviour. Seriously, they love it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So I established that it's a pheromone and a potent aphrodisiac. I questioned whether this is a form of telepathy because I was clearly giving off sexual cues, and thus how far it could potentially travel.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So I tested it out, I prayed of Maddie, picturing her in my mind and looking into her eyes. She responded.

                   Well, how it came to happen I can only speculate because, as I said, it's unheard of. It's either due to excessive tryptamine usage or somebody activated me; I suspect the former. Clearly, I began to give off a steroid which I realised was affecting women, it's an aphrodisiac.

                   It's not about thoughts, it's about pheromones... so that's smell. We communicate by firing smells at one another.

                     In terms of subjective effects, psychedelic tryptamines are generally regarded as producing a significantly stronger and "deeper" psychedelic effect than the other major class of psychedelics, the substituted phenethylamines (e.g. mescaline or the 2C-x family). Users tend to report greater amounts of ego dissolution, time distortion, conceptual thinking, and transpersonal effects such as unity and interconnectedness with substituted tryptamines. The reason for this is unknown. The subcategory of hallucinogens known as entheogens predominantly consist of tryptamines such as DMT (including ayahuasca), 5-MeO-DMT, and psilocybin.

                      By claiming to know that one of the many impressions/personalities/odors you say you are/have been experiencing is Madelaine McCann pheromonally communicating with you about having sex with animals and that you believe it is not because you are mentally ill.

                       Of course I believe it. I've reasonably explained what is occurring and what controls it. This isn't even about tryptamines, it's obvious to me that we're dealing with a primal functioning of the endocrine system.

                        There is nothing in your account that supports your impression that it is Madelaine McCann and because of that, the premise of your post is a distortion.  You don't have intel but you have your account of what you are experiencing and how you have interpreted such. You admit to having schizophrenia (which also can cause distortions/unusual sense of smell/ or olfactory hallucinations).  Seeing something in the news can trigger a line of thinking that can become it's own perceptual reality.  I'm not criticizing you for what you are experiencing, but you sound like you have the intellect to admit that everything you you've described in this story is one sided.  Is there any point in what you've said where you actually have had a live person physically (not telepathically) with you, or are ALL the people you describe

                        Why do you think Madelaine McCann's name is the first one to come to mind and why would you assume blinking your eyes in morse code is proof of contact?  Why didn't you pray that any name you decided to invoke would know how to peel an onion properly? /s

                       <p>
                        You do a disservice by not honestly acknowledging that it's more likely that you are experiencing olfactory hallucinations and other sensations due to your history of mental illness, and even if that was not so, the conclusion you have drawn (that you are remotely communicating with Madelaine McCann) resides nowhere else except in your thinking.

                         Yes, it's one-sided because there's absolutely no way I can prove it here without undertaking and providing evidence of brain scans.

                         As for olfactory hallucinations, I'm not talking about passing smells, this is a case of communicating via such using Morse, and distinctively smelling female hormones. I can smell her smoke, I can smell the drugs up her nose.

                          Brain scans will not prove anything.  You can't prove you are remotely contacting someone in another country without actually there being a living person to confirm your story (which I don't believe there is)

                           How would it not? Sure a neurologist and endocrinologist would take one look at brain activity showing Morse as unheard of and worthy of intense investigation.

                          <p>
                           Morse is the only feasible way to articulately communicate in this manner. Body language alone is not enough.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           How she already knew Morse I do not know, but it's worth keeping in mind that my prayer was spur of the moment and the response was instant.

                    Yes but that would mean you would have to be in the same house as Madeleine, as smells are simply molecules that spread slowly throughout the air. Our noses are molecule detectors hence why dogs can track by scent and thus machines can be made to do the same.

                     I don't know how to explain it. I could go into the endocrinology, but that concerns how one's own body gives off and detects hormones. How exactly it can travel across the world in a split second is beyond my comprehension. We're possibly talking about teleportation, and I'm not exaggerating. We would probably require a rocket surgeon to understand it.

                      Considering this pheromone has a physical essence as well as a metaphysical one, quantum entanglement is theoretically possible.  As you explained, if they were using her for something purely physical (adrenochrome) she would be 'gone' after this physical essence was drained - perhaps there is a non physical essence, and she is still being "farmed." This doesn't have to be energy vampirism either, but perhaps purely being used for sex. They just seem more esoterically driven than your normal run of the mill predators.

                       The thing is, there's hardly any decent information about adrenochrome so I've never really understood much about it beyond it probably being a steroid. Having said that, it could even be adrenochrome that we're using to communicate with.

                       I absolutely believe that the main motive with Maddie is sexual. I know from experience.

                        Yes, similar. Stimulant with psychedelic attributes much like DMT from my understanding. According to THEM all of these physical things, sex, coloboma, fear, adrenalized blood, emit an essence that could be beyond the physical spectrum, energetic, and therefore potentially used as such. May we ask
                        <em>

                         Funnily enough, this ability seemingly stems from my dabbling with what was a legal high and is now a Class A substance. Alpha-MethylTryptamine - I took an absolute shit-load of it. Or I've got some kind of genetic disposition which allows me to do this thing. Or both.

                         She was fine for three months from when I first made contact with her, then shit started to happen out of the blue in February. She literally hasn't stopped fucking since then, it's driving me round the bend.

                           It's constant, without any specific action. We can always smell and feel each other, so long as our middle eye is opened as this opens a valve which allows for the pheromone to be released.

                      Maybe it has something to do with non-covalent bonds and virtual photons. The molecules in our cells communicate with each other at the speed of light via non-covalent interactions. It's a dance of a complexity beyond the ability of human scientists to really grasp.

                       Interesting. I'll have to research that tomorrow. Whatever it is, it must be on the atomic level. I can absolutely understand what you're saying about the speed of light because the communication is in real time.

                    I think I understand what you mean. I have experienced something similar before. I can usually tell when a lady is in her period, ovulating  or sexually active based on an specific scent(I know because I ask to confirm and they stay baffled thinking I am a weirdo or a creep which maybe I'm the first but not the second). It does not happen with every woman tho, but with the ones that happen I feel more attracted to, sexually talking at least. Some ladies have told me the same about my scent which I cannot actually perceive. How did you get that close to Mad?

               This is something which really irks me. Why would Kate not answer any questions? Surely, refusing to cooperate with an investigation in what was very clearly a serious crime against a child is reason enough to be prosecuted, yet nobody has ever been brought before a court. I'm certainly inclined to believe they know far more about what happened than they've let on to.

             Given her current situation, it is abundantly clear that she was, indeed, trafficked.
            </p>
            <p>
             No, I never have been and never will be involved in the trafficking of women and children.

             I have tried to get her help, Leicestershire Police and Scotland Yard have both been pinged. No joy.

               Don't you worry about it, I brought this up for people to ask.

               Maddie is always in people's prayers. While there will be many good hearts within governmental circles, they have badly let her down.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for the police, I highly doubt that they've had any part in this. If anything, their hands are tied because they've sworn an oath. I actually feel sorry them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Suggesting that of her parents is a bit too far in my opinion. They should certainly face court and, thus, potentially jail.

             Yes, she can. She knows how to and so does Kate. Her family are aware, but so far there has been no word from them publicly.
            </p>
            <p>
             She claimed that she was in the United Arab Emirates until about a week ago. She is now seemingly in Saudi Arabia, possibly near Bahrain.

             As to who is keeping her, I again make reference to her mentioning "G" multiple times.

            Wasn't Tony and John Podesta visiting their pervert friend the Prince and staying at a villa right down the street from where she was abducted? Then the wanted sketch that looked like them.

             Unknown. Clearly though, the sketches do indeed remarkably resemble the Podestas, as well as Maxwell.
            </p>
            <p>
             I guess the "villa" you refer to is Freud's mansion. In my opinion, that is beyond coincidence.

             But I have no specific intelligence for this.

               I made contact with Maddie in November. At some point, Kate must have caught wind because on New Year's Eve, she reached her. Maddie was seemingly uncooperative and a few days later Kate reached me.

                 When I first reached Maddie and she was hitting me with repeated SOS, I hit Kate with one and I got a nod out of her. I heard nothing from her since then (November) until the New Year when she managed to reach Maddie. She wouldn't talk to her mom, so she reached me instead and I responded by doing something which I won't go into for privacy reasons. So, we've were in contact briefly but never got chatting. In other words, she knows about this but there has been no public statement and nobody, be it Kate or anybody else, has ever spoken to me about it.
