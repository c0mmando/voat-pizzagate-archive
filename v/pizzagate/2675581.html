            I would really love for some folks to regularly and reliably scope Comet and Pegasus but not in a very visible and obvious way like how Pizzagate Howie and co. did. It needs to be stealthy. For example, say every Thursday evening hit Pegasus sometime between 6pm - 11pm and just hang around for a while recording any activity, any visitors etc., and do the same for Comet but around closing time/after hours. We need to get something on what's going on at these locations. If I wasn't thousands of miles away I'd have been doing this for the last two years.

            My wife and I just moved to DC a few weeks ago.  We drive by Comet Pizza constantly just to see what they're up to.  When we went last time, they all stared us down.  Any time we got up to look at the murals, even the chefs would peek their head over staring us down.  The hidden bathroom is weird and the fact that the owner said in an article back in 2015 or so that they store tomatoes in the basement, and there was a band saying they were live in the basement of Comet Pizza...only to have the owner say there is no basement...is just very very odd....
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd be happy to do some recon.

            Fuck sake, people hear comet ping pong and think immediately of tin foil hat wearers somehow stirring a man into shooting up the place, when in reality, if we showed people the type of sick bands playing there they might think differently.  Fucking heavy breathing.  I bet the media never mentioned that

            Just want to point out the phrase 'all ages' is something that was created for events where people under the age of drinking age could attend. I believe. I've read an article on how the all ages thing was changing the nightlife scene somewhere. So it can't be put down to inviting children.

             Yup. I've meant to say this for a while. Almost all concert tickets say all ages on the ticket. Underage can attend but not purchase alcohol. Been that way for a long time

             Occam's razor would strengthen the inclination to conclude that it's just referring to 18+, but since the intention for this instance would be implied and not explicit you can't rule out entirely the possibility that they might be literally referring to "all ages."

             You look like an Alefantis shill; you're the real idiot incel that can't even muster the courage to look at himself to where he desperately attempts to project his own shitty psychological state onto people he obsessively envies. Your lameass sociopathic bullshit trolling is wasting your precious time here on earth. Go take a shower and read the Bible and clean your room Jordan Peterson style, dude. I can smell your foul stench from all the way over here, and it smells very bad. Bless your heart.

              Oh wow. You also believe that an invisible sky wizard came to Earth and raped his own mother so she would give birth to him so he could sacrifice himself to himself so we would be forgiven for the sins he made us commit in the first place? No wonder you believe Alex "admits that he's 100% lies" Jones if you believe in the jesus-god-ghost thing.

                "An invisible wizard called God came to Earth. He came here so he could rape his own mother, Mary. He did this so she would give birth to himself. After ~30 years of being an invisible wizard while at the same time also being a human, he sacrificed himself to himself on a cross. At this point he stopped being two creatures and went back to being one (which was actually two because of some ghost thing). All of this was done so the God wizard would forgive humans for committing the sins he forced us to commit to begin with. But only if we believe an invisible wizard came to Earth and raped his own mom. Otherwise each human will be tortured for all eternity in a pit of flame for hurting his fee-fees" -The Condensed Bible

                It's no wonder you also believe in pizzagate. Seriously do America's gene-pool a favor and go swallow some high velocity buck-shot. Too bad you mom didn't cast the Bible's abortion spell. would have save us a perfectly good shell.

            Slightly off topic, but this reminds me of the X-Ray Cafe, a place ran by Tres Shannon (Voodoo Donuts) in the early 90's. All ages club full of druggies, runaways, and bands with sexually charged names. They made a documentary about the place and within 2 minutes you see a 6 yr old stage diving and guys dressed in diapers. (Not to mention those blue swirls all over the walls). Here's a comment from the page I'm gonna link.
           </p>

            I don't listen to the radio much, but today I turned on 94.7 while stuck in traffic. The radio DJ was the guy from Big Daddy Meat Straw. I think about that every time I hear his voice on the radio. I say BDMS in concert a hand full of times when I was 13 and 14. I'm 29 now. lol. I thought "you know what? I'm going to google them when I get home" It led me to this website. I didn't realize at such a young age what I was experiencing at X-Ray. I knew it was cool and I hung out with an older crowd that all hung out there. But I didn't realize that place would be such history. One of the first times I smoked pot in pubic was on the mattress on the top top weird part of the club. Not sure how to explain that. anyway, thought I would share that thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could only find the first half of the documentary online but I found a copy and watched the second half. There was a band called Sons of Satan or something and they were drinking "blood" onstage and throwing gallons of blood all over the audience, which always had children. Good family friendly environment

            And some good monitoring headphones so you can a clean recording.   I like my audio-technicas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember you want to get the band not the audience talking.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you're done, replace the camera audio with 24 bit tracks from the recorder.  Don't be afraid to pan the stereo tracks a little bit wide, you can get some nice effects this way.

                When was the last time you saw the page? When Pizzagate first started, we had a real problem with webpages disappearing within minutes of them being posted here. Maybe this is starting to happen again.
               </p>
               <p>
                It became a policy to archive pages before posting links to them so whoever is watching Voat won't delete things before they can be shared.
