            Hello 2.6 hour old account

           <p>
            Would you be so kind as to show us the permission you received from the site owners to use their trademarked images?
           </p>
           <p>
            You can't??
           </p>

            That's what I thought.

             Wait - do you really think that you need permission from every single business to make a shirt that is related to their business?
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean I can't tell if you're serious or not. Because it's not illegal. Far from it. Voat's 'trademarked images' are on the public domain, making them available for free use on clothing. I mean I can literally look up the law and show you how it works because if you think that every single coca-cola shirt on the web has to ask permission
             <em>
              from Coca-Cola
             </em>
             to print a shirt then you've misunderstood the clothing business completely.
            </p>
            <p>
             And lastly, do you remember how this logo came to fruition, Cynabuns? If you don't,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/announcements/41527">
              it was designed by a Voater and donated to the site.
             </a>
             All I'm trying to do is help Voat because the admins basically begged the userbase for money 2 days ago and you're coming off like a complete asshole to me without actually having a conversation. And p.s., I've been on Voat for 1.6 years - I'm not going to post a link to a shop that reveals what city I live in on my main profile. Of course I'm going to make a new profile for that. I'm not going to open myself up for doxxing
             <em>
              that
             </em>
             easily, cyna.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             So if you would care to respond or like more information, I am more than happy to provide it. However, this is NOT ad spam - and if you would have been willing to ask me a question or two before making assumptions of my character or intent I feel like this could have been avoided
