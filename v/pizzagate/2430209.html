            Not only is #MeToo a distraction it is an attempt by corporate media to normalise paedophilia. The MSM are only giving voice to women who were molested as children - kept their mouths shut at the time - then went on to become rich and famous "stars." It is essentially saying "I was molested and it never did me any harm, and I'm not going to press charges."
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing I find fault with Pizzagate is that people call it "elite" paedophilia. The target for this brownstone operation is communities that are ear-marked for destruction. One of the biggest child trafficking rings where pizzacode was being used to procure children for sex was the Minnesota area - mostly working class nobodies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The satanic aspect of this is somehow these rich people think they can exploit children's body parts to make them live longer. They are weakening the population to make them more vulnerable to exploitation. This has calcified into an ideology that is based around the beast system.  What is stopping the authorities acting on this is that being caught in a compromising situation is the only way to get anywhere in the beast system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just about everyone at the top of western civilisation has sold their souls to the devil and we all know who are the main beneficiaries of this ransom - Zionist expansionist Israel.

            Of course it is intentional. The campaign started 2 days after Trump announced The Storm and has been spearheaded by Hillary's State Department boy Ronan Farrow. The next big article was the Uma article around Feb 2, which came out a few days after two employees of her ex-boyfriend's venture died in a Helicopter crash (Standard Hotel RE: Adam Schiff). And this article was written by Maureen Dowd, who led the US to war in Iraq!!!

            Harvey and Matt Lauer were sacrificial lambs, limited hangout. Has anyone ever seen censorship like the one garnered by PG? (apart from that HOGGG  crisis actor) Podesta emails &amp; CPP sent shockwaves among the Cabal members. It was panic mode, batten down the hatches and flee! They are still in panic mode. As D100Monkeys (Enigmatic Truther who makes rare Youtube videos) said 'They would rather cause a Nuclear armageddon than be outed as child murdering pedo freaks that they are.' Expose PG and it's the end of the NWO. And it's us who have to do it. Trump cannot dare do it without full backing of the people.

            Someone should really re-edit that Kelly/Alefantis interview to show the other Instagram images on the screen, Tammy Luzatt's blog etc. It's crazy watching that again after about 6 months, seeing them highlight the Caris James pic and justify it was surreal.

            Yes. You are correct. In fact I felt that way when "pedogate" began to be pushed. So many critical archived links are under "Pizzagate". Pizzagate points specifically to corrupt government/D.C. actors. There are plenty of pedo victims in Hollywood, they are just outing the adults mostly.

            Yes I think they created the metoo to act like they were being so very open and honest and exposing it all.  Well they have not even touched the tip of the iceberg.  If they think we are satisfied with their Dog and Pony Show,  NOT.

               Mind you, I have only been groped by gay men.... never by a woman (outside the bedroom that is) And gay men are pretty agressive simply cannot get what I mean when I tell them I am straight. Are they pretending that they don't get it or is it something to do with their psychological make up.

                I go to the site Data Lounge and have come away with the impression that they would just love to get into the trousers of straight men.  This I think is the ultimate goal, you know, like straight men getting to that one woman that seems untouchable, or unattainable.  Like, wow, see, they act like they don't want us, but they really do.  Vindication of sorts.  I don't think this was much of a thing many decades ago, but is more prevalent now.  Pretty Frisky imo.  And Nasty.  Do other men on here have a good remark or answer for this.  These Groping Perverts should not be let off easy.

                  OK will do.  I got really disgusted yesterday reading their replies to the Oscar Stupidity.  I had to just get off the site myself.  I just check it out once or twice a week now.  I have to stay sane somehow!

                 When I drove cab during my college years on busy weekends here in Sydney (gay capital of the world) I heard that exact thing!!! Their biggest gratification came from seducing 'straight' men and got fury when I kept explaining to them that those married 'straight' men that they were supposedly seducing were in fact closet homosexuals.

             The topic of kids being killed...how does one hashtag that!!!
Even this pizzagate voat is controlled psyops..
I keep bringing this up..
Besta pizza because of its arab connections is not being investigated further...
The reaction when they were found out was very vitriolic..then they pushed alefantis in front of the tv..everything they bring in front of us is a distraction to avoid the topics they dont bring out in front of us..
Besta pizza is an important logistic link..i believe there is a connection to shipping lanes from haiti to dc....a study of the shipping company and its trade routes ..its itinery just before the haiti disaster and after it ..should be studied..that is public information
When has any recent invesstigation been conducted on besta pizza and the shipping company attached to its promoters..
..
Even voat is a distraction

              I would like to know more about it. There hasn’t been much attention on that. I have seen a few youtubers going in with periscopes or trolling Besta with phone calls... that’s about it.

              And that was when I found out that Alex was a total fraud or a sellout, scared of his own shadow. Apart from groveling (to quote Skippy himself) before JA&amp; Creep of The Universe himsef, he swept Besta Pizza under the rug. If you remembe his meme...'It's just one Pizza Joint...' refering to CPP, when His own channel did a great expose on Besta Pizza and Buck's Fishing&amp;Camping! Here he was all this time demonizing the Saudis at every turn, and finally when he stumbles upon a real Saudi Conspiracy of monumental proportions he does a 180 and goes full MSM on us.

             Jus look at the Oscar nominated film of 2018..... Call Me By Your Name' an ad for NAMBLA!!!!!!! Oh...but the boy is 17???  Actually it's an archetype. He could be 15, or 13 or 12 or 10!!! This is NAMBLA gone mainstream. And people still think all is just a conspiracy theory. Yeah... some random script writer came up with the innocent idea of pederast friendly flick and pitched it to a random producer. Most are aware by now that Gay Kabbalist Mafia runs Hollywood. Just read from a high priest satanist and Hollywood insider Kenneth Anger's himself in his Hollywood Babylon (1&amp;2)!

            I have long regarded the #MeToo nonsense as a limited hangout; admitting to and highlighting the casting couch culture in Paedowood which has been an open secret for decades as it serves two agendas; it is used by feminazi/SJW (the same cult of degenerate filth actively attempting to normalise paedophilia) scum to demonise men and hide the much darker crime of rampant child sexual abuse.

             Also conveniently avoiding the exposure of sexual abuse dished out by high powered female executives to all the subordinates around them. 
As Michael Douglas said in 'Disclosure' Sexual harassement is about power. Are we that naive to think that women in high positions of power do not abuse men, or in case of Lesbians - other women? Who are we kidding!

              you bring up a great point. Also, women are known to be major pedos too. This has been conveniently forgotten. Even if they don't physically harm, the moms that sell their kids into pedo rings or act as pedo pimps need the same sentencing as convicted pedos.

               And let's not forget that shocking email about transporting children to a pedo pool party! Main culprit appears to be Tamera Luzzatto witch! As you have correctly pointed out, even though most women may not take an active role (unlike Killary according to Cathy O'Brien) Luzzatto like pimps play a prominent role in all things PG. In fact in my eyes she is even more guilty than the monsters she supplies! And she would be fully aware that it's not just rape, it's torture &amp; murder. Pretty sure she likes to watch.

             Maybe we should hijack it...#metoo tags and create similar tags
            </p>
            <h1>
             me2 ..etc and inject the mkultra culturr in LA and california..
            </h1>
            <p>
             In a controlled manner
Drip feed it into the same tags..across nations..especially third world countries ..
Eg : India ..where political parties who have used actresses to run child prostitution rings ..they have been caught but there is a coverup
The nexus between politicians and media entertainment should be priority..since people hate politicians ..when they see that there is an age old connection between..the two with regards drugs ..money laundering ..prostitution ..and the intelligence agencies..people will wake up
..another case recently is a former wwf etertainer who has come forward with a confession with regard to the murder of two children during a drug drop off in arkansas..
U have children..drugs..entertainmnnt ..and the clintons.. One of the boys mother is still active chasing the killers and he has approached her..
