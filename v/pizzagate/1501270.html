            They were busted on undercover video basically saying  'we will look the other way, Mr Pimp.'

            If u are prostituting a 13 yo girl &amp; she gets pregnant, u need an abortion clinic like PP. If she gets stds, might as well head to PP. Although this doesn't answer about body parts, it does bring to light that PP is a prime place to see victims of human trafficking &amp; their pimps.

            My apologies of no link added here, figured u could choose which media source to read in case there's ones u don't trust.

            It took me a while to type up this comment, but it was worth it. I'll hold nothing back, downvotes be damned.

            I am reminded of a interview of a former Satanist named Zachary I heard on Relevant Radio this past year. His account shocked me with its vividness and depravity. (It's the kind of evil that, when described, you know it has to be true because there was no way somebody could invent it. Truth is stranger than fiction.) He said they used abortion as a ritual sacrifice for appeasing demons. He was slowly introduced to Satanism when his tabletop game buddies asked him if he wanted to perform 'real magic'. (See the parallel to Pizzagate so far?)
(Don't confuse edgelord-millitant-Atheism 'Satanism' with this authentic Satanism. These people actually believe in it.)
They'd hold an orgy, and then kill the child. It's a moonchild ritual (the kind performed by L. Ron Hubbard, no, I am not making this up).
They'd also 'pray' for churches to fracture, churches to be corrupted, laypeople to sin. They'd offer all the children butchered that previous day to Satan. Something happened that caused Zach to split up from his previous Satanic buddies. He'd reached the pinnacle of his magic; he could cause a ton of things to happen. He was not happy, however.
He wandered for three years, going from job to job. He was a drifter.
Zach was only later converted through touching a Miraculous Medal from a mysterious stranger (Initially in anger. The Devil hates to be taunted.). He was transported to a space in which there was nothing but darkness surrounding him, and looked into the eyes of the stranger. 'Twas Mary, the Mother of God. She told him something (I cannot remember what he said he heard). He then realized that he needed to be a Christian.
He said one thing that shocked me during the interview, and I was actually convinced of the fact when he said it because his story was so compelling.
He said that the Illuminati was real, and that he knew of them from his old days.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to look into more accounts of former Satanists to effectively investigate Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not to mention, I also heard on the radio about something called a 'black mass'. These can take place at your local civic center without your knowledge. They take a Eucharist, stab it, spit on it. Say mockeries of prayers. Not to mention, they probably violate city code with the orgies and defilement. 
Are there any civic centers in Washington D.C.? Look for clues there.
