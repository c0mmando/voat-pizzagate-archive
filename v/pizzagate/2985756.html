           <p>
            Let’s learn from some actual examples of people who became targets for covert operations:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <ol>
             <li>
              Thomas Drake, NSA Whistleblower: Forced out of his job, blacklisted, financially ruined, forced to defend himself against criminal charges, placed under physical and electronic surveillance.
             </li>
             <li>
              Jean Seberg.  Actress and civil rights activist.  Supporter of the Black Panther Party.  Experienced FBI Surveillance, harassment, stalking, break-ins, intimidation, defamation and discrediting.  Victim of a false FBI story that she was pregnant by a Black Panther Party member, while married to a white husband.  The stress of this caused premature delivery of her baby, which died at 2 days of age.  The baby was white.  Eventually committed suicide.
             </li>
             <li>
              Arnold Lockshin.  A Cancer researcher and supporter of socialism.  Experienced surveillance, harassment and threats by strangers, break-ins, psychological warfare, implied death threats through the 1970’s and 1980’s.    Eventually sought asylum from Russia. Wrote a book about the ordeal in 1988 called “Silent Terror: One family’s history of political persecution in the US.”  The book was never published or distributed in the US.  On the web: ArnoldLockshin.Wordpress.com.  By the way, his work performance and mental stability in Russia are apparently just fine.
             </li>
             <li>
              Adrian Schoolcraft.  Blew the whistle on corruption, wrongful arrests, arrest quotas, and the stop and frisk program within the NYPD in 2009.  Received on the job harassment and was shunted to the NYPD psychologist.   Within 3 weeks after reporting corruption he was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward, handcuffed to a bed and prevented from using a telephone.  He was portrayed as paranoid during his hospital stay, which lasted 6 days.  After discharge, he was suspended from the force without pay.  Tapes he had made were eventually reported by the New York Times and others and he has been largely vindicated.
             </li>
             <li>
              Dr. Lawrence Doerr.  Orthopedic surgeon.  As reported in the NY Times, wrote an 
open letter to fellow surgeons in 2008 warning about a flawed hip prosthesis. Subsequently became the target of a whisper-campaign that questioned his skills and competence as a surgeon.
             </li>
             <li>
              Russell Roderick.  Insulted a powerful, politically connected firm by refusing continued employment.  Unclear if he was aware of high-level wrong-doing.  Has been the target of a 25 year, multi-national campaign  (you will find that these programs are multi-national and follow targets wherever they go) including slander, character assassination, allegations of incompetence, paranoia, drug-addiction, sexual deviance, and being “a deranged, suicidal maniac.”  Has experienced blacklisting, financial devastation, isolation, stalking and overt surveillance, street theather, telephone/computer and mail tampering, Stasi-like manipulation of people into a campaign against him, death threats, intimidation, harassment, and a shut-down of all avenues of support.  He refers to this as Zersetzen torture.  On the web: Zersetzen.wikispaces.com.
             </li>
             <li>
              Greenham Common Women’s Peace Protestors.  In the 1980’s, were protesting the presence of US cruise missiles at an English air force base.  Came under microwave weapon attack in 1984.  Scientists from Electronics Today demonstrated the presence of electromagnetic waves.  Dr. Robert Becker, twice nominated for the Nobel prize, found their symptoms were consistent with exposure to a microwave weapon.  Every time a cruise missile convoy was ready to drive by, these women were experiencing severe headaches and unbearable fatigue, etc.
             </li>
             <li>
              Andy Lewis and friends.  A group of former British soldiers.  Became targets of full-on gang stalking in 1996 after attempts to draw attention to what they viewed as an unethical experimental vaccine program that had been given to Gulf War soldiers in 1991.  These men have experienced blacklisting, covert harassment, directed energy and psychotronic weapons attacks, overt and covert surveillance, stalking, secret notifications, etc.  They have made two excellent websites: targetedindividuals.com and gang-stalking.com.
             </li>
             <li>
              A long list of 9/11 truth activists have reported being targeted with electromagnetic weapons and death threats.  Some have died under suspicious circumstances.  US Army Major Doug Rokke, PhD physics from University of Illinois, former head of the US Army depleted uranium cleanup project after Gulf War I, says these weapons are very real, and commonly used in military circles. He has described how he personally used such weapons on a regular basis while training with Special Forces at US Army facilities: “We had them vanmounted, truck-mounted, plane-mounted, and hand-carried. We would go around zapping each other for fun. This was during exercises, or sometimes just as a practical joke.” Rokke further stated that, based on his firsthand knowledge of US military mind-set and capabilities, 9/11 truth activists have undoubtedly been targeted by exotic non-lethal (and lethal) weapons.  Remember again Cass Sunstein, who openly advocated cognitive infiltration and disabling of 9/11 truth activists.  Is he talking about psychotronic weapons attacks?

             <li>
              Jill Hansen.  Professional surfer, model and entrepreneur.  She received wide acclaim for her performance in a TED speech in 2010 about her spiritual values and altruistic beliefs, Entitled “Open Mind, Open Heart”.  In the talk she espouses values including compassion, honesty, integrity, generosity, belief in God, charity, hope, faith and love.  She concludes by stating that the world would be a more beautiful place if we all thought this way.  Within weeks after this talk, which received a lot of publicity, she found herself the victim of stalking and electronic harassment.  Fast forward 
a few years.  Unfortunately, In May 2014, she was charged with attempted homicide for allegedly running over a woman intentionally with her car.  TI’s report that attempting to get them to act out inappropriately with strangers is a common protocol.  A couple interesting facts: 1) none of the news stories mention that she considered herself a TI and 2)  Interestingly, The local Neighborhood Watch Group's 500 members had been alerted about Hansen—supposedly for reckless driving.  A representative of the group was reported as saying, "We need everybody to be on the lookout for her, it's that scary.”  So here we have someone reporting being a victim of organized stalking, and it turns out that—HELLO—there was a group of at least 500 people deliberately on the lookout for her.

             That person is Mandi Rei Serra. She's the one who broke the invisible bistro lead.

              Its obviously pizzagate relevant but since I was mentioned in the podcast as having done a good deed, and warned her how dangerous what she found was, its of course disinfo in Vindicator's mind :)
