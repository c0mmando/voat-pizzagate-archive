            The FBI anon post was admitted by the author as fake. This post is also disorganized and lacks a cohesive argument. Are you for us or against us? Regardless, nothing here is pertinent in anyway to this investigation.

             I hate Pedos.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hate being played for a fool.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which is real?
            </p>
            <p>
             Trust me son, your arguement for me trying to slide this is it not you trying to "slide" reason and logic?
            </p>
            <p>
             You state a truth and then dismiss my rambles as being foolish. Let the people think for themselves! And not fall prey to false hope and Prophets.
            </p>
            <p>
             How can I trust one like yourself who is trying to derail this by claiming my post as not being pertinent?
            </p>
            <p>
             Your petty arm chair investigations will met nothing but broken hopes while, I, call for action and true investigation even knowing this could be an elaborate troll.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, prove yourself and lay forth a plan or call to action that will work? And no sir, do not claim it starts with Google searches because you group has only uncovered memes and questionable evidence that you yourself has ended up saying is a false witness. And of which, I didn't see you posting that thread claiming that anon was full of shit? Why's that you can post questioning me, yet you daren't question the circle jerk echo chamber. Please now, mive along and be useful like you have accused me.
            </p>
            <p>
             I once again clearly state, pedoz need raped with broken glass. And this is were my allegiance stands.
