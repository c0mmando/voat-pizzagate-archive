<p>Child slaves, pedo porn and snuff films are being traded openly on YouTube and Instagram with the obvious collusion of the website involved. 
<strong>We need to help catalogue all of the links and research all of the YouTube channels and Instagram accounts mentioned in this video.</strong>
Much of it appears to be coming from ISIS-linked accounts, but they are using popular modern music to condition their slaves, and using the same occult death threat, stay quiet, forget-what-you\'ve-seen MK-ULTRA NLP language and symbolism as can be found in many new music videos. The concepts behind ISIS sex slave/snuff adverts and the music videos appear to have the same ultimate source, and the ISIS people running the accounts seem perfectly aware of what all of the symbols in the music mean, and are actually using the songs in videos that seem to be made to be used in slave conditioning.

<p>Also, one of the ISIS vids shows a little girl no more than 2 or 3, crying, with enormous pupils in her eyes. Like she\'s drugged or... I don\'t know. And the comments were all laughing at her. But some of the new music videos appear to be alluding to this phenomena as well. </p>
<p>Finally, the rap &quot;artist&quot; CPSilencer needs to be studied, as all of his songs/vids appear to belong to one or both of two categories: 1) NLP &amp; tonal inductions for mind-controlled child sex slaves, and 2) actual advertisement (to those in the know) of his services as a hitman who kills &quot;CP&quot; slaves and cult members who have been &quot;blackballed&quot; for talking too much. I even think his phone number is encoded into the beeps on one of the songs, and on the cover of one of his albums. Snippets of their songs are being used by YouTube accounts that suspiciously have more comments than views and seem to exist solely as something to show sex slaves to intimidate them. </p>

            There's a phenomenon of "EarRape" memes (where you get surprised by something in the video that comes up suddenly and is so loud it almost blows out your speakers and eardrums. People think it's just funny. It isn't It's the same thing. Maybe not every one of them. But when you check out the friends of suspicious accounts and find people making and trading "earrape" memes, and start looking at what they're posting, and how people are commenting, it definitely seems like the same phenomenon. There's stuff in these files, containing information about how to buy stuff/and or hypnotic triggers that work best at certain speeds.

             Here's a guy who posts earrape memes. Look at the memes themselves. But also, he puts his eyes as his profile pic, and his name is "Need." He's saying, "I need adrenochrome." He's offering to make transactions with someone who's in the same underworld because he's addicted, like the kids in the Chaucer Videos.

            Then following one of the people who commented on a suspicious Chaucer School video, I found this guy. This alleged writer of children's literature. His eyes. My god. Is this the adrenochrome? It gives you the lizard eyes? Look at the way everything is described on this website.

             Adrenochrome is pink isn't it? Also it seems to go along with electroshock. He promises thousands of trained monkeys and expenses of over 1,000,000 eV per day. eV is the measurement of voltage.

             It's embedded in "music," "art," and "literature," and if you point it out they just try to act like you're not cool and you don't understand what the kids are into these days. With me, that's not the case at all. I was aware of all of these really obscure trends in art and music. It's just that I'm only now realizing what they are facilitating. People copying the symbols and styles without understanding their meaning gives them cover.

             Look at the way this guy described his writing and podcasting services on his website. And then look at this lady's website. She's also an author, and a stand-up comedian, supposedly. Look at her stand-up acts on YouTube....weird. Kind of like those videos from Comet Ping Pong, where you couldn't figure out why everybody was laughing because the jokes made no sense? Here's one of her books. You can it on amazon with a few obviously fake reviews

             You see. Remember in the original video reports that OP linked to, they all kept talking about "reading" and "poetry." Perhaps that's why they picked a school named after a poet, Chaucer. Perhaps we should look at other schools named after poets in England.

            Can we get a post just about Chaucer School please? The whole thing that kid said at the end about looking only into the future is a code. Because only those who cooperate have a future. Well, it looks like they all have to say that in their "goodbye" videos. And that's what the song in this girl's goodbye video is all about. And look at their eyes, and the weird picture towards the beginning with all of the babies and toddlers.

            The buzzing sounds you hear in many of the videos we've presented to you are found throughout these videos from all these YouTube accounts I'm finding of people who make comments on each other's videos (all like this), and several of them go to this Chaucer School. But if you go back and watch the videos about the ISIS-related traffickers on YouTube (OP's main post^), you'll notice that a lot of them had the glitch too. They seem like the sound is sped up, reencoded somehow. They mention bees because the "bee sting" appears to be something that they are all threatened with. The boy at the end of the video, the graduate of the school, mentions "I think I hear a bee buzzing." They talk about the bee sting in the song
            <a href="https://youtu.be/7W_CSE6-pKE">
             "Peek-at-Chu" by CPSilencer
            </a>
            which is about "The Most Dangerous Game:" human hunting. Cathy O'Brien talked about the Most Dangerous Game. Listen to the lyrics, look at the imagery. Look at the names CPSilencer &amp; LP Charm. Child Prostitute Silencer (and CPS). &amp; LP Charm. NLP Charm. Neuro-Linguistic Programming. The song is an NLP Charm. I've been following the trails of the record companies connected to them. That's bringing up so much. Look up the group XXXTentacion and their song "#imsippinteainyohood" It's wildly popular, supposedly, with millions of views, but the whole song sounds like these glitches. And in the comments on
            <a href="https://youtu.be/ymSgls0Ce24">
             this video that includes it
            </a>
            , several people said to play it at 1.25 speed. The comments in general are weird, beyond any of the lingo I'm already familiar with in regards to trap music, vaporwave, and all of those newer electronic subgenres. I am aware that "glitch" is a type of music too, though admittedly don't know much about it. People are talking about how well it "works," and that it makes them horny. Now I know kids have for years been saying stuff like that a certain drop in a dubstep song made them "come" and things like that. But look at the company's logo, at the bottom of the video. It's the spiral triangle. There's tons more I could tell you about the bands and songs I've looked at, but for now I'm trying to focus on the kids on YouTube, getting everybody to understand the symbolism, the codes, etc. But most importantly if you just go to the links of the original videos and view them yourselves, you can look at who comments on their videos and start following the trail. Is a good place to start

            Spud is a word for poop. Full of videos of kids from Chaucer. I'm sure that if you know how to reencode the video all of those weird glitches in each video contain something.

            The entire Chaucer School in Sheffield, England, the kids are being prostituted through YouTube, and their being threatened with murder constantly. It's all put together in this YouTube video that just came out a few minutes ago. We've already been to the FBI. Somebody needs to call MI5 NOW

              The sound you are hearing there is one of the many glitches throughout these videos from all these YouTube accounts I'm finding of people who make comments on each other's videos (all like this), and several of them go to this school. But if you go back and watch the videos about the ISIS-related traffickers on YouTube, you'll notice that a lot of them had the glitch too. They seem like the sound is sped up, reencoded somehow. She mentions bees because the "bee sting" appears to be something that they are all threatened with. The boy at the end of the video, the graduate of the school, mentions "I think I hear a bee buzzing." They talk about the bee sting in the song
              <a href="https://youtu.be/7W_CSE6-pKE">
               "Peek-at-Chu" by CPSilencer
              </a>
              which is about "The Most Dangerous Game:" human hunting. Cathy O'Brien talked about the Most Dangerous Game. Listen to the lyrics, look at the imagery. Look at the names CPSilencer &amp; LP Charm. Child Prostitute Silencer (and CPS). &amp; LP Charm. NLP Charm. Neuro-Linguistic Programming. The song is an NLP Charm. I've been following the trails of the record companies connected to them. That's bringing up so much. Look up the group XXXTentacion and their song "#imsippinteainyohood" It's wildly popular, supposedly, with millions of views, but the whole song sounds like these glitches. And in the comments on
              <a href="https://youtu.be/ymSgls0Ce24">
               this video that includes it
              </a>
              , several people said to play it at 1.25 speed. The comments in general are weird, beyond any of the lingo I'm already familiar with in regards to trap music, vaporwave, and all of those newer electronic subgenres. I am aware that "glitch" is a type of music too, though admittedly don't know much about it. People are talking about how well it "works," and that it makes them horny. Now I know kids have for years been saying stuff like that a certain drop in a dubstep song made them "come" and things like that. But look at the company's logo, at the bottom of the video. It's the spiral triangle. There's tons more I could tell you about the bands and songs I've looked at, but for now I'm trying to focus on the kids on YouTube, getting everybody to understand the symbolism, the codes, etc. But most importantly if you just go to the links of the original videos and view them yourselves, you can look at who comments on their videos and start following the trail. Is a good place to start

             Nobody's forgotten, but the connections to ISIS, the music industry (the child porn &amp; snuff film codes in the music videos), and what the kids at doing at Chaucer School: this is all new info. It only got figured out a few days ago and so far only a few people have been willing/able to even follow the trail of clues. Nobody has been willing to do ANYTHING about it, so please, help.

            This stuff needs to be archived, then sent to the Attorney General' s office for the purpose of going after You Tube. Surely screening  or censorship algorithims  (sp?) can be devised to.prevent this stuff from ever being posted. On the other hand maybe it can be used to trace child traffickers. I never thought I would see the day in my life time that a portion of humanity would sink to such a degree of unimaginable  degeneracy. I never believed in hell until I stumbled upon this internet forum. I've been away tackling health problems but  I have lurked every single day from hospital beds and rehab facilities. The research has been great, alot of new faces and alot less acrimony.

            Highly disturbing stuff being uncovered. How these social media sites host this material, remember ElsaGate? Whilst I'm willing to believe those at the top are unware, it's becoming increasingly unlikely. They can pro-actively do so many things to users and content creators but they can't delete suspect material?
           </p>
           <p>
            At the very least it shows these companies are morally bankrupt. Before ElsaGate broke into the mainstream those softcore paedophilia videos were up - and they were making $$$
           </p>
           <p>
            I even wrote a thing about how child pornography has a thriving trading scene on Twitter:

           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like this stuff is everywhere. Archive and report.

            I'm overwhelmed from reading this post. Thank you for all of the work you have put into this post. I am sending positive energy and thoughts to all who are tackling this horror.  I cannot delve very deeply, right now, but want to keep up with this.

            Please save all of this in multiple formats and amongst multiple investigators. I will do the same, when circumstances permit. And please contact me with an alternate venue if this causes the takedown of this sub!

              That is the problem.  Most people care, they are just not aware that this is really happening, nor will believe it.  Plus, I can't even figure out when to bring this stuff up to people.  During a dinner out, or brunch or party?  Nope.  A long get together with a friend only gets you Wild Stares.  They sound concerned and then it starts with the vacay they are going on with the kids, etc.  Confounding and Exasperating.  Thanks for posting.

            I got into this vein after doing deeper research into this artist called “CPSilencer” I found a few weeks ago when it finally dawned on me that that their name and many of their songs are about intimidating child rape victims into silence.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cpsilencer">

            That eventually landed me on this channel. “King Sultan” Check out the whole channel:

            It’s all about the threat of the Glasgow Smile and the Soul Scalping/eye gouge tortures.
“GlaSglow Smile: A nickname for the form of torture that involves cutting a victim’s face from the edges of the mouth to the ear, the cut, or its scars, form an “extension” of what resembles a smile. Usually the victim is given a small cut, around 1/4″-1/2″, in the corners of the mouth and is then further injured by kicking, stabbing, or other means, causing them to scream and the cuts to further tear.”  (

             https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/butterfly-effect-travis-scotts-introduction-occult-industry/
            </a>
            )
One of the videos there is this:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/xjTZFzXbWcM">
             https://youtu.be/xjTZFzXbWcM

            دقه سستم حماس
daqh sstim hamas
           </p>
           <p>
            (It’s Domain is Fire [Hamas])
Then YouTube suggested this link. Using the same imagery for the same purpose: to threaten people:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/BMxt-uiIC_o">
             https://youtu.be/BMxt-uiIC_o
            </a>
            From there, I followed the links to the profiles of the commenters and that’s when I opened the gates of ISIS human trafficking Hell. Note the prolific emojis: a broken heart, a black heart, and a person walking to the left. This, as I’ve decoded from other rap videos that I find suspicious, is a person with their back to the future, and only the past to look at: no future, dead man walking. 
As the minds behind the website The Open Scroll have proved conclusively, time travel and ritual sodomy are connected, and the film series Back to the Future is all about ritual sodomy. I’ve figured out a lot more of what it’s about, and I’ll explain in upcoming writings.

            </a>
            one-eyed Mike
A reference to a man's penis. This term was quietly used in the movie "Monsters, Inc." as the character Mike Wazowski. Anal sex, specifically illumination through ritual sodomy, was quietly asserted in that another monster, James P. Sullivan, has colored spots on his back and arms, which is a reference to the colored spots reported to appear on persons' eyes which are being sodomized. Note also that Mike, the one-eyed monster, is in control of the larger, scarier monster Sullivan. "Sulley," as he is called, is a reference to being sullied, or sexually defiled.
"I'm gonna give her some one-eyed Mike up her Wazowski. I'm gonna sully her good."

             I don't get what the problem is in these videos. Especially "CrAzY kiAn". I don't know how kids acted when you were in school, but that's just how some kids act when they're around their friends. Yelling and screaming, looking for attention.

              Find the actual videos. I posted links in another comment. See the glitches. You could't hear them very well in the video report. If you go to the original video, notice the glitches. They are all throughout the videos posted by that account and related accounts. They are abnormal. What it seems, from what I've been researching, is that slowing it down to a certain rate reveals the hidden info in the glitch, but you have to know what that rate is.

                No. They're not being abducted. They're at a school where they have to do this, or at least, it seems, a goodly portion of them. And in the cases of those kids, their parents are clearly in on it.

             OP, you can save YouTube videos when using a Firefox Browser, installing an add-on, that will allow you to download them.
