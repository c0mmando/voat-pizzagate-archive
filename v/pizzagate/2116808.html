            Ok. This was weird. I watched the film and decided to see how far this Comprehensive Sexual Education had infiltrated the UK education system. Specifically I looked at the "Its All One" curriculum mentioned at around the 13:00min mark. A search led me to this article:
            <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0968-8080(10)36522-0">
             http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0968-8080(10)36522-0
            </a>
            I then decided to take a closer look at the publishers of the article as listed in the above left and right of the page - particularly 'Elsevier' to the top left whose web page is listed as follows - and upon opening I was shocked to be met by this page (***that needs a NSFW warning!!)
            <a href="http://www.rhm-elsevier.com">
             http://www.rhm-elsevier.com
            </a>
            Can't explain how this address for a supposed academic publishing company webpage brings me here - can anyone help? Even if only to prevent me making the mistake in the future!! I don't want to see this shit.

            Yes. Exactly right. They are in fact part of the UN and teaching or shoving this curriculum down the throats of children around the world. They created a sex education book that was being taught in African countries with massive AIDS crisis still that explains you don't have to reveal your HIV positive status if you are uncomfortable and pushed the agenda on children that every sexual activity is safe as long as you agree. The African leaders are incensed due to the death levels and enormous cost of AIDS treatment and also culturally this is a violation to their families.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have to think about the deepest motivations of all. That is depopulation. Whether that is through AIDS or abortion or destruction of the reproduction of the culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            So sinister. People need to wake up. This is intentional and they are not doing it because they care about anyone except the all mighty dollar.

            MassResistance-Texas parents were holding a presentation at a public library in Austin on the LGBT / sex-ed agenda in local elementary schools. LGBT activists tried to disrupt it and shut it down. But the parents stood their ground and weren't intimidated!

            I have posted the article that identifies the co-founder of the Human Rights Campaign another (HRC) as mentioned in these videos by teachers and parents is non other than Terry Bean and is a top democratic donor and great friend of Obama.,He is seen in many pictures with him and Michelle at fundraisers, speeches, and even on Airforce One. This is quoted in this article even by CNN.  He is 66 years old and was a preeminent gay rights Speaker out of San Francisco in the 70's.  Terry Bean was credited by Obama as helping write the school curriculum for LGBTQ and transgender education for schools. He was also indicted for child rape along with his 25 year old boyfriend involving a young boy who had been lured to a hotel room. Yes Bean's boyfriend was 40 years younger than he was and they sexually assaulted a young boy. This is who has been writing curriculum for young children.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many posts on Terry Bean and his involvement with Obama &amp; Clinton as well as their glowing remarks about him.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is also credited for writing the template for the "bathroom bills" which many have suggested was pedophiles attempting to write laws to gain access to children. He was involved and pictured with Pres. Obama even on Airforce One after these charges came out.

             Hi Jem, I might get banned for posting info about ELSEVEIR, ELSA VEER, from their Wikipedia page. They were caught paying doctorate shills. Very interesting. They have the market cornered for global academia science . They write all the college text books and lower grades....voat keeps deleting my posts about this, it's very inoffensive material and I think people need to know we are being poisoned through inaccurate school books. They make 2.3 billion.  I just wanted to thanks for the lovely bible chat. We must keep searching for accurate knowledge and then those ones receive life says the Bible. Keep studying. The Bible says there are students who are always learning, but NEVER come to accurate knowledge of the Bible. We don't want to be one of those. Keep on seeing and knocking for YHWH to teach you. Go to The great teacher and learn without any preconceived ideas. Our thoughts about God don't matter. It's what He teaches about Himself through the scriptures that matter. Jesus said come to him like a child and learn. Children have no preconceived ideas about YHWH. They listen , believe, and obey the masters will. You will inherit the kingdom if you do. Please take care of yourself your such a nice person and intelligent. I hope we will talk soon again :). Good bye.
