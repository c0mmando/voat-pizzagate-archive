            To Mod Crensch -
           </p>
           <p>
            So you deleted the submission below because -  "Reason given: "Bigotry and Hate speech" is not pizzagate related. Hate speech will not be censored here. Violates rule 2, as such."
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to ask you mod Crensch - how you can justify your assertion that pizzagate is not "related" to the idea of bigotry and hate speech.  It is, and that relation already provides an existential threat to the subverse, much like the kind of threat that in fact eliminated pizzagate on reddit because of a "witchhunt".  For this reason, it needs to be agreed that pizzagate holds a unique place on Voat and hate speech i.e. "witchhunts" towards any race, orientation, political party, religion etc cannot be tolerated.
            <br/>

            - this one says "In an interview with the Washington City Paper, Alefantis called the pizzagate-supporters "conspiracy theorist, white nationalists made up largely of racists, homophobic individuals"
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the article they refer to

            "He calls the attackers "conspiracy theorist, white nationalists made up largely of racists, homophobic individuals who loosely tie together theories and do not attempt to find the truth, and when they do find truth that dispels their theories, they ignore it."

            Pizzagate and hate speech - "The move followed criticism from Brussels that the tech companies had not done enough to clamp down on hate speech. A similar collaborative effort is needed to stop the spread of fake news." from ‘Pizzagate’ exposes real consequences of posting fake news

            A completely differeint article states pizzagate is a "stew of homophobia, panic, and paranoia among Trump supporters."

            Do you need 5 articles?  10?  I might add more at my leisure.  The post you deleted had encouraged the public to subscribe in the hundreds to the voat pizzagate forum over a couple of days.  It was written appropriately and the free speech differences between posters from other Voat subverses were ironed out.  Bigotry and hate speech do indeed constitute genuine problems with how the pizzagate forum is percieved because it is potentially under more than ordinary scrutiny by the media and the calls to call out bigotry and hate speech were exactly what mods explained should be done IN EACH CASE where it was found, and so these comments were absolutely appropriate.
           </p>
           <p>
            The success of my two posts over 48 hours is indisputable and very satisfying to me as far as encouraging subscribers to the subverse which was my goal.  This is a complaint about your mod inabilities and total lack of discernment as well as a use of your position in a biased manner.  It isn't posted because I care about a response from you or any action - it is for the record.    A record that will have many lives, and will illustrate your position on the wrong side of history Crensch.

Original Submission
350 NEW SUBSCRIBERS IN LESS THAN A DAY - THEY ARE CAUGHT OFF GUARD AGAIN WITH THE HOTTEST CROWD SOURCED INVESTIGATION ANYWHERE
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the last thread with dozens of comments from new subscribers, and how they have been watching as things develop -

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1491975
            </a>
            . If you like, come back here and let us know what you think. Let's get to 10,000 - please upvote this to keep it in front of newcomers and our public audience of friendly lurkers.
           </p>
           <p>
            We cordially invite you to join and subscribe to this investigation and social movement to find the truth surrounding the circumstantial evidence of a child trafficking hub right in the heart of Washington DC, which appears to be preying on our young, compromising our political representatives, our lawmakers, our Constitution, our country, our values, and the very spirit of America.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once you subscribe, be strong in finding shills - your COMMENTS against shills require both discenment and then abrasive zero tolerance commenting which will earn you points to be able to downvote them in a couple of days. Open a front on the engagement of trolls and shills. We also need tweeters, and yakkers - just TALK to your friends and families, especially over the holidays. Show them the evidence. Or for the methodical among you, pick a thread and look at all the evidence, and submit a post on what you found. Use the search engine and look for interesting older posts that may have been lost and buried and bring them to light again. There are always going to be more of us than there will be shills, if you participate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Call out racism, call out anti-Semitism, call out violence and vigilante justice. NONE of these things represents this investigation and social movement. Use wit, use humor, use knowlege, use your wisdom. YOU are the citizens that will not let this topic die without a fair and complete investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: After hearing the concerned arguments from places on VOAT other than this pizzagate subverse, and making this statement clearer to them in comments, it should be added - Calling out bigotry and hate speech on THIS forum on Voat is limited to the pizzagate subverse. Elsewhere on VOAT hardcore free speech advocacy rules for good reason and that should be respected.

             I won't waste my time with someone that cannot come up with why the investigation of child fuckers/traffickers has nothing to do with speech or the dislike of groups of people.

              I put the connection right in that post.  Incredible how butt hurt you are over trying to keep RACISM and BIGOTRY from subverting the pizzagate investigation.  This is just a game to you guys, and it is pathetic.  I'm fine with lurking here, the points thing is important in your world, not mine. Cheers.

               You put a lot of wharrgarbl in that post that is completely irrelevant, and it's not my job to coddle you and pick out your arguments from the piles of bullshit you type out.

               Not a single rule could be even remotely objectively enforced that has the removal criteria "racism" or "bigotry", so that rule will never be made, and it will NEVER be enforced.
