            VOAT is Not Sure What to Make of Our Love Frontier…

            Beware that this looks to be hostile territory, in the event you want to follow the link below.
           </p>
           <p>
            Normal Link 01) Our Love Frontier – Possible sarting point for investigations into online pedo networks
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me explain something to the people in that thread:
           </p>
           <p>
            We get sick to death of you sorts, who relentlessly project onto us MAPs, whatever is going on in your own heads. We are tired of you sorts, who pull “facts” out of your own ass, and try to drag us MAPs into all of your psychological bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            What happens on Our Love Frontier, is the logical outcome of a human being who owns his own sexuality, and who is no longer going to take any shit from other people for being this way.
           </p>
           <p>
            …It’s the product of a person who figured out decades ago…that the social system he lives in is based on a lot of smoke and mirrors…a lot of horse shit…and it’s never going to work, to heal the social issues which have most impacted his own life…Therefor, the job of representing myself and the issues which impact upon me, falls upon scrupulous people like myself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over a decade ago…I seized this stance of power…at the very least, for representing myself…but also to give a human voice, to pedophilia…and to the experience of it’s being.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am proud of being a pedophile, yes…This is a beautiful state of being, with a beautiful attraction, to other beautiful human beings. My consequence on this world, is one of a net positive…not a net negative…And you clueless people who don’t even know me [nor my history], have nothing to say of relevance on this matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            I belong in this world…and this world needs people like me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will not be used in every way possible by the system [military, disabled war vet, taxed worker, etc.], just to be treated as though I’m not even human, by that very same system…or as if I have no right, to take full part in that very same system.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will not hide any part of who I am, just to appease small minded people who are chronically offended.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have no right to expect, that you can take and take and take, abuse and abuse and abuse…and that we are not going to stand up and fight back for ourselves, and for those we love.
           </p>
           <p>
            Point is…you sorts crossed a line…and you crossed it many years ago…And you should have known better, than to just keep pushing and attacking us…We are not a bottomless well of pacifism…not when our very lives and freedom are at stake, over the coddling of your extreme and warped phobia…and the appeasement of your endless aggression.
           </p>

             Wow
So we are the ones who've crossed the line?
A 5 year old who wants to play with her puppy and color is missing out on the joys of sex with adults.  And I'm am oppressing this normal desire.  If we weren't so opressive I guess these people wouldn't have to kill the kids afterwards right.  I also guess if more people were open to giving their children's bodies to dating 40 y/o then they wouldn't have to kidnap new sex partners right?  We need an eharmony for pedos and people who want their kids to have this beautiful experience.  The delusion of grandeur and toxic narcissistic behavior is dangerous in these people.

             That's a very articulate and intelligent author.  Of course, I disagree with his ultimate take on the subject, but I recommend everyone read that message thoughtfully.  It's a look inside the mind of one of our opponents.  A lot of you will instantly reject the suggestion that we need to understand them, but we need to understand them.  Sun Tzu, folks.  Sun Tzu.

              these people breeds sympathy and empathy. Scientific/psychological studies and data collection would be - far more effectively, and far more often - used as a tool to normalize pedophilia, than it would ever be used to stop these predators.

               Thanks for illustrating my point so perfectly.  Your fear about normalization is blocking you from becoming more effective by understanding your opponent.  Again, Sun Tzu applies.
              </p>
              <p>
               No amount of anger, regardless of how righteous, can substitute for knowledge of one's opponent.  It's like being angry because an injury is bad and you want it to go away.  The correct approach is to study anatomy until you understand how the various organs and body parts and systems work, and then perform a surgery designed to repair the specific damage caused by the injury, followed by a rest period to allow healing.  (Obviously it's helpful when someone has already done all of that studying!)  Yelling at the injury, doing a chicken dance over it, throwing rocks at it, kicking it, spitting on it, rolling logs on it, slapping it with palm fronds, etc. etc. etc. will not help, and may even make things worse.

                Seeing this is still a (mostly) free country, anyone who wants to psychoanalyze pedophiles - knock yourselves out. But do so inside their prisons, and don't expect tax dollars to pay for it. I'm sure George Soros would be happy to provide the funds.

                 That's a good idea; the ones already caught are available, and some might be willing to talk.

                <p>
                 BTW, you can't ever criminalize pedophilia.  Only child abuse, rape, molestation, etc. can be criminalized.  Desire is not an act, and thus not a crime, no matter how upsetting it might be to know about.  (This is what the infamous NYT article said, which set off a firestorm of REEEEEE from all the "reasoned" folks such as yourself who were rage-blinded from understanding the distinction.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Obviously you're all lathered up against me here.  That's OK.  But when you calm down, I hope you think again about what I'm saying.  We can only operate on the basis of our understanding.  Willful blindness toward pedos isn't an advantage here, it's just self-impairment.  You clearly care a lot about this, so I encourage you to think carefully.

                 , Understanding these pedophiles will gives us a critical advantage, because the knowledge gained from these pedophiles will help us understand how they think, what type of language/codewords they use, and how we can destroy them. This is similar to a country sending spies to help infiltrate a country to expose all their weak points, and then we can proceed to formulating a plan to invade the land of pedophiles based on the knowledge/intel we gathered from spying on them.  This is a war we are fighting, it's best if we infiltrate these pedophiles to gain knowledge and then we surround them, so we'll leave them with no room to escape.  CHECKMATE

             The reviews are oddly specific and paint the author as a victim of persecution who overcame all while being an outcast. I remember when the LGBT rights campaign started they patterned their narrative after MLK. At the time many said eventually would lead to people trying to normalize pedo and beastiality. At the time that sounded crazy, now I see the point.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I see the writing of these sympathizers I notice they use Nabokovs writing style for Lolita to justify their preference.  Rumors are Nabokov may have been a survivor or predator himself. Many times reading Lolita I had to remind myself that this guy is Pedo/phile or pedorast and not a typical love story.

            "In most societies, pedophilia is an emotionally charged concept.
Because of the many prejudices, pedophiles will be afraid
to be open about a (sexual) relationship towards the child’s
parents. Nonetheless, openness is a crucial condition. "

            The worst thing is that the blog is active until today, his last post was a few hours ago. From his last post, quote "Don't let those bastards let you down. Thought I’d repost this, to help lift the spirits of those MAPs who are being targeted and abused". Plus a video with a weird guy playing guitar and singing.

              He has another place where he says that he will accept videos from Minor Attracted People and will post them. So I don't know what that means. Here is his quote:

             https://archive.fo/kDCgm

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             …Incredulously…you cannot have a competent, real discussion on childhood sexuality or pedophilia…but you can spout off all the racist vitriol you please…Hell, you can run an outright hate and terrorism channel on YouTube [complete with doxing, character assassination and death threats], so long as it’s aimed at “pedophiles”.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This man thinks that he is on the side of angels. He thinks we should respect him and find a way for him to enjoy his love interest in a mutually beneficial way. I think he believes that children are not harmed by "child love". That somehow the stats that show that kids that are victims of pedophilia don't have higher drug use, higher incarceration rates, rates of prostitution, rates of sexual dysfunction are caused by culture. That if the child believed that it was normal then everything would be fine.

             Amazing The use of words like love, minor attracted person. Double plus good newspeak to describe raping children. We can't fight these people if we keep using their language. They are predators not MAPs, rapists not Pedophile.

              That is vitally important. The term 'pedophile' thankfully has a negative connotation in our culture, but at the end of the day it is a euphemism. What we are actually dealing with is people who wish to exploit, abuse, and rape children at a bare minimum, and most of them have actually done it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The term 'child porn' is also a euphemism.  It is not even porn.  Objectively it is criminal footage of child rape and exploitation.
             </p>
             <p>
              These people do consciously attempt to change the language to force society to be more permissive of them. They are dangerous and manipulative.

               "Pedomaniac" may be a good alternative. They never liked kids, they are mad obsessed with them (or rather with the filthy image they project on them before they tear "it" down).
              </p>
              <p>
               JA's instagram clearly revealed a subculture of pedomania in the larger homo ghetto.

               True
If an adult woman is raped it videotaped it is not called "adult porn". It's called what it is, rape. 
Consenting adults video taping a sex act is porn.
Rape is rape. A one year old being raped is not porn.
              </p>
              <p>
               We must neutralize the euphemisms and double speak.
