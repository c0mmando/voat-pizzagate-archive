            Hi OP, I think todays blind from CD&amp;N is sherman.  think the 'church' is CF or maybe some other church connected to CF.
TUESDAY, JANUARY 23, 2018
           </p>
           <p>
            Today's Blind Items - We Can't Let You Talk - The Church
Right after the calendar turned to 2018, he was going to talk. He had to talk. He didn't want to go to jail for lying. He was going to have to talk to investigators in his own country. When they asked where the money was going and who he was paying and that secret installation out in the middle of his country, that is where things were going to get more interesting. Investigators from the US would then be called in and that would set off alarm bells all over the place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who is the he mentioned in the first paragraph? If you live in his country, you might not know his name but you knew his company. You knew his products. Almost every single person had probably used one of his products. People from all over the world used his products. It is why he was very very rich. He also had a lot of charities he supported. People also gave his charities money. He was very interested in creating products for people that his charities supported. That is how The Church became involved with him. That is the "product" that was created.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why was he going to talk to investigators? He got busted. He got busted for paying off people he shouldn't have paid off and he gave them a lot of money. He gave them enough money to do his bidding for the rest of his days. When investigators asked him did he give any money to anyone else he would answer yes. They would go through the list and one of those names was going to make some ears go up and some telephone calls made. Lets call that name F.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did he give money to F? He wanted to try a new product. A product he had been testing not only in poor countries around the world, but also testing in a facility in the middle of his own country, away from prying eyes. Did he have permission to test it there? No. Those indigenous people thought they were signing up for something completely different for that money they were being paid.
           </p>
           <p>
            He finally got the product mastered and wanted to be able to sell it to the world. He thought of a way to do that and make a big splash. That is where F comes in. He gave a huge amount of money to F to get his product into a country at a time when all eyes were focused on that country. He wanted every news story to have pictures of his product and people talking about his product. That all happened. He got his wish and the product flew off the shelves. It flew off so quickly that it was easy to forget the early stages of the product that killed people in other countries and his own country.
           </p>
           <p>
            When faced with all of that in front of him, when he would have nothing left to save himself, the only thing he could possibly offer up was The Church. So, they killed him. Period
           </p>
           <p>
            Also I think F is Frank Guistra, who is canadian, big ties to Clinton and CF and involved in all the corruption

             Oh I've been trying to find ties between Frank and the Shermans, there are only so many Canadian billionaires.  He's got to be right in the thick of things with his Radcliffe Foundation and boys foundation.

            For awhile I've been fascinated by the fact that prior to the Haiti quake Canada's governor general was removed and a nobody named Michaelle Jean was put in the position.  Jean was born in Haiti and was thrown into the position from out of nowhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.ninasimone.com/2013/01/michelle-jean-is-canadas-first-black-governor-general/">
             http://www.ninasimone.com/2013/01/michelle-jean-is-canadas-first-black-governor-general/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There was huge objection to this nobody filling this position.  The Governor General position represents the British Queen and can act directly for her.   Coincidental timing?
            <br/>
            There was some question over her husband's activities as a independent movie maker, but I didn't follow that at all. 
Notice that the prime minister of Canada is appointed by the Governor General who is the representative of the British Queen.

             In 2002, as Bill Clinton contemplated his next act, he received an impassioned letter from his former presidential policy adviser, Ira C. Magaziner, a friend since their days as Rhodes scholars. The two had just met in Barcelona, Spain, with the leaders of several AIDS-ravaged nations, including Mr. Kagame, and heard how hundreds of thousands of people were dying because they could not afford antiretroviral drugs.

            <p>
             The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network was cautiously optimistic today in welcoming news that Rwanda will be the first developing country to attempt using Canada's Access to Medicines Regime to purchase an affordable AIDS drug from Canada. Yesterday, Rwanda notified the World Trade Organization (WTO) of its intention to import 260,000 packs of Apo-Triavir from Canada over the next twoyears. Apo-Triavir is a generic drug manufactured by
             <strong>
              Ontario-based Apotex Inc
             </strong>
             . It combines three patented brand-name drugs: zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. The notification by Rwanda is the first step for Apotex to get a licence that will allow it to produce and export this medicine.

            I know it's probably obvious but it seems to me that investigating the people murdered is more important than those left alive. What was it that got that person murdered and not someone else?

           <blockquote>

             Fuck the [deep state] police

            ...because they cannot serve two masters.  They fucking love their salaries which they extort from the mass population.   Then fucking know your place!

             Let me guess: they want to demolish it ASAP, have the rubble removed and sent to different landfills (or better yet shipped to China), and force anyone working to do the demo and transport work to sign NDA's???

              I think it usually goes on the market, instead. Even Jon Benet's house is still intact. Makes me wonder if there are underground storage places or tunnel entrances/exits that the children want to seal off. Maybe the cops told them they'd do a light search to make it look good, but then the children must destroy the house.

            Thank You!  I am Shocked anyone is admitting they were murdered and did not die by one of their own hands.  That person better watch his back.  Yeah, the cops surely would not be putting that out.  WOW.  A tie from Apotex to CF and CGI is HOT!  How in the world can that be pushed to be brought out to the MSM or at least a few Soc. Media Sites.  Big News.

              The Sherman family has hired a team of experts, which includes a number of former Toronto homicide detectives, to conduct a separate, independent investigation.

             <p>
              The private investigators have found evidence that both Barry and Honey Sherman had their necks wrapped with leather belts that were then knotted around a handrail that runs adjacent to the pool, the source told CBC Toronto.

              Their wrists showed evidence that they had been, at one point, bound together. No rope or other materials that could have been used to tie their wrists were discovered, the source told CBC Toronto.
