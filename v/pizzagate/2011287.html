Trump blasts AG Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Trump harshly criticized his attorney general and one of his most loyal supporters, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, indicating that he regretted the choice.</p>
<p>In an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, Trump vented about the probe and said that he would not have appointed Sessions — a top campaign supporter — if he had known Sessions would step aside.</p>
<p>“Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today this:</p>
<p>Sessions discussed Trump campaign-related matters with Russian ambassador, U.S. intelligence intercepts show</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia’s ambassador to Washington told his superiors in Moscow that he discussed campaign-related matters, including policy issues important to Moscow, with Jeff Sessions during the 2016 presidential race, contrary to public assertions by the embattled attorney general, according to current and former U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Ambassador Sergey Kislyak’s accounts of two conversations with Sessions — then a top foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump — were intercepted by U.S. spy agencies, which monitor the communications of senior Russian officials in the United States and in Russia. Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>One U.S. official said that Sessions — who testified that he had no recollection of an April encounter — has provided “misleading” statements that are “contradicted by other evidence.” A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had “substantive” discussions on matters including Trump’s positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration.</p>

              Also the special prosecutor investigation is touching on pizzagate, as they have already studied Russian bots and found they helped spread Pizzagate news.   The bots were used to amplify pizzagate, DNC, Podesta news.  McClatchy news has started looking at the Trump Team's digital operations to see if there was coordination.  Jared Kushner has been named at person of interest in this investigation and he was working on the digital operations.

               Investigators in the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and the Department of Justice are now looking into the Trump campaign’s digital operations led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to a report published by McClatchy DC.......

                including a debunked story of a pedophile ring at a D.C. pizza shop (infamously known as Pizzagate),

              <p>
               By Election Day, an automated Kremlin cyberattack of unprecedented scale and sophistication had delivered critical and phony news about the Democratic presidential nominee to the Twitter and Facebook accounts of millions of voters. Some investigators suspect the Russians targeted voters in swing states, even in key precincts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Russia’s operation used computer commands known as “bots” to collect and dramatically heighten the reach of negative or fabricated news about Clinton,** including a story in the final days of the campaign accusing her of running a pedophile ring at a Washington pizzeria.**
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump son-in-law Kushner, now a senior adviser to the president and the only current White House aide known to be deemed a “person of interest” in the Justice Department investigation, appears to be under the microscope in several respects. His real estate finances and December meetings with Russia’s ambassador and the head of a sanctioned, state-controlled bank are also being examined.
              </p>
              <p>
               Kushner’s “role as a possible cut-out or conduit for Moscow’s influence operations in the elections,” including his niche overseeing the digital operations, will be closely looked at, said the source knowledgeable about the Justice Department inquiry.

               Please provide evidence of "Russian bots." Given the Vault7 revelations about CIA making their shennanigans look like attacks from other countries, you're going to have to do better than McClatchy if you hope to debunk anything.

               I didn't find out about Pizzagate from a bot on Twitter. I found out about it reading the Podesta emails on Wikileaks. And frankly, I was only suspicious -- until the insane, Orwellian cross-platform crackdown on discussion of the subject, complete with the silencing of Assange and DDoSing of Voat, Reddit, 4Chan, pizzagate.wiki, and Twitter. That, for me, was the real red pill.

                McClatchy is a solid source. And they are reporting about the investigation and the investigation is looking into this.  This is news about a developing story.

            Well I guess the Russian Lawyer charade is officially dead. After all it's kind of hard for any Democrat to argue from a position of moral superiority:

           <p>
            "Will no Pizzagate arrests occur under Sessions?"
           </p>
           <p>
            I wouldn't say that. I'd argue there will be no arrests while Robert Mueller "investigates" Russian hookers and their Golden Showers.
           </p>
           <p>
            As soon as Mueller and his corrupt cronies get flushed down the toilet all hell's going to break lose down in DC.

            Watch!  As with the "wiretapping" and the "Comey" comments Trump is trying to make Mueller think that Sessions maybe on his way out! Knowing Mueller will step down as prosecutor, cuz Mueller wants Session's job! Then Trump can tell Mueller to go fuck himself!😁😁👄👄👄👄👄👄

            Trump always gives warnings.  I think he just told Sessions to clean up that special prosecutor mess or he will fire both of them.
He has already warned 'crooked" Hillary and 'everybody is talking about ' Podesta.

              I am saying that the issue is Mueller being out of control.  He had no limits put on his investigation.  It is Sessions job to control that investigation.  He can recuse himself and still limit its scope.
