<p>Relevancy: Linda Collins-Smith murder is entirely relevant to Pizzagate. She was proven to be involved in investigating missing funds from DHS/CPS, funds that filtered back to the Clinton Foundation. She was also calling for the resignation of Jeremy Hutchinson, nephew of Asa Hutchinson. This is all documented here: </p>

<p>This post will attempt to find a motive behind her murder and offer up evidence of there being more behind her condemnation of Hutchinson and it boils down to drugs. While the bulk of this will be evidence bolstering the contention that Hutchinson was willfully and vociferously involved in protecting/covering up the trafficking, it will also document a very strange \'\'coincidence\'\' that occurred regarding Linda Collins-Smith\'s ex-husband, Judge Philip Smith. I\'ll leave it up to the reader to decide what it all means in the context of this war being waged over drugs overtaking Arkansas and the rest of the world, but I intuitively felt the need to do this digging into the background of Judge Smith. While there is no evidence at all tying him to the drug trafficking, the incident is curious given what happened to the ex-State Senator. And the drug factor is definitely involved with pizzagate. It is human/child trafficking and drug selling that keep this cabal rich and in the position to dictate what happens in the world. </p>

<p>I first want to start by again documenting Linda Collins-Smith call for Jeremy Hutchinson’s resignation: </p>

<p>Asa Hutchinson’s record of seeing, hearing and speaking no evil can be found as easily as tracking an elephant through the snow but most voters simply lack the time and inclination to actually know who they vote for. Maybe my research will help?</p>

<p>A third article that gives another view of Hutchinson\'s collaboration with Purdue Pharm, a purveyor of OxyContin. The article also references Rudy Giuliani being a involved and reflects him in a very negative light. So be it. I\'m just concerned with getting the truth out there, and if he knew of the addictive nature of the drugs, then let it fall on him. </p>

<p>The statement echoing Purdue’s finely honed sales pitch came just before a congressional committee was slated to hold a hearing addressing reports of OxyContin addiction.</p>
<p>Only two people were quoted in the DEA press release announcing the joint statement: Hutchinson and Dr. Russell Portenoy, an internationally acclaimed pain specialist and one of Purdue’s best-known consultants.</p>

<p>I\'d like to know cite an article that introduces the devastation that Oxycodone products cause to our country by highlighting an arrest of a Dr. Richard Duane Johns. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — A physician accused of selling prescription drugs back in 2014 pleaded guilty in court Thursday. </p>
<p>Dr. Richard Duane Johns, 49, of Little Rock, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute oxycodone without an effective prescription....</p>
<p>Prescription drug abuse is an epidemic in this country that destroys countless lives,” DEA Special Agent in Charge Azzam said. “The DEA is fully committed to the pursuit of any individual who abandons their oath as a medical practitioner. This conviction sends a clear message to all who engage in the illegal distribution of prescription drugs: we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, the medical community and the public to identify and stop those responsible for endangering lives in our communities and bring them to justice.”</p>

<p>And it\'s here things get dicey. Also in the article are the names of other arrested:</p>

<p>Now I\'ll post an article re: an assault against Judge Phillip Smith, Linda Collins-Smith ex-husband. </p>

<p>So there we have an individual named RANDY BYRD launching an assault on \'\'RETIRED\'\' Judge Philip Smith. Is it a coincidence? Well, I would imagine it wouldn\'t be too difficult to find an alleged meth addict engaging in an attack, but the thing is I hate half-truths ... especially half-truths covering lies. I\'m referring to the use of the word \'\'RETIRED\'\' to describe Philip Smith. How about use \'\'REMOVED FROM OFFICE\'\' instead?  
</p>

<h1 id="md-ex-judge-barred-from-judicial-jobs">Ex-judge barred from judicial jobs</h1>
<p>A retired Arkansas circuit court judge has accepted a reprimand and agreed to be permanently ineligible to serve in the judiciary.</p>
<p>The Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission released the decision Friday in the case of Philip Smith, who once served in the 3rd Judicial District in northeastern Arkansas. The district covers four counties: Jackson, Lawrence, Randolph and Sharp. ...</p>
<p>During divorce litigation with the Randolph County Circuit Court, Smith said under oath that he improperly used court computer equipment after regular work hours at the office, according to a commission document.</p>
<p>Smith retired from his position as circuit court judge on Dec. 31, 2017, two days after the commission\'s executive director, David J. Sachar, filed a complaint because of information obtained from various sources. The panel determined that Smith committed his infractions during his time in office, according to the letter.</p>
<p>Sachar said he could not release the contents of the complaint because it is a confidential process.</p>
<h1 id="md-according-to-the-letter-the-effect-of-the-agreement-is-the-same-as-removal-from-office.-smith-is-unable-to-perform-any-temporary-assignments-or-appointments-as-a-judge-according-to-the-commission.">According to the letter, the effect of the agreement &quot;is the same as \'removal\' from office.&quot; Smith is unable to perform any temporary assignments or appointments as a judge, according to the Commission.</h1>

<p>So let\'s get this timeline straight: </p>

June 4, 2019 -- Linda Collins Smith found dead outside her home </p>
<p>Rel the interview given on March 26, here is a quote: </p>
<p>Illegal Aliens Use Our Highways</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collins-Smith recalls a conversation she had with a Minnesota sheriff in which he informed her that his state has the most opioid deaths. She tells us, “He told me, and he told the public, ‘remember, they’re being delivered up and down your interstate and on your highways to get to us up north.’” She says you don’t have to be a border state to have issues with illegals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So do I think it was the issue of DHS/CPS that got her murdered? No, I believe it was drugs. She intended to be very involved in the 2020 elections and we don\'t know what she learned. As I stated before, I do hope that if she had information that a copy was given to the proper authorities or organization. As for her husbands, all I know is that using equipment after hours for a divorce proceeding would not get you barred from judicial jobs. It just wouldn\'t. There had to be something in the complaint that detailed something more than writing that his ex-wife was mean to him. What it was, I will not speculate. Hopefully, more will be revealed in the coming days.</p>',

            Prescription drug abuse is an epidemic in this country that destroys countless lives,” DEA Special Agent in Charge Azzam said. “The DEA is fully committed to the pursuit of any individual who abandons their oath as a medical practitioner. This conviction sends a clear message to all who engage in the illegal distribution of prescription drugs: we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, the medical community and the public to identify and stop those responsible for endangering lives in our communities and bring them to justice.”

           So there we have an individual named RANDY BYRD launching an assault on ''RETIRED'' Judge Philip Smith. Is it a coincidence? Well, I would imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to find an alleged meth addict engaging in an attack, but the thing is I hate half-truths ... especially half-truths covering lies. I'm referring to the use of the word ''RETIRED'' to describe Philip Smith. How about use ''REMOVED FROM OFFICE'' instead?

            Ex-judge barred from judicial jobs
           </h1>
           <p>
            A retired Arkansas circuit court judge has accepted a reprimand and agreed to be permanently ineligible to serve in the judiciary.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission released the decision Friday in the case of Philip Smith, who once served in the 3rd Judicial District in northeastern Arkansas. The district covers four counties: Jackson, Lawrence, Randolph and Sharp. ...
           </p>
           <p>
            During divorce litigation with the Randolph County Circuit Court, Smith said under oath that he improperly used court computer equipment after regular work hours at the office, according to a commission document.
           </p>
           <p>
            Smith retired from his position as circuit court judge on Dec. 31, 2017, two days after the commission's executive director, David J. Sachar, filed a complaint because of information obtained from various sources. The panel determined that Smith committed his infractions during his time in office, according to the letter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sachar said he could not release the contents of the complaint because it is a confidential process.
           </p>

            According to the letter, the effect of the agreement "is the same as 'removal' from office." Smith is unable to perform any temporary assignments or appointments as a judge, according to the Commission.

          <p>
           Illegal Aliens Use Our Highways
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Collins-Smith recalls a conversation she had with a Minnesota sheriff in which he informed her that his state has the most opioid deaths. She tells us, “He told me, and he told the public, ‘remember, they’re being delivered up and down your interstate and on your highways to get to us up north.’” She says you don’t have to be a border state to have issues with illegals.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So do I think it was the issue of DHS/CPS that got her murdered? No, I believe it was drugs. She intended to be very involved in the 2020 elections and we don't know what she learned. As I stated before, I do hope that if she had information that a copy was given to the proper authorities or organization. As for her husbands, all I know is that using equipment after hours for a divorce proceeding would not get you barred from judicial jobs. It just wouldn't. There had to be something in the complaint that detailed something more than writing that his ex-wife was mean to him. What it was, I will not speculate. Hopefully, more will be revealed in the coming days.

             I'm really just trying to contribute to uncovering what is going on. As you said, journalism used to do this and we could rely on them to be all over these subjects. But now they only push ''the narrative,'' and it's a shame.

              I hopemthe media wont Bury the story and ärmellos learn more. This is highly suspicious. Did you know HRC's younger brother passed yesterday? Interesting, don't you think?. Someone is cleaning house, that is for sure.

               There's also a U.S. Commerce Commission official that was shot in a murder/suicide. She was hosting a trade conference in Uzbekistan which has one of the worst ratings in human trafficking. But

               Oh, there's also a German politician that was shot .... five days ago was it? Part of the Angela Merkel crowd. Supposedly, a young lover shot him .... or so the story is.

                   Kellyanne Conway's husband was going nuts as were a couple of other folk. I thought it was hyperbole when others were saying they were scared, but they really are panicked.

                     Oh, and there were a couple of videos. One showing Linda Collins-Smith cross-examining a CPS official about why they don't let grandparents have custody and instead give the kids away to strangers. Really breaks your heart. She was the real deal and very serious about straightening out the corrupt system.

                      They steal children to provide for Pedos and Satanist. So SICK!!! Ever since Trump became President you see pop up news that Pedos/human trafficers have been arrested. Never happened under Obama that treasonous snake.

                      <p>
                       Someone put together a bar graph showing the number of pedo/human trafficking arrests. Even in the first couple of months there'd been ten times the arrests than for The Manchurian Candidate's whole presidency. And it's got to have grown like crazy since then.

                      <p>
                       Yes, having your child stole would be a nightmare. No doubt. It's why it was so important to have someone like Linda Collins-Smith championing the cause and fighting for parent's rights. Our POTUS has to do something.

                     Yes, it does. Hopefully, our POTUS and the DOJ won't let them bury this story. As for George Conway, he went crazy calling our POTUS ''mentally unwell''. Here's the quote:

                    <p>
                     Y&gt;ou’re not “presidential” at all, period. You’re mentally unwell. You engage in bizarre, irrational, self-defeating behavior, which prompts criticism of you, which triggers more bizarre, irrational, self-defeating behavior. You would have been fired from any other job by now.
