<p><em>Simplified explanation</em>:</p>
<p><strong>PIZZAGATE</strong> is the Washington D.C. child trafficking, SRA, pedophile rings used to keep high level politicians in check. </p>
<p><strong>PEDOGATE</strong> is the Global Child Trafficking business mainly managed by the CIA and other countries\' respective Secret Intelligence Agencies, for the Military Industrial Complex and other key Fortune 1000 companies scattered around the globe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is especially urgent to read this entire “Special Report” so that the Pizzagate lexicon and Pedogate back story can be properly understood. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>N.B</strong>. The term PIZZA in Pizzagate is not so much related to the Pizza joint on Connecticut Avenue (Comet Ping Pong) as it is to the Pizza <strong>CODEWORD</strong> found in the WikiLeaks Podesta Emails\' Dump. </p>

            I like using pedogate only because people seeing it would know its related to pedos instead of pizza. The first time I heard pizzagate I didnt even bother caring because I thought it was some corny trend about netflix and chill or something except with pizza lol.

             Thanks... I'm concerned though because the division here is real. I'll be praying for our movement and the children. Probably will be asking for the strength to carry on too because, unfortunately, I feel like I need it more than I ever did since I joined Voat.

            In my view, Pizzagate stands for our discovery that the world is run by a cult of super-rich elite satanic pedophiles and the politicians, judges, police chiefs, media outlets, journalists, CEOs, movie and television stars and personalities, famous musicians, and others they control. The name came about due to the revelation that pizza is code for sex with children, which is key to the cult's beliefs as well as to their maintenance of control over their members and minions. John Podesta's emails opened a window into this world, which was then opened wider when we looked into Comet Ping Pong and Pizza and its many ties to politicians and pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            We then realized that other pizza places and businesses were also used to facilitate these crimes and we could recognize them due to their use of pedophile symbols or satanic artwork. These discoveries allowed researchers to make an incredible number of connections. We also had our eyes opened to the fact that the many people who have claimed to be raped and tortured in satanic ritual abuse over the years weren't nuts or liars, as they had been portrayed to be, but that our controlled media is the liar, protecting the perpetrators while attacking the victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me, Pedogate seems like an attempt to make the scandal smaller, to limit it to pedophiles, when in fact the crimes go much deeper than that. Sadistic pedophilia and child trafficking are involved and are obviously heinous crimes that must be stopped. But every person on the planet is the victim or potential victim of this elitist satanic cult, who wants to control (and to some extent already does) us, our land, air, food, water, medicine, property, homes, schools, technology, entertainment, and more, and who some believe are working toward not only toward totalitarian oppression but serious depopulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The real name of the scandal should be SatanistsGate or SatanicElitistsGate, but that sounds too nutty, so let's stick with Pizzagate and let it encompass everything that is uncovered.

            Local is a relative term. It is contingent upon a point of reference. Your backyard, home town, region, and nation-state. It is a matter of drawing a distinction. Turn around from the nation-state conglomeration, and you get the global/international. Terms can also be nested in one another, ie Pizzagate is a part of the larger network of Pedogate. Everything is connected eventually, but the mind needs to draw lines or it gets overwhelming. What will happen when we determine there is an external, off planet contingent manipulating Pedogate? New term, new reference point.

            Pizzagate is the main focus. The villians are more than happy to make arrest of pedogate. They want Pizzagate to go away however and no such arrest have been made. And now, mysteriousy, a movement to get us to follow pedo arrest in general and not focus on arrest of the elite which is Pizzagate. I stay with Pizzagate. More and more I believe the effort to get us to switch focus is so the smaller bust can be proof that pedogate is being punished. But Pizzagate has not a single arrest. And that is what they want.

            What a bunch of bullshit.  Long on assertions, short on sourcing.  This is where I stopped reading:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This is what really distinguished Pizzagate from all of the other child sexual abuse scandals in high places over the past many decades.  It has broken open a prominently configured C.I.A. cell of deeply embed operatives within the international child exploitation business. This particular Pedogate operation is really controlled by the C.I.A., as well as other alphabet soup agencies that no one has even heard of they’re so secret and nefarious in their criminal activity.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Wow... that's pretty secret and nefarious!  Can I get a decoder ring if I sign up for your newsletter?
            <em>
             eyeroll
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is global.  Pedogate is just another name for it.  Pizzagate is the long-overdue investigation into Pedogate which has finally become workable in the info age (although we still lack effective quality control tools, so junk like this article still bedevils us).

            I think I'm going to drop the term pedogate all together. Pizzagate is searched MUCH more and in my opinion means everything that pedogate is and much more. The pizza shows that the elites use codewords to cover their tracks which makes pizzagate more accurate that pedogate. I believe people are trying to split the pizzagate movement so I will stop using pedogate.

            This does not include the notion of Organ and Human Fluid Trafficking that has been exposed by Pizzagate.  The ARTs (assisted reproductive technologies) exploited through the Podesta Lobby group and the 'sauces' used for long life or medical treatments.  These are typically used to force 'blackmail' materials.

             If it is related to John Podesta, then it is connected to Pizzagate and Pedogate in general because Pedogate includes Pizzagate.

              So how does pizzagate fit into Pedogate if Pedogate is about pedophiles and pizzagate includes the genetic ARTs laws and covert use of Crisper-Cas9 technique on DNA and other organ and virus testing.   FBIanon says Benghazi=pizzagate and there were hundreds of children affected with AIDS in liou of vaccine testing,  Dyncorp special.

               PIZZAGATE is the Washington D.C. child trafficking, SRA, pedophile rings used to keep high level politicians in check.
              </p>
              <p>
               PEDOGATE is the Global Child Trafficking business mainly managed by the CIA and other countries' respective Secret Intelligence Agencies, for the Military Industrial Complex and other key Fortune 1000 companies scattered around the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
               If the Pizzagate includes Child Trafficking in Washington D.C. and we all know that organ harvesting is one of the reasons behind the child trafficking in the first place, then that means that Pizzagate is included in the Global Child Trafficking, except that Pedogate is the larger version of Pizzagate.

            Part of the reason people will use #PedoGate over #PizzaGate involves the overt censorship of pizzagate on social media platforms and google. A simple search of pizzagate, where VOAT should dominate the results, reveals zero results for this platform, making it hard to expand our outreach and message to the broader community who have not investigated and who have only been exposed to the LSM lie that pizzagate has been debunked. This thread gives context for google's censorship and a workaround strategy to reach more of the masses:

             Good tactical analysis.  This is the eventuality I've always expected (not PG specifically, just this sort of thing) and one reason I've tried to get people to stop using and saying "google".  Google is not your friend, it's a trap used by your enemy to control you (and everyone else unwary).  The trap is being sprung now.  Sucks, huh?

             There are other tools not run by your enemy.  Use them instead.

              I get your point about the tools we SHOULD use. The challenge is reaching the large swath of the public that uses these censoring tools right now...coming up with ways to reach them with our messages. It does not matter if we use a different web browser or search engine if they do not. We need to be creative to spread the word so that the community does not become closed, with us talking only to ourselves, due to their overt efforts to block our message,

             You raise a very valid point. However, knowing what you know about TPTB, don't you think #Pedogate will also be censored at one point? I think so. I still think we should continue to use the terms we've used so far instead of letting TPTB dictate our behaviour.

              The reason that my post got a negative vote is that CTR knows that this is important. We need to have messages and tags around #PedoGate and #SaveTheKids since they are so effectively blocking pizzagate that much of what we write and post is only seen by those who ALREADY KNOW about pizzagate.

               Just as pedos will need to find new code words for pizza and pasta, and drug dealers keep moving the names to keep ahead of the authorities, pizzagate may have to evolve its name to keep ahead of the censors.

               direction where the investigation can bubble away in its own little bubble.

               Personally, I like pizzagate.  But I note that money laundering may not have moved much form the old mafia trick of the pizza parlor.  Art galleries may be the new pizza.

                It does not discourage me, but my point is very important and relates to your post. While pizzagate is the name and focus of the plaform, people need to realize that the censorship on the term is very effective. Stubbornly saying "we will not be stopped by TPTB from using our term" fails to recognize that not altering our messaging serves to keep our message contained and insulated to the current community...a goal of TPTB. We are playing into their hands if we do not adapt and find other ways to share our message so that it reaches the broader public. Please go to google and enter pizzagate to see for yourself that this search will not bring a single person to this platform because google is literally blocking VOAT from the results on that search. Once you realize this, you will see the actual limitations created if we solely focus on using the preferred term of pizzagate when we try to engage others on social media or other platforms.

                  Again, the issue is not the platform that we, who know about pizzagate, use. The issue involves the general public which is still uninformed, and which uses google, twitter, FB, and YT as primary sources of info. It is irrelevant if WE have moved on from these censored platforms. As long as they dominate in terms of providing info to the public, we need to find ways to get our messages out through these megaphones by adjusting HOW we message. This includes saying that pedogate/pizzagate is non partisan, an evil infecting both sides of the aisle. It is all about the evil of the elites and corrupting those in power so that they can be controlled (a compromise operation).

              My point is that PIZZAGATE is currently heavily censored. Postings with that as the key reference WILL NOT BE SEEN in a google search and will be actively banned or shadow banned on Twitter, FB, and YT. We need to be smart in dodging the censorship to increase reach so that we are not limited to just talking to those who already know about VOAT. Right now, no one who enters "pizzagate" in google will even be exposed to VOAT in the results...it is that extreme. This is part of the reason I started suggesting #SaveTheKids in December as the censorship was already becoming heavy. They will have a hard time blocking #SaveTheKids without a much more major reaction by the public since the agenda will be so transparent.

                Sure. Everyone can come up with some catchy titles, but #SaveTheKids has already developed some traction since many in this community started using it in December and piggyback it onto related posts and threads. It actually summarizes our mission. The HandsOff does not begin to touch how much worse we know things are...not just touching kids and sex but murder, cannibalism, SRA programming. The HandsOff message does not really touch that. #SaveTheKids does cause people to think, "Should I click on this to learn more?"

             I would never ever like to see John Podesta associated with any paternal term. He's so far from what a father should represent. It would also be an insult to all great fathers out there. Skippy would be more appropriate LOL.

            I think this is a pointless distinction, since it's the same fremason/jew dog shit responsible in both cases, and the solution to both problems is the same: Vigilante bullets in the heads of jew and freemason dog shit.

            I like the distinction (local vs. global), but think we should broaden 'the local' a bit.  #pizzagate perhaps should include the pizza/donut shops (and other 'satanic'-appearing eateries) used as fronts (voodoo donuts, Dr. Pong's, Roberta's pizza, little babies ice cream, etc.)

             They should all be included in Pizzagate because they all are connected to Washington D.C. Are they not?

            I believe Pizzagate is as wide spread as Pedogate,.... Pizzagate exposes the sick terms used to describe children, it really has nothing to do with Comet Ping Pong other then Alafantis and his business being one of many involved in these sick crimes against our most innocent and helpless.

            Actually my definition of pizzagate is this:  a set of facts sparked by the Tony pedesta Wikileaks email release, which when followed lead to worldwide pedophila, satanism, human trafficking, CIA manipulation, probably all the way back to the end of WWII...with CIA pulling the strings...now supported by facts from witnesses, survivors, and WikiLeaks disclosures...

             Thank you. I think it's so important to clarify these things as we go along. If we're going to fight this evil together, we desperately need to be aligned in our way of thinking. Imho, uniformity and order should make us grow stronger as a team.

             I agree with your second paragraph.  The problem is that this "Pizzagate is local" stuff is a false explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Merely repeating something doesn't make it true.  Pizzagate began with certain evidence limited to DC and American officials, but quickly revealed much more.  Calling it local is inaccurate.  The activities revealed are international, and so the investigation is too.  Now it seems that a lot of people are eager to define Pizzagate falsely.  That seems strange to me; I could understand shills doing so, but it's not just shills, so clearly there's another motive at play.  Your "same language" motive is certainly a great one, but IMO it doesn't explain why so many of you are willing to falsify the history of the investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is it because this is the explanation offered in article form, so it's easiest to just go along with it?
