            Good information thank you. When our forefathers wrote the constitution of the United States of America they never dreamed that their words freedom of speech would be twisted and changed so that the main stream media could report false news..whats even worse is when they change what someone says by editing out words or leaving out sentences to appear they said something else they are taking away that persons right to freedom of speech. Which is against our constitution and should be punishable by law.  The main stream media and the journalists reporting for them should be held accounbtable. Punished for filling our ears with lies.

             The answer is no one; has the right to determine what your eyes &amp; ears can experience... The problem is, if this becomes blindly accepted by the masses, without so much as a meaningful discussion on the topic, it will over time become the norm. And with that, propaganda itself will take a new form... They key to managing the 'conspiracy theory' and 'truther' community is to create their sources.

            Here's one for you. Did you see Donald Trump's first interview with David Muir? Remember when the women's march was discussed and Trump mentioned the pro-life march and how the press doesn't cover it? ABC later deleted all that from its transcript without any notice of it:

             A great question, that I don't doubt Millions of people would love to know the answer to... In short I would say yes, we can and should enact a petition that is well articulated and meant to oppose these bills.

             I wouldn't be surprised if the CIA created the fake news thing in the first place so they could discredit the real news. This article explains the origins of fake news; it wasn't Macedonian teenagers:

             From the article:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Late 2012, early 2013 I was spending a lot of time researching what is now being referred to as the alt-right. I identified a problem with the news that they were spreading and created Disinfomedia as a response to that. The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly false or fictional stories and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction."

              CIA has been doing this forever. They are just now trying to point fingers away from their propaganda by blaming everyone else for doing it. They created alt-right and right wingers to fight Obama and as a separation tactic...Trump used them to get elected. Check out Operation Mockingbird. It's like Franklin scandal, it comes out and gets very little coverage before being swept under the rug. Then when other scandals bubble to the top, they get even craftier at covering it up....like they are trying to do with the latest version, pizzagate...it doesn't ever just go away. Internet is going to have to be taken down a notch because it's making it harder to cover things up and steal elections with candidates they shove down our throats.

            We all screamed at everyone on twitter on this site, on social media, everywhere to call your Senators to stop it. J. Podesta was even spotted in the office of the bills author on capital hill. Many of us were mocked as were the original pg investigators. This is archived on this sub still many people laughed it off called it another conspiracy. We all hope it is not to late but this one of the last bills Obama signed into law. Our goverment giving itself the power to determine what is fake news.

            This is horseshit.   There are dozens of fake news sites out there that do no reporting and simply make up their "news stories" and this is different from conservative news sites or opinion journalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's one example of how it works.

             Brock bought Blue Nation Review just to put out propaganda for Hillary. Last I checked it died around when the primary was over and he had to buy other ones because the cat was out of the bag.

             The Propornot site listed sites like lewrockwell, zerohedge and ronpaulreport as fake news because of claims of clickbait and misleading headlines.  The term is abused so that it can basically mean "any news source or blog I don't like".  Or course Buzzfeed was all over these claims despite their being more guilty of clickbaity headlines than anyone.  The term has come to be used against anyone the mainstream media considers not to be towing the party line.  If it was just directed against cheap Macedonian websites no one would care.  But it isn't.  It is a war effort against alternative media.

              Exactly. It should not matter who wins an election the government does not in the US get to censor speech. That is what separates us from others. We can debate on ideas. Now we know the congress was willing to write into law language that could impact free speech. This at a time when the population was being told so much information from MSM that we now know was blatantly False and the internet sites were literally scrubbed of content. Serious journalists and concerned citizens went from forum to forum to get the truth. 
Zuckerberg started saying "Fake News" the same day Obama did... then scrubbing the sites. Then the Pope said likened "Fake News" to sin involving excrement. Find the video.

              Why would these people, media, Hollywood go to such extreme lengths?
To pull off the biggest cover up of all time. They each chose along the way to keep going knowing this was all under the surface. The trafficking of children and arms, oil, money&amp; organs. 
They have lied and are exposed. Why are they fighting and rioting still? They do not want anyone to look at this reality.

             Satire news has been around since News itself.. Trolling is in human nature, that's undeniable. Are you claiming all of the sudden this thing called "Fake News" is a real problem? All of the sudden, you would justify stripping us of absolute free speech in the most used online environments? What about freedom to view what ever it is you'd like.... So you're telling me Fake news is such a real problem that we need national anti-propaganda institutions that don't only discern real news &amp; 'fact check', but actually regulate your news feed and Google searches... So you're totally fine with FaceBook &amp; Google openly admitting to going China on you? Either you haven't done the research, or you have and your just shilling.
