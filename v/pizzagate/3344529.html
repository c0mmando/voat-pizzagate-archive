<p>According to the two JetSmarter members, who both have lawsuits pending against the company, the FBI and a prosecutor from the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida interviewed them for more than two hours last month. The investigators asked about JetSmarter’s sales practices, their communications with members, contract details, the names of salespeople and the types of passengers who flew on JetSmarter flights.</p>
<p>They also told the members that the interview was part of an “active investigation” that included ongoing interviews with other JetSmarter customers...<strong>The questions follow a CNBC report in January detailing JetSmarter’s financial losses, lawsuits and concerns about security and drugs on JetSmarter flights</strong>.

             "The founder and CEO, Sergey Petrossov, 30, is the son of Vatchagan Petrossov, who served 15 years in Russian prisons, according to Robert Friedman’s “Red Mafiya,” published by Little, Brown in 2000.
Vatchagan settled in Denver, where he opened a restaurant popular with Russian expats. Vyacheslav Ivankov, a.k.a. Yaponchik, who’s been called the John Gotti of the Russian mob and once had a crew of 100 soldiers in Brighton Beach, “frequently traveled to Denver, where he stayed at Petrossov’s home, even using his address to apply for a Colorado driver’s license,” the book reported. “Ivankov and Vatchagan Petrossov were so close that Petrossov named Ivankov godfather to one of his two sons.”"

            <p>
             "Other issues have arisen for the 7-year-old company. Its former president, Edward Gennady Barsky, resigned in 2017, a week after being arrested on charges of embezzling $11 million from a California real-estate investment company. Barsky was indicted by a Contra Costa County jury in June 2017 on five counts of grand theft. He pleaded not guilty and is free on bond."

             "He did a lot before establishing JetSmarter as well. He helped establish a couple of Information Technology (IT) concepts. He was part of a portal that catered to schools that revolved around the Russian language. He was part of an Internet chatting network that accommodated customer service requirements in the e-commerce sector, too."

             "The crew at JetSmarter is made up of advisory, management, and technology professionals. These individuals have done a lot for all sorts of prominent names, too. Examples of these are Uber, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Microsoft, Nokia and, last but definitely not least, NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration)."
