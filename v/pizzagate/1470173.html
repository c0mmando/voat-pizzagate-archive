Continue to use their social media to spread info but at the same time mirror all the info on other uncensored social media platforms so there is a pizzagate presence on every form of social media.

            Well, you can't comment on Youtube without a google account, as far as I know. But yes, I wouldn't use it for primary email purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            By now, everyone knows about gab.ai. However, people who value free speech will need to find a new home for videos. The company ties and ownership should be vetted, and the platform needs to be capable - with full embedding capabilities. Optimally it would have ability to link gab comments, or something like that. It would also be nice to get a promise that they will not force users to display their real names at any time in the future, and would fight against such a thing if it were pushed by law. If there isn't such a place, perhaps we can persuade some folks to make one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Above all, I think we need a place to collaborate in a bit of privacy. Voat has been decent in removing shills, but there's some pretty crafty guys out there who try and steer people off course. Some have mentioned a need for an "open intelligence agency". I very much like the idea, though it probably shouldn't be completely open, if you get my drift. Some embedded tools could help as well. For example, mind mapping, archiving of websites, a full blown relational database on known people and organizations, and perhaps an automated news scraper to get the latest on potential targets. Maybe even a system that connects up with State and Federal databases to provide critical data that we'd usually have to go through a gatekeeper to get. With such a system, even novice investigative journalists could create very well sourced articles that the media cannot refute or dismiss. A good picture archive might help in meme warfare, and let us rely less on google images...

             Wow, great points... thats what i was looking for. Yea i forgot you cant comment without a google account, damn thats how they get you trapped. Ive never trusted gmail so i dont actually have an account with them.  Ive never been on any social media actually because i dont trust them and VOAT was the first site ive seen in a long time that didnt ask for my email address to sign up. Really they shouldnt need it. Same with email services. The pic archive is another great idea, i think as long as we have to rely on big google for everything we will constantly be subject to their bullying tactics. Hopefully more people can figure out how to ditch them for other services. They treat us like crap so they shouldnt get our business... whatever that business is.
Do you know of any good free email services you can recommend?

              Plenty of free email services out there, but I personally wouldn't recommend any. You get what you pay for. I don't know of any that don't at least scan your emails for advertising purposes. I'm sure most have made deals with NSA to make copies of your emails for investigative purposes.

            I'd not share any you know legit yet, not til Trump is in. Those that know of the newer ones, or those not listed that don't censor already know. They may collect the names easily. We can message those we trust to sites if really needed.
