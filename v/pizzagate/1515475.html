            It's irrelevant for the investigation, though I'm sure some idiots will try to use it to "debunk" in their own minds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recall this recent idiot:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1510644">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1510644

           </p>
           <p>
            Who came here to inform us that because some of what Marina Abramovic calls "spirit cooking" doesn't involve blatantly disturbing content, that therefore the blatantly disturbing content isn't actually "spirit cooking" (in a nutshell, their illogical argument was difficult to follow).
           </p>
           <p>
            The way it works for the truly retarded among the skeptics is basically like this:
            <em>
             if apples are a type of a fruit, and peaches are a type fruit, then that means apples are not a type of fruit, because peaches are the real fruit
            </em>
            (again it's hard to follow because it's retarded, but that is how they at least pretend to think).
           </p>
           <p>
            So with the Heavy Breathing / Majestic Ape stuff, retarded skeptics will ignore the content that includes or is about children, whether it is the art, the lyrics or Mr "we all have our preferences" and so on, and instead focus on the content that doesn't include children to try to make the case that therefore
            <em>
             none
            </em>
            of it does.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I specify retarded skeptics, because constructive skeptics are very helpful and welcomed.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I'm sure some of the retarded ones will use such videos to be like, "See, it's not about kids" while ignoring the content that clearly is.

             if you're trying to characterize me as "apostate", forget it. you bullshite is borderline abusive, and yet I'll bet you haven't even watched the video.
            </p>
            <p>
             for starters: the VAST MAJORITY (I'll use caps as I please thank you) of pederasts and such self-identify as hetero-normative. now what TENDS to happen in the public eye, is some paedo-inclined fag-boy like Alefantis primps and preens for paedo rights - much as with NAMBLA, which accomplishes 2 things:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              Takes "heat" away from the supposed hetero-norms, who are then free to pursue their paedo delights regardless of victim preference.
             </li>
             <li>
              Creates unnecessary friction within the gay community itself (by making "gays" the straw man), many of whom are victims and survivors of these same paedo creeps.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             So yeah, it "confuses the issue" as you suggest, but you're missing the point. That IS the point, and it's why this kind of crap is produced, to confuse the public.
            </p>
            <p>
             Examining the evidence is NOT confusing the issue. Get a grip or find another thread to lurk in, I could care less.
            </p>
            <p>
             And if you THINK for one tiny shitty moment that "spirit cooking" recipes involving human placenta, menstrual blood and semen are "all innocent and artsy", well then you're definitely part of the problem: big mouth, oral fixation, small mind.
