<p>The general judgment I received was that there was too much specificity. The test not only had hidden directory results but also &quot;Custom extensions, Common configuration files, Configuration files, Source code files, Archives, Database files, Logs, Backup files, Documents, and Web files&quot;.
(as declared by jackthebutholeripper). And I get that, I do.</p>
<p>So here\'s the thing, I had only 50 points left. That\'s the way pentest-tools does things. I used it to do another scan on bucksfishingandcamping.com (I chose this and not cpp because this is where the password protected section was allegedly found) and this time, I deselected all the other options and only wanted the test to detect directories. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/395817927/URL-Fuzzer-https-Www-bucksfishingandcamping-com-ONLY-DIRECTORIES">Here are the results.</a> </p>
<p>Doing this, results went down from 1100 to 200. But we still have interesting results for a small domain (we\'re talking 5 links here) such as:</p>
<p>/benefits</p>
<p>/delicious</p>
<p>/feeds</p>
<p>/lsold/</p>
<p>/memberlist (10 of these with varying names)</p>
<p>No /military, /iraq.bat, /asia, /jacob, /anal.java, /military etc.- <strong>I\'m sorry but I still don\'t believe these were default squarespace or java pieces, wouldn\'t a quick google search confirm this?</strong> </p>
<p>What I\'m taking away from all of this is, even if we cannot get to what was once there, this is like a footprint. Now I know the directories I mentioned came from Comet Ping Pong\'s website but we are talking about a <strong>pizza place</strong> here. There is no reason to have a directory called <strong>asia</strong> or <strong>military</strong> connected to your website. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Anyway, now onto the new stuff.</strong> First off, if what I\'m about to post is not allowed for whatever reason, let me know and off it goes.</p>
<p>Another testing website and another experiment. <strong><a href="https://dehashed.com/">Dehashed.com</a></strong></p>
<p>A website where they compile all the dumps that they can find and put it into one place. Late nights of searching and surfing led me here. </p>
<p>Searching for BucksFishingandCamping brings me no hits. Searching for James Alefantis doesn\'t really bring me anything either.</p>
<p><strong>But searching for Comet Ping Pong brings me a couple of things.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/St5Hqor">We have a dropbox - cometpingpong@gmail.com - pass is bigcheese5</a></p>
<p><a href="[https://imgur.com/a/Et8xGei](https://imgur.com/a/Et8xGei)">We also have a yahoo email account - cometpingpong@yahoo.com - pass is 4greenwood
</a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/E5HLCAr">The most interesting thing is we also have a Zoosk account</a>.</strong> Zoosk is a pay to play dating app. (After the first message to the person you\'re attracted to, you have to pay to contact them any further.) </p>
<p>The username for the account is supposedly cometpingpong. </p>
<p>The email address connected to the account is janetjimenez@earthlink.net. I don\'t think we\'ve ever heard of a Janet Jimenez before. When dehased using a free online tool, the password is/was tootie.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that\'s where it ends for now. I\'m not up to try and get into the accounts with the passwords given. They might work or they\'ve might been changed when all of this originally broke.</p>
<p><strong>But I will leave one thing for all of us to chew on:</strong></p>
<p>Zoosk -&gt; the dating app</p>
<p>tootie -&gt; the password that once belonged to the zoosk account</p>

            Tsk tsk silly tin foil hat wearers. You guys are sad. First of all, Pizzagate was debunked over a year ago. Mr. Alefantis even appeared on numerous media outlets and even Faux News and even your beloved Faux News debunked it. Repeat after me, there is no basement at CPP, there isn't or has never been, children being abused in any way on any of Mr. Alefantis' properties or by him, and fake news hurts real people. You people need to get a life.

            Our sauce means plural. 10 tons is a lot! That is like saying he is a supplier. Can them all, like being in the can (jail). The basement means our basement. It is a we thing.

            A+++ Appreciate any effort to keep sicko #49 James Alefantis-related shit alive and back on page one. Hate to think he’s still slithering around in public. Empty words, I know, but I’m still watching when I can, and hope I’ll find a way to contribute to his demise. I support all of you who work at it. Continued Godspeed.

            Have tried to google the symbolism of the circle from the ancient mystery schools. Unable to find it on the internet...but have read an author Cyndi Dale, who is a shaman....instructs in one of her books on how concentrating on say, a square, or a triangle affects   your life. Mystery school teaching is very important to satanists and freemasons....another thing that is important to them are ley lines. It is hard to find a good map with them on it..They are the electrical system of the planet. Cathedrals and military installations like to build where they intersect for extra power. And I will bet they are important to where people like Alifantis and Podesta to do their dirty work. Think DC itself might be an important one...Thomas Jefferson, who has been mentioned as illuminati , built his house where two ley lines intersected. Nuke facility Minot ND. Same thing.

             Without the debt system they have no power..
All this ley lines are highways for dusmembered spirits..ie idiots caught in limbo who r obsessed with human energies...they have no power...what they do have is ways to trick the fools who fall for their idiocy..
The spirits increasingly ask the fools to do more sociopathic tasks...which is also essential for the debt system...more debt begets debt...
We can undo the debt systrm with agreeing to stop lending our credit to bwnks and destroy credit at the debt reduction department of the US...
This is the remedy we all have of turning them and their book keeeping system into our debtors..
They have to follow our instructions...
The work is done ..it is finished...
We dont have to rely on the debt system whrn we can destroy it by reducibg debt ...
Google : surety rights
            </p>
            <p>
             Spirits have no power..except of fooling sociopaths into more sociopathy...
            </p>
            <p>
             Therr is a lot to understand but stay away from advertising the mysteries ...it only gets power in the debt ssystem..death begets debt begets debt ...
            </p>
            <p>
             The solution is simple to undo their machinations ..just reduce debt at the treasury

            Remember Cesar Sayoc the guy that supposedly sent those packages to Democrats?  He worked at a pizza place in Fla. and there was a bigcheeseLLC connection to that pizza place.  I am searching for it now.  Someone posted it in the comments.  New River Pizza &amp; Fresh Kitchen     I found this PDF  but don't know how to copy.

            ...  This appeared below the link to the PDF  in the copy it stated a connection of Alefantis to Big Cheese LLC.

              It was there and now gone.  Today I found it again but am lousy at archive.  Now it has disappeared again.  Who's doing this?  Super Fishy imo.

              I saw it.  Never been more sure of anything.  It also had a place you could click on states, etc. and it listed who was with Big Cheese LLC in that state.  If you clicked on DC well James Alefantis came up and his agent.  Dang can't remember his name Jack something I think.    Checking some more right now.

             That's one that I don't buy and I said at the time that it was revealed that it could simply be the use of the same phrase, "Big Cheese" as in, I'm the top dog, the head honcho, the big cheese, i.e; the boss.

               Yeah but it doesn't mean that it has anything to do with Alefantis or Pizzagate. I think that was just a lazy case of trying to link multiple conspiracies together. In reality they would likely keep them
               <em>
                very
               </em>
               separate otherwise it'd be easier to crack the case and bring it all down.

            Could represent a pair of eyes, or it’s a Joo thing. Probably a good symbolism dig.
