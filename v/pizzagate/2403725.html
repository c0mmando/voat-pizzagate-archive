The snuff film of the brutal gang rape and torture of an 8 year old boy who died on camera and multiple child porn and snuff film production places ran by Warwick Spinks. He would throw elite pedophile parties. This particular snuff film was shot at a gay brothel in Amsterdam called the Blue Boys club. The tape is called the Bjorn Tape. I found a forum from 2001 talking about the Blue Boys club here. The guy who produced it made other snuff films as well. Warwick Spinks is his name. He was caught in 2012 after an international manhunt. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234679/Britains-wanted-paedophile-Warren-Spinks-kidnapped-sold-young-boys-abuse-finally-caught-15-years-run.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234679/Britains-wanted-paedophile-Warren-Spinks-kidnapped-sold-young-boys-abuse-finally-caught-15-years-run.html</a> The MP and other elites are not named or even mentioned in this article but in The Suns article. So there were elite torture and snuff pedophile rings being run out of Blue Boys Club and at Elm Guest House in London. Celebrities, Politicians and other elite would use Elm Guest House as a child rape ring. Found a few old forums talking about these locations to rape boys with multiple countries and multiple Hotel chains, clubs and businesses mentioned.</p>
<p>From The Sun:</p>
<p>DETECTIVES probing the Westminster paedophile ring are investigating bombshell
evidence that an MP was involved in the murder of a child in a snuff movie.</p>
<p>A young boy sold for sex is said to have died in a torture session filmed at
Amsterdam’s notorious Blue Boy vice club.</p>
<p>Allegations that the unnamed MP was present can be revealed today. The claims
mean police are now investigating FOUR child murders linked to the alleged
abuse ring.</p>
<p>Informants said the MP was present at the murder after going to Holland for
sex with boys supplied by paedo fixer Warwick Spinks.</p>
<p>Boys were allegedly taken to the guest house in Barnes, South-West London, and
Dolphin Square flats near Westminster, to have sex with VIPs and MPs
including Cyril Smith.</p>
<p>Yesterday it emerged that police who investigated Spinks in the 1990s were
told a boy had died at the club while the MP was present.</p>
<p>A source said: “Officers were told Spinks knew the MP and arranged a tour to
Amsterdam. While there he went to the Blue Boy bar, where Spinks was running
a brothel.</p>
<p>“The MP was said to have been present when a boy died during an orgy which was
being filmed. The information was not confirmed and the MP’s identity never
surfaced.</p>
<p>“However, clear evidence that boys were tortured was discovered.”</p>
<p>Spinks was jailed in 1995 for sex offences, including abducting a boy of 14
and taking him to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Evidence from the Spinks investigation is now being analysed by the Met’s
three-pronged probe into networks of VIP paedophiles.</p>
<p>The team are already probing three other alleged child murders, one by a Tory
MP.</p>
<p>The families of two boys believed to have been murdered by Sidney Cooke’s
paedophile gang are also urging police to investigate possible links to the
VIP ring.</p>
<p>Police were last night accused of covering up claims that a senior MP abused a
boy at a gay brothel.</p>
<p>The victim is said to have named the MP when interviewed by detectives probing
claims of abuse at the Elm Guest House in the 1980s.</p>
<p>But his claim — heard by a social worker — was allegedly left out of his
statement after Special Branch or MI5 intervened to protect the MP.</p>

From 2001 talking about Blue boys brothel</p>
<p>I was very saddened to learn in the reviews today that the BlueBoy Club/WhyNot? in Amsterdam has closed. It was a true boys brothel -- and, I believe will be sorely missed. I had several very good times there when visiting Amsterdam -- the shows were always sexy and hot, and the boys were always friendly and without attitude (at least that was my experience). The bartenders were all friendly and helpful -- and no one was &quot;pushy&quot;...</p>
<p>So many great sex venues are disappearing all over the world!</p>
<p>Another comment makes this remark:</p>
<p>There\'s another place you may like to try: Club 21, and you can find it at the Spuistraat 21 (= same street as the back entrance of the Blueboy). It\'s a 5 minutes walk from where Blueboy used to be. I\'ve been there a few times (showing clients around), and I found that the atmosphere always was nicer than at Blueboy.</p>
<p>Regards, Anton.</p>
<p>Read the Google reviews of Boys Club 21.</p>
<p>&quot;Is an Escort Club for gay people where you can rent a boy for sex they have upstairs rooms,and also a bar with music and striptease shows is the single one left in Amsterdam witch does that legally !!!&quot;</p>
<p>(from 2000) Another forum talking about Blue Boys </p>
<p><a href="https://www.message-forum.net/threads/why-not-blue-boy-in-amsterdam.59084/">https://www.message-forum.net/threads/why-not-blue-boy-in-amsterdam.59084/</a></p>
<p>Information on Blue Boys pedophile ring here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nickdavies.net/1997/03/01/a-paedophile-ring-in-amsterdam/">http://www.nickdavies.net/1997/03/01/a-paedophile-ring-in-amsterdam/</a></p>
<p>&quot;They were going to Amsterdam, to Spuistraat, to a club called the Blue Boy, where Spinks quite simply was going to sell him.</p>
<p>&quot;In Tuesday’s programme, Edward describes the children he says he saw in all five videos. “There was a boy with sallow skin and brown hair, brown eyes, which is unusual for Amsterdam. I’ve no idea where they got him from. There were two blond-haired boys and a strawberry blond boy, and a boy with a very distinctive haircut. It was shaved over both ears, with a loop and a parting down the middle.” Edward says he couldn’t tell their nationality: “They cried and screamed a lot. They did cry out, but I don’t know what language they were crying out in.&quot;</p>
<p>Another forum talking about where to get boys.

On the gay houses of boys in Germany, check [<a href="http://www.erados.com/">http://www.erados.com/</a>]</p>
<p>They have the correct addresses and sites for some German places and a few others.</p>
<p>My best house of boys experience was in Frankfort back 3 or 4 years ago when there were 4 all within walking distance. The best would be Playground. In Berlin there is Club 96, called CC69, see also www.cc96.de. Its near the city centre.</p>

<p>(mentions another hotel website. &quot;Hotel Citadel&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hotel Citadel is a small but functional place near Central Station. There are a lot of small hotels to stay in around this area. Also, near Central Station and of course near the &quot;houses w/boys&quot;, The Black Tulip is a <a href="https://voat.co/s/M">S/M</a> bed &amp; breakfast with lots of equipment in each room. 
Both of these are near Why Not?&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hotelcitadel.nl/">https://www.hotelcitadel.nl/</a></p>
<p>along with </p>
<p>The three main boy brothels in Amsterdam are all very close to each other at the top of Spuistraat, close to the central station.
There are lots of hotels near by.</p>
<p>More hotel chains mentioned in the comments.</p>
<p>The Holiday Inn  Crowne Plaza, the Inntel and the Renaissance Amsterdam are all <em>very</em> close (you can see the &quot;Why Not&quot; bar from the entrance to the Crowne Plaza ...).</p>
<p>Slightly further away (but still only a 3 or 4 minute walk) is the Barbizon Palace, which I think is a much nicer hotel.
You should be able to get weekend rates of about 350 guilders a night for any of these hotels.</p>
<p>There is also a Golden Tulip hotel further down Spuistraat that is a bit cheaper - weekend rates there are probably between 225 and 300 guilders.https://www.message-forum.net/threads/europe-houses-of-boys-saunas-with-boys.59198/</p>',

           From 2001 talking about Blue boys brothel
          </p>
          <p>
           I was very saddened to learn in the reviews today that the BlueBoy Club/WhyNot? in Amsterdam has closed. It was a true boys brothel -- and, I believe will be sorely missed. I had several very good times there when visiting Amsterdam -- the shows were always sexy and hot, and the boys were always friendly and without attitude (at least that was my experience). The bartenders were all friendly and helpful -- and no one was "pushy"...
          </p>
          <p>
           So many great sex venues are disappearing all over the world!
          </p>
          <p>
           Another comment makes this remark:
          </p>
          <p>
           There's another place you may like to try: Club 21, and you can find it at the Spuistraat 21 (= same street as the back entrance of the Blueboy). It's a 5 minutes walk from where Blueboy used to be. I've been there a few times (showing clients around), and I found that the atmosphere always was nicer than at Blueboy.

          </p>
          <p>
           "In Tuesday’s programme, Edward describes the children he says he saw in all five videos. “There was a boy with sallow skin and brown hair, brown eyes, which is unusual for Amsterdam. I’ve no idea where they got him from. There were two blond-haired boys and a strawberry blond boy, and a boy with a very distinctive haircut. It was shaved over both ears, with a loop and a parting down the middle.” Edward says he couldn’t tell their nationality: “They cried and screamed a lot. They did cry out, but I don’t know what language they were crying out in."

           My best house of boys experience was in Frankfort back 3 or 4 years ago when there were 4 all within walking distance. The best would be Playground. In Berlin there is Club 96, called CC69, see also www.cc96.de. Its near the city centre.

           <em>
            very
           </em>
           close (you can see the "Why Not" bar from the entrance to the Crowne Plaza ...).
          </p>
          <p>
           Slightly further away (but still only a 3 or 4 minute walk) is the Barbizon Palace, which I think is a much nicer hotel.
You should be able to get weekend rates of about 350 guilders a night for any of these hotels.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is also a Golden Tulip hotel further down Spuistraat that is a bit cheaper - weekend rates there are probably between 225 and 300 guilders.https://www.message-forum.net/threads/europe-houses-of-boys-saunas-with-boys.59198/

            You'll see a comment about how Spinks has been living in Prage, Czech Republic, since he was sprung from jail in 2013, and living under the alias Willem van Wijk. Other people have made exactly the same claim.

            He has always been making money organizing trips for pedophiles to travel to foreign countries and molest boys.

            The location is right (Prague) and the age (53) is Warwicjk Spinks's current age.

           <p>
            Is there anybody in Europe who could look into this further?

            The abuser was first investigated in 1992, after police suspected he had links with paedophile rings in the UK and Europe.  
He acted as a 'fixer' in Amsterdam, the Sunday People reports, where he introduced sex tourists looking for underage boys.
           </p>
           <p>
            He told undercover officers from the Metropolitan and Dutch police he could pick up young boys from German, Prague and Poland for as little as 10p.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was also caught on secret camera offering to supply a video in which a 10 year old boy was killed and one featuring the horrific abuse of a young boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Spinks was sentenced in 1995 at Lewes Crown Court for a string of offences against under-age boys, the court heard how he drugged a 14 year old boy and 'sold him' to a gay brothel in Amsterdam.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Later he informs the police about the secret stash and on 28 June they return to the flat, carry out a thorough search, and find computer records under the floorboards, including a list of 300 names which is said to amount to an international Who's Who of suspected paedophiles. It includes Warwick Spinks, who was released from prison in Britain last July after being convicted of drugging and kidnapping a 14-year-old boy, and is now believed to be in Prague, and Lothar Gandolf, a notorious German paedophile.

            This monster is fucking horrifying. This is the kind of person we need to hunt and track because he is no doubt out there doing this again, that’s all he knows. Please see this info posted in 2017 on another forum from someone who claimed to be a former abuse victim:
           </p>
           <p>
            Warren spinks used other aliases including john Williams where he passed off himself as a church organist and is linked loosely federated to the Chichester child abuse rings within the church of England.It is a Li that Spinks hid for 15years in the Czech republic: He entered UK regularly on fake passports and was spotted in Hastings on numerous occasions…the hometown of zHomeSecretary Amber Rudd,ironically considering PM May started the iicsa enquiry. Not only has Spinks admitted supplying boys to parties at Elm house, he was witnessed selling a video of French children abused by a man in priests garb.If you want to do some good lobby both the French press and Judicial system,for exploitation of French children.You can guarantee the UK police and Amber Rudd have neither informed the French police of a witness against Spinks in relation to his exploitation of young French children being abused.pleade lobby every patent because while he is free each child in uka d abroad is at risk.Spinks also had connections in the child support agency where they could use the government income support database to trace children who had been moved away…all they needed to do was transfer departments to get access to the “alphasplit”(a to z section)and type a similar name ir birthday.That’s 20,000 children endangered in 1999-2007ish….the system has since randomised accounts. Please lobby UK parents to hold enquiry into CSA and links to Spinks.in addition, another abuser linked to Spinks and torture supplied youngsters at parties also attended by Rev Cotton, and linked to Pritchard..it is this ring that Chichesters last Bishop covered up, and the current Chichester Bishop has covered up up the harassment of a witness (BBC reporter aware).

            Good God!  Does anyone know what is the Big Kick these Sick Scumbag Pedos get from seeing a child die after someone has sex with them?  I can't even get it.  Where does that come from in their brains?  How do they get to that point.  Is it boredom with all the other sick acts they have viewed?  Idk.  I just can't get it.  This to me is the Ultimate Degenerate Pedo.  Can a person that starts out killing small defenseless little animals graduate to this level.?  I would like to know.  If we can understand some of this.......Also, some of these children in the Blue Boys Club were sold off by whom?  Parents.  Lock them up.  They do not get out. Ever.  My thinking is this Blue Boys Club comes from Blue Blood terms.  Blue Bloods are thought to be the very best.  More Sickness.

              Just wanted to include this part about Blue Bloods and it will make you laugh.  I could not stop laughing.  Just about all of the European Royal families have the RH Negative (Rhesus Monkey Factor Negative, RH-) blood with a high degree of “O” type blood.  Prince Charles, for example is RH-type O (
              <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazin...">
               http://www.time.com/time/magazin...)
              </a>
              ).  Thus we can establish that there is a unique blood type for Royal nobility. The distribution of RH-blood is less than 5% in total world population.  THE ROYALS ARE BLEEPING MONKEYS!!!   BWABWABWABWABWABWABWA!!!   I am sorry I could not help it.

              It means like the Royals.  There is a term that some use for them.  I should look up why or where that came from.  Whenever I hear the term Blue Bloods, I think of the Royals.  This is a VERY good article:Most recorded history state the term Blue Blood originated in 1834 in Spain with Royal families that made a claim of Visigothic decent (
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nob...">
               http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nob...)
              </a>
              ).  However this simply is not the case. Version of this term and observations along with art from periods as far back as 2500 BCE confirm similar terms were in use. There is a however a clear case that the Basque people of Spain and France have the highest concentration of RH- blood at this point.

              As Violent a Thought that is, I am moving towards that same thinking.  Sometimes Heinous Acts require Heinous Punishment.  I just hate the thought of it.  But when you think of it, those Horrid CP sex videos are sometimes broadcasted to many at one time.  An audience.  So why not an audience if one wants to view the death of a Sick Pedo Murderer.  But somehow, I am afraid this may get out of hand.

               you guys speak sanity as always. bring back public hangings. Forget going to see the latest movie; Ill happily whoop and holler at some good ole rope and bucket action. If and when they ever find out who contributed to HoR's death, I will also be the one volunteering to do the deed. Well, you know I'm crying again Carm :(

            MI-5 and Interpol cover all this shit up they are paid a lot of money by the elite to cover it up we need to send US Speial Forces teams to abduct every bastard who tortured these boys take them to Gitmo and torture them to death they must be punished the same way they tortured these poor boys. Disgusting that they have gotten away with these crimes.

            Always the gay escapades. I remember watching the movie Irreversible - and at the begining of the film it depicts a gay dungeon and the depravity that goes on. Somehow homosexuality / sado-masochism and pedophilia/child torture/snuff are interlinked. (My humble apologies to all the gay folk who have nothing to do with this) My sister is a DJ here in gay capital Sydney Australia and she knows the gay scene and tells me some shocking stories. Mind you many of the gay folk that I know are just regular guys who are into men (not kids) but we have to note that pedophilia and snuff seems to rise its ugly head in homsexual communities more often than not (Plenty of Heterosexuals are into degenerate stuff also) .

            Note the blonde haired boy in the Bjorn tape didn't die. He's alive. He was drugged and raped, this can been seen or hinted at on the BBC doc. But he did survive and is still alive, worked as a male prostitute for a while.

              Ty, important to verify facts. Yes I know he's produced snuff for Arabs and Japanese elites. The collapse of the Soviet Union brought him and his friends lots of new opportunities. The snuff were filmed in East Germany, most of the kids from Poland and former Soviet  Bloc. Spinks is free.

            UK here. Investigated Spinks and the 'Dirty Dozen' for years. There's a reason he (Spinks) didn't do hard time and Cooke, didn't serve long either. BBC doc 'Boy Business' is an eye opener for those who think such things are conspiracy theories.

             This does not surprise me one bit.  Wonder if CR was offed.  Were his activities going to be outed which would draw attention to some of these Clubs?  EJ is such a Pedo.  So obvious it Reeks.  Two little boys. Think about it.

               He makes me sick.  When I think of him and his pedo man who ordered their two boys as out of a vending machine, it turns my stomach.  They heralded this procedure as a new found wonder for the poor women that could not give birth, but their real plan was to allow their pedo friends order children for their own amusement.  Vile Pervert Scumbags.

             Mod pet makes daily references to infamous "research." Never produces infamous research. Mod pet tries to create an illusion of being a "researcher." Mod pet full of shit. Posting a crumb once in a while is not "research." You are full of shit.

            Jesus. No wonder they want depressed kids to be able to opt for euthanasia. What a shitshow. I'm going to give this a "Share!" flair. I think Americans will believe this is happening in Europe. And from there, it's just one small step to the fullness of the truth.

             Indeed it is. People need to see that this underground culture of sickness exists and these monsters slipped up. We now know several major Hotel and Resort chains child trafficking boys if what these sickos are saying is right and most likely girls as well. These Resorts need to be looked into if their prostituting children and there has to be more of these slip ups on forums from the past.

            Pray for the UK. It’s unreal, hard to imagine how much has been exposed there, with little effect. Pray for hearts to change.
