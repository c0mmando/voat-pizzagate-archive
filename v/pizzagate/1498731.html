            Yea I am a bit surprised noone is talking about south korea either, it's huge for what we are trying to accomplish here. But I guess the media is just doing as told right now. We have to stop just labeling it as crazy. The clinton foundation is actively being investigated and their corruption is world wide. Haiti is a weakness I don't think we are able to get enough info on with just the internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact it's happening everywhere should be waking people up but some just can't imagine life being grand or complicated. Or that people might just actually have a sick enjoyment out of hurting and murdering kids.

            don't get me wrong,, i agree with what you're saying. Yew tree stopped cold when it hit politicians/royalty... but what i'm saying is the public here are a bit further ahead in getting over the cognitive dissonance and can help the yanks. When i moved to the uk Savile was alive and i remember seeing him on telly and saying 'pedo alert',, my gf nearly took my head off. Got proper pissed off cuz he was a hero to her as a kid,,, when that all fell apart it opened the door. You look at the footie scandal recently and there's hardly a reaction to the fact that some 'well respected' people have been caught out. The UK's not all honest yet but you can still get headlines like this
            <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10953043/20-establishment-figures-in-elite-paedophile-ring.html">

            something that isn't happening in the states,,, right now the public who are bringing this up are still getting laughed at like I they're nutters.  Like I said,, we've got to think globally,,,,, I know if you tried to say the queen was involved in a satanic ring you'd be laughed at like you where david icke,, but if you said that to a south korean right now you'd probably be believed,,, am i makin sense?? it is late an should probably get some sleep lol

            Yep the UK media is awful. And far too many Brits buy into it, and think that the Royal family are lovely, and that Jeremy Corbyn is bad news but Thersa May is wonderful, completely ignoring the fact that the media only hate on him because he's anti establishment and actually cares about actual citizens and not about wealth and power, and they forget that May brought in the most draconian internet spying laws for any so-called democratic country ever and that she's instrumental in the establishment 'historic' child abuse inquiry cover up.
           </p>
           <p>
            It just goes to show how nonsensical the right-left dichotomy is, when over in the UK they've got the anti establishment politician that the media smear at every opportunity being called an extremist leftist, while the right wing government is called 'moderate' and sensible. And in the US you've got the opposite, with the anti establishment politician being smeared as an extremist right winger, and the leftist government being pushed as the sensible moderate option.
           </p>
           <p>
            Right and left mean nothing anymore, it's just Us and Them now.

             ok probly didn't get my point across well enough,, I'm not sayin uk msm is any good,, msm anywhere is geared to protect the pedo's. What I mean is the PUBLIC is further ahead in accepting this is a real problem...  if the UK msm tried to say the footie sex scandal was fake news the public wouldn't let them.... but again I think we're drifting from my point,,, add the South Korean story. There are  millions of people in south korea now that are aware that their political elite are involved in Satanic shit.... so yeah UK isn't gonna lead the charge  but if we work and think globally we can get a lot farther than if we leave each other compartmentalized,, which allows our local control agents ie msm to manage the situation...

            key has got to be not letting pizzagate be an american issue,,, it's easier for american msm to shut it down as fake news. UK and Europe have had much greater success in exposing the elite pedo power network,, once we make sure we join forces and expose it as an international problem we'll have more success.
           </p>
           <p>
            they can't use the fake news meme in the uk after the savile scandal,,,, while american's were just being introduced to the idea we've had a huge scandal breaking in the UK in football [soccer for you yanks lol]. They can't even attempt to cover that as the public here are already over the cognitive dissonance. There are big names being exposed,,, people who have been considered hero's to joe public being outed as monsters and they can't stop it because the public aren't going to help them by doing the whole 'oh that's just crazy talk' stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            American's need to do make sure they're forcing the narrative to include the international stuff cuz it's all connected. That Norwegian bust went right to the top,,, and what about south korea,,, same time we've all been mulling over secret codes in podesta emails there have been MILLIONS of south Korean's marching to oust there president who has been busted being involved in a SATANIC cult...
           </p>
           <p>
            if you keep things compartmentalized it's easy for the likes of meghan kelly to laugh off the idea of prominent politicians being involved in something as sick as an elite satanic pedo network but it ain't so silly when you start looking at the issue globally!!

              ok,,, now keep in mind the comments above. I'm gonna post a BBC link which the lads above will let you know is actively gonna try and minimize this story [calling it shamanic instead of satanic] but I've got some mates in Korea and it's not nearly as tame as this article implies. Just look at the photo's of the massive amount of people who marched to oust the president.

              to be fair though,,,you coulda googled that yourself. It's not MY source, if you're interested just look it up, the more non msm articles are better imho but I didn't want to put up something from a source you didn't recognize. Better yet check out a korean source,,,,

                mate,, it's half two in the morning here.. what are you trying to achieve with your snide ass comments. The BBC article calls it a Shamanic cult,, I can try and dig out the article that talked about it being a demonic possession thing but it's late and i'm not your bitch. The point I was making was that there is this kinda stuff happening globally and if we worked together and looked at things from an international perspective we'd get further in trying to rid the ourselves of this problem. If you disagree then feel free to debate that point instead of pulling this semantic bullshit.
               </p>
               <p>
                ok two seconds and i've found something
                <a href="http://livingresistance.com/2016/12/08/unreal-crowds-millions-protest-finding-president-part-satanic-cult-south-korea/">

                </a>
                <br/>
                if you come back and challenge the validity of that source you are being a complete dick cuz I'm trying my best just to stay awake to watch ufc...
               </p>
               <p>
                My original point was we shouldn't let these things sit in silo's and should work together recognizing this is an international problem,,, I hope that's enough for you to get where  i was coming from in my original post. if you want more sources to help you understand where I was coming from feel fee to use the links below:

                 I don't give a flying fuck if you think I'm being snide. Your source says that some people are calling it a satanic cult, but spiritualism and sataism are different things. Look like you just repeated some shit without verifying it first.

                  look I don't disagree at all,,, I actually think the use of the term satanism is poorly used. Same could be said for the claims that the podesta crew are involved in satanism when it's probably more Thelema based occultism. I used the term satanism more a blanket term for the uninitiated. Would you be more comfortable if I said that I think they are all involved in occult practices and rituals.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Did you not get the fact that it's silly o'clock where i am and i was making a more general point that the global power structures are involved in the same kind of stuff? You probably have a point,, it's probably more shamanic in nature but that wasn't my point,,,, my point was the people of SK have acted on mass to tackle the problem [which involved more than just her involvement in occult practice and included political and financial corruption on a huge scale much like the clinton crew] my point was that if we didn't silo these things you guys in the states might be in a better position to tackle the problem...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don't really get the argument your making against my original point,,, I get that you think i've not properly used the correct terminology to explain it but as i've told you it's late and i'm tired,,, but do you disagree that we would be better served recognizing this as a global issue and working together or not?

                   I'm focusing on Satanism because it's an important issue which has been associated with false reports which causes the thing to be labeled as "moral panic". There's good evidence that pedo networks are a global issue, but the connection with Satanism is harder to pin down.The point I'm trying to make is that allegations of Satanism should be backed up by credible evidence.

                    right,, ok I get your angle,,, and agree. I noticed a big push to shut down pizzagate labeling it the new 'satanic panic'. Apologies if you think I was adding to it. I hope you can also see my point,, you only have to look at the photo's of the millions of people on the streets of south korea to see what i wish would happen around the world to get rid of the 'bad guys'. My personal feeling is that there wouldn't have been the same reaction by the masses if it had just been about corruption. I think the same could be said for the problem in the states and I think if the american public would be exposed to things like what's happening in South Korea they would be more inclined to do something about it... imho
