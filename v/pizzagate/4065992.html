<h1 id="md-house-intelligence-committee-to-hold-virtual-open-hearing-on-misinformation-and-conspiracy-theories-online">House Intelligence Committee to Hold Virtual Open Hearing on Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories Online</h1>
<p>Washington, DC – On Thursday, October 15, 2020 at 1:30 pm ET, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) will convene a virtual unclassified hearing entitled, “Misinformation, Conspiracy Theories, and ‘Infodemics’: Stopping the Spread Online.”</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories and misinformation narratives that prey on individuals’ fears and uncertainties continue to mar the online landscape. Against the backdrop of a global pandemic, an economy in turmoil, and a tumultuous presidential campaign, there is ample terrain for malicious actors at home or malign foreign operatives and governments abroad to exploit such tensions by stoking chaos and dangerous, even life-threatening, untruths. Recent trends in the spread and reach of misleading or unfounded claims online have the unsettling potential to come to a head after Election Day – particularly if the certified outcome is unknown or contested in the ensuing days and weeks.</p>
<p>Although the seeds for many conspiracies and misinformation narratives – ranging from baseless QAnon posts, to dangerous coronavirus skepticism and denialism, to falsehoods about mail-in ballots – are often homegrown and amplified by American voices, the propaganda and covert influence machines of foreign adversaries have nonetheless repeated and amplified them in the service of strategic interests.</p>
<p>In the hearing, the Committee will examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>the intersection of and divergences between different online conspiracy and misinformation narratives;</li>
<li>the role of social media platforms in the proliferation and deceleration of such content;</li>
<li>how foreign actors are taking advantage of misinformation circulating U.S. online communities;</li>
<li>steps that the US government and private sector need to take in response; and</li>
<li>the implications for our social and political discourse beyond Election Day 2020.</li>
