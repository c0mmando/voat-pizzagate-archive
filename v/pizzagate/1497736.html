                  CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN PODESTA; 
</code></pre>

<p>MR. PODESTA:  Good afternoon.  People can join me if they</p>
<p>want.  Let me briefly say that I\'m going to try to summarize what</p>
<p>happened at the meeting, but I think it was an excellent discussion</p>
<p>today with the President, members of the Cabinet, leaders of the</p>
<p>Internet and e-commerce companies, civil liberties organizations,</p>
<p>security experts, reformed hackers, some academic people.  I know that</p>
<p>many of you have been outside and have heard from people who were inside</p>
<p>the meeting.  But let me try to briefly summarize what was said and the</p>
<p>dialogue that took place, and try to put it in some order. </p>
<p>The comments went into the following areas:  We need to raise</p>
<p>the level of security practice.  I think that many of the people in the</p>
<p>room commented on the fact that many tools were out there to deal with</p>
<p>security threats, but many of the tools were not being used.  We need to</p>
<p>be more pro-active.  One of the participants said that in much of the</p>
<p>software that\'s shipped, that the default mechanisms are never switched</p>
<p>on for about a third of the software that\'s shipped by one of the</p>
<p>venders -- so that we need to be more pro-active in getting the tools</p>
<p>out and getting them in use, to practice better hygiene, as many of the</p>
<p>people commented.</p>
<pre><code>      We need to make the government, secondly, a role model.  We\'re
</code></pre>

<p>not doing a good enough job in making sure that the government\'s own</p>
<p>systems are secure.  We need to enhance the security on the government</p>
<p>systems, and make sure that they\'re not broken into, that the firewalls</p>
<p>are in place, and that we\'re practicing good security procedures. </p>
<p>Much More Here.</p>

            The efits supposedly came from private investigators hired by the McCanns themselves.  Wed need to confirm their dates and source of creation or speculate that British intelligence did the the whole thing.  I do agree they were planted by a whistleblower.
