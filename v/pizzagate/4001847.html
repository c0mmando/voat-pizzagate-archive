<p><a href="https://canadafreepress.com/article/kamala-harris-covered-up-for-san-francisco-archdiocese-sex-abuse">https://canadafreepress.com/article/kamala-harris-covered-up-for-san-francisco-archdiocese-sex-abuse</a></p>
<p>Kamala Harris Covered Up For San Francisco Archdiocese Sex Abuse...And for some reason, her record of covering up sex abuse records belonging to the San Francisco Archdiocese was never part of the political news of her record. Today, Harris is a United States Senator, with an eye for running for President in 2020.</p>
<p>..As of 2010, the Archdiocese of San Francisco settled 101 abuse cases and paid $68 million in settlements since 2003, the New York Times reported... Kamala Harris could have legally intervened, but did not. Inquiring minds want to know why she did not?</p>
<p>..As California Attorney General Kamala Harris ordered a raid on the home of David Daledin, who in 2015 exposed Planned Parenthood officials openly discussing buying and selling the body parts and organs from aborted babies for research, through Undercover videos, I reported in 2017. ..</p>
<p>By sifting through documents made public as a result of lawsuits, Russell learned that during the 1990s and 2000s, Levada helped keep allegations against pedophile priests shrouded in secrecy. <strong>Alleged abusers included Salesian Brother Salvatore Billante, who police alleged had sexual relations with at least 24 children, but charges were dropped after the California Supreme Court overturned a state law extending the statute of limitations for pedophiles</strong>. And so the full contents of archdiocese clergy abuse files obtained by prosecutors were never revealed at trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Salesian Order also came up in my thread on pedophilia at a Haitian orphanage.  Research is providing an extensive network of organisations visiting  them.. with more info to come... <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/4001103">Another Catholic priest accused of pedophilia in Haiti</a></p>

<p>I looked into our archives but we haven\'t covered the Salesians in much detail.  But there is much on the net, like:</p>
<p>House of the Accused  <a href="https://www.ronrussell.org/house-of-the-accused">https://www.ronrussell.org/house-of-the-accused</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When priests within the Salesian order based in San Francisco were accused of sex abuse, the leaders chose to keep quiet.</em> ..Five of the eight Salesians listed in a recent personnel directory as holding positions of responsibility at the provincial house are also accused child molesters. One of them, Father Bernard Dabbene, who once held a prominent post as former San Francisco Archbishop William J. Levada\'s chief liaison to parishes in the archdiocese, is a convicted sex offender who struck a plea bargain with prosecutors to avoid going to jail.</p>
<p>..The list does not include a defrocked former lay brother, <strong>Salvatore Billante, who served four years in prison for molesting a child and was later indicted on a whopping 181 counts of sex abuse.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rarely if ever have there been so many accused priests clustered at the heart of a single religious order,&quot; says David Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, a victim advocate group. Although largely ignored by news media, SNAP\'s protests in recent months outside schools and churches run by the order, and in front of archdiocese headquarters, have sought to draw attention to what Clohessy claims is the Salesians\' &quot;abysmal record&quot; in dealing with their accused clerics.</p>
<p>And here\'s a CNN report about the order, no less, which includes drawings of SRA. I didn\'t read the entire report and a warning, there is quite some disturbing stuff: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/12/us/salesians-of-don-bosco-intl/">Pedophile priests operated at this California school for decades</a> [archived: <a href="https://archive.is/WIyYu">https://archive.is/WIyYu</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>..Joey Piscitelli was at the school in 1972, when Dabbene returned as principal...</p>
<p>Piscitelli, who graduated from the school in 1973, has since made it his life\'s mission to bring the Salesians to justice for the abuse they inflicted upon him as a child.</p>

             <a href="https://www.infoans.org/fr/sections/nouvelles/item/11094-bresil-deux-projets-innovants-de-l-universite-salesienne-unisalesiano">

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In recent days, the Salesian University âUniSALESIANOâ has been the protagonist with two important innovations. The first concerns hepatitis C screening tests in the adult population, while the second concerns the former municipal emergency room, which will be transformed into a specialized dispensary, thanks to the contribution of âUniSALESIANO. "
             </p>
             <p>
              Students and teachers in the Biomedicine course performed tests for hepatitis C in adults between August 24 and August 26. Identifying the disease is not easy, as it only shows symptoms at an advanced stage. Thus, at the headquarters of the
              <strong>
               Rotary Club of AraÃ§atuba
              </strong>
              - which designed the campaign against hepatitis C - 400 kits were distributed for testing. The coordinator of the biomedicine course, Prof. Rossana Abud Cabrera Rosa, underlined the importance of the project by inviting the population to participate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fr Luigi Favero, SDB, Rector of UniSALESIANO, explained that the work will take place in several stages. It will begin with the hospitality and physiotherapy sector, then it will continue with the other sectors of specialization. The new dispensary will house specialists in cardiology, dermatology, physiotherapy and much more.
