            This is my favorite (horrible) part a quote from another Quora user: What I didn’t realize was that the pizza jokes were explicitly Cheese Pizza posts. There were hundreds upon hundreds of posts of people asking for cheese pizza, cooked for 4–16 minutes, or however long they wanted. What made it so disturbing for me was the slow realization - it took me about half an hour to fully realize - that cheese pizza was not an in joke, but child porn. Links to anonymous email accounts were often provided under a post/request, and the number of minutes cooked was a reference to the age of their victim bracket.
