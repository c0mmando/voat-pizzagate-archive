            It's very, very difficult to determine what the intent is behind military aviation activities.  Little birds running full black, landing in downtown LA - highly suspicious.  47s and 53s over CT?  Doesn't sound that unusual.  Then again, I don't know what normal air traffic in your AO is like. What Reserve, NG, FORSCOM, TRADOC, etc. posts are in your area?  What naval assets were offshore?  What was the training schedule?
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, most people would shit a brick if they saw what I saw on Monday.  Coming out of DC, Lincoln Memorial in my rear view mirror crossing the Memorial Bridge, 3 X Blackhawks in formation came right overhead at 500'.  If it were 1 X Blackhawk, I'd say "normal".  3 Blackhawks, very unusual.  But again, no idea what they were doing.  Given elevation and direction, I'd say they were coming from the Pentagon to the White House.
           </p>
           <p>
            All that said, without some direct relevance to Pizzagate, I'm not sure how this post belongs.

            Hi there
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Hispeedtim2876">

            . Thank you for your service.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please have a look at our submission rules in the sidebar; they're a bit more strict that other subverses. You need to explain how you think this might be relevant to Pizzagate (global elite abuse of kids). Are you thinking this is related to potential arrests? What are the bases in the area these might have been transporting people to/from? Could it be related to National Guard? Which groups use these particular birds? We need your pizzagate thesis, here. I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. Otherwise, I will have to remove this per Rule 1.

             It’s better when people ask questions themselves rather someone pointing everything out.  Research for yourself. 
My post is obviously about pizza and arrests, use logic!   Watch Greenwich!

              Sorry, that's not how we do things here. Please see the sidebar. We have a very specific ruleset, designed to keep disinfo and forum-sliding to a minimum (which we historically get a lot of when the news heats up). You have to state your thesis and support it with linked sources. Otherwise, when we get a shitpost from a bot about pineal gland harvesting by reptilians, we won't be able to remove it without being accused of censorship.
