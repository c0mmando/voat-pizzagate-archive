            I have a lot of respect for Icke, the material he covers is immense. I think we all to one extent or another have our limits in what we are willing to accept when things he says goes against our beliefs (be they purely scientific material rationalism or in some way religious), especially when there is so little evidence for some of the things.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of his best presentations in my opinion is this one: Big brother and the big picture.
No reptiles there but lots of remarkable stuff, like his concept of Problem, Reaction, Solution.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAkM_AiIT0">

           </p>
           <p>
            The way I see it with people such as Icke is you try they say against your best judgment and accept what ever is reasonable, file the rest away for later consideration or even as pure lunacy, but you gotta give the man respect for depth of his life's work's investigation.
Personally I have a hard time accepting his religious new agey ideas about vibrational states of consciousness, the importances of colors and so forth, the ascended masters he claims to talk to etc... ("Pure love is the only truth everything else is illusion.")
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently, however I got my world-view challenged yet again to the point of even considering the pesky reptiles as I recently discovered Carolyn Hamlett, self proclaimed survivor of sexually abusive mind control, self proclaimed member of the Illuminati as well as high ranking member of the "satanic hierarchy". Almost everything is based on repressed memories, out of body experiences, yet somehow I find her words truthful, hard to explain why in rational terms.

            Now this rabbit hole is just about as deep as they go and would seemingly take a lifetime to explore, I was surprised of the sheer amount of information available, so I don't want to derail the current investigation by any means, explore if you are drawn to it. I find the character of Daniel Duval to be somewhat shady, yet he brings a lot of DID people to his radio program where their testimonies are contained.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps I add a trigger warning to more scientifically minded people all this is Christian and they will preach on you...

            If you would have listened or read how Icke comes to this "cray stuff" you wouldn't think it's crazy.

             What is being uncovered in this documentary is truly remarkable, complete with the the dishonest media. The court called it not a accident but used the term unlawful killing and the media refused to report on it.

            Alot of people believe in reptilian aliens interbreeding with humans. The theory is that there are some benign, benevolent alien species who look over us, trying to help humans. Then there are other aliens who, while not evil, simply view us  with cold-hearted indifference.   I've never met one so I've got no idea.

            He is a storyteller! And a good one!
Titus frost was mentioning the strange sounds of trumpets, now I think david talked about the first recorded writing about the building of the pyramids, it was mentioned they were build by the sound off trumpets!
I looked into that! So interesting! Titus should look into that, but I have no way to contact him. ???

            I have been watching his videos and even tho this reptilian stuff sounds crazy, it could be true. This guy sounds like he knows what he's talking about. He may know why these Satanic elites seem to have no souls. He's worth listening to.

            Controlled opposition is such a highly strategic move on the part of the corrupt elites, and especially with the U.S. government giving itself legal authority to spread propaganda to U.S. citizens (which works for both MSM material but also with controlled opposition material, they can tap both angles), that people would have to be pants-on-head to not be vigilant about the possibility with anyone who has achieved significant popularity/attention and thus has the power to influence the opinions of many thousands to several millions of followers.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in that regard, the question I ask is, is this person/group's participation helping or harming the cause of raising awareness and/or gaining credibility? With David Icke, his most famous conspiracy theory content is the reptilian stuff, and that is what people are going to see/read/watch when they look him up. So having him become prominent on the topic of pizzagate is more harmful than helpful.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then the best defense anyone has for the guy, is that he had to use reptilian talk to keep himself from being murdered. So in other words, that he allows himself to be used as a prominent figure for discrediting topics, is excusable because ultimately he did it for himself. And we are supposed to feel.. okay with that? Personally, I don't.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also reject the fallacy that you can't criticize someone unless you have done everything they have done. I see that fallacy all the time, and it's bogus no matter who is using it or for what. I'm not a dentist, but if a dentist screwed up my teeth, I could sure as hell notice it and I could sure as hell criticize them for it. That I haven't been making conspiracy theorists look bad for years allegedly in order to cover my own ass, is a moot point.

            I can't imagine that Philip, Liz or Charles really cared that much. Are they capable of normal feelings like normal people.    These royals have been doing things for  power and prestige for centuries  above all else. And we know  Charles wasn't into Diana anyway,  so I don't think there was much love lost there.

            He obviously never heard the idiom 'don't throw the baby out with the bathwater'. 
its what makes conspiracy theorists, look like conspiracy nuts. and yes people in general will dismiss anything he has to say as bullshit, because he comes out with retarded things like reptiles rule the world. metaphorically yes...since reptiles have the dubious stigma of "evil". Thats why its a SNAKE in genisis. the lowest to the ground of all the reptiles. But LITERALLY reptiles.

            The craziest thing, IMO, Icke predicted, was the idea of many alternative realities or dimensions, all existing within the same 'space' but vibrating at different frequencies, so you only sense one reality at a time. He makes the analogy of radio frequencies, and how all the music and chatter from all the radio stations are in the room with you all at once, and when you turn the radio on and tune it to one particular frequency you can just hear that one. He talked about that stuff 30 years ago.

            Recently, this has become an actual theory in quantum mechanics, with all the mathematics to describe it as well. Apparently this theory solves one of the major problems in theoretical particle physics.

            I have always respected Icke for the same reasons you mention. I was never a hater. I do continue to criticise his Alien obsession as well as other hair brained theories - but I will never be a hater. I just lament that many good friends have been led down the garden path of aliens which I believe is completely a psyop - and who unfortunately discredit many other legitimate 'conspiracies'.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have read Michael Tsarions works in detail, another Alien protagonist, which is unfortunate because he also has many interesting works on the occult &amp; ancient history. I wonder sometimes if it's just a good money spinner or these people genuinely believe it. Perhaps it's an inability to cope with the possibility that humans really can be this evil. At least that is what my experience is with emotionally unstable, often drug addicted hippies / new agers who buy this stuff. Check out Project Avalon forum - that's a really strange alien cult.

            That's the problem,  and if  the latest fake news shitstorm doesn't prove that nothing will.
Yeah,  I couldn't remember if the hologram over Bush was from  Cathy O'Brien or Taylor Bryce, thanks for the correction.
And the problem is that  these people  really do like to put information to the public, and then go back on it and make it look like it was all fake;  as seen with the cpp weirdness, because honestly if I didn't experience the cpp - fake news media thing myself I don't think I would have believed me if somebody told me about it 20 years from now... you know?  It's just that bizarre.
Did they allow  Cathy O'Brien and Taylor Bryce to do their favorite game, which is to put out some information and nobody believes it?
            <br/>
            Then they get to go back over it and disinformation the shit out of it through their  msm fake news stories?
I don't know who is part of that and who's not, and I'm guessing that's what the controlling shitheads want us all to be..... confused!
Bastards!

            Well said OP. I remember the day DI was interviewed by Wogan and called himself the son of God. Must have been 30 year ago. The ridicule that man endured for his belief is amazing. But now that what he says is coming true people call him 'controlled opposition'. It's the ones doing the calling who is 'controlled opposition'!!

            David Icke educated me about the multi-decade bait-and-switch between paper money and gold, and the insidious injustice of fractional reserve banking. He lost me on the lizard man thing, though - but I see your point.
If the lizard man thing is just a kite he flies to avoid being erased, then he's even cleverer than i thought

             That's always been my thought. Most of his shit is true, but the reptilian stuff he pushes so he sounds crazy, and becomes free to say whatever truth he wants in-between.

            I have to disagree with you on that one. They found paint on Diana's limo from another vehicle that night. Which means her car was struck by another vehicle which is not in the official account. They tracked the owner of the vehicle and he was a known intelligence employee. 2 years later this intel guy was found burned to death in his vehicle. Sorry but I can't remember names. Philip was also known to be completely against Diana's relationship with Fayed because he was Egyptian. There is actually a recording of Phillip saying this.

             aaah,  burned to death.   That is a favorite molech ritual  of the 9th circle and lesser  elite groups --  passing through the fire sacrifice.   That one is saved for big rituals.  And Diana was a big ritual.   I knew it was a murder when she died,  but only now I'm able to piece together the who and why.

             I'm not sure the American masonic version  are as picky and precise on things, maybe a little more hillbilly and not as precise on exact details.

                Yup just like how vince foster killed himself and apparently levitated to a park bench on a dirt trail, since he had no dirt on his shoes. However, his body was covered in carpet fibers. Must be a symptom of levitation lol.

            Believing Icke's theories are ridiculous is lazy groupthink. If you think it's possible that the Queen eats babies, then it's certainly possible that she may be an alien that eats babies. Stephen Hawking himself came out a couple years ago warning against thinking that aliens would be beneficial and kind. So if the one of the smartest men in the world believes that aliens could not only exist, but could be evil, than Icke's theories are perfectly valid. It's like making fun of the fake moon landing. Yeah? That's been proven without a doubt? Sometimes the more a theory is ridiculed, the  more likely it is to be true.

               That's a hoax video. He never admitted to helping to fake the moon landing, but it's certainly plausible, especially with some of the symbols in The Shining. He did reportedly say however, according to his collaborator in Eyes Wide Shut, that "Hitler was right".

            He's been crazy correct about pretty much everything relating to the current exposure to The global human trafficking ring,"Pizzagate".

            So I'm not even going to look into the reptilian shit because I can't even be confident he's wrong.   Like a couple months ago, I'd say a handful of conspiracy's were true.... Now I'm the point where I'm looking for past conspiracy theories, That I dismissed in the past without even giving it a chance, and they all seem plausible as fuck now.  Fuck, I would even give some of them a chance... But they still seem like bullshit to me. I actually got pissed at them because I thought they  gave the "True conspiracy Theories" a bad name. Like, Fuck me.

           <p>
            I don't need to learn the truth about reptilians at this point. It's too much.  If there are reptilian overlords, I'm moving to and Island and living out the rest of my life on hallucinogenic drugs.

             I know watch some of his lectures David Icke is strikingly accurate about such matters. He provides a lot of consistent thoroughly researched evidence for his claims. Don't know about the reptilian agenda but his discussions on pedophilia and occult practices is damn stunning in its entirety. Just don't know how he would get away with it as many have lost their lives trying to expose such matters. Just look at Max Biers and others its something that if you try to expose on a public forum that involves certain elites its like a guaranteed d notice.

             The reptilian part refers to psychopaths' lack of care. The r-complex (i.e., reptile brain) of human neurophysiology is responsible for fear. The limbic system, or mammalian brain is responsible for care (e.g., caring for others, or sympathy). Finally, the neocortex is responsible for abstract thought. A psychopath has a functioning r-complex (i.e., reptile brain) and neocortex, but the limbic system is broken—hence they're called reptilians.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recall the cremation of care satanic ritual.

              That's simply not an accurate characterization of Icke's claims.  He claims there are multi-dimensional beings who are reptilian shape-shifters.  Zero proof/evidence.  Clearcut disinformation.

               It doesn't matter what particular form evil takes. I used to think like you, and then one day I simply understood Icke's message. I believe Icke uses the magic of metaphor and allegory for a very specific and necessary reason—perhaps to stay alive; I don't know.

              There is no correlation between Psychopathy and Paedophilia. There is however a strong link between Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Pedos.

             I've been delving pretty heavily in to the Antarctica shit lately, with John Kerry and Buzz Aldrin randomly flying there its peaked my interest. I completely brushed it off in the past as interesting but unlikely, now its starting to seem pretty plausible.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm still not 100% on the Antarctica conspiracies but they are really interesting, I'm not sure what it would take for me to be to really believe it but Pizzagate coming to light has put me from 75% to 100% on the existence of an international human trafficking ring run by high profile elites and protected by government agencies throughout the world. There far are too many coincidences throughout history for nothing to be here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now I am starting to think about how they all may be interconnected and wondering if that's insane or not.

              The Antarctic conspiracy is related to the flat earth story..
I know the programmed knee jerk reaction is how ridiculous, but I'd say that 1 year ago.. I've believed in globe earth my whole life like everyone.. But not this past year or anymore.. Watch jeranism channel on youtube.. Go back about a year and start watching.. Flat earth will blow your fucking mind once the penny drops! 
Don't mock it until you've really looked into it. Flat earth is related to all this shit with the elite and their obsession with control and living forever and so much more.

               I've watched many of Eric Dubuy's flat earth/Antarctica videos.  You can't argue with the math.  Our programming is just too complete, though, to accept it at first glance.  This one def takes some getting used to.

               There's a bunch of newer youtube videos too I don't want to link one I haven't watched and I can't find one I think is a good example.

             Not only the recent past. I'm starting to wonder how much of he old folklore is based on stuff we are only just uncovering in their modern form. Vampires, fair folk, werewolves, oh my!

            <p>
             Telling your kids not to follow strange lights in the woods is great advice if whatever passed for pedosatanists existed in those days in one form or another.

             I think you just read my mind.
Between the  cannablistic desensitization more than I ever dreamed was going on (I never even dreamed it was going on anywhere but psycho's like Dahmer),  and  who knows what other shit,  I feel like you...
             <br/>
             We have to clean up this shit !
             <br/>
             This is what I get for being  tolerant, innocent  and equal minded -- then shit comes in the door covered in pizza and I was stupid enough to  think it's actual food!

            I respect Icke for the amount of effort he has poured into his theories.

           <ol>
            <li>
             Some of his conclusions are too far fetched to be believed without undeniable physical proof (reptilians)
            </li>
            <li>
             For the most part, he simply is not pertinent to Pizzagate. Much like your post, I'm afraid.

             This post is off topic but Icke did directly address pizzagate in an "I told you so" video. He said this child pedophile ring existed years ago. No one wanted to believe it.

            I think people who think taxation (taking people's money at gunpoint for a moral "higher purpose") is an acceptable aspect of society are scarier than people who think lizards walk the earth. :)

            I respect that he shared a lot of info,  but when he ate the alleged reptilian skin given by an  African shaman, or holy man,   he lost something for me.
 Even if I didn't believe in reptillians I wouldn't have eaten this,  but if I  did believe in them I REALLY wouldn't have eaten it.
That said,  I think it was Taylor Bryce who said she saw a hologram like image over  Bush Sr during a ritual,  and perhaps there's  projection of internal  duality psychology, or who knows,  but did he ever explain why in hells name he'd eat something he considers to be reptile skin?

            I have done my own thing for  ''the cause''   starting May 22, 2016 I went deeper and deeper  inward to look into the split  (the dark/light which  pedo bdsm groups might call dominos)   that chooses on all kinds of levels.
            <br/>
            I denounced the external projections of such split off creations in all their forms.
            <br/>
            It's been a whirlwind ever since.

           <p>
            Maybe you're right, if he didn't go a little off he may have been suicided,  but it does leave room for consideration if these guys are used as disinformation controlled opposition.
            <br/>
            I wish him the best,  but.....

            I am not a huge fan of Icke, especially the reptile bs (and yes that part is bs). With that being said, he has been spot on in regards to a helluva lot of other conspiracies that have been proven to be true.
