            Resident shill Are_We_Sure is here posting about how situations like yours are but mere ancedotal evidence that don't prove elite pedophile rings exist.

           <p>
            Why not go to him and one of his posts in this thread and "let him have it". Picture him as being one of the people who abused you. Unleash every last bit of rage and hate you bear towards them at the shill as you tear that piece of shit a new one. Lash out at him as you dismantle his ridiculous claim, then remind him of what a vile irredemable inhuman monster he is.

            There was a post on here a while back and there was a place on top of a football stadium for a helicopter landing.  We know some elites may like to be just dropped off, but it is also a place for trafficked victims to be brought in as well.  I am hoping someone else remembers.  We also know that in all large cities there is a stadium involved that has an airport or two nearby.  There is a reason for this.  An Operation Set Up.  You know what I am taking about.  They have ways to transport and meet the demand of these sick pedophiles.  Bless You.

            I think you're misreading this.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Super Bowl is not being used a cover and the NFL has nothing to do with this.  It just basically means you have an event where a lot of men with money are going to out of town and away from their families.  These are two factors that increase the likelihood of those men going to a prostitute.  It's a supply and demand thing. Same thing happens with conventions or big fights in Vegas.  The trafficking occurs to meet the demand.  The major event is not "used to cover it up."  It just means thousands of folks are renting hotel rooms, the trafficking just blends in, there's no need for cover.
           </p>
           <p>
            I used to work in a bar where we made the most money on the night before Thanksgiving.  It was better than New Year's Eve.  The reason being was everyone was back in town for the holiday and had no obligations that Wednesday night.  It was jammed packed all night with people who were drinking and willing to tip.  The folks who came out New Year's Eve were not the folks who come out all year round, so they were less likely to tip.   We always knew everybody was working Thanksgiving Eve just like pimps know when a big event is going to happen.
           </p>

            This follow up article claims this mostly to be myth.  Interviews with local cops did not turn a bunch of out of town hookers, mostly locals.

             So the actual sex trafficking victim is lying according to you. Typical of a leftist elite defender shill like you (not to mention liberals in general) to care more about criminals than actual victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             You also ignore that it has happened in more than one Super Bowl.

             The fact that you're even here means this is an important lead.

             I didn't say the NFL was behind this incident shilltard. I said that we should START looking into possible pedophile/human trafficking connections to prominent people in the NFL.

              Um, the victim was talking about events that happened decades earlier.  She's 53.  Also you can't define a trend by the anecdotes of one person.   This is not about if she is lying.  It's about is there evidence of something widespread beyond her experience. And some cops and anti-trafficking organizations say there is not.  See article below.

              The NFL is behind just some prominent people in the NFL.  Gotcha.  Good distinction.  You do know that the Super Bowl is widely publicized event and traffickers don't need to have any special connections to anyone at the NFL to do what they do right? And that this is announced way in advance? 2022's Super Bowl is scheduled for Los Angeles.

              Sports Illustrated took a look at this as well.

              <p>
               (Santa Clara Police Leiutenant) Stenderup says that in the three weeks before Super Bowl 50, the Human Trafficking Task Force made 43 arrests of johns, two human trafficking arrests and six arrests for aiding in or loitering for prostitution. Which sounds like a lot, until he notes: "We actually were able to contact more sex workers and had more john arrests in one day in October [2016] than we did during a three-week period leading up the Super Bowl."......“I would argue that sex trafficking occurs all the time regardless of major sporting events,” Stenderup says. “If we had the resources all the time we could make a very significant dent in this problem.”

               In 2011 the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, a group of nongovernmental organizations, published a report examining the record on sex trafficking related to World Cup soccer games, the Olympics and the Super Bowl. The paper concluded: “Despite massive media attention, law enforcement measures and efforts by prostitution abolitionist groups, there is no empirical evidence that trafficking for prostitution increases around large sporting events.”
