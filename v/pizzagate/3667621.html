<p>One of the most dramatic and significant examples of the disease principles Selye has discovered comes from the New York State Mental Hospital, at Creedmoor, L.I., just outside New York City. There a group of doctors — <strong>Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond Sackler</strong> and the late Johann H. W. van Ophuijsen, world-famous psychoanalyst—were seeking the physiological causes of insanity, particularly schizophrenia. <em>Their experiments revealed that <strong>electric shock therapy</strong>, which sometimes aids in the recovery from this type of insanity, released histamine, a hormonelike substance, into the blood stream of the patient.</em></p>
<p>Further experiments, based on Selye’s concept of stress, convinced them that in the schizophrenic, stress had forced the adrenal glands to overproduce certain of its hormones and the resulting disequilibrium had produced this dread mental disease. This was a radical departure from past investigations; other doctors, noting the schizophrenic’s apathetic response to the outside world, believed he suffered from an adrenal deficiency. But both investigations revealed the existence of a glandular imbalance. The histamine released by electric shock apparently restored the glandular balance.</p>
<p>In a new experiment the Creedmoor doctors followed Selye’s principle of attacking the underlying glandular imbalance. They injected their schizophrenic patients with histamine. The results were startling—many patients began to get well. Their most recent experiments show that while it is no cure-all for mental diseases, histamine can possibly double the number of schizophrenics who could be released from our overcrowded mental institutions. The Creedmoor group uses histamine injections to maintain the glandular balance in these released patients, with one injection coming every few weeks. As a result of this work. <em>New York state has set up the Creedmoor Institute for Psycho-biologic Studies <strong>under Dr. Arthur Sackler’s direction</strong>, for research on the hormonal causes of insanity.</em></p>

<p>Hormones Help Mental Cases NEW YORK, May 12.</p>
<p>hormone treatments made one- third of a group of mental patients well enough to go home, five Creedmoor state hospital scientists said today. </p>
<p>The hormones helped some patients who had not benefitted from shock treatments, they told a New York state medical society meeting. <strong>Both male and female sex hormones were used, in large doses.</strong> </p>
<p>The combination is something new in treating severe mental illnesses. Their use is based on a theory that mental illnesses result from an imbalance of various body hormones. </p>
<p>The studies were reported by Drs. Mortimer, Raymond and Arthur Sackler, three brothers; Dr. Co Tui, and Dr. Johan H. W. Van Ophuijsen, of the Creedmoor Institute for Psychobiological studies. The sex hormones were tried on 40 patients. They were suffering from schizophrenia, in which a person withdraws from reality; maniac depression, marked by severe depression or extreme excitement, and involutional psychoses, or melancholia. Fifty-eight per cent of the 40 improved, and one-third recovered enough to be able to go home, they said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>electroconvulsive treatment was used on more than 500 children at Bellevue Hospital from 1942 to 1956, and then at Creedmoor State Hospital Children’s Service from 1956 to 1969. </p>
<p>Years later, another of Bender’s young patients who became overly aggressive after about 20 treatments, now grown, was convicted in court as a “multiple murderer.” Others, in adulthood, reportedly were in and of trouble and prison for a battery of petty and violent crimes. A 1954 scientific study of about 50 of Bender’s young electroshock patients, conducted by two psychologists, found that nearly all were worse off after the “therapy” and that some had become suicidal after treatment. </p>
<p>In 1955 and 1956, Dr. Bender began hearing glowing accounts about the potential of LSD for producing remarkable results in children suffering mental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Bender’s earlier work with electroshock therapy had brought her into contact with several other prominent physicians who, at the time, were covert contractors with the CIA’s MK/ULTRA and Artichoke projects. </p>
<p>Shortly after deciding to initiate her own LSD experiments on children, Bender attended a conference sponsored by a CIA front group, the Josiah Macy Foundation. The conference focused on LSD research and featured Dr. Harold A. Abramson as a presenter. In 1960, Abramson conducted his own LSD experiments on a group of six children ranging in age from five to 14 years of age. A few short months after the Macy Foundation conference, Dr. Bender was notified that her planned LSD experiments would be partially and surreptitiously funded by the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology (SIHE), another CIA front group then located in Forest Hills, New York. The Society, headed by James L. Monroe, a former US Air Force officer who had worked on top-secret psychological warfare and propaganda projects, oversaw about 55 top-secret experiments underwritten by the CIA. These projects involved LSD, ESP, black magic, astrology, psychological warfare, media manipulation, and other subjects. Apparently, Bender’s work with children and LSD raised some concerns at the CIA’s Technical Services Division (TSD). A 1961 TSD memo written to Monroe questioned the “operational benefits of Dr. Bender’s work as related to children and LSD,” and requested to be kept “closely appraised of the possible links between Dr. Bender’s project and those being conducted under separate MK/ULTRA funding at designated prisons in New York and elsewhere.”</p>
<p>In 1960, Dr. Bender launched her first experiments with LSD and children. They were conducted within the Children’s Unit, Creedmoor State Hospital in Queens, New York. The LSD she used was supplied by Dr. Rudolph P. Bircher of the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Company. (Dr. Bircher also provided Bender with UML-491, also a Sandoz-produced product, very much like LSD but sometimes “dreamier” in effect and longer lasting.) Her initial group of young subjects consisted of 14 children diagnosed schizophrenic, all under the age of 11. <strong>(Because diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, autism, and other disorders have changed over the decades, one cannot assess what actual conditions these children really had.) There were 11 boys and three girls, ranging in age from six to ten years old.</strong></p>

            The whole business is beyond shocking and disgusting. But what bothers me is her thoughts about Children having “sexual relations with adults “.  WHAT?  This is Rape. Sexual relations are what adults have with each other. Not With Children. I think the Dr needs some serious therapy of her own. And her books should be banned along with her studies. Just Shocking.

            It is amazing to me that this level of evil has been around us for decades, if not longer, while we have been sleepily going about our lives. It is deep, it is wide, and it is pure evil. Heaven help us.

            AP Exclusive: Sackler foreign firm caught up in opioid probe

              What Italian police overheard on their wiretaps offers a look at how pharmaceutical executives still pushed opioids abroad even after the cause and consequence of the American epidemic had become apparent.
             </em>
            </h1>
            <p>
             PARMA, Italy (AP) — The police huddled for hours each day, headphones on, eavesdropping on the doctor. They’d tapped his cellphone, bugged his office, planted a camera in a trattoria.
            </p>
            <p>
             They heard him boast about his power to help Big Pharma make millions pushing painkillers, and about all the money they say he was paid in exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now Dr. Guido Fanelli is at the center of a sprawling corruption case alleging he took kickbacks from an alliance of pharmaceutical executives he nicknamed “The Pain League.” Its members, police say, included managers with Mundipharma — the international arm of Purdue Pharma, which is facing some 2,000 lawsuits in the United States over its role in the opioid crisis that has claimed 400,000 lives in two decades.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the first known case outside the U.S. where employees of the pharmaceutical empire owned by the Sackler family have been criminally implicated, more than a decade after Purdue executives were convicted over misleading the American public about the addictiveness of OxyContin.
