<p>&quot;Organizers of a recent exhibit of paintings by U.S.-based Chinese artist Weng Bing removed three out of 38 paintings, citing &quot;political&quot; content, RFA has learned.</p>
<p>Arts officials in the Town of Cary in North Carolina removed one painting depicting Chinese president Xi Jinping standing on the shoulders of late supreme leader Mao Zedong, surrounded by a sea of skulls.</p>
<p>A painting showing a hand reaching out to grasp the world with China colored in black, and a portrait of Xi splattered with grey paint were also taken down from the exhibit in the town\'s Senior Center.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She was inspired in particular by activist Dong Yaoqiong, who was sent for &quot;compulsory treatment&quot; after she streamed live video of herself splashing ink on a poster of President Xi in protest at &quot;authoritarian tyranny&quot; on July 4, 2018.</p>
<p>Dong, who made her protest in SHANGHAI, is now being held as a psychiatric patient in a women\'s ward in Hunan\'s Zhuzhou No. 3 Hospital.&quot;</p>

               I would love to but I have very limited time due to my hectic life right now. I wont promise it but I'm hoping to come up with a post within a month or two.
              </p>
              <p>
               I repeat! I'm not promising to do it despite I would love to do it.

              I intend to crosspost all quality submissions about art and artists that we had here on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagateart">
               v/pizzagateart
              </a>
              , so that it becomes a research archive for the community, but it will take some time.
