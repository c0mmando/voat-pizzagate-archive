<p>This great thread <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499872">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499872</a> was posted by <a href="https://voat.co/user/spoor">@spoor</a> a while ago giving lots of brilliant information and analysis on the Alefantis owned &quot;Pegasus&quot; building at 3518 Rear 11th Street NW. Spoor concluded that this pic <a href="https://i.sli.mg/B0nf9D.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/B0nf9D.jpg</a> of John Kreher and Matt Proper looking at a hole in the ground, and this pic <a href="https://i.sli.mg/F2wqnz.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/F2wqnz.jpg</a> of two workmen breaking the ground up were not taken at Comet Ping Pong, were not taken at the Pajama Factory, but were in fact at the Pegasus building.</p>
<p>Yesterday I found this website <a href="http://www.margotwork.com/about/">http://www.margotwork.com/about/</a> of Joseph Margot, who worked for Square Form <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/going-out-guide/wp/2014/07/10/from-the-ground-up-running-on-fumes/?utm_term=.add70a3c5617">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/going-out-guide/wp/2014/07/10/from-the-ground-up-running-on-fumes/?utm_term=.add70a3c5617</a> <a href="http://archive.is/q4zIV">http://archive.is/q4zIV</a></p>
<p>If you look at the picture in the workshop from Margot\'s site, noting the area I have highlighted with a Red circle <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ec9xe">http://imgur.com/a/ec9xe</a>
You will see that it matches this one from the construction pictures, also highlighted with a Red circle <a href="http://imgur.com/a/YH2Vi">http://imgur.com/a/YH2Vi</a>
and in-turn the brick pattern of the wider construction picture <a href="http://imgur.com/a/OmA2w">http://imgur.com/a/OmA2w</a></p>
<p>Now, how do we know this is at the Pegasus building and not Comet or the PJ Factory? spoor covered it in his thread, but I\'ll put a little here once more for ease of analysis:
This image shows all the relevant parts very well <a href="https://i.sli.mg/KNWZ7C.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/KNWZ7C.jpg</a></p>
<p>Now, the clincher is that for this construction site to be the work room and be at the Pegasus building, then there needs to be some proof of Square Form being there. Thankfully, we have that.</p>
<p>In these images <a href="https://sli.mg/a/s9hoRx">https://sli.mg/a/s9hoRx</a> from Joe Wills (Head of Square Form) we can see their former office space that was featured in an instagram picture (I can\'t find that picture at present).
Now compare those images with the images of the Pegasus building from the outside noting the locations of windows/doors etc as well as the new windows etc.</p>

            You have done tremendous work and in my opinion are on the right track. Now step back and think. These architects and construction workers clearly are JA's friends. They must have worked on more than one project at different sites and different times. It is very possible that they've done digging and working at CPP, Bucks and Pegasus together at different times. I suggest you seperate the different projects and sites. Time is the key imho. I was trying to connect everything and I couldn't. Then I said, wait a minute, I can't connect them if they're not from the same project... right?

            I didn't agree with your stuff about the 'kill room' at the beginning, but your pegasus research is top notch. As next steps someone should scour for any media statements about the "museum". Also worth looking into the name of the other guy on the LLC registration. BTW not sure if you noticed but under permits you listed both CASTELLUM ACHILLES LLC
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            ACHILLES CASTELLUM LLC. Are these two separate entities?

            The Harris connection is probably nothing. He's an attorney

            1630-C 19th Street, Nw looks like a residential address. Maybe its his apartment or something.

             Which ceiling work are you referring to? There are construction pics of the upstairs ceiling, with a central skylight that match up with birds-eye views of the location. Downstairs in the Square form office area with the rolling mezzanine that provides an "upstairs" is essentially a separate or different area at the end of the building, hence being able to see an upstairs and a downstairs, and it doesn't look like any construction was done to make it so other than building the mezzanine. The workroom pics don't show the ceiling but the fact that tiny details such as the brickwork pattern that I found suggest it is the same place. I'm quite confident on this one, I went over it many times.

              I understand now after seeing the video someone made with your information. That is some really good work! The bricks matching on both walls really stood out to me. The picture where the guy is leaning with his hand on the wall on the right matches too! You can see the bricks behind him and the brick patters on the right is a match. This is all so weird. Who's going to go thru all that work for a museum that isn't displayed? I'm confused about who lives there. Wiseman? Nobody? You seem to really know what's up!
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I remember a picture taken from a window in a white 2nd story building. It was aimed across the playground at the houses in front of Pegasus. You could see the phone lines and playground so you can see where the photo was taken from. I wish I could find the picture. If I can remember right, that is the building that Wiseman lives in. Maybe it was taken from Pegasus aimed at the other building. I remember it looking so creepy. In the video where your information was laid out, I think the building I'm talking about showed a man on the roof. Really strange. I was confused at the time because I didn't know about Pegasus at that time. Is there 2 buildings or what?
             </p>
             <p>
              If you know what I'm talking about please explain. It's all coming together for me now and would really help. Sorry about my horrible explaination of what I'm talking about lol. I just woke up and am texting out a confusing question.

               Unfortunately for us we're trying to play catch up. Pegasus being worked on is about 1-2 years ago, also Square Form being housed there as well actually, as they now have a new home at 5624 Lafayette Place Edmonston, Maryland. 
One of the last pictures I added shows an event being held at Pegasus, so I'm guessing things are quite different inside now, and the work room is almost certainly something else now too (you would have to assume open museum space given its listing as a museum). I would assume this is why Wiseman is involved, doing work related to the Museum.
I think I know the pic you are referring to, the one tagged "peeking", at houses across the way. I would guess that the house is not involved as we only have sales data for one building (Pegasus) and that cost $200,000; he wouldn't get Pegasus AND a house for that. The building with the man on the roof over-looking the playground is Pegasus.

             Btw, just so you know the dates of the Chris Zee Flickr won't apply b/c that is the date he cataloged the photo from JA's account, the picture was likely much longer ago.... but more than likely did line up with some sort of satanic holiday regardless.

            In my opinion, if you look at the backdoor that leads outside, from an inside the backroom perspective, the secret passageway is hidden on the left of the door. There is a 2 to 3 foot brick wall, but you access it from behind the black curtains at the back of the room at 3:25 of this video here :
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=YJrkbgiETzs&amp;app=desktopYouTube">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look at the backdoor of the CPP, from the parking point of view, it's hidden behind the wall on the right of the doorway.
           </p>
           <p>
            There could be a stairway there that leads to a basement or underground room...

             Thanks. I believe this picture here is what proves my theory. Look closely at the wall all the way up to the ceiling. The ceiling gives out the space that is behind the curtain. I think this is evidence. I'd love to see someone submit this as evidence for PG.

             I don't believe Comet to have any hidden areas at all. When you walk in the door the first part you get to is the main dining room, if you continue walking forwards the bar is to your right. Behind the bar is the kitchen. If you continue walking forwards past the bar you get to the ping pong/band area. At the back of the band area are black curtains, one to the left, one to the right, these cover the entrances (with a small amount of steps) down to the back room/party room. The party room has a small bar to the left, the exit door is on the back wall, positioned to the right hand side. There is a black curtain just to the left of the door that covers the wall, why I'm not exactly sure but there's no room for anything significant to be behind it, my guess is its just covering a really shitty looking wall. Here is a pic from outside the exit door of Comet, note the seating that you can see up against that back wall where the curtain is. There is no room for anything to be there.

              From this picture, if it  is taken of the back door, the the area I'm talking about is inside the building, in that party room/2nd bar, to the right. Behind the black curtain. That is where I think people get into an area between Comet and McCullough. People have reported tons of kids playing in the ping pong room for hours as if their parent isn't even there. Where do they end up going? A person took pictures of many things there. She said 20 men walked back to the party room/2nd bar area and didn't come back out. So, they went back and looked. They took pictures. I am posting a video for you to show you what I mean. If the men weren't hanging out in there, they would have had to go in the back and to the left behind the dark curtain. I highly doubt 20 men show up at Comet and just go out the back door. Where did they go? Plus, in the 1st bar area, there is a white door that seems sealed up. There is a table and chairs in front of it. Here is that video. The curtain area I'm talking about starts at 3:00

             <p>
              Now, I agree with what you found at the Pegasus building. All of that makes a lot of sense. But I also think there is something at Comet. He's got money and connections. That wouldn't be hard to do. He could have done both buildings. Plus, the day after the shooting, those 2 guys that said they found the tunnel under Besta Pizza, posted a video. It showed 5 boys and a guy jogging away that looked really suspicious.
              <a href="https://youtu.be/RMGGSY0A8r8">
               https://youtu.be/RMGGSY0A8r8
              </a>
              That starts at about 1:45. Also on that same video, at 3:11 it shows James Alefantis staring at the men. He looks creepy. He's standing in that little doorway. He has his car parked right up against the building so nobody could go back there. Is that the area where there was a gap?
             </p>
             <p>
              There are so many little questions that make people so confused. If you, or anyone can explain these it would be helpful!
             </p>
             <p>
              P.S. Don't forget in the tunnel video I shared, it shows that sign telling patients to go around back to the clinic area. Many people looked into that and I can't find the thread but it seemed like a really dirty and weird place to have a clinic. The doctors website looked all creepy too and even showed a babies penis picture so he could describe circumcision. Weird! So I'm wondering about that as well!

               Hmmm, I'm a bit suspicious of that first video. It uses old photos (the ones with the little girl) and they way they're used suggests they were taken by her friend that went to DC. If that's what she's claiming, then she is lying, the photos can be found doing a search. Also, she sloppily suggests people went into the back room and disappeared somewhere, she assumes behind the curtain...completely ignoring the fact that the exit door is located in that very room!!
The second video was recorded by people who are known satirists so I don't trust that video. 
Now, about the supposed Alefantis person. If you look above the door its part of the White building, Little Red Fox, so you'd have to assume that either little red fox has two doors at the back of its building, or the door to the right is an exit door from behind Comets kitchen.

                Ahhh it's all so confusing. I wish I could just see the outside of it all in person. It's hard to figure out where and what everything is. I'm not good at that like you. I live on the other side of the country tho.

                See the back door to the left? Next there is a small building that looks like an add on. Then there is a door to the right of that. From the video I showed you,
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/yingyangmom">
                 @yingyangmom
                </a>
                is thinking that big black curtain to the left of the back door, leads into the add on, the kill room. But, in the picture I just shared with you, I put an arrow on the 3rd back door. So if that is the back door then the curtain she mentioned would be on the right of that back door and that isn't where that add on room is. What do you think

                 It does get confusing but if you picture Comet as the long building that it is, it gets easier. Essentially, everything in Comet goes from front to back, the only thing that is to one side is the kitchen area, but even that, in the grand scheme of things is still within the long shape of the building. 
In the picture you linked the door on the left is Little Red Fox, the add-on is possibly Little Red Fox' cooler and its possible that Comet shares the usage of it, accessing it from the door on the right of it (though that is just a guess on my part at present, I'm looking into it to find more certain info). And obviously the door on the far right is Comets exit door at the far end of the building.

                  Thank you. Supposedly, he would tell people going to his party to enter thru Bucks back door. I'm not positive if it was Bucks or Besta. But, that means they are connected inside to each other. So there could be a place somewhere between all those places where men meet up with these kids. I mean there could be a secret door under the stage or anything. I think Pegasus has the kill room but Comet has a place too where men are using kids. I'm glad you're looking into that add on room. I'm surprised people haven't been bringing this up.

                 I see. You're absolutely right about this and explained it very well, thanks. Which means that the way to the add-on from CPP would be from the kitchen area. There is no other explanation. Alright. On that same picture, the add on is in between 2 doors. The one on the right is CPP and the one on the left is... Buck's? Oh my. This would make sense. Is the building left to CPP Buck's? Ok, but where do the 20 'older men' and children from this video
                 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=YJrkbgiETzs&amp;app=desktop">

                 </a>
                 end up then? They go back to the party room and disappear. Either they completely leave the building by the backdoor of CPP (the one that you've marked in this picture)

                 or... there is a secret passage way or staircase behind the black curtains at the back of the party room. Makes sense?

                  I don't know where but I think there is a secret door. It could even be under the stage or something. I think there are 2 locations. I think the kill room might be at Pegasus. But people are going somewhere at at Comet too. I'm not sure what is next to Comet except the McCullough building. I think maybe Little Red Fox and next to that is Besta. He would tell people at parties to enter thru Bucks so it has to all be connected inside somewhere. If so, the basement could be anywhere in there.

              There is enough space inside the backroom for a secret passage way or stairs that lead to undeground space. Let me just emphasize that JA did say that he had a basement in some interview, can't find that article right now, but I'm sure somebody could. I also remember in a government document that CPP was 1 story building, but had 2 floors. I suppose that means it has a basement. Now let me explain where I believe there is a possible secret passage way. In the picture here
              <a href="https://archive.is/yLNJR">
               https://archive.is/yLNJR
              </a>
              you can see that on the left of the door, there is a black curtain. Look closely at the wall on the left and follow this all the way up to the ceiling. There is approximatively a 2-3 feet space available that goes all the way down behind the curtains. If you position yourself at the door facing outside, you'll see nothing but a wall on your left, but if you go back in the room and pull the curtains, you might find a stairway there, that leads to an underground space or basement. Watch this video here:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=YJrkbgiETzs&amp;app=desktopYouTube">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=YJrkbgiETzs&amp;app=desktopYouTube
              </a>
              and pause at 3:28 and 3:51 and you'll understand what I mean.  The woman that visited the place says that she kept seeing older men and children going to that room and not coming back and when she entered the bar herself, she didn't see anyone but a single waiter. There MUST be a secret room somewhere and the black curtain is the only place for a secret staircase. Also if you watch this video here:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYy0JPyZZ1E&amp;t1m30s">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYy0JPyZZ1E&amp;t1m30s
              </a>
              you can see at 1:34 of the video (when JA opens the backdoor that leads to the parking that there is a 2-3 foot wall on the left side which is the same wall that the black curtain is hangs over. This is enough to hide a secret passage way.

             I don't see the problem with work being done at more than one location, meaning CPP, Bucks and Pegasus. These are architects and construction guys friends of James, there is no doubt in my mind that they've worked on different projects at different sites. The pictures prove it.

            The CPP hoody seems quite significant, I think, as it helps connect these workers directly with Alefantis.

            Any refrigeration lines running through CP?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another advantage of an outdoor walk-in is the location of the condenser. Refrigeration systems work by removing hot air from inside the cooler or freezer and blowing it outside the unit. On an outdoor walk-in, the hot air goes directly outside. On an indoor unit, the condenser either emits warm air into the building or requires the installation of a remote condensing unit, which involves running refrigeration lines through the building to the roof or an exterior wall. With an outdoor unit, this hassle can be - See more at:

            Yes this is the Pegasus building!! Those stairs outside will be the stairs u can barely see in the top left hand corner of the doorway (tiny white triangle) of the JC construction pic also seen with the bloke standing in them in the other pic, which that doorway wld lead in to the garage on the left side (looking from outside pic) of the Pegasus building, it definitely is the Pegasus building not McClloughs good find!

            Yes this is the Pegasus building!! Those stairs outside will be the stairs u can barely see in the top left hand corner of the doorway (tiny white triangle) of the JC construction pic also seen with the bloke standing in them in the other pic, which that doorway wld lead in to the garage on the left side (looking from outside pic) of the Pegasus building, it definitely is the Pegasus building not McClloughs good find!

             You're almost there. The triangular shape you see in the top left of the doorway featured in the construction pic with the guys digging is more likely stairs on the inside that lead upstairs. It makes sense as most stairs are located near to doors.

             Square Form is a company that produces custom metalworks. They do tables, benches, custom shelving etc. It is owned by Scott Cummings and Joe Wills and they have a few people working for them. They are friends of Alefantis and can be seen in many of his instagram photos.

             Square Form is a Comet Ping Pong connected company... I believe they do construction work for them, there have been some posts on it in the past. The workers all have connections with CPP and one of the couples ccwoolman and his wife also ran a child care center in Oregon.... just really creepy connections where they seem to work oddly close to children... sort of like the fact pattern of Jerry Sandusky, which I did a post on here:

            Just because walls are brick doesn't make them at the same location. The parameters of the room aren't even close to being inside the building that JA tagged Pegasus Museum. This is an open space. The house is not open and there are supporting load bearing walls/rooms. The kill room would be larger than the total space required. The kill room I would guess to be attached to that farm where JA buy things and his friend works.

                  No, I looked at a few. Look, I don't think it matches. I haven't downvoated anyone and argue about it. The dimensions are off. Wasn't it an open concept also? I seem to recall it looked like a barn or something like that. Homes like the Pegasus Museum have load bearing walls ... it makes no sense.

                   I'm getting a few of the names mixed up, so I don't know if Pegasus is an open concept. I haven't heard of anytbing about this being a home.

                  <p>
                   I think that most open concept so far is that platform office space, which matches the watchtower thing. I don't know.

                   The construction room definitely has a standard ceiling. The number of exposed bricks in this corner match. The number of rows do too.

                    And look at the floor. That's the ground floor. You can tell because the door is open. The floor looks like cement. They don't put cement in those types of homes. Yes, they do it now in trendy homes, but this home wasn't trendy. It was owned by a Russian immigrant. JA is enough of a jerk to want cement, but this is being renovated, so it's before he could have had cement floors put in. The next problem is that this is on the ground level so it's the first floor. Do we know there isn't a basement, because there isn't a basement in this home. That's why it looks like a barn to me. The lack of a basement, the open concept and that door ... definitely a farm door.

                     Yeah, I think that you're misunderstanding us. You keep mentioning "home". You're the only person, that I know of, who brought that up. We think that it's a commercial building, or an office building. At least, that is the impression that I got. I could be wrong.

                    <p>
                     Anyhow, I do agree with you in that I don't think that it's a home.

                      Well, I think they're two separate places. But if you're correct and the Pegasus Museum is the place where the picture was taken of the concrete floor, then, yes, it's commercial space. You know, you could be right. Maybe I'll go through a look at everything again. It just seems all wrong, but he was doing something with it. Your theory is the kill room and it's as good as any.

                       I wouldn't guess that they are killing anybody there. I'm just confident that the 3 photos are of the same corner at different times. I'm also not confident of the specific building.

                       There is that photo of that guy sitting on the edge of the loading door. His leg seems to be hanging down, but that can't work very easily with the exterior photo of the back of the building, because the big door is practically at ground level.

                       I don't think that the construction is taking place in a barn, but don't give up on your theory. :-)

                        So you agree it's not that building? Not sure why everyone is so adamant about it being Pegasus. Makes way more sense for it to be either on one of the farms they frequent.

                         I don't know if it is Pegasus or not. I'm just trying to be open minded about as many ideas as possible, until people start revealing more evidence.

                         I agree with his claims on the brick work, but not much else. I'm still open to it being next door.

                         I'd need to look into the documents that contain the addresses to confirm my views. A lot of the documents just went over my head.

                          Yes, but it keeps sliding into the brick work being the #killroom. The brick room wasn't the #kill room. At least I don't remember it being. This was the #killroom:
                         </p>
                         <p>

                          This can't possibly be in that space. It just can't. So why are they going on and on about the brick and this being where the #killroom was? I'm not understanding where the two were linked.

                     Don't buy it.... the odds that these 2 photos from the construction stage to where the guy is welding just so happens to have the same fucking discolored brick in the same fucking location? God damn, it's good to be a bit nuanced and anal retentive... but these are the same exact place.... either you don't know what I'm talking about when I say discolored brick or you're just not seeing it... put on some bifocals.

            great work Yuke - still not entierly convinced that is inside pegasus but you make a strong case

            curious when the photos of the workshop being there were from??

            looks like the construction to the room was done 2-3 years ago - they could have installed the walk-in after the workshop moved out

            STOP looking at the walls, and look at the CEILING... which is clearly visible in J Achilles Alefantis's original instagram construction photos.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't see ANY indication whatsoever, from these new pics, that the ceiling structure is even CLOSE to those original Instagram pics. And ceilings are a big fucking deal - load bearing, entire structure is exposed while the ceiling is open, major permitting and inspections, big heavy dangerous work often involving cranes and lifts, etc etc etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            No way, I don't buy this yet. Show me where the ceiling matches, and I might give a shite.
           </p>
           <p>
            and SECOND, there is NO WAY (without GPS information on the image), or on site verification) to place the walk-in at ANY particular address... it's the interior of a WALK-IN, dummy - with no other identifying information.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, it IS possible to match the construction photos with their current address - but you must look UP, not DOWN. Raise you view and gaze above, then tell / show us what you see before pronouncing "Eureka!" like some socially challenged savant, please.

             Yes, there have been some really good posts on here about the people behind Square Form and their bizarre closeness to children... one of the couples that posts on Jimmy Comet's insta ran a daycare center with his wife in Oregon.... I can't find the VOAT at the moment but it detailed everything.

            Great work. I do worry about the ceiling though. There is a lot going on in the ceiling of the construction photo for it to fit in the Pegasus building and under those windows.

             It is my personal opinion that if there is any killing being done, Alefantis and his immediate circle would not be the ones doing it. I see them more as 'fixers' and others things along those lines.

            Nobody ever said there was a 'killroom' except for JA's gang on IG. Yeah, sure, jokingly as always.
           </p>
           <p>
            That picture looks like a giant walk-in freezer, supposedly at Comet's (where else?), but we don't know where it is located, and how it is accessed from Comet - which officially doesn't have a walk-in freezer at all according to health inspectors, but does have an outside freezer accessed through the rear entrance according to the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now yesterday someone speculated rather convincingly that the original building site with the excavation was indeed at McCullough. And lo and behold, once again this Pegasus project is being connected to it - which it doesn't resemble structurally at all, and where it's hard to see this kind of underground excavation going on, or any plausible function at that location.
           </p>
           <p>
            Funny how this unconvincing line of reasoning keeps coming up whenever we connect Cullough - which is owned by Edwin S. Rockefeller - both physically and figuratively to neighboring Comet Pizza owned by Alefantis.

             If you look back at my previous posts you'll see that I brought up Rockefeller and McCullough long ago. The reason why I am now onto Pegasus is because this is the right place. McCullough doesn't match up at all, let alone the fact that it's owned by CONNEB I LLC not Rockefeller anyway. He owns unit 4, not unit 7. Look at all of the work-related pics and you'll see the pattern of work.

              I know you brought the connection to Edwin S. Rockefeller up before - even if you were wrong about Edwin Rock being the same guy - but I don't think that his mother's maiden name being McCullough is coincidental.
             </p>
             <p>
              He likely inherited the properties, then split McCullough Residential and McCullough Realty (bought by the obscure Conneb I).
             </p>
             <p>
              Looking at the building site pictures though I'd have to agree that the location of the rear door doesn't match McCullough. But I'm not convinced it's at Pegasus either given the structural anomalies (they would have to have demolished the entire beam structure to match it).
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, we are still at least one outside freezer short for Comet.

            (edit - started to disagree, but convinced myself)
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm convinced that this is in the pegasus building (great work, btw)
           </p>
           <p>
            I started to disagree, because the pattern on the inside of the garage door does not match the outside, and the garage door has exterior windows, whereas it did not in the 'build' pics.
           </p>
           <p>
            inside, no windows:

            </a>
           </p>

            outside, windows:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT - the grey door to the left of the garage door on the outside shot does match this pic:

           </p>
           <p>
            on the left, that is the grey door which is opening in, looks correct.
           </p>
           <p>
            this brings to light two new questions!
           </p>
           <p>
            1:  we still don't know what's in the gap between CPP and the building next to it
2:  why is the 'kill room'/refrigeration room at pegasus, of all places?  (when a walk-in cooler makes sense at the restaurant)

             I don't believe there is a refrigeration room other than the ones that already exist, so no, Pegasus does not have one. The gap between Comet and McCullough looks to be filled in with bricks and cinder blocks (you can see the shape of the cinder blocks if you look very closely at the bricked up doorway inside) and nothing more. Comet was built in the 1930's, the buildings next door (McCullough etc) were built in the 1980's. So, the Comet building probably had another exit that did go out to the side but when the buildings next door came along that got bricked up and the exit moved to the back of the building instead. 
Also, please look at both pics included of the garage door; the older one has no windows and the newer one does. The older one matches up better time-wise to the goings on inside.

              yeah, i get that they replaced the garage door - but i'm also compelled by the "kill room" picture that the floor (specifically the damage on the far-right corner) matches up with the digging being done in the pegasus room.
             </p>
             <p>
              if square form has removed it's workspace (conceivable) then the refrigeration room can still sit there.
             </p>
             <p>
              let's agree to leave that question open - unless you have a better indication as to where it might sit?

            If this is correct wouldn't the air handlers be venting out into the cavity between the two buildings, maybe possible to see this from the back side. Permits are by address, so if there was a permit for the work it would be for that address. Well it's interesting, if he has a larger cooler next door, full of food, why not just show it, because it's behind a secret door in a secret room? Still not sure how it all fits together, but does look like the work was done right next door and they had it opened up between the and comet for some reason. Seems like if they were using a walk in there, it would be common knowledge and would have came up sooner, they showed the bucks walk-in and showed pizza stuff stacked in bucks small crowded walk-in, all very odd, perhaps why the comet supplies were badly stored in bucks walk-in?

             Could very well be. ALthought I've seen very persuasive evidence regarding the design of the kill room and how certain things line up very well with the hole in the ground. I'll try to find.

            I'm struggling to understand how you can say that it's at McCullough and acknowledge there's a garage? There is no garage at McCullough. Look at the older version of the outside of Pegasus and the new one. The older garage door has no windows, the newer one does. The square Form office area that is all white is the part to the extreme right as you look at the building (the part closest to the playground as well). The other part downstairs is a work room with patchy brickwork (i.e; it doesn't need to be fixed up inside).

             No I can see how you think the middle of Pegasus is the dig room because of the relation of the door and garage and wall. They do seem very similar to what we see on the outside of pegasus. But aside from this, the garage door of the inside photos don't have three little windows like the imurgur photos you have.

             this is good.  add the lunch picture and the other angle to show the garage door from inside.

             they must have replaced the garage door at some point, though, or maybe those windows are fake.

            I would like to add that the title is a bit misleading. This Pegasus building doesn't appear to be a kill room AT ALL! The rumors going around have implied that the kill room is here in these particular photos, but the photos kinda disprove it in my mind.

             That's why I have put it in quotation marks. A lot of people are looking for the walk-in thinking the construction led to the building of it and thus, a kill room. I have never believed there to be a "Kill room" in the way it has been alluded to anyway. So, yes, I am saying that there isn't a "kill room" at Pegasus. 
Although there is possibly a basement.

             What specific permit would you look for? Just curious. I think it's okay to finally call this place a dead end. We're all on the right track in other areas, but we need to put this one to rest so our time is spent on the promising leads.

              I don't know how. I read that investigators here found out that CPP hat no permit from the city for this contruction (at CPP). So I concluded somebody looked that up somewhere...

               What I meant by that is that we can obviously see construction going on here. That's established. Finding permits is meant to only establish work was being done somewhere. In the case of Comet Ping Pong, the permits would put a timeline to any work being done. This building at this residence is obviously a work studio, and if it was anything more (not saying it isn't), I highly doubt a permit would show it.

             The grey bricks top and bottom clinch it - the vertical grooves are in exactly the right places in relation to the red bricks. But can I ask why the "Pegasus" building is of interest as anything other than a place to hold art shows?

              In case nobody answers: Pegasus was brought up a while ago due to its location or something. You'll have to search for an answer, if nobody else responds.

               Yes, I've read a bit about Pegasus but I kind of assumed it was where children might be being detained. I never thought as of it as a possible location of the so-called killroom.

               I definitely see the Square form office being at Pegasus . These are the same rooms. Same windows doors and white brick.

               And the dig site visually matches the steelworks workshop. But you can see Comet pizza through the doorway of the dig site photo and they have thw same steel beams.

               Great find on the Square Form connection though.

                I personally can't see through the doorway to Comet Pizza. There's nothing in the doorway to indicate that it's CPP. The ping pong tables are what throw it off. It's not a far out claim to say though that this building was storage for a while. James could use it for anything while owning it.

                 This could all be coincidence but look at this and see the similarities to comet.

                    Yeah also when looking at it as a stool, first I think the door is further back in the restaurant so you wouldn't see that bar, second you don't see the bar where's the bar? But he nailed it it's a tool box! Good find!

                     Yeah, I thought the toolbox was the bar and the crossbeam, but it was one of those things where I was still reconciling issues like the white background and no bottles, and the front windows seemed too close. Anyway, human mind filling in blanks.

                  I think that it is next CPP, but I think that there has to be another explanation, because the bar stool and the beams across the bar are too close together. There are no drinks through the door way.

                   Thanks, I've come to the conclusion that they brought the old barstools to pegasus and that's why it resembles comet through the doorway. This clears up some of the things that I wasn't sure about, like you say no drinks. It's crazy how close in look things are. Cheers

                  I'm sorry but there is a very big difference between the evidence suggested in those pics than from the ones I and others have shared. I find that evidence to be of very poor quality. The beams run through Comet all over, there's not just one. But just to reiterate a point I made about 5039 unit 7 quite a while ago; Politics &amp; Prose holds book groups there, here is a more recent one

                  How can they do that if it's some secret kill room space? They can't.

                   I never said it was the kill room. I said it was the dig room. Don't draw conclusions about the kill room and the dig room about being connected. Quality of my photos notwithstanding, because I'm on my phone on a bus, and I'm not here for a pissing contest so relax, the ONLY things that have me leaning that the pegasus building could be the dig room are the flourescent lighting through the door of the square form party matching Margot's workshop lighting--circumstantial, the door and the garage in a similar placement to the outside of pegasus -- circumstantial, the possibility that the comet ping pong table and red bar stool were brought into pegasus because now they have black barstools there now -- circumstanstial, but the most convincing thing so far is the panels of the garage door inside Margot's workshop are seemingly equidistant to the panels of the garage door on google maps outside pegasus. So much so that they almost match identically in pattern and the exterior garage door has odd breaks where the adjacent steel brace would be.
