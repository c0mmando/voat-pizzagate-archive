            I submitted a thread a couple of months ago about redpilling church goers.

            They are just the demographic to target - mostly conservative with a developed sense of right and wrong. In a way this is a spiritual war - and if Christians were made to believe that their country is being run by Satanists/Lucifarians - a real groundswell might just give pizzagate the critical mass to break out from being a tin-hat conspiracy theory.

             I've been doing a survey of my local churches. Most aren't likely receptive to the idea. I've noticed sinister iconography among many of them.

            <p>
             Granted I live in a fairly wealthy area. Monied people are less likely to make the sacrifices to the status quo necessary to affect change. Some are likely involved. There are masons in my nearest church for example.

             It's a good idea, but I would say that my congregation is split about 50/50 between liberal and conservative. Plus it's a church and many of them are old so how do I bring up the subject? Yeah the game was great last night, by the way have you heard about the pedophilia that is running rampant in DC?

              It's the preachers and pastors that need to be redpilled.Then they can bring it up in church in a sermon or prayers. I know some are corrupt, but they are the only figures in authority that have not been totally compromised. Forget the MSM, police and politicians - concentrate on those in the Good vs Evil business - it's their job for God's sake!

               I feel that a lot of people that go to church don't want to hear about politics, I know I don't.
 Some Pastors are awake, some asleep, some opposition. My church doesn't have a permanent pastor, they rotate every week. We had a woman that instead of giving a sermon decided to tell us about how she went to the woman's march the Sunday after the election (the one where they wore pussy hats)  and tell us how those are just poor people trying to have their voices heard. Then afterward she had the nerve to comment on how much she loved our congregation and we are great and would never tell anyone what she talked about. She hasn't been back since.

            In general I don't think an "awakening" is happening yet... I feel like the leaks have certainly started a fire in people's minds that is spreading slowly, but, for the masses? A leak is still not enough. I speak with people about this regularly and the consensus from those who remain ignorant is that this is all "hard to believe" and an "impossible conspiracy theory" - even with subjects that are blatantly proven to be true in the leaks, people don't believe it. Even with precedents set by previous arrests/court cases that graphically depict the kind of abuse we try to stop, they don't believe it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The awakening needs to be something that shatters the conception and forces these people to acknowledge how depraved the powers that be actually are... like, literally concrete evidence so impossible to ignore, it makes it to the homepage of CNN.com with actual politicians/elites being named/charged and their crimes detailed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until then? It's a slow, slow burn fuse. The time frame of our current awakening is the polar opposite of nano-thermite.

              Agreed! That's where the elite excel and we're completely dependent on whistle blowers and leaks in between connecting the dots/information.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are chunks of the story that seemed like we had a good chance:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               The server location in Hawaii (off the grid, separate networks)
              </li>
              <li>
               The CP allegedly hacked from CPP's private domain
              </li>
              <li>
               The lack of any explanation behind the leaked emails/messages pertaining to questionable behavior (namely the Luzzato pool party and the pizza related hankerchief)
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              A lot of smoke, but, no ability to illustrate the fire/source.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is frustrating for sure.

            Idk how new you are to the "conspiracy" movement in general, but I've heard at least 50 different researchers, whistleblowers, conspiracy theorists, radio show hosts, etc saying the exact same thing over the last 25 years.  Something like "there is a mass awakening happening"  Not to say it isn't actually happening, I have no metrics to base on either way, but I'm just trying to establish that this has been said over and over and over again over the years.  Imo, there is no awakening happening.  The mass majority of people are CHOOSING to remain ignorant,  regardless of the ease of access to information nowadays.  And since you asked, that's my 2 cents.

             The discussions are WAY more common, though. I hear random acquaintances bring up 9-11. People are waking up to the feeling that something is wrong with the world, that things are not as they
             <em>
              should
             </em>
             or at least
             <strong>
              could
             </strong>
             be. They just don't know quite why yet...

                I see,  was just asking because you mentioned John Lear Bob Lazar and bill cooper,  all of whom started their "careers" in conspiracy on the Billy Goodman Happening radio program back in the late 80s.

                 I believe Lazar, Cooper, and Schneider were real. I never heard Goodmans radio show, I know Art Bell took it over. I was young and didn't have access to a computer until 1999. I knew about these guys and Art Bell from the TV shows. I know you are a LARPer pretending to be Cancer Man from the X-files, that I watched religiously and know some of the episodes were based on reality.

                  Excuse my ignorance but wtf is a larper.  Quick search defines it as "A live action role-playing game (LARP) is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically act out their characters' actions."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Is that what you mean?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I honestly don't understand that statement.
The x files were based in reality, as Chris Carter has admitted to using bill cooper's behold a pale horse as inspiration for the show.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Bill cooper is was and always will be my hero.
I have reservations when it comes to the others mentioned.

                   "BASED ON REALITY" which means some things were changed and added. Yes, that is the LARP I mean. You are pretending to be a gubmint agent spreading disinformation.

              Dude, the guy was just point out his own experience, he wasn't attacking you. Calling him a twat is uncalled for and makes you look like a hyper-aggressive jerk. Take it easy, save that for when you're ACTUALLY being attacked.

                The religions and their houses of worship are what have caused a lot of our problems.Many of their leaders are involved in either the sex trafficking, raping, organ harvesting in any of these or all of them.  I really don't believe attendance is on the rise, but if it is attributed to hipsters, I find it even harder to believe.  People are leaving religions by the droves.and people that do not identify with any religion now is up to 20%, but I believe many more just do not attend.
