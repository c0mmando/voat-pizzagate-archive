           <p>
            Hello Quarter,
           </p>
           <p>
            I get the feeling people assumed I was initiated into the program because my post sounded threatening, but i was merely implying the inevitability of it all. nevertheless, I am always skeptical of initiating any lasting relationships online (other than people i know iRL) its just too sketch. Anyway, though, I do think your dead on (have the correct perspective on most of what you say.
           </p>
           <p>
            for example,
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Modern Christianity IS neck deep in Paganism. Is it ignorance, is it willing? As with all things, i'm sure its deceitful at the top and mostly ignorance below the eye of the pyramid.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I agree with your veil terminology. (2 Corinthians 3:13-18) 
but don't be so concerned about people who can see and who cannot. There is going to be a great awakening before long. Notice verse 16 and 17.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
           </p>
           <p>
            When will the Veil be taken away? When one turns to the Lord. and what is the Lord? = That Spirit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, go read Acts 2:17, Joel 2:28, Isaiah 44:3....
The Potter has created many who are destined for destruction, and it is just for the creator to be the sole being to decide what work of his own hands should be shattered or set upon the mantle. (we use this logic in our court systems even today, but some nonbelievers still gnash their teeth at it). So, many will continue in paganism and your preaching, teaching, alarms bells and whistle and screaming, will not make them realize their errors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Matthew 16:17
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. (flesh and blood does not reveal truth to anyone, a man cannot make anyone "realize" truth. in fact a carnal man runs from it - unless it be self serving in a way an it feed his belly. but it takes "that spirit" in order that a man deny himself and accept a fact that he must bow to [repent].
           </p>
           <p>
            Matthew 11:15
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. (this was said by Yahusha himself, and we can safely assume those in the crowd had physical ears, yes, the"ears" he spoke of were not of the body, but were given by "that Spirit" (discernment).
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, a few questions from you, I'm not really an expert in anything, rather i am an amateur read-searcher. But I am heavily versed in scripture (both biblical and extra-biblical books that i feel were acknowledged by the writers of the major books) and also in many areas of the Occult, SRA, ritualistic ceremony, and I collect a lot of Pagan and Occult lit (a lot that I assume I was not meant to have), and through this i am able to gain a big picture opinion of it all, a bird eye, not a lot of detail up close (i don't think any of us researchers do have this detail in all areas), but I am fairly certain my foundations are set up right and the small amount of scaffolding I have set up is climbing in the right direction., anyway....
           </p>
           <p>
            Q1: I saw you mention that the star that was followed to the messiah was in fact Lucifer, and you spoke of his meeting with who i suppose you mean to be King Herod. I ask this because I had never heard of this before in my reading and was wondering what sources you pull it from. (i don't deny it just curious).
           </p>
           <p>
            Q2: The symbols you mentioned, i am mostly all familiar with from scripture, I assume the "star" you mention I assume is either your reference to the "morning star" or the "star of Remphan" (modern seal of Solomon, six point Jewish star). But one I am curious about it the Bird cage, and your assertion that Ha Satan was referred to as a "bird catcher" in scripture, can you point me to this?
           </p>
           <p>
            I have also noticed you speak kind of cryptically, "I saw you coming from afar, did you see me?" Is there something behind this or is this an internet persona? I am a no nonsense kind of guy straight to the point, I have spent years combing through books and books of long drawn out pagan nonsense babble that circles around to nothing ALMOST every time. (Esp. Masonry and these groups). - so, because of this i have developed an impatient "stick and move" strategy, I am surprised I have written all of this actually, lol, but your eye for utilizing scripture in all of this intrigued me, most wouldn't, because they are programmed to call the Scriptures, "old dead superstitious bigotry and myth" - but in the same breathe speak of aliens, lizard men, new age magic, etc etc etc...
           </p>
           <p>
            anyway, i replied.

            Aww we're related in more ways than one ! I'm also a survivor and 911 is what prompted my study ! It's a long long long story lol . But I'm thankful to be alive and to see  prophecy being fulfilled as we speak ! I've lost my tongue a few times on here but never too bad . This is such a " hit home " thing for me as well .

            Who gives a shit about "the bible"? It's a fake book, written to control dunces like you.
I don't have any ink, and don't "worship" any fake "gods" of any sort. 
You may think I look "dumb", but it's because you're insane.

            no.  I have a vague idea of the stars pattern originating on the pole of Saturn possibly?  Please enlighten me.  Or point me to somewhere i can read or watch about it myself.  very interested.

            Your going to see that the culture bubbling up in society is purposefully coming from an old source. Through the Hegelian dialectic and very slowly in steps, decade by decade, you will accept it.

              With all due respect .. if you celebrate any of these Pagan holidays , you have already "accepted it". The Bible tells us to flee from false religion . 
The Exodus From Organized Religion Foretold!
Not many decades ago, the present plight of organized religion would have been hard to imagine. God, however, foresaw this development and announced it in advance in the Bible. Using symbolic language, God likened all religion that is unfaithful to him to a flamboyant prostitute named “Babylon the Great.”—Revelation 17:1, 5.
             </p>
             <p>
              That symbol is fitting because false religion, while claiming fidelity to God, has consorted with the rulers of the world to gain power and wealth. “The kings of the earth . . . committed sexual immorality with her,” says Revelation 18:9. The term “Babylon” is appropriate too, because many false religious teachings and practices, such as the immortality of the soul, triune gods, and occultism, have roots in ancient Babylon, a city steeped in false religion and superstition. *—Isaiah 47:1, 8-11.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mighty Babylon fell when its protective waters—a moat fed by the Euphrates River—were “dried up,” opening the way for an army of Medes and Persians to conquer the city. (Jeremiah 50:1, 2, 38) In fact, Babylon was taken in one night!—Daniel 5:7, 28, 30.
             </p>
             <p>
              Babylon the Great too “sits on many waters.” These, the Bible tells us, mean “peoples and crowds”—the millions who  support false religion. (Revelation 17:1, 15) The Bible foretold that these symbolic waters would dry up—a development that portends the imminent and swift destruction of modern-day Babylon. (Revelation 16:12; 18:8) But at whose hands? Those of her political consorts, whose love for her will turn to hatred. They will also plunder her, or devour her figurative flesh.—Revelation 17:16, 17.
             </p>
             <p>
              Because of what lies in store for Babylon the Great, God lovingly warns: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.” (Revelation 18:4) Notice the word “if,” mentioned twice. Yes, God’s warning is aimed at people who are disturbed by hurtful teachings and who want God’s favor

            black robes are also a symbol of ancient saturnalia.  This is why we see priests and judges wearing black robes.
           </p>
           <p>
            many corporations use saturn symbology.
