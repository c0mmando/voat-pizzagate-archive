<p>A little backstory in how I came to find this: I have an account on FB. Through a mutual friend, I started seeing posts by someone in the entertainment field. I won\'t go further than that because I don\'t want to identify him. Why? Because he is a Satanist. He is also a major proponent of spreading disinfo campaigns and fanning flames of dissension. I would say it was over a year ago that I noticed his posts, but back then, he was most promoting his work. People would assume he was a Satanist from what he does and how he looks, and he took exception to that. I\'d assumed the same thing, but he called everyone out in this big long post and categorically denied he was and said how furious he was that anyone would think that. He said he didn\'t know anything about Satanists, what they did, or what they believed. Well, not two days later, he completely reversed himself and confirmed he was a Satanist, and it\'s here things get interesting. Ever since admitting what he was, he\'s been pouring on the propaganda and stirring things up. From cop killings, to pedo priests, to despicable cartoons mocking Christ, he\'s been all over things including the Kavanaugh hearings and calling him a &quot;rapist&quot;. </p>
<p>He\'s been on my radar, but I didn\'t want to make a submission since I didn\'t want him to know I was tracking him. He gives me clues as to what the agenda is and where this PedoTrain is headed. Like the PedoPriest crap. He\'s tearing down Catholicism and suggesting that religions are a farce so why not try something new? That\'s the direction he\'s going. Of course, he\'s not saying that the priest involved ARE Satanists so you\'d only be signing up for more of the same. </p>
<p>So I\'ve been tracking him, but then ... again through one of my many &quot;friends&quot; I happened to stumble across another post by someone I don\'t know. It was the most ridiculous piece of shit disinfo that I\'ve ever seen. It was this: </p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/YFXTof5">https://imgur.com/a/YFXTof5</a></p>
<p>Now the neighborhood is never identified, and for all I know, his mother could have written this ... or he could have written it. I just had this feeling he was a shill and so I went to his profile. Sure enough, he\'s a fucking Satanist!. Here\'s the pic he was using:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Xy0fKPM">https://imgur.com/a/Xy0fKPM</a></p>
<p>It\'s a combination of the Satanic Baphomet symbolism and the LGBT Rainbow flag. </p>
<p>This nonsense about some anonymous home owner not wanting &quot;poor kids&quot; to come around is ridiculous. It further alienates rich from poor and builds animosity between the classes. I\'m posting this to make people aware that the two factions are aligned, and to ask that people gather more proof of exactly how Satanists are helping tear apart communities. Once you tear apart communities, it\'s easy to get to children. You also set up a kind of paranoia which is not a good atmosphere to live in. </p>
<p>I would love it if we would each take note of these things on social media and begin taking snapshots and download images used. I would then like to post another submission where we could paste our findings into one submission to use to \'\'red pill\'\' those who don\'t know what\'s going on. I mean, come on. Rose McGowan is leading the Weinstein charge except there\'s no more charge against him, is there? Why has he disappeared off our radar? Because McGowan is a Satanist and working with him not against him. And then we have the fake fight with Argento over sleeping with a minor. Staged! </p>
<p>So from now on, I\'m going to keep a record of both these FB users. I figure if we all do it together, then even when they erase everything, we\'ll have documented proof. I only wish I had saved that initial denial. It was epic. Then there he is, proclaiming to the world he lied.</p>

            , could you add at least one link to the source of your images, please. Pics don't really allow people to vet posts for themselves. Also, please avoid using imgur. They are owned by Reddit and frequently scrub material, which would leave this thread totally unsourced. Thanks.

             This can be resolved in two simple questions:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) do you believe that Satanists work in high positions in government? Perhaps Hillary Clinton and the like come to mind.
2) do you believe that the LGBT agenda has been pushed by the government? Perhaps by the highest office in the land, as recently as 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not so much that LGBT's are helping Satan. They are useful idiots controlled by the agenda of Satanists.
            </p>
            <p>
             Are you still laughing?

            It's usually a point of pride for a neighborhood to be thought of as the place, one night a year, that is safe enough, well lit enough, and cool enough to be the hot spot of trick or treating. I can see how it's a registered sex offender's nightmare, but don't do the crime if you can't do the time 😁

            UpVoat!  Thank You for posting this.  I have seen so many Rainbow Banners/Logos whatever you want to call them attached to all different kinds of things.  Now we have Satanism linked with the LGBTQ and I hope never, P.   This is part of their Push for Pedophilia and Transgender Normalization Campaign. This must stop. Now.

             Thanks! If you saw this guy's profile it would make even more sense. He described himself with every degenerate term you can imagine. And is a socialist to boot. Not surprising. Socialists are godless. They're pure evil.

              They should leave our religions alone, whatever they may be.  Attaching themselves to other causes does not help Gays, and others either.  I am not for Bashing of Gays or any other group, but when the Satanists align with them then we have to speak up.  Before they came out of the woodwork and moved into schools and trying to brainwash Our Children I left them alone, they were a small minority.  But now they are just going too far and have become way too emboldened.

                I agree. And while I hold to the Bible's views on homosexuality, they are still people that you can live with, work with, befriend, be at peace with. They don't victimize. Any homosexual snowflake sjw that thinks it's a good idea to start adding "P" to that LBGTQ (I'm not even sure why the q, i know it means queer, but that's a slur imho) better recognize that if they go to that extreme, they may as well add an "S" to support the rights of serial killers too. I mean, think how serial killers are treated. They didn't CHOOSE to want to kill people, right? Y'all think maybe I ought to stfu before I give them ideas? 😑

                 Yup, serial killers can't help it ... thieves can't help it ... alcoholics can't help it ... hell, racists can't help it ... wife beaters ... rapists ..

                <p>
                 I guess what they're trying to preach is that none of us can help it. Oh, you know ... you are REALLY right! Just remembered something I saw on Twitter. A dim Dem candidate said something like, "prisons and arrests have no place in justice"? Isn't that saying they want to abolish prisons and arresting people now?

                Yes that IS what they are after.  And as usual they have made another group fearful of speaking out.  Although I have read that Lesbians are not in favor of this Gender Fluid stuff for Children.  They get it but again fear is playing a big part.  This is beyond disgusting.  Please see me new post on the Jesuits normalizing Gender Dysphoria at St Ignatius High School.  Barf Worthy.

                 And PedoWood is leading the charge here. Yeah, trying to make giving eight-year-olds hormone blockers and Whorealina cutting off her little girl's hair, knocking her tooth out, and telling her she's a boy. That's abuse. She should be in jail and not given awards.

                        Those children are just being used to push their Gender Fluid Normalization Program.  They use them and abuse them imo.  So sad and sick and people, especially their fans are blinded by the lights.  Even if I had not been woken up to all the other stuff, I would never have accepted what they are doing with their Children.  They are going to be a mess when they reach adulthood.  These people are criminals imo.

                         Oh, I meant to pass something by you. I wonder if we pizzagaters can use it to counteract this transgender campaign. It relates it to cultural appropriation. Not sure of the exact phrasing yet, but something like this:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Isn't it strange that we condemn cultural appropriation, but support appropriating someone else's gender.

                          Yes!  I think that is a great message.   We need something to counteract their campaign.  Ha Ha.  Maybe it's too intelligent of a statement!  Something more simple or they may scratch their heads - What?  What means appropriation...........   Check out my ping.

                           Oh, I see lots of tweets using cultural appropriation. It's "their" jargon so to use it to counteract them would be powerful. A shorter version would be:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           "If cultural appropriation is wrong, why is appropriating someone's sex okay?

                         They are playing social experimentation games and all they're doing is destabilizing perfectly healthy children to see if they can create their "dream" sex victim. They want an adrogynous victim, one that can play dominate/submissive and male/female. It's crazy. Insane, but then they're Satanists.

                          Satanists or they are completely under control MK Ultra.  Possibly they are using Children they never gave birth to, at least some of them are.  Others just use their own cause they just don't care.  I wonder if that is why they are stealing those Children?  $adonna and $angie.  They can't bear to do it to their own offspring.  Just a thought.

                           Absolutely, they are using children they didn't bear. Like Amy Schumer. No way she's pregnant. Teigen will pass along the fake belly that Beyonce lent her.

                           I hate what they're doing so much and hate that women are so desperate that they'll be surrogate mothers to this scum. They're probably told that their children will be placed in rich homes as if money matters.

                            I am sure many of those promises are not kept but then they get used to the life style.  Sickos.  I mentioned this to my husband and he can't wrap his head around how they have fake bellies.  I said WOW.  I can't believe you don't get it.  They use them in movies all the time.  DUH.

                             Exactly. Did he see Alien? And that was how many years ago? Oh, did you show him the video where Beyonce forgets she's supposed to act pregnant and the belly folds in half as she bends over to sit on the chair? Does he think a real pregnancy would allow the belly to fold?
