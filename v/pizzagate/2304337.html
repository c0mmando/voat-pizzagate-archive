            This shows what complete idiotic scumbags these Trump truthers are.  It won't be the CIA that is stolen from. It will be us.  Look how desperate you are to spin this as some proof that Trump is fighting them. Trump's history is one of a cabalist. His uncle stole Tesla's papers and credited himself with his ressearch. I tire of this disinfo about Trump and the storm and the secret behind the scenes war he is having with the cabal. He was put in place by them and is playing a role. Quit your bullshit.

             What this law and executive order is about is denying bad actors the safety of the US banking system. Their assets in the US can be seized and banks around the world who knowingly do business with sanctioned individuals.

            Does anyone here with at least a few firing brain cells believe the alphabet agencies don't know the locations of the most recent sra/solstice?
           </p>
           <p>
            So where are all the children that were rescued from a fate worse than death?  Where are all the ppl that were arrested doing despicable things?
           </p>
           <p>
            Right, Q says we have to go slow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump sits in his warm place filled with food and cheer while homelessness is on the rise for the first time in 7 years.  Know what trump...that means lots of children are homeless and will have no holiday anything...or even a pot to piss in for that matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            More troops deployed overseas...more children that will not have dad or mom home for the holidays.
           </p>
           <p>
            But ho ho ho...I signed another exe order...I am the great and wonderful OZ.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell that to the children that are homeless...tell that to the children with parents overseas that are put in harms way for imperialism...but hey, the military supplies body bags so there ya go.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell that to the children that are suffering in Yemen.  Make excuses for still training and supplying radicals in Syria.  Children won't be hurt right OZ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Q says pray and trust...I can't believe anyone believes this bullshit.

              This year, Trump has spent $91,655,424 of American taxpayer money on golf trips. For that money, Meals on Wheels could've fed 33,117 seniors FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. For that money, after school programs could've fed 635,936 poor kids FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. Trump First. America Last.

             It allows the Secretaries of Treasury and State and the President to order the seizure of assets of any person found to be even loosely associated with the violation of human rights or any person financially tied to or even slightly aware of corruption.

            CPS is gonna love this one.  Not like they don't steal kids for profit, medical experiments or trafficking as it is...but hey, the parents are in violation of human rights (like maybe refusing some medical treatment w/o a second opinion, which has happened) and anyone else loosely associated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hi, I'm from cps, either do as we say or not only will be confiscate all your assets but those of your family and friends that know anything about your child's case.  Comply or fry.

            First, I am ALL FOR ARREST OF PEDOS and CORRUPT OFFICIALS, but this is basically more civil asset forfeiture which finds a person guilty and punished without even charges being filed. This is completely against our Constitutional rights. Already civil asset seizures are out of control theft by government with no prevision to be represented by counsel. This order is an abuse of power.

            Read it, all of it. Technically speaking, if the Clinton Foundation is found to be an entity guilty of corruption, this EO authorizes the treatment of any donor, large or small, to the foundation as an accessory. Same for her campaign, same for any corrupt campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the most part though, the EO is worded as though it's tailored for foreign actors. That being said, its not like he'd name Soros as a target in the annex.

             PATRIOT act is worse. Lots of loopholes, lot of broad strokes. This targets in exclusivity people that can reasonably be held legally culpable for human rights violations or corruption schemes. The PATRIOT act was about hunting Patriots. This is about hunting the swamp and hunting the worst, most morally bankrupt people on Earth.

               Say what you will, but I still have faith in our President, and I still believe that in due time, we will cleanse the earth of the elite among us who prey upon what they see as human veal. We'll cut off their supply of slaves, and then we'll tear down the institutions they built to rig our economy, our legislature, our courts and our law enforcement.

                How can you write such drivel? You come off poorly. Nobody talks like that or thinks like that. You disinfo ops all have the same quirk, you ignore all that others point out about how the POTUS is obviously part of the cabal, and go right back to your scripted opinion as if you evidence never sinks in to you. We can show you a picture of Trump flashing the devil horns and wearing a Jesuit cap and you will ignore it and go right back to your script.  Say hello to Vindicator for us.

            Q is a complex large-scale psyop meant to mislead with a few crumbs of truth tossed in to make believers.  Note how most things happen "in the dark" or are "80% private / 20% public" or happen in far away or private lands (Rothschild estate, SA, NK), or underground or in space?

             You say we shouldn't believe Q, because psyop. Then you give no further arguments, or proof, for said statement and you want us to take your word for it. Bit hypocritical don't you think?

             "We need" isn't going to get you one - arguments based on necessity are the basis of lawlessness. The legal doctrine of the state of emergency originated with the Roman justitium.
            </p>
            <p>
             Illud quod alias licitum non est necessitas facit licitum, et necessitas inducit privilegium quod jure privatur. That which is not otherwise permitted, necessity allows, and necessity makes a privilege which supersedes the law. 10 Co. 61.

               Not a bot. "we need" implies necessity, and necessity is inconsistent with miracles because miracles happen according to natural law and necessity doesn't have any causal basis at law. The doctrine of necessity originated with Roman law, which doesn't have a foundation in natural law.

              Just because you throw Latin into the mix does not make your “logic” statement any less flawed/skewed. While I may agree with the underlying concept you’re attempting to relay, I disagree w/the absolute terms in which you’ve chosen to phrase it.

To take their money, their status, their rights as Americans if they're citizens and it extends that arsenal of legal avenues to the proverbial jugular of the Swamp to those that are even slightly involved in these despicable acts.

               The Saudi government is a fucking problem, and the solution is Sarin gas.

              <p>
               As for Hillary and Mueller's ties to Russia, yeah, odds are good that nothing will happen. But I'm glad the tools are there to either drain the swamp or start a goddamn civil war.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously Ukraine is about oil, specifically about disrupting Russia's share of the European oil industry. Wars have always been about resources. Soon enough though, our wars will be fought by drones.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look, I'm a skeptic, but one of three things is gonna happen. One, nothing at all, life goes on being overwhelmingly 'meh.' Two, civil war. Three, we Make America Great Again. I really don't give a shit which happens, but I'm partial to two or three.

                   I never endorsed the American government. America and it's government are two completely separate entities. It's getting better, but that's only been since January.

I can't be a Zionists because I hate organized religion and theocracy, but unless America takes over, the holy land will be a warzone forever. At least Israel is committed to upholding a nation wherein Christians and Jews can visit in peace without the presence of Sharia law. But if the things people say about Israel are proven, we should annex it and the whole of the Middle East.

            Will this also allow our Govt. to seize our assets?  There are people that are still in power to do that.  The Deep State is still up and running underground.  This also includes Martial Law.  That will scare the heck out of many people.  May create panic.  Idk, I certainly hope this works out OK.

             It allows the Secretaries of Treasury and State and the President to order the seizure of assets of any person found to be even loosely associated with the violation of human rights or any person financially tied to or even slightly aware of corruption. That includes the Deep State. Martial Law was already something the President can pretty much do at will. It should scare the heck out of many people, many people are corrupt, many people are the swamp, many people treat human beings as cattle. Obama signed worse shit every week. Let people panic, he's well within his rights as the sole embodiment of power in the Executive branch. I'm positive, It'll work out fine.

              For it do you that you must first alienate yourself from your natural rights. Typically this is done by representing yourself as a person, or remaining silent (i.e. implicit assent) when someone asserts that you are a person.

               The executive order is because of the Global Magnitsky Act which is a wider version of 2012

                The Magnitsky Act, formally known as the Russia and Moldova Jackson–Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, is a bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Obama in November–December 2012, intending to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Magnitsky uncovered a $230 tax scam where high level officials were stealing from the Russian Treasury.  The government thieves were not arrested Magnitsky was.  He was imprisoned, beaten and denied medical care.  He died after 11 months.   This stolen money was tracked and ended up helping to expose a much,
               <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/laundromat/the-russian-laundromat-exposed/">
                much bigger money laundering scheme, the Russian Laundromat.
               </a>
               It was also discovered that some of the $230 from the Magnitsky case was

              <p>
               It's these assets that the Magnitsky Act goes after.   It's seizing of US assets of non-Americans who can't be prosecuted in American courts for the original crime.  The 2012 law was only about Russia.  The Global Magnitsky Act extends this beyond Russia.

                I think you're looking at the surface of it, the functions of this EO as advertised, and I'm looking at the intended use of the precedents therein. 'Human rights violations' and 'corruption' are both rather broad terms. This EO, if interpreted broadly, affords the President the ability to lock up corrupt American politicians, to crack down on American human traffickers. It doesn't name them because that would be a warning. It names people that are aware of their impending incarceration, people who's number was already called. But the tools it provides the President and his cabinet with are robust in application.

                 The President does not have dictatorial powers. The President doesn't have the ability to lock anyone up. The laws are already on the books to prosecute Americans for those crimes, but that would go through federal or local DAs.

                 No. It doesn't name them, because the law doesn't apply to them.

                 No.  These people are not being incarcerated because most of them are cannot be touched by US justice without an extradition.  This sanctions them, not incarcerates them.  You need to read up on Treasury Sanctions and how they work.

              The federal reserve is owned by jews, it owns the money and this nation, we are it's slaves, it owns the politicians, they are puppets to the owners of the federal reserve.
             </p>
             <p>
              What was my most certain idea of trump being one of theirs?  Iran and north korea lack private central banks similar to our federal reserve.  How was trump going to react to those places?  Especially generally to the middle east? He reacted just the same, status quo, same old shit.

               You don't have to educate me on the JQ, thanks though. I'm just pretty sure Trump isn't a part of it. But we'll see.

             You are right, seizing assets from Soros and Clinton and/or putting them into prison will never happen. There isn't a "Storm". There is only a social media team employed by the government, that created a psy-op, calling themselves 'Q' to launch a saga of 'Trump will fight the Deep State'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump isn't a jew, but still the dream of every zionist. So is his son-in-law.
