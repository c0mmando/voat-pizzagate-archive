<p>That\'s right, <strong>Jan</strong> attempted to <strong>court and cultivate</strong> (<strong><em>a married woman I might add</em></strong>) a relationship with the infamous <strong>Nora Maccoby Hathaway</strong> (<strong><em>and it seems she was mildly receptive</em></strong>) of <strong>PIZZAGATE</strong> fame who stood up for <strong>James Alefantis\' Comet Ping Pong and Pizza</strong> and lived <strong><em>&quot;right around the corner&quot;</em></strong> from the infamous establishment. The same <strong>Maccoby family</strong> that was said to have issued threats to <strong>Common Council Member</strong> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1516125">Frank Winstead</a> for not letting Alefantis operate his restaurant <strong><em>through the night</em></strong>. The same <strong>Maccoby family</strong> who\'s daughter claims that their neighborhood is <strong>&quot;80% CIA agents and operatives&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The same Maccoby family that has an INTIMATE relationship with the worlds leading authorities on the clandestine MK-ULTRA Project and it\'s plethora of sub-projects in mind control and social engineering.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1943, Dr. Henry Alexander Murray was commissioned by OSS boss, U.S. Major General William “Wild Bill” Donovan (Phi Kappa Psi, Catholic Knight of Malta)(Fuck You Bobby Weir!), to help complete an infamous “Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler.” The groundbreaking study was the pioneer of Offender profiling and political psychology, today commonly used by many countries as part of assessing international relations. Dr. John W. Gittinger’s CIA Personality Assessment System (PAS) expanded and refined Dr. Murray’s models in the selection, recruitment, assessment, training and hiring of CIA agents, clandestine operatives, and government department heads.</p>
<p>Psychologist Dr. Henry Alexander Murray (May 13, 1893 – June 23, 1988) of Harvard University was the CIA’s preeminent elder statesman. During World War II, he left Harvard as the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as a lieutenant colonel. For Allied Forces, particular America and Britain, Dr. Murray developed special psychological assessment tests to recruit and select secret agents. He joined with the Schools and Training Branch of the OSS to write an entire book about the recruitment of special agents called Assessment of Men. The title was later changed to Selection of Personnel for Clandestine Operations: Assessment of Men.</p>
<p>*“Murray was indeed a Cold War warrior—not, perhaps, as prominent a player as some, but a player nonetheless. He received steady funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, which had served as cover for his trip with Cantril to the Soviet Union for the CIA in 1958, and from the National Institute of Mental Health, also known to be a covert funding conduit. He apparently worked for HumRRo. He served as an adviser on army-sponsored steroid experiments. He helped found Harvard’s Social Relations Department, which had been generously funded by covert intelligence agencies. He served the U.S. Army Surgeon General’s Clinical Psychology Advisory Board and the National Committee for Mental Hygiene with the CIA’s propagator of LSD, Frank Fremont-Smith. Along with Fremont-Smith, Abramson, and Leary, *he occupied a spot on the agency’s LSD pyramid.”</p>
<p>In June 1960, <strong>Dr. Michael Maccoby</strong> received his <strong>PhD from Harvard in Social Relations</strong> at the same time Murray was a central figure in Harvard’s interdisciplinary Department of Social Relations. Murray retired from Harvard in 1962.</p>
<p>At Harvard at the Social Relations school, Dr. Maccoby said that he bumped into and started working with psychologist Jerome Seymour Bruner (October 1, 1915 – June 5, 2016). During World War II, Bruner served on the Psychological Warfare Division of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force committee under General Dwight D. Eisenhower, researching social psychological phenomena.</p>
<p>At Harvard at the Social Relations school, Dr. Maccoby said that he also bumped into and started working with psychologist, behaviorist, author, inventor, and social philosopher Burrhus Frederic Skinner (March 20, 1904 – August 18, 1990), commonly known as B. F. Skinner. And, he taught the shadow government and the CIA and the ILLUMINATI how to shape children into anything they want- MK ULTRA ritual trauma abused sexual slaves and espionage. agents.</p>
<p>At Harvard at the Social Relations school, Dr. Maccoby said that he also bumped into and started working with one of world’s most dangerous and ruthless bloodline Satanic ILLUMINATI globalist on earth, McGeorge Bundy.</p>
<p>Dr. Maccoby also worked under Psychologist Erich Fromm. Erich Seligmann Fromm (March 23, 1900 – March 18, 1980) was born in Frankfurt, Germany, the only child of Orthodox Jewish parents. Fromm was a social psychologist, psychoanalyst, humanistic philosopher, and democratic socialist. He was associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory. Fromm’s Jewish background had an influence on his approach. Fromm studied the Talmud at an early age and was profoundly influenced by the ethical and humanistic implications of the writings as well as the mystical revelations found throughout.</p>

<p><strong>The Maccoby\'s have also intermarried to include into their family line a quite notable pedigree:</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Michael Maccoby’s other daughter is Izzette Maccoby Folger. She is a longtime Washington DC friend of Alefantis. They are connected to the DC nonprofit art group, Transformer. Izzette is married to DC financial advisor Neil Folger. Along with Tony Podesta and Alefantis, Neil is expressly in the Transformer’s Visionary Leaders’ Circle.</p>

<p>I thought that this might be of some interest to the <strong>PIZZAGATE community</strong> considering <strong>Ms. Maccoby\'s</strong> characterization of the entire event and some of the things she says, like, <strong><em>most interestingly</em></strong>, that:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Publicly Nora said Pizzagate was a psyop. Privately she said that it was most likely... <a href="https://i1.wp.com/burners.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-26-10.08.07.png?w=610&amp;ssl=1">True</a>.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Interesting as well that she states that <strong><em>&quot;they&quot;</em></strong> are keeping track of every discovery on **Pizzagate. <strong>Hi guys!!!</strong> 👋🖕Learn anything about yourselves, Fuckers?</p>',

            The names Jan has chosen are interesting: 'Gnosticmedia' and 'LogosMedia'. 'Logos' is a favourite word used by gnostics. Gnostics believe that God, the one who made the universe, is not a benevolent being and that Yahweh, the demiurge, created the physical world. Yahweh wants to keep us captive and ignorant, slavishly following him. He cares not that humans suffer. But Lucifer, the lightbearer, seeks to liberate us by waking us up to knowledge so that we can take our rightful place next to God.

             This
            </a>
            explains how the lucifer of freemasonry is the embodiment of reason and reason. Luciferians, like the Templar Knights, despise Jesus and believe John the Baptist was the redeemer and Jesus the usurper.    Sounds like Jan might be a luciferian.

             Right. Well I do believe that Yawn and crew struggled with that idea and thus the name change. I'm pretty sure, like most of us, Yawn has had an evolution and this name change to Logos media is supposed to reflect that. However, Yawn has relapsed into paranoia and delusion and has gone on a scorched earth policy where everyone he ever worked with is a spook, so I have sarcastically reverted him back to a gnostic. In all reality though he has addressed this issue and has tried to correct it but the scar, and the legacy he was trying to create, has hit some very bumpy roads because of his caustic personality traits.

              I do not believe he is a luciferian in any way. I do believe he can and is a good person with a decent heart who is, so to say for the time being, a little caught up in his own aura. I do believe things will even out for him and he can get back on track with his research but his current tact has lead him astray.

            Sorry, but I don't get it - what do you mean by 'little secret'? Did they have an affair or something? Because the screenshots show him only talking about flirting a bit.

             The 'little secret' is the entire interaction, including the pertinent information that might have lead us to believe that there is and was definitely much more to the entire episode.

            <p>
             Although I am unaware of any other interactions physical or orally speculation can and could remain up in the air as to how far he pursued the relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
             Although I do employ a bit of poetic license implying something deeper one can surmise as I did on this line of thinking,Yawn believes he's a real Playboy when he thinks he has a chance.

             She claims her Dad is not dirty (so who is she implying

             Publicly Nora said Pizzagate was a psyop. Privately she said that it was most likely... True.

             If there was one event that seems to have marked a turning point in Jan’s life, and a dramatic shift in his behavior and treatment of those around him who thought of themselves as his friends, it would have to be his involvement with someone from an infamous CIA family. Nora Maccoby made a video about “growing up in a CIA family”. Her Dad is James Alefantis’ lawyer. She seems to have reached out to Jan and tried to engage with him around the time he started turning on everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further bizarre connections to this family come from Stephen Biss, who happens to be the lawyer for Defango, Robert David Steele, and Timothy Holmseth. Biss’s wife has been giving large superchat donations to truther channels under the name Ahme, trying to “correct the record” about the Maccoby’s Friends of the Orphans charity not being the same one that Haitian child trafficker Laura Silsby and her lawyer were connected to.

                Hmm, I'm vaguely familiar with Holmseth and he didn't send up any immediate flags to me but I never really dug into any of it.  DeFango and Steele are both full of shit imo. The lawyer thing is a little weird if it's true. Anyone know where all three of these guys live? I think Holmseth is in Minnesota or maybe Wisconson. I'm not sure which.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm pretty much to the point where I don't trust what any of these people have to say about each other.

                  Ah, I gotcha. I don't even remember any of the specifics he talked about. Pretty sure I encountered him pre-pizzagate. I saw he went or was going to jail for a while here recently but I've been too occupied with other stuff to take the time to refresh my memory. I know he'd been battling legal stuff for quite some time.

                   Yes. Do you maybe remember whether he was accused of dometic violence? I vaguely seem to remember that. If true, it could be 1) a legit claim or 2) be an attempt to harass him.

                    I don't remember exactly. It seems like he was getting messed with when I first came across his website several years ago and I never kept up with what was going on. It had something to do with Haleigh Cummings' disappearance. IIRC the cops were fucking with him even back then. A couple weeks back someone posted a question in
                    <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/whatever">
                     v/whatever
                    </a>
                    about a boys reform school in Florida with a bunch of graves and I mistakenly thought that was what Holmseth was involved with so I started searching stuff with his name. That's where I saw he was going to court or maybe it was sentencing. I didn't really pay much attention because that wasn't what I was looking for at the time. I just thought to myself, 'Huh, they are still fucking with this guy?'

            It's not difficult to see the issues that you suffer from that you seem oblivious to yourself. This is why you have friends around you that can pull you back from this behavior but since you have alienated everyone in your periphery and control the narrative on your Youtube account noone can tell you anything or you will delete it. As Steve Outrim said you do not even follow the rules of your precious Trivium and you are resembling more of a cult atmosphere than any research conglomerate I've ever known.

            This brother needs to take a step back and reassess where he is going with his research because as it stands now he is in a deep and fast sinking hole.

            The second and third Irving Maccoby are the same. Is this intentional?

            Interestingly enough, this discussion has arisen from the tumultuous and exhausting infighting between various organizations within the conspiracy research community. As we have been witness to there has been a battlefield of allegations between researchers and survivors of SRA and CSA  in every forum on the net from twitter to faceblock, from AnOpenSecret to Jan Irvin and Alex Jones it seems they have gone on an all out scorched earth policy of
            <strong>
             <em>
              no survivors left
             </em>
            </strong>
            since everyone feels like they have to
            <strong>
             <em>
              "debunk"
             </em>
            </strong>
            each other and drag each other through the mud instead of getting to the
            <strong>
             common core
            </strong>
            of the beast that we all face.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Jan Irvin
            </strong>
            has included himself in this list and apparently has a
            <strong>
             <em>
              very long list
             </em>
            </strong>
            of
            <strong>
             alienating
            </strong>
            those that he tries to establish relationships with notwithstanding his latest literary assault on
            <strong>
             Fiona Barnett
            </strong>
            and most of the long term "friends" and partners Irving has collaborated with over the past ten years including the purveyor of this information researcher and philanthropist
            <strong>
             Steve Outrim
            </strong>
            , of whom is included in
            <strong>
             Irvings smear campaign.

            As you will see here,
            <strong>
             all is not what it seems
            </strong>
            . This story gets very interesting and very deep, including a relationship to the
            <strong>
             King of Marijuana
            </strong>
            and author of
            <strong>
             The Emperor Wears No Clothes Jack Herer
            </strong>
            , speculation of pedophilia, MORMOM CHILD BRIDES and a slew of
            <strong>
             interesting details that will expand your understanding about the decay of the hippie dream.
            </strong>

            <strong>
             FALLOUT
            </strong>
            that IS the
            <strong>

           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             What we are seeing with Jan is YEARS and YEARS of  psychedelic drug abuse and it's long term schizophrenic and paranoia inducing after effects
            </strong>
            -dysfunctionality at it's very worst.

              I'm not familiar with Jan Irvin or his particular stance on anything and while I have encountered the name before I don't know what he is all about. I will say that my tolerance for public-facing 'truthers' is currently at an all-time low and falling fast.

               Yes. I admit that I had never heard his name before. But then I usually don't watch Youtube videos, and I'm not on Twitter, so I guess I don't have an overview of all Pizzagaters / truthers active there.

             Alex Jones was a limited hangout, AnOpenSecret seems to be a limited hangout. How do you expect limited hangouts to 'get to the common core of the beast'?
