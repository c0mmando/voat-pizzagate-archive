<p>I know people have been saying &quot;WHOA, bro, this is a ton of indictments.&quot; But a &quot;ton&quot; to one is not a &quot;ton&quot; to another. 
So, here is my attempt to give you context to the sealed indictments...</p>
<p>What is a sealed indictment? Criminal charges that are brought by the grand jury where the charges and Defendant are kept secret.</p>
<p>Why do they seal indictments? Usually in large, organized crime cases, the prosecutors want to keep the defendants secret, so as not to tip them off that they are still collecting more evidence, or that maybe a co-defendant is cooperating.</p>
<p>What is the normal frequency of sealed indictments? The only official numbers I could find are from 2006, completed by the Federal Courts. In 2006, there were 284 sealed indictments across the entire year, for ALL districts, combined. <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2012/SealCaFC.pdf">https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2012/SealCaFC.pdf</a></p>
<p>How do I (a normal citizen, not employed by the Federal Courts) find out how many sealed indictments there are? Dockets (a court\'s calendar) are public information. So, the sealed cases appear on the dockets, but as &quot;Sealed v. Sealed,&quot; or &quot;Defendant: Sealed.&quot; Any person can go on a federal court\'s website and count the sealed cases. OR, you can order a PACER Report. PACER will do all the work for you for a price. They aggregate all of the public information into one document. </p>
<p>What is the frequency this year? According to a PACER REPORT ordered by <a href="https://voat.co/user/damartin32">@damartin32</a> on Twitter, 832 sealed indcitments were filed across the country between 10/30 and 11/14 of this year. So, in just two weeks we have over 800 sealed indictments filed across the US. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybqDYsLxNnkKNEypjHfuzZuXEo1WbIKd/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybqDYsLxNnkKNEypjHfuzZuXEo1WbIKd/view</a></p>
<p>800+ in two weeks vs 200+ all year
Assuming that the 832 number is correct and assuming that the number of sealed indictments has not DRASTICALLY changed in the last decade, then Yes, this is abnormal. 
Of course it is POSSIBLE that none of these are related. But it is not likely. There becomes a point where there are so many coicidences that it stops being coincidental.
I hope this post gives you context.</p>
<p>FINAL QUESTIONS: Is this related to Trump/Russia collusion? Well if this were related to Trump/Russia collusion, would it be THIS extensive? If it were related to Trump/Russia collusion, why are so many of the indictments (by far) out of California Central District (which just happens to contain Hollywood)?</p>
<p>EDIT1: Even though the indictment numbers are abnormal to me, they sounded TOO abnormal, so I did my own sampling using the SAME database and SAME terms, just different dates... I did filing periods of 10/30 - 11/15 over 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Not enough time/energy to do ALL districts, but here is Arkansas:
2013: 3 cases filed, 1 sealed
2014: 4 cases filed, 1 sealed
2015: 6 cases filed, 1 sealed
2016: 11 cases filed, 6 sealed
2017: 21 cases filed, 6 sealed
That sounds more reasonable... AND it makes sense that increased SEALINGS extend back at least a year because organized crime is very complex litigation. They often spin those defendants and turn them on the bigger fish.</p>',

            This isn't correct. If you read the preamble of the PDF analyzing the 2006 sealed dockets, you'll note that they completed their search in 2008. On page 3 they point out explicitly: “The research, therefore, reflects cases sealed approximately two years after filing.”
           </p>
           <p>
            It is routine for courts to issue dockets which are sealed until the defendant is served or enters court. Those dockets then become unsealed. So you'll see a lot of sealed dockets if you look at filings from the last two weeks. If you examine these again in a month or two, most of them will be unsealed. In 2019 you may only find a few hundred sealed criminal indictments in the whole country for 2017. Ken White explains how normal this is in the tweets quoted here:

            I have a question.  I would have submitted to  ask pizzagate but I don't have enough points.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have spoken of all the indictments.  Appreciated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today I heard that Jeff Sessions is complicit in Uranium One.  Now
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know if that is true or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question:Does Sessions have to approve all the indictments?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do they have to originate in the DOJ and be signed by him?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because of what I heard  Jeff Sessions himself could be indicted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you if you can shed any light on this.

             If you are speaking about those indictments that are directly from Mueller, then no, they do nit have to go through Sessions for approval. Mueller, as special counsel, has power to seek indictments from the grand jury. The very nature of the special counsel is that it is outside the normal system that might have conflicts of interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             I gotta say, this is seeming more and more like a special counsel who is going beyond the Russia pretext and really spiraling outward to anyone and everyone that is corrupt. Trump.does not have to be worried because a sitting president cannot be indicted.

            I had a look at this Google Drive file. First, a lot of the indictments contained in the files are not sealed as we can clearly see the name of the defender in the first column. I ran a google search on some of these names and at first glance these appear to be small fish.

            posted the info about 832 sealed indictments, he searched more Federal District Courts, and he is up to 1428 sealed indictments in 50 of the districts, with 44 remaining to search. There is a PDF showing the indictments when he was at the 832 stage. It is available online here:
           </p>
           <p>
            Pacer Printout of the 832 Sealed Indictments
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybqDYsLxNnkKNEypjHfuzZuXEo1WbIKd/view">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, he stopped printing to PDF and is just keeping a spreadsheet and adding the number per district:
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15579P4VztZO0aNvejJasb1yOvXUCp3vS/view">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Next, he did a Deep Dive and and searched other things, like sealed search warrants, etc, starting Oct 1st through November 18th.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope this helps.

            Hey OP.
            <br/>
            When the indictments are going to be unsealed, I'm interested in the statistics of
            <br/>
            the defendants ethnicity, specifically, how many of the defendants are jewish (or have an Israeli citizenship).
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think you could source something like this, perhaps with the investigative help of the whole community?

            Actually, looking at those cases... at your drive link, and maybe I'm missing something here, if so please assist, don't seem very sealed when you can look at them... the Los Angeles ones seem to be mostly search warrants, including electronic devices, (18 U.S. Code § 2703 - Required disclosure of customer communications or records.)

            Does anyone know if these indictments have been ruled out as having to with the MS13 sweeps?  Wouldn't the sweeps require indictments, as well, whether sealed or unsealed?

             They absolutely could be.
It is all speculation at this point.
But this is where we can test theories and attempt to see the patterns.

            User damartin32 has been shadowbanned on Twitter. His profile still exists but, as a non-subscriber, I am unable to see their tweets in search in the tweets and people sections. I am sharing this for informational purposes only. I have been investigating Twitter algorithm trying to find out why Twitter will not show me James A D'Amore's tweets even though I am subscribed to him.

             There is some seriously weird shit going on with Twitter as of the past 24+ hours.  Tonight I kinda sorta tweeted to J Podesta that he's a child rapist, and my account IMMEDIATELY got pinged with a 24 hour cage-like ban where I could use twitter to post but only mutuals could see what I post.

            I believe there is an error in the original post.  The 832 represents 1/3 of the US district courts.  They are listed on the front page of the google doc.  if you do a search for Stormwatcher or
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/damartin32">
             @damartin32
            </a>
            on Twitter you'll find this guy who is counting them.  He counted a handful more and found another 184, I think that is the number.  Plus, the 832 does not include the 31 or 82 out off D.C. (Ive heard both numbers, and verified the 31.  That was a week ago and it is very possible more have been added and that the 82 is correct.  So the number counted for less than half the districts now stands at around 1000.

               Just go to 4chanorg then look for catalogue click on that and look for clam before the storm.  Here's a link to the latest thread.  You need to download a plug in and use mozilla firefox to be able to track replies to comments.  They don't play over there.  lurk for at least a couple days and only comment on the questions that are currently being discussed which are the latest batch unless you want attacked for wasting time.

            . Thanks for your hard work and concise elucidation. In hopes you'll do more digging per the user requests in the Comments, I am going to sticky this post in place of the original QAnon sticky, and  flair this "Share!".
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, commend your effort to satisfy Rule 1. Appreciated. Might want to tweak the wording from "human trafficking" to "child trafficking" though. The same logic applies.

I'll try and answer any legal questions i can when i can. 
The indictment comparison is more time consuming.
Just wanted to open the dialogue and allow for skepticism because constructive skepticism is what strengthens the core truths.

             Any announcements on indictments will come form DOJ. President and DOJ stay separate.  If you are following Q one of his first few posts he says basically same thing.  Q says the president will post on twitter if civil unrest occurs.  I guess you could watch for that.  Civil unrest is feared as massive arrests of public people occur.  Sealed indictments are also used when there is means to flee the country or they do not want the press to find out right away.
             <br/>
             Edit Trump recently tweeted that he has to remain separate from DOJ too.

             Thinking  round up would rather possibly occur on a weekend day.
Things need to be subdued  ? 
understated on the streets and villages 
interstates and airport and train and bus terminals.  ?
Saudi Arabia used a weekend day.

            Is it possible to get the indictment count for Hollywood? If that's where a great many of the closed indictments are it seems to make sense to get some historical context there.

            While the indictments have increased, it is not as dramatic as it seems at further glance. 
Also, some courts tend to seal most cases initially until the Defendant appears, so it can be a tough category to read.
Wanted to ensure accuracy to remove as much confirmation bias as possible.

            Very interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just to confirm a theory, could you check the numbers for a few random years?
           </p>
           <p>
            My theory is about the average number of sealed indictments per year. If it is correct, then 2006 should be a relatively average year, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that this number of 800+ is a major statistical anomoly, thus a big "something burger".

             This is the comment that got me thinking more...
2016 would still be abnormal if this is really a complex litigation. But, before that, it should drop off.

             <p>
              Thinking of the corrupt and crooked cogs in the current and former US DOJ.
             </p>
             <p>
              Doctored indictment stats?
             </p>
             <p>
              Know majority  DOJ es don't know how to behave.
             </p>
             <p>
              Especially when heir names are sealed up real good in those indictments.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes.  I am talking about you Mr. Lawyer:
             </p>
             <p>
              Holder
             </p>
             <p>
              Lynch
             </p>
             <p>
              Comey
             </p>
             <p>
              Will add more later.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just like all the rogue fderal employed citizens...
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe powers that be are messing with the numbering...data.
             </p>
             <p>
              Like labor stats and other examples.
             </p>
             <p>
              I still think of Assistant Attorney General's

             <p>
              dead body with a reported bullet to the head showing upat Florida beach side.

              <p>
               DOJ doesn't keep these stats, they are kept by the courts and their clerks and entered into a central database.
Grand juries are VERY secretive and the citizens that empanel them take their job very seriously. So,no leaks is normal too.

             Agreed. We won't know until we see them in cuffs. No point in getting in a hissy fit over a possibility. Maybe they are just rounding up antifa or BAMN or something. Hafta wait and see..

              Yup.  On the bright side, I noticed that Donna Brazile and Sen. Pocahantas both trashed Hillary in the last week....also known as "distancing themselves from Hillary"....So the bad guys are guessing too, but betting against Hillary.....

                It is compromised. In fact, iirc, it's basically using the same search as Google and I'm sure they track shit as much as Google but, it's still not goggle. Out makes my heart happy and dick hard when i see any search platform taking shit from goggle.

            .  You did an excellent job explaining this, and you put it in words that mere mortals (i.e., non-lawyers) can understand.  This is very helpful, especially in light of all the chatter about the "sealed indictments" that I've seen here, on 4chan/pol, and on Twitter.  Great job.  Thank you.

                I mean I want it to be true, but 'momma didn't raise no fool!!'  If it were true, wouldn't there be other sources to corroborate?

                 Yeah, this is a good point.  Google drives are terrible.  Google is a company run by idiots so dumb that they got looted by fucking Communist Chinks.  Seriously, they were hacked by a group of communists so they went crying to the NSA.  I wouldn't click that link for all of the coke that Bill did in the 70's.

              Also about 250 members of MS 13 have been arrested. HQ is on VA and 1/2 hr from DC. MS 13 were hired as mercenaries to kill Seth Rich and in 10/1 Vegas shooting. One of the "Juan Campos" is MS 13. Note Stephen Paddock also had a "13" tattooed on his neck.

             There’s not really anything to suggest that, given that they’ve tried to impeach ever republican president who has ever sat.

              Why wouldn't he? The Dems are trying to savagely smear anyone in the GOP with some basic, JV level tactics that any logical person can see right through. Some of the attacks are valid, but, Trump gets back from a long international trip and they spend all their time making fun of the way he drank water?

               Oh, man! Did you watch her most recent interview? I mean, I'm no professional at body language or anything, but Hillary looked very uncomfortable and tense. I swear I could feel her anxiety just watching her. Let me see if I can find the link. Its definitely worth a watch.

               It's for posterity.  It's to let them flop around a bit so that, looking back, history will vindicate this administration as genuinely being above petty partisanship.  This is about law and order.

            Bless you.  I was hoping someone could distill this.  @ lawyer4justice - I'm not breaking OPSEC to sign up for PACER account.  Search the same time frame for last year.  There are lots of recurring operations in all facets of LE which occur at the same time every year.  If you can get that info from PACER, I'd be curious to see what was filed in this same timeframe, in the same jurisdictions in 2016.  Thanks.

             Me too. I was kinda wondering if it was one of those patriot act secret court secret trial things. Your explanation fits in the sense of a large criminal network, as opposed to a terrorist cell thing.

            Thanks OP! Answers many questions I had about the sealed indictments. One "bonus" of the pizzagate investigation is that I have learned so many things during the last year - about law, art trade, the international monetary system and much more.

              We learned of a network of embassies that move expensive packages puroorted to be art, unchecked by any customs-all around the world. We reviewed the notion that high end art pieces are an excellent trade commodity for traffickers and criminals to use as a purchasing currency in big sales. We also learned that many of our p-gate usual suspect's named have come up all over said art exchange network. This comes near the end of the podesta art collection/abramovic performance art crowd/transformer art gallery rabbit holes. Consider: why else would richy riches spend so much on sophomoric and appallingly hideous art? Because it is attached to a secret commodity that us transferred out of site: kids, slaves, organs, drugs...

              I second that! Unless you just meant how it's used to wash money and funnel nefarious money from here to there. Makes sense, since art is subjective to begin with who is anyone to tell someone else that a piece of shit watercolor painting that took 3 minutes isn't worth 10 million dollars?
