I was asked by a fellow voater &quot;where is the refrigeration equipment at Pegasus?&quot;  I set out to figure it out.  This post is the result.</p>
<p><strong>### The Comet Ping Pong Freezer ###</strong></p>
<p>First let\'s look at <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1544338">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1544338</a> where <a href="https://voat.co/user/anolegion">/u/anolegion</a> included an <a href="http://archive.is/OkTF6">FBI affidavit</a> concerning the CPP shooting event.  The affidavit describes a walk-in freezer at Comet which is accessible by a rear exit.</p>
<p>This was part of my comment on the above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A couple of supposed hoaxers made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMGGSY0A8r8">a video that captured all kinds of interesting tidbits</a>. (Note: the tunnel scenes are alleged to have been edited in, so take with a grain of salt.)</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/icbCAE.jpg">This image</a> is the 2:13 mark in which the back of CPP is shown.  Now, revisiting <a href="https://sli.mg/fRH1UZ">this image of yours</a>, you might see them [the rear exit and the freezer].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that\'s the CPP Freezer -- about a 9\' or 10\' square walk-in freezer outside the restaurant\'s back door.</p>
<p><strong>### The Pegasus Museum #killroom Freezer ###</strong></p>
<p>This freezer is approximately 15\'x25\' and was given the hashtag \'killroom\' by Alefantis\' Instagram friend werkinonmahnightcheese.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/Yuke">/u/Yuke</a> has done research instumental in identifying that the #killroom is located in the Pegasus Museum building.  See:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1536880">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1536880</a> - The Pegasus building - HOMe to the &quot;Kill room&quot; construction site and Square Form

<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1543972">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1543972</a> - Further proof/information on Pegasus (Great work!)</p>
<p>Now I think I have the missing piece - the answer to <strong>&quot;where is the refrigeration equipment at Pegasus?&quot;</strong>  And it\'s mostly explained in <strong><a href="https://i.sli.mg/ETyg9z.jpg">THIS INFOGRAPHIC</a></strong> with some supporting notes below.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Note -</strong>  We can now be reasonably assured that <a href="https://i.sli.mg/F2wqnz.jpg">the infamous hole being admired by John Kreher and Matt Proper</a> was dug in order to plumb the black ABS pipes from the evaporator units into the basement below.  (There\'s probably a 2nd hole just out of camera frame in the foreground.)</p>
<p><strong>Note -</strong>  Source follows for my infographic statement that &quot;PVC and ABS piping is never to be intermingled in a plumbing system.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://ths.gardenweb.com/discussions/2510581/new-construction-plumbing-white-pvc-vs-the-black-stuff">&quot;Under no circumstances may PVC and ABS pipe and fittings be co-mingled in the system.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Finally, I am in no way a refrigeration expert.  I invite any of you who are to correct or clarify what we\'re seeing here.</p>

            I don't believe there is a cooler at Pegasus. The photo with all the piping is from Alefantis' instagram. In the comments he says "we meeting at CORE offices not #centrolina"

            It's dated as 90 weeks old, so adding on the time since we discovered the pics it takes us to roughly two years ago. This is also about the time that Centrolina would have been going through construction (it opened in June 2015). I've found one image of Centrolina under construction from owner Amy Brandwein's twitter

            that is dated December 4th 2014, and you can make out some piping that looks similar, although the picture quality isn't the best. This piping has undergone a lot of changes, as the whole building did, and ended up looking like this

             Ah!  That explains a lot!  Thanks for taking the time to sort out where the piping photo came from.  I hadn't caught the comment about CORE/centrolina.

             Do I understand correctly that you've associated #killroom with Pegasus?  and if so, what you're saying here is #killroom is not an actual freezer, even if it has evaporator fans in it?

              Lets roll it back a step or two. #killroom was a comment on the photo of the walk-in cooler that we still haven't 100% identified. A lot of speculation was then made about the construction site (which we didn't know the location of then) being the site of a dig to install a cooler (thought to be the one in the #killroom photo). That was not and has not ever been my thought on things. I have been looking to identify the locations of things. This is the reason why in previous threads I looked into the surrounding area as well as focusing right in on the Alefantis connection and who/what he was involved with.
Pegasus means something for sure, its location and the name "Castellum" tied to it are more than coincidence, that is a planned move. (that name is also where he thought he was smart, that nobody would ever question it.)
I will also add this; when the photos were taken for the Square Form offices (the rolling mezzanine) some key information was there...that wasn't there. They claimed it was their office space yet apart from two laptops and a drawing board, I saw nothing that resembled a working office, not even a pencil.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also; I am growing more convinced that the #killroom photo is the inside of the cooler that is outside Little Red Fox and Comet. I'm working on proving that definitively but it is not as big as people believe (just look at the light bulb in comparison with the space). A wide-angle lens was used to take that photo, which means size and shape distortion.

              Just entertaining the idea that the ITGOT convo with Alefantis is real, Alefantis said ITGOT could keep talking about killroom. This immediately says to me there is nothing there. Just a sensationalist diversion.

            The #idonitron bothered me. Why would he specify that he does nitron? Anyway, nitron's original Greek word is short for Nitrogen and this led me to the next disturbing fact:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            From the wiki page:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The name nitrogen was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots νἰτρον "nitre" and -γεννᾶν
             <strong>
              "to form"
             </strong>
             . Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Greek άζωτικός
             <strong>
              "no life"
             </strong>
             , as it is an
             <strong>
              asphyxiant gas
             </strong>
             ; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.
            </p>
            <p>
             The name comes from the Greek πνίγειν "
             <strong>
              to choke
             </strong>
             ", directly referencing nitrogen's **asphyxiating properties. **
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Gas chamber is not too far fetched after reading the comment about how he does nitron.

             There's just about nothing I wouldn't put past the guy.  However, the hashtag he used there when discussing the napkin is #idontiron -- "I don't iron".  Thanks for sharing info about nitron, YYM, it's always conceivable it could come up somewhere else in this case.

              Yes, my bad. Some coincidence. Anyway, I guess he toasts, he grinds, he cuts with knives, but... he doesn't iron. Is that suppose to sound reassuring? Haha.
The guy sure knows how to put himself and his preferences out there.

               i followed the hashtag. A bunch of late 20's/30's folks and a few kids. Nothing really seemed off about the comments about the kids on the photos though.

                    This is NOT a gallery. You'd have to crawl or be on your 4 to pass through that doorway (the one behind the young girl). Maybe not crawl, but you'd have to bend over quite a bit.

                     that would be kind of the point of reimagining the space. Also, on the ceiling you have a row of spotlights, artsy ones, that follow the wall along the corner.

                    <p>
                     I think it's an art installation. Is there any context or is that just a random photo?

                   oh man, I would not be surprised if this was a "moving the outside to the inside" kind of lame ass art piece where they filled the whole building with that crap to force people to reconsider their sense of space and surroundings. Also, thought that was like... a skylight/natural light ceiling or something

                    The spotlights are there to illuminate the square glass flooring atop of them. Also, the ground is uneven as you must have noticed and it seems like a wide space (probably under a museum, a gallery or huge mansion) as it spreads to more than one room. The pic was posted by Alefantis either from Instagram, tumblr or other social media as it was picked up by a Chris Zeebra. Chris seems to have picked all of them early and posted them on his Flickr account. To see more, click on the 'go back to photostream' icon (left top) of the picture. All the pics are randomly posted.

                     yeah, i went through the Zeebra stuff already. Maybe a wildly unfinished basement then? With a small creek running through it Frank Lloyd Wright style?

                     I'd need to have more pointed out about the space and the girl to see more than an art project. :/ then again, we all have our preferences (couldn't resist)

                      Nice pun. If you don't see anything wrong with this picture, that's ok i guess. For the thousand words its worth, I personally certainly do.

                       It looks innocuous to me.  The girl looks like she's just a normal girl exploring an unusual space.

              Yes, its from James Alefantis pictures from different social media posts that Chris Zeebra collected and posted on his flickr account last month, just before JA made them private or deleted them. It struck me as very creepy. Underground spot, alone, i don't know why he would post it other than he's into the creepy stuff. Either that, or she's a victim. I don't know why, but the squares, the white, the space gave me an impression and reminded me of Tony Podesta's house...

            I'm still undecided about this. You provided some good evidence but I don't think it's 100% certain the fridge room is at Pegasus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could the elongated walk in fridge be at Bucks? There's definitely a basement there I think.

             Yes, there's an ezine article that mentions a freezer in the basement of Bucks, but it pre-dates the construction photos of the #killroom freezer.  I'd have to scrounge to relocate the article.

              /u/Spoor

             Yuke refers to) make the most compelling evidence as to the #killroom location:

              If it's at Pegasus why go to all the hassle of adding refrigeration gear though? Pegasus is just an art gallery.

            I found
            <a href="http://sli.mg/a/kork4x">
             a larger image
            </a>
            .  I'm not sure we're looking at the same shiny pieces.  I do see where the pipe diverts upward and there is something shiny on it.  I'd guess that to possibly be one of the valves as mentioned in the refrigeration diagram [edit: sorry, there's
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            a valve in the diagram I used; I had seen another diagram somewhere with valves on the schematic.] -- but I could be guessing wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            It could be that we're actually seeing two pipes intersecting at the back of the evaporator units, one would be a suction line coming away from the evaporators.  The other would be a return carrying coolant (maybe?)  I should probably wait and put my eyes on it again fresh tomorrow.

            Just a question, these black pipes that you say are for the cooler? but of you look along the lines Does it not look like a sprinkler system in case of a fire? Just looks like there's sprinkler heads on the pipe that runs toward you at the top?

             I guess I'm still not seeing sprinkler heads, even with the larger photo.  Wondering... what would they want to flood so thoroughly in the concrete basement if the building caught fire?  It seems a little odd that none of the

              other photos in the construction album

             show sprinkler heads or plumbing for sprinklers in the more combustible parts of the building.  I guess we could just be lacking those photos, but

             I'm going to try to round up a larger picture.  I don't see sprinkler heads, but I see shiny metal straps hanging from thin chains - suspending the pipes.  It's possible that those are sprinkler heads - or that I'm not even looking in the right place at the right thing.  Off to look for a bigger pic.

               Ah, okay - yes, I see that!  Trying to research that now.  Possibly a valve?  I had another refrigeration diagram that included a couple of valves along the lines.  Hunting that down again if I can.  Thanks for clarifying.  I've turned up a

            Aight.... I don't wanna call this guy LITERALLY Hitler, but it seems like he's built himself a gas chamber. You know what's not spelled out here? What the hell ABS is. So I looked it up for y'all:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Plastic pipe is a tubular section, or hollow cylinder, made of plastic. It is usually, but not necessarily, of circular cross-section, used mainly to convey substances which can flow — liquids and gases (fluids), slurries, powders and masses of small solids. It can also be used for structural applications; hollow pipes are far stiffer per unit weight than solid members.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plastic pipework is used for the conveyance of drinking water, waste water, chemicals, heating fluid and cooling fluids, foodstuffs, ultra-pure liquids, slurries, gases, compressed air and vacuum system applications.
           </p>
           <p>
            ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)[edit]
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is used for the conveyance of potable water, slurries and chemicals. Most commonly used for DWV (drain-waste-vent) applications. It has a wide temperature range, from -40 °C to +60 °C.
           </p>
           <p>
            ABS is a thermoplastic material and was originally developed in the early 1950s for use in oil fields and the chemical industry. The variability of the material and its relative cost effectiveness has made it a popular engineering plastic. It can be tailored to a range of applications by modifying the ratio of the individual chemical components.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are therefore used mainly in industrial applications where high impact strength and rigidity are essential.
           </p>
           <p>
            This material is also used in non-pressure piping systems for soil and waste."

             Weird!  Gas chamber entered my mind when I first saw that room and couldn't make my brain connect to where the plumbing was going.
            </p>
            <p>
             I kinda think the plumbing in the basement looks more complicated than it would have to be for a gas chamber.  Then again, I've never built either.

             But I'll be keeping my mind open to the possibility of either scenario!  Thanks for your comment!

              I dont think it  would be for gas.  What would gas be used for?  To kill, right?
              <br/>
              Well, they do that as part of their rituals ....kill. Unfortunately they enjoy the torture and the kill.
              <br/>
              So whatever it is, it would be a means of body disposal or (sorry) body part disposal?
              <br/>
              But you cant incinerate down there?   Who freaken knows.

               Not all gas is lethal. It could stun them, leave them coughing... maybe the mace the shit out of 'em and suck it out before getting into there. It's not just pumping stuff in... it could be going out as well. Could pump nerve agents, I dunno. Maybe they set up a camera to watch whomever is in there asphyxiate. So many options.

              theres still an actual building there where they host... stuff and... do... things. Gotta maintain the front. The real question is... where are these pictures being taken from?
             </p>
             <p>
              Cuz we're seeing two, clearly separate pipe systems. So... if they're using those pipes for what those pipes are used for....
             </p>
