<p>Disclaimer: I don\'t support Rebel as he\'s overtly obsessed with sex, follows some useless narratives and has a history of being disingenuous. Don\'t Go West appears solid, but it seems too long looking into this has made him an extreme homophobe. If you do go deeper into his stuff, be aware that odd esoteria surrounds it and it\'s probably best avoided. I don\'t think he\'s a shill though.</p>

           This is a documentary produced some years ago and distributed in various edits. It correctly identifies media trends relating to anal fixations and pederasty. Below the (bad) preview is Pt. 1 of the complete film.
