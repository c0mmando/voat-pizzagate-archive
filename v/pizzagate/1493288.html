   Can we agree that non-shills on /v/pizzagate will only upvote? That way we can find real material just by seraching through downvoted posts... What can shills do to combat this?

            Seems like a good idea, but if you think about the implications is just as bad or good as the current situation. Anyone can up or downvoat and you still don't know who. So why implement change if outcome is the same?

            If I were a shill reading this, I could just be like "Nope! No shill here! Nothing downvoted by me!"

            Probably best to just ignore votes and skim for content. Votes can be manipulated, anyway. If I see something where I'm like damn I wish a lot of people would see this, then I'll give it an upvote since many people are psychologically programmed to just skim a first page of "popular" or "hot" or whatever, but that's about it. And plus some people here get too chest-puffy with each other and start downvoting each other and talking shit over theory/lead disagreements and accusing "shill" like people are crying "Russian agent" out there lmao, good luck getting people of that maturity caliber to actually stop.

           <p>
            Do you think when a group of professional investigators sits around a room or networks online that they go around doing thumbs up thumbs down upvote downvote and pissing on each other? Or worry about what "shills" on the internet are doing with votes? Get a grip. Did you all not just see how some Arizona law enforcement ignored all the hype and bullshit and stayed focus until their day of reckoning. That's how it's done.

             Isn't half of vote manipulation based on downvoting to make the post appear to be uncredible, or to hide it from view? I agree, votes aren't truly indicative of content, but clearly the shills on these forums are working and acting effectively or they would not waste their effort. I want to hamstring them. Considering I have multiple downvotes and no real explanation as to why this wouldn't work, I think I am on to something. True, an upvote brigade could bring awareness to an agendized or false story, or redirect conversation to something preferrable, but they would be unable to bury good info without flagging themselves. If it is truly a shitpost, leave a comment about what shit/garbage it is and don't downvote. I for one will continue to use downvotes on voat as a click guide.
