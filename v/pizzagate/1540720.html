While the user\'s actions were illegal and were condemned as such, yet another independent investigation revealed the property\'s address was registered to ID and (<em>Daveidoff Rocks<em>).[5] Images taken by the (</em>Deadit</em>) user at the property seem to corroborate this, as a photo from the ID website distinctly shows the same area as can be seen by the image comparison below:</p>

<p>========================================================================================================</p>
<p>Can someone please Tell me why this is debunked.... Based on the wiki, It\'s debunked because (<em>Dan rocks</em>) Did an interview (An interview that I listened to in full, Multiple times.  I actually wrote a  long...Way too long...I need to work on that) analysis of the interview  how it makes Dave S. even more suspicious, because of all of his inconsistencies/contradicting, and straight up nonsensical statements.</p>
<p>The interviewer actually did a pretty good job, but there were several instances in which He could have completely squashed the suspicion, or reinforced it, but kinda let him slide.</p>
<p>So anyway, I\'m pretty certain that (<em>Dan</em>) Is most certainly relevant, based on a number of aspect including the interview, that is the entire basis for proclaiming this aspect has been &quot;Debunked&quot;</p>
<p><em><em>My question is; Was there actually some other information that debunked, that Is not included in the Wiki? I mean, the wiki has been turning out pretty well... Even including a few things that I never knew existed... I do realize it references that The Emails in question are referring to (</em>general Dan Rocks</em>) ... But it provides no source.  I do know there were emails mentioning the death of <em>Dan Rocks</em> and his death, but if I remember correctly, most of the emails were redacted?**</p>
<p>Regardless... We\'ve seen many instances in this research, where dead people, still seem to be living, based on activities related to that name, after they already died.</p>
<p>So why are they claiming that (<em>Dan Rocks</em>) Is innoncent, because <em>Dan Rocks</em> Said he was innocent?</p>
<p>It was literally a matter of;</p>
<p>&quot;he said, and provided tangible proof of what lead him to say&quot;(*marty), </p>
<p>vs </p>
<p>&quot;He said,&quot;(<em>Dan</em>).  
</p>
<p>Even though the suspicion of <em>dan rocks</em> did not solely revolve around <em>marty\'s</em>  (<em>deadit</em>) post... It was simply the introduction of (<em>Dan</em>) We\'ve found MUCH MORE incriminating evidence Since then.... </p>
<p>But apparently that Doesn\'t matter? Because the second (DaN, person of interest) said that  <em>Marty</em> was a druggy. Again, Provided no proof of anything, to anyone, he simply said it... and said it in an extremely, smug, confusing, often times nonsensical way. So now Dan  has been debunked? </p>
<p>Like, we do understand that He didn\'t address any of the most suspicious aspects, right? Or I guess I should say, He didn\'t answer them. A lot  of them were addressed, but that\'s where my annoyance with the interviewer game in, because he didn\'t make him answer.</p>
<p>So did WIki make a mistake by not providing the actual debunking proof?  I took a pretty decent break over christmas, So maybe I missed something that clears all of this up?</p>
<p>Because what is currently provided, isn\'t proof of anything being debunked, and it\'s eerily  reminiscent of the ACTUAL wiki and it\'s way of &quot;Debunking&quot;. Which again, Is what is throwing me off here.... Because it has great info else where... Which again, is why I\'m giving them the benefit of the doubt, that its me who is missing something here.</p>',

            I think there is some confusion here. I followed this from the beginning, and what was the most damning thing was that David FS and the property in Hw were arrived at, and THEN the old post about that place was found. So that's what made it so suspicious - that this investigation into child long-aline-of-vehicles-standing-still-ing had led to that man and that property, and then it was discovered that completely independently and months beforehand, someone had made a post about suspicions of kids in a long line going nowhere but really going somewhere bad-ing at that exact property.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Stone the admiral was never as far as I recall mixed up with this man - that was a separate strand of the investigation relating to Stone Harbour etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            All that to say, you are right I don't think this has been debunked at all, I found it to be one of the most suspicious aspects of the whole thing, because of how this place and person were arrived at as suspicious by two different leads at two completely separate independent times. And the guy saying he didn't do it is not debunking, because he's not going to say that's what he does for a living or as a side project, is he?!

            I think it's a great idea to attempt to not set off alarms. As far as I know, it's probably also a good idea to not use definitives, but I also don't really know anything.

            It looks like you skipped the very top: David "Flintstone" Stone is the owner of Island Distillers. He is not the same individual as Admiral David Stone, who is referenced in Wikileaks emails on Stone Harbour, LLC and associated with James F. Blom. David "Flintstone" has been accused of being the one running "Cheesybay", which sells "faulty hard drives", but there is no evidence to support this claim. Stone admittedly uses the names "David Flintstone" and "Bif Skipman" in social media accounts.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you find evidence the two are the same David Stone, post it here.

             Dude. why are you deliberately doing everything I attempted not to do? So I Spent all the time, Making sure that there are no google alerts for the people in question.  IF you're so certain that he is innocent, You've now involved him again. Why would you do that?
            </p>
            <p>
             I understand that there are two people with that name.  I Understand the Admiral is Dead, and with Stone Harbour  But we never assumed the admiral , is the same Df, In hawaii.
            </p>
            <p>
             The admiral only came to light, because of the living DF.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's actually a lot of evidence,that it is him,  It was all in the original post.  It may not be... But There's no evidence that's came to light that's disproves the original post, Correct?
            </p>
            <p>
             Where did I ever say that the Two were the same?  I'm not even talking about the Dead admiral... He's either relevant, Or he's not... But it was never assumed that he was the same guy in hawaii.  If he's not relevant, that by no means The living DF ISN"T relevant either... Or on the contrary, If The dead admiral WAS relevant, it by no means the living DF ISN't relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't tell me to post fucking evidence. Evidence  already  has been posted... What I'm saying is that None of it has been debunked, Other than the DF himself, saying " No, I do not traffic kids" [sic]

              Dude, you type in the most confusing way possible. Needless to say, David Stone or other parties interested in him, would be watching the Pizzagate.wiki. You're saying the Pizzagate.Wiki should change. They will see the changes you're (I guess?) recommending here (honestly can't tell, cause you're rambling).

               OH, and retard... IF you actually listened to the 30 minute interview, You'd know " He Doesn't watch pizzagate."  In fact, He didn't even know what it was, Until an "anonymous" person told him.  At least that's what he said... And you apparently take him at his word, because he said he doesn't traffic kids.
              </p>
              <p>
               I forgot you deliberately used all the identifying words, So I take back my apologies for being a dick. KIll yourself. Shill or not, you're a worthless cunt. Even If I'm wrong about everything, You're just going to deliberitly identify everyone? How does that help? It's not hard to know who I'm referring to when I say "Dan Rocks" after I Clearly state that I will be removing the identifying names.
              </p>
              <p>
               Apparently I give people too much credit. For some reason I thought people on voat, Couldn't possibly be as stupid as you are.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm going to identify you by name in this post. I'm going to go back and Identify you by name in my post that got 200 up voat, and the one that got 100.  As well as every other post I submit. You're a liability, and everyone should know it.

               Listen, I'm not going to say "I'm never confusing."  Fuck, I'll even admit I could have been  more clear originally. But  I will say, You're a fucking retard if you're still confused as to what I'm fucking asking.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not rambling. I'm not saying wiki should do anything. I'm asking a rational fucking question, about an irrational debunking. An Irrational debunking of one of the most pertinent aspects of this research... Or at least it use to be...Now it's not.  The problem is, The fucking wiki doesn't say how it has been debunked (WHICH MAKES IT IRRATIONAL) The fucking wiki says "Dave F. Says he doesn't do bad things] [SIc]
               <strong>
                DEBUNKED!

               My questions, as well as statements were pretty precise... I mean, It's a pretty simple fucking question, that you apparently couldn't answer... With three comments... .So then you disparage me? Go fuck yourself.
               <strong>
                I changed the easily identifying words, so they can't be searched on google, and  You're the retard who used everyone's full name,  in addition to throwing a few more into the mix.  Why don't you just email them personally, That way they won't have go through the trouble of searching their name.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               You, are a fucking retard.  You're the confusing cunt. You're the one saying " Uhh well, The dead guy, and the guys who's still alive, um, yeah, we've deduced they are two separate people."  Ok you stupid fuck, fanfuckingtastic.... Can't wait to hear your next monumental break through....
               <em>
                "Pizzagate has been debunked, It's been discovered that Bucks fishing and camping, DOESN'T EVEN SERVE PIZZA!"

              </p>
              <p>
               You wrote  3 comments, disparaging me, but couldn't answer the simple fucking question. It should be a simple fucking answer, based on how sure you are... Why you are sure? I have no clue.
              </p>
              <p>
               For some reason you think the dead admiral and the living David S. Invalidate one another. You do understand  that makes you a retard, Right? Again, I'm not even commenting on whether or not the living Dave S is connected, he might not be... But  nothing's come out of your mouth,(fingers) that's lead me to believe he is NOT connected, or that this angle has been debunked.  You can't give rational answer, to what should be, an easy question.
              </p>
              <p>
               You;re retarded response, about two people sharing the same name. Isn't even included in the wiki's retarded debunking.  You still can't answer it, and you still think you've made your point, don't you?
              </p>
              <p>
               This is where voat's at I guess... I should have realized that when people were posting to Podesta's facebook page YESTARDAY, as if they discovered this amazing new lead.... Even though every half witted individual archived his facebook, as well as all of his friends facebook, months ago. Literally months ago.

             I have been wondering about this.  The whole Hawaii connection seemed to suddenly die when I started asking for proof of the hacked emails (in the post I was replying on, the images supplied as evidence had cropped out the necessary info that would prove sender and recipient).  The guy I asked for proof replied with some 404'd 4chan threads, then when I pointed that out, he said he would contact "Titus Frost" and some other guy who supposedly made the original posts on 4chan.  He never got back to me, even after I contacted him again a few days later, and I have never seen him post here since.  Seemed sketchy.

              Thank you.  This is answer to my question. Perhaps this should be mentioned in the WIki... Or something. It's insane to say it's debunked, based on what wiki provided.

            There was a whole bit a while back where a guy sent in an foia request that basically ended up with them not debunking anything. Lemme see if I can't find the video.

            (since you made a couple posts about debunking) figured you might be interested in this as well.

             The post is not about Pizzagate being debunked as a whole. It's about the specific matter of the two David Stones.

              indeed it is I still think this is relevant here for my purposes tho. pointed a user who is interested in this kind of stuff here as well as shared semi related information so hopefully they can contribute to this more than I can.

              Dude. I don't know why you keep saying that. This is about this one aspect of of pgate being debunked.... But the fact that dead DF and the living DF are not the same person, was never assumed... At least not by me, and definitly not in this post, and for sure not mentioned on wiki.

                WHAT THE FUCK DUDE! I DIDN"T FUCKING SAY DAVID FLINTSTONE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CHEESY BAY. YOU DID! THE WIKI DID!
               </p>
               <p>
                Neither of you have any reason to say he's not.
               </p>
               <p>
                The one in the wikileaks, Is obviously not him.... Since he's fucking dead. It doesn't mean there's no connection to the two, but we have no reason to assume there is, or isn't, based on the information that's been put forth, THUS far.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again, you fuck... The dead david flintstone has nothing to do with wiki entry, it has nothing to do with my question, but for some reason, It's your entire fucking answer.
               </p>
               <p>
                Dude. I'm not going to waste my time talking to anymore. I'm blocking you.   Actually I'm not. but just stop asking stupid questions, or at least stop taking your confusion out on me. It's not because I'm writing in a confusing way, It's not because I'm rambling, It's just you. You either aren't following this as closely as you think you are, or you're a shill, or you're just confused in general.
               </p>
               <p>
                If this was our first exchange, I would say "Ok, Maybe I was confusing, What can I clarify for you ?"  But this is our 5th exchange. You're still confused, everything I've said still makes sense.

                You know what, Fuck it. I'm wrong, you're right. thanks for the help.

                  dude... RIGHT!? What fucking world are we living in. Like, I feel like I've never had to interact with people like this, prior to
                  <em>

                  Don't get me wrong, I know I have an irrational temper and often times waste energy over retarded matters... buuuut, Dude has to be a shill, Right? Or is he actually retarded? Or is he simply high as fuck?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Listen, I know that Mark Twain and I have nothing in common... Well, besides our excessive use of the word, "nigger".... But holy fuck, this dude is retarded or shill. At this point, there's no such thing as "Trolling"... If you're trolling about this shit, you're a shill. Simply as that.

                 <p>
                  And Honestly, If you're a shill in regards to this shit, You should be charged with aiding and embedding felons, Or whatever you want to call it... I'm no Atticus Finch, But that has to be fucking criminal, Right?
