<p>The suspects allegedly recruited victims by advertising sexual services, setting up locations and appointments for sexual encounters, transporting the victims, bringing customers into the residences and facilitating the exchange of money, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>In addition to bail being set, conditions of release for the defendants arraigned in Chelsea District Court include being fitted with a GPS monitoring device, having no contact with any victim, witness or each other, and staying away from the alleged crime scenes.

<p>The investigation remains ongoing. </p>

<p>John, an employee at Walgreens, who declined to give his last name, said he was working when arrests were made at the store. He called the incident “unnerving.”</p>',

            Hi Dutchmane. Thanks for submitting. Can you edit to add a connection to elite child abuse per the pizzagate definition in the sidebar per Rule 1 (as well as the source link per Rule 2)?
           </p>
           <p>
            A possible angle might be the ICE/gang task force, since Trump has long argued that the globalist open border policy is to facilitate child trafficking via organized crime, but you have to spell that out.

                Is this true, Dut h? You can't edit your submission to include a link?

                I really don't know the answer to that. Maybe break the link so it will post, and since I've posted a link and an archive that will be enough.

                The mods would be the ones to ask.

            Thank you, thank you for reporting. This should make huge headlines in NY &amp; MA especially, but somehow I don't think it'll get much more than a passing mention.
