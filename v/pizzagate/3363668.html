            Hi Dutchmane. Thanks for submitting. Can you edit to add a connection to elite child abuse per the pizzagate definition in the sidebar per Rule 1 (as well as the source link per Rule 2)?
           </p>
           <p>
            A possible angle might be the ICE/gang task force, since Trump has long argued that the globalist open border policy is to facilitate child trafficking via organized crime, but you have to spell that out.

                I really don't know the answer to that. Maybe break the link so it will post, and since I've posted a link and an archive that will be enough.

                The mods would be the ones to ask.
