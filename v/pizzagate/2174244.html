BUTTER is the name of his film....remember Tony Podesta\'s email about having &quot;Lobster dipped in butter...?&quot; We need to break down the connotations of &quot;butter&quot; ...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_(2011_film)</p>
<p>Read this PLOT...sounds like a total mind-fuck MKULTRA programming movie! WTF?</p>
<p>The film takes place in and around Johnson County, Iowa. Destiny (Shahidi) is a ten year-old foster child in Iowa who gets placed with Ethan (Corddry) and Jill Emmet (Silverstone). While visiting the Iowa State Fair by herself, she wanders into the exhibit of the winning butter sculpture, a life-sized Last Supper, and skillfully finishes the Holy Grail cup, which impresses the sculpture\'s creator, Bob Pickler (Burrell).</p>
<p>Bob had won the fair\'s butter-sculpture contest for the past 15 years straight; because of his dominance, he is asked to abstain from future competitions to give others a chance. Bob\'s wife Laura (Garner), overly competitive and socially ambitious, goes to the home of the competition\'s organizer to protest. Bob goes to a strip club and solicits stripper Brooke (Wilde) for sex in his minivan. Laura discovers them and T-bones the van with her SUV.</p>
<p>Laura decides to enter the county\'s preliminary sculpture competition herself because of the social status that comes with winning. Destiny decides to enter as well, as does Brooke, who just wants to harass the Picklers because Bob owes her $600. Despite practice, Laura comes in second to Destiny.</p>
<p>When Brooke appears at the Picklers\' seeking her money, Bob\'s daughter Kaitlin (Greene) admits her and takes her up to her room. After talking a bit, Kaitlin challenges Brooke to a game of truth-or-dare which escalates to them having sex. Kaitlin is drawn to Brooke\'s alternative style and attitude; Brooke just wants the money (she ups the amount to $1200) and Kaitlin says she can get it. While this is going on, Kaitlin\'s stepmom Laura is hooking up with Boyd Bolton (Jackman), an old high-school boyfriend who is now a used-car salesman. She\'s seducing him to get him to falsely testify to county officials that Ethan paid him to help Destiny in the competition. Laura suggests a rematch at the state fair. Destiny agrees; everyone else is disgruntled.</p>
<p>Brooke gets her money from infatuated Kaitlin, meets Destiny after school, and takes her to the mall to buy her a $1,200 set of chef\'s knives to help her in the rematch with Laura. When Destiny gets home, a social worker informs her that her biological mother has died.</p>
<p>At the state fair, Laura carves a replica of John F. Kennedy\'s car immediately after his assassination complete with the president\'s blown-up skull and Jackie Kennedy and Clint Hill crawling onto the trunk; Destiny creates her biological mother holding her infant self in a rocking chair. That night before the judging, Boyd sneaks into the butter-sculpture room and defaces Destiny\'s sculpture with a blowtorch. Destiny, disappointed and expecting to lose now, encounters Laura in the restroom and offers the forgiveness of her handshake. Laura tells Destiny that winning the butter-sculpting contest means more to her than the little girl can comprehend. Laura feels she has little opportunity to distinguish herself otherwise, while Destiny has talent and her entire life to realize her own potential. Despite the damage, Destiny\'s sculpture wins. The sabotage of the piece is recognized as &quot;higher art&quot;, as the judges believe the melted face lends the butter sculpture a greater depth. Destiny goes on to win in the state competition, where judges give a positive critique on her piece, deeming it an &quot;angst-ridden exploration of post-natal abandonment.&quot; Upon her victory, Destiny assures Laura that the butter-carving contest is &quot;not all that you have&quot;. Laura kneels down to Destiny and hugs her, understanding that she must move on to greater triumphs that are her own.</p>
<p>Later, Destiny is officially adopted by the Emmets and Laura is running for Governor of Iowa, claiming that God appeared to her and advised her to run.</p>',

            According to YT psychologist Richard Grannon when groups of Narcissists get together and victimize someone there is a cross melting between the participants - as the high of Cross Projective Narcissistic supply is exchanged. He refers to a scene in the 80's movie SOCIETY where a gross group orgy and body melding / melting takes place depicting what is occurring at a psychological level.

            Lyrics to Scentless Apprentice by Nirvana
           </p>
           <p>
            Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice
           </p>
           <p>
            Go away! Go away! Go away!
           </p>
           <p>
            Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers
           </p>
           <p>
            Go away! Go away! Go away!
           </p>
           <p>
            I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume
You can't fire me because I quit!
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit
           </p>
          </p>

            The word "butter" is only one little code word in an entire cheesy B grade movie script about the lives of people that live and work in the world of MK mind fuckery.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Butter, Pickler, knives, etc..." and on and on, if you know what you're looking at. Its a parody of the mind fuckery they put on people and society at large. They think its funny.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, Barbara Bush supposedly "pickled a fetus" in a jar. That has broader implications that simply putting a real fetus in a jar.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "child" is a main theme in all their doings. Molding children's minds is what they do. The infantile child alter is the "core alter" in an MK programming too.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you "cook a spirit" all the MK stuff is involved in that.

            Decided to dig a little deeper into Weinstein and the PLOTS of his films, check out his 1st film in 1981 called The Burning, is this not MKULTRA programming to you through the use of cinema?  The subconscious only communicates by imagery and it cannot tell what is real from what is programming!  Keep that in mind when you watch this kind of trash!  PLOT:
           </p>
           <p>
            One night at Camp Blackfoot, several campers pull a prank on the caretaker named Cropsy by setting a worm-riddled skull next to his bed with candles in the eye sockets. When the caretaker is awoken by the campers banging on his window, he is frightened by the skull and accidentally knocks it onto his bed, starting a fire. The flames reach to a gas tank, where it ignites Cropsy and his cabin. He runs outside, engulfed in flames, and stumbles down into a river as the boys flee from the scene.
           </p>
           <p>
            Five years later, Cropsy is released from the hospital despite having to deal with failed skin grafts, and wears a coat and hat to hide his deformities. While outside, a prostitute lures him and in a fit of rage, he repeatedly stabs her with a pair of scissors. Soon, he arms himself with a pair of garden shears and sets out to another summer camp entitled Camp Stonewater. At the camp, the counselors and campers are playing baseball and Tiger, one of the campers, goes to search for the baseball lost in the woods. Tiger finds the ball and runs back to the game just before Cropsy almost attacks her.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next morning, a camper named Alfred scares Sally as she steps out of the shower. Sally's screams bring the counselors Michelle and Todd to the scene, and campers Karen and Eddy catch Alfred. Michelle is furious at Alfred's actions and demands that he leaves, but Todd talks to him; he finds out that Alfred has no friends, and was merely pulling a prank on Sally. Later, Sally's boyfriend Glazer confronts Alfred, but Todd gets him to back off, and Alfred apologizes to Sally. That night, Alfred spots Cropsy outside his window, but nobody believes him.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next day, Todd, Michelle, and the kids all go on a canoe trip down to the river Devil's Creek, and Todd tells the campers about the legend of Cropsy. After the campfire, Karen and Eddy go to a lake to skinny dip. Eddy is upset when Karen reconsiders having sex with him, and leaves the lake to get her clothes. As she collects them, Cropsy grabs her and slashes her throat with his shears. The next morning, Michelle finds out about Karen's disappearance and the missing canoes. While she and Todd question Eddy, the campers Fish, Woodstock, Marine, and Barbara search for the canoes on a makeshift raft. They spot a canoe and paddle to it, and are then ambushed by Cropsy, who jumps out from the canoe and savagely kills them all with his shears.
           </p>
           <p>
            Early the next morning, Glazer has sex with Sally in the woods, but suffers premature ejaculation. After this, he goes to get matches to start a campfire and resume their intimacy. While away, Cropsy appears and forcibly shoves his shears into Sally's chest, and a returned Glazer is stabbed through the neck and pinned to a tree by Cropsy. Alfred witnesses this and wakes up Todd, who comes along with him. While investigating his body, Todd is knocked unconscious by Cropsy and he chases after Alfred.
           </p>
           <p>
            While Michelle discovers the slaughtered camper's bodies on the makeshift raft and brings the remaining campers - Dave, Tiger, Diane, Sophie, Alan, and Rhonda - back to camp to contact the police, Todd reawakens and chases after Cropsy with an axe. Cropsy takes Alfred hostage inside an abandoned mineshaft, and pins him to a wall with his shears before arming himself with a flamethrower-esque blowtorch. After finding Karen's body in the mineshaft, Todd sees Cropsy and remembers he was one of the campers behind the prank that disfigured Cropsy. Cropsy appears, showing his disfigurement, and fights off Todd just before Alfred frees himself and stabs him in the back with his own shears. He reappears and is killed by Todd when he slams the axe into his face, and Alfred ignites him once again. They make their way outside to Michelle, who has brought the police via helicopter, and Cropsy's corpse still continues to burn away.
           </p>
           <p>
            The film ends with another group of teenagers retelling the story of Cropsy around a campfire.

             What a sick piece of garbage.  I think we are rid of Weinstein after the second round of charges.  It seems he produces a lot of filth. The world is better off with him locked up.  But does anyone remember how we were discussing that maybe this is all a psyop? Hmm.

            To me this is telling us that there is a CIA/mind control element in the plot the little black 10 year old orphan girl gets sent to live with preppy political parents and is influenced through the use of "butter".  There is also the little girls adult friend who is a stripper, and many sexual scenes...the little girl is later adopted by the weird white parents and runs for Governor of Iowa...who else do we know with this kind of MKULTRA/CIA mind-fuck programming background that later became POTUS?

             Also relevant is the last episode of the latest Tim and Eric's Bedtime stories, titled Butter.  The episode is about a couple running a "butter" farm where they take in orphan children, until one day a CIA looking fellow walks in and offers to buy one.  He then murders the child because he won't cooperate with his twisted plan to display children from all over the world in a kind of horror-show museum.  Lot of eerie undertones.  I thought your post of this was extremely coincidental, as this episode was just released.  Available for free on Adult Swim.

              Well I guess we shouldn't forget Butters, the "bi-curious" lad from South Park.  It has been implied that he is a victim of sexual abuse on several occasions over the years.  Plus his dad is gay, his mom actually tried to murder him on one occasion, and they once chained him up like a gimp in the basement.

              Now that I think about it, the character of Butters has probably experienced more
