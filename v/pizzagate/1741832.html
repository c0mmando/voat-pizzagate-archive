            Want to share something personally about cadaver dogs or search dogs in general. They are only as good as their handler. If the hanker is incompetent or worse corrupt and lying it is easy to have the dog give a false positive hit for death or just about anything.

            After the recent decision not to ban the book written by former policeman about Madeleine, the McCanns said they would use money from the Madeleine Foundation to pay for legal costs to fight to suppress his book.  This is NOT what the money is for.

            Remember how confident the world was that Lindy Chamberlain's baby girl was killed by the parents?
We also know that there was "blood" evidence found in their car which allegedly pointed to the child being killed.
There was absolutely no evidence that those parents did anything wrong and yet we saw a witch hunt.
That was Australia at that time and the world watching the insanity going on.
Lindy Chamberlain actually served time in prison .... until the baby's sweater was found with evidence of dingo
saliva on it.  Then she was finally released.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hall and Hyatt are two jerks who have set themselves up as judge and jury in a video whose title suggests that the parents have 
"confessed" because Hall and Hyatt say so.
But clearly, you couldn't ask to see a happier child than Madelaine McCann.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also clear from photographs of the children at that time that Madelaine McCann seems to have been being stalked and targeted as a child to be kidnapped and trafficked.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the history given to us by victims of how these children end up victimized and trafficked often begins in sexual abuse in their own homes.
Any number of female victims have related sexual abuse by fathers who then have turned them over to the CIA which ran an organized kidnapping and sexual abuse program, and likely still does.  This program MKULTRA is based in sexual abuse to create multiple personalities which can then each be programmed.  The CIA in program MKULTRA and Monarch arranged that these children be sexually abused and tortured and then used these children to program them with photographic memories in some cases.  They were used as drug runners, as prostitutes and as spies to be used in espionage work to blackmail notable politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only evidence I see of criminal activity is on the part of pedophile rings working to kidnap and traffic children.
And, of course, of our own government US/CIA which should be wiped out for the corruption and evil doings the agency has been involved with.  Especially in attacking children, torturing and sexually abusing them over a very long period of time.
Disgraceful that we could even know about this and still let this agency stand.  How that can be???
           </p>
           <p>
            We have Joe Biden openly on C-span live video sexually fondling young females any time they are near him.
How can this be going on???

            I'll believe it breaks when I see it break. We're all rather weary of such claims about times.

            That's a possibility. The only problem is the cadaver dogs signaled twice in the apartment and once in the McCann's rental car.

           <p>
            Have you considered the possibility she died in that apartment? And that's not saying you're wrong about the theory she was sold. Maybe she was sold and something went terribly wrong?

            Your point about the police and/or private investigators putting in the Podesta images. Thomas Baden-Riess thinks they were either attempts at blackmail or used to point in the direction of who they think committed the crime but didn't have enough evidence or the perps were too powerful to persue.

            Your account is 3 hours old so it's sketchy. You could be right. But IF YOU'RE A LARPER then you need to do some soul searching. We're just trying to help save kids and people making fun of us deserve to roast in hell.

             The guy is a LARPer. Disinformation agent. There's some truthful parts in (that we really can't do anything with really, like the Kenia mission fail). However, there are some hints that this dude is bullshit:

            <p>
             <strong>
              This goes beyond just trafficking. It is the idea of human domestication for the robotic future. When there is few people on the planet they must run a controlled royal society of luxury to avoid inbreeding.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             It goes beyond human trafficking. But it's not "human domestication for a robotic future". However, we've seen quite well now that it is all about Babylonian Satanism / Luciferism. Again, they're trying to hide this.

            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               If Transhumanism (attempting to get the human consciousness in a fully robotic body) is the full target, they would not be building already and advocate for solar-shield technology. Robotics care less about some radiation that's not an issue to begin with. Nor would TPTB want to 'surrender' to a fully robotic AI with the risk of themselves be eradicated by this entity. This also tells that the "Black Goo distributed A.I." stories are total bullshit to inject massive noise into the UFO / E.T. / Spirituality domains. Just as Flat Earth crap is the same noise injection into the amateur scientific community, also a dark PSY-OP running. And, just as the "Mandela Effect" PSY-OP which is designed to scatter our collective human consciousness and memory

               Inbreeding hasn't been a too big of a problem for the Luciferist rulers anyways, through rejuvenation techniques. Exactly THAT what they all want- and need blood of the youngings for. Madelaine McCain is a living blood production human slave. The surrogate parents have given birth to her for that purpose and the abduction was a mere transaction. She was an IVF fertilized baby. Technology exists that enables eggs to be fertilized with DNA originating from multiple parents. Including luciferist elitist DNA. Top luciferists have, through this method, "seeded" offspring with their DNA for bloodharvesting purposes (and likely, organs), maximally compatible with their own DNA. McCain is not the only child that carries Luciferist elitist DNA. God knows how many of these 'DNA-compatible blood batteries' they've set out in the world.

              <p>
               Why don't they opt for standard blood transfusion? Because there is much more beyond compatibily issues than just the blood group (which I won't divulge in here now). Suffice to say on this is that our micro biology, every cell and microbe is an autonomous intelligent being with its own memory (it has read/write access to its own RNA / DNA strands as a means of 'private' memory).

              I didn't think of that but you're correct. The whole post kind of stinks of condescension. It's the "This is a fact." bull shit about stuff we already know is a fact like John and Tony Podesta looking like 2 police sketches.

             Perhaps she was sold, and was drugged to keep her out while she was "acquired".
            </p>
            <p>
             Further, perhaps she died from too much of said drug (or from an unexpected complication of using it). They stuck to a rehearsed plan to claim she was kidnapped once her purchasers had "secured" her and themselves, only instead waiting until the body was disposed of.

             That is, of course, presuming her parents had a hand in this (and they may have).

              All I know is Madeleine died in that apartment and they put her in the car at some point after she was dead. Cadaver dogs don't lie. They don't know how to lie.

              is a LARPer or a shill or just feeling like an ass-hole. We've gotten these guys for the past 4 months. Some days they're as thick as mosquitos other days nothing. We get LARPers too. I'm thinking this guy was a LARPer. They're pathetic. They come here and have "pretend time" and just make up shit and post it. It's insane.

               Odds are this guy is just some LARPer. But it's still possible for the parents to be involved enough in getting rid of her body to alert cadaver dogs to trace scents of the incident, however she ended up that way. Pure speculation and theorizing on my part, however.

               Agree that the poster's quote is nonsense because no one can "know" anything like that at all.
Remember when Lindy Chamberlain's baby was taken by a dingo in Australia, yet police were positive that tests on their car showed that it was the baby's blood and that they had killed her???

              <p>
               Imagine how much pedophile rings and higher up's would love to see the McCann's persecuted and have the public think them guilty?
              </p>
              <p>
               What we have are organized government/CIA programs to kidnap and torture children and sexually abuse them.
There is no deny that reality.  We have our own government involved in drug running and spying and espionage in order to compromise public officials and gain their cooperation.
We have our own government which committed genocide against the Native American here and also used kidnapping of their children and abusing them in "Church Schools" run by the RCC and Mormons. Children were sexually abused in every way in those schools and often murdered.

               It could be a false positive. As far as I know, cadaver dogs don't pick up specific dead body smells?

                I couldn't find a definitive answer to this online, but I would guess that dogs can not identify specific corpses. These dogs are trained to locate the scent of only human (and pig) deaths, along each step of the way from warm newly dead to 30-yo dry bones. The bouquet changes along the way, it's quite complex.
               </p>
               <p>
                Other dogs can find specific (alive) lost humans by smelling a t-shirt, but maybe that person's signature scent changes as they decompose? I dunno

            It might be for obvious reasons other than PG, but Obama definitely fled quickly to Hawaii during that wiretapping fiasco. Now new information released by the NSA will be acquired Friday. Obama has now fled to Tahiti (a non-extraditable country) and will vacation there over a month. Makes me suspicious although could be nothing since he does like to vacation. I'm sure there are other suspicious people who fled, but that just pops up in my mind.

             Oh yay. Where did you hear about new information being released by the NSA Friday? I want to read about it. His vacation spot is a good place to hide out until he finds out how this is going to play out. That bastard. I wonder where Hillary is.

               The FBI hasn’t been responsive to the House Intelligence Committee’s request for documents, but the National Security Agency is expected to produce documents to the committee by Friday. The NSA document production is expected to produce more intelligence than Nunes has so far seen or described – including what one source described as a potential “smoking gun” establishing the spying.

               Some places will stay Satanic until a revolution hits...like Saudi Arabia.  And only thing I think can cause a revolution there is a crashing of the price of Oil and the public finally understanding the House of Saud is Crypto Jews.

            Who has fun investigating this stuff? I don't, I assure you of that. I'm also extremely reluctant to believe a single thing that comes from either Scotland Yard or Horse Guards Avenue. If they can explain why Kate took her wedding ring off in 5A, maybe then I'll listen.

              Basically, this is my bat-shit theory...
             </p>
             <p>
              This entire thing could have been planned from the start. Gerry may have found out years ago that he's impotent, realising that Madeleine is not his biological daughter. He also had reason to believe Kate was engaging in extra-marital relationships, possibly even suspecting that Kate's first pregnancy was not the result of IVF but rather an affair (true or not, this could've been nothing more than a suspicion on Gerry's part, a strong one at that but with no real substance, after he realised that Madeleine could not possibly be his own daughter). And thus he wanted revenge against Kate (or just hated Madeleine), so he conspired with "friends" to concoct a story of abduction before the holiday even began. The final conversations were made during his tennis games with unknown persons (this is another matter I believe to be important - who did Gerry play tennis with?).
             </p>
             <p>
              And then, of course, Gerry even said this...
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               I'm not going for a fucking holiday.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The matter of a possible affair is probably of secondary importance to the bigger question...
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Is Gerry impotent?

              When Dave went to check she was okay while Gerry was playing tennis, Kate was apparently in, getting into or getting out of the shower in a towel (this was late afternoon I think on 3rd May). She had taken her wedding ring off and placed it on a table. This was all while Gerry was off playing tennis and Dave was rather keen to check up on her. What I'm saying is that if, and that's a big "if" I know, she had an affair then I believe it's extremely relevant to the case.
             </p>
             <p>
              Excuse me if I'm being ignorant or naive here because I've never been married before, but do people tend to take their wedding ring off when showering?
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT: I'm double-checking this right now. To quote Kate directly from her book, she took her
              <em>
               engagement ring
              </em>
              off because Madeleine wanted to wear it (which "she often liked to do"). It doesn't mention a
              <em>
               wedding ring
              </em>
              - I may have read something somewhere in statements given to the police by the party, possibly one from Dave (who may have claimed to have seen a ring on a table when he checked in on her). If I can find a proper source for this then I'll link it because I do believe it's worthy of interest if she did indeed take off her wedding ring and leave it on a table in another room whilst showering.

             There's enough evidence of organized kidnapping and torture and sexual abuse of children by the US government and the CIA under MKULTRA and the Monarch program but I don't see arrests of government officials or the dismantling of the CIA.
Why not?

             Don't get too excited. They've sent many shills and pathetic shut-ins even LARP here if you can believe it.

             You need to take what he said with a grain of salt. You've been here 30 days. I've been here 4 months. If you're getting so excited over some random comment with no proof you've got another thing coming.

              Agree, these are ridiculous accusations with no evidence except two guys who have set themselves up as judge and jury against the McCanns.

              One very important thing to remember in all of these pedophile cases is how the media is used to persecute the parents.  Given all the evidence of US government/CIA organized child sexual abuse and torture I think more likely these organized projects are responsible rather than these parents.
And, often I see that people are asking how Madeline and her brothers could have been left 50 feet away as the parents had dinner with another couple or two.  The Mother speaks about there being a system in place where parents were supposedly checking on their own children and other children which was something the McCanns considered to be safe.  In other words, other parents were doing the same thing with their children.  It wasn't unusual.
