<h1></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Barros submitted his resignation to Pope Francis alongside every other active bishop in Chile</strong> at the close of a May 15-17 meeting between the pope and Chilean prelates, during which Francis chastised the bishops for systematic cover-up of abuse throughout the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>He also accepted the offer to resign of two other bishops, Caro and Duarte, who have reached retirement age.</em></p>
<p><em>From what I understand, he will not accept the resignation of the 31 other Chilean bishops who also offered to resign.</em> </p>
<p><em>(This remains to be seen though.)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Francis had summoned the bishops of the country to Rome following an in-depth investigation and report into the Chilean clerical abuse crisis carried out by Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Msgr. Jordi Bertomeu of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in February, resulting in a 2,300 page report on the scandal.</p>
<p>The announcement of Barros\' resignation coincides with the announcement <strong>that [the investigators of sexual abuse] Scicluna and Bertomeu will make another visit to Chile June 12-19, this time traveling to the diocese of Osorno</strong>, which Barros has led since 2015. The investigators will spend June 14-17 in Osorno, and the remainder of their time will be spent in Santiago.</p>
<p>Pope Francis\' appointment of Barros to Osorno in 2015 was met with a wave of objections and calls for his resignation. Dozens of protesters, including non-Catholics, attempted to disrupt his March 21, 2015 installation Mass at the Osorno cathedral.</p>
<p>Opponents have been vocal about their opposition to Barros ever since, with some of the most outspoken being victims of Karadima, who in 2011 was found guilty by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of sexually abusing several minors during the 1980s and 1990s, and sentenced to a life of prayer and solitude.</p>
<p>Barros maintained his innocence, saying he didn\'t know the abuse was happening. Pope Francis initially backed him, refusing to allow Barros to step down from his post and calling accusations against him “calumny” during a visit to Chile in January.</p>
<p>However, after Scicluna and Bertomeu\'s investigation, the pope in April apologized for having made “serious mistakes” in judging the case due to “a lack of truthful and balanced information.”</p>
<p>Since then, he has met with two rounds of abuse survivors in addition to his meeting with Chilean bishops.</p>
