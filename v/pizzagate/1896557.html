<blockquote>
<p>A. No, I\'m implying he was once a victim of these pedo rings. Omaha is the occult capitol of U.S.</p>

<p>Q. why is there such a concerted effort to latch pizzagate on to this. hm</p>

<p>A. <strong>Pizzagate is very much connected to Seth Rich. I know some of you will think connecting the two will derail the investigation, but you need all the clues to solve the murder.</strong></p>

<p>Q. Image - <a href="https://imgtc.com/MOyzMNE">https://imgtc.com/MOyzMNE</a> - I want to know if you think this murder is related to the seth rich case. This guy showed up dead in the 23rd district of florida, DWS former district, a few days after DWS lost her shit at capitol police chief for holding a laptop that belonged to someone, either DWS, one of the awan brothers, or seth rich whose laptop was taken by police.</p>
<p>This guy was working on a DNC related case at the time of his death, ive heard it involved voter fraud but was also deeper than even that.</p>

            ok so here's an original article from Washington post (yeah, I know) regarding Seth, take special note of some of the particulars regarding his early history/getting startes with the DNC. Also, his mom mentions about him wearing a panda suit.
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712140958/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/police-identify-man-fatally-shot-in-bloomingdale/2016/07/11/4236fd1a-4754-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html">

            </a>
            I checked a the direct link article, and there is now a video that's updated to include late May 2017 info...yet unlike."normal" article updates, there is no notation of edits, which is expected because of the source.
Anyway, good for reference, just take out the web.archive.org and info prepend in just before the second https and you'll see the "current" version.
           </p>
           <p>
            A couple of things about this:
           </p>
           <p>
            First, I though Cathy Lanier was police captain?
            <a href="news/local/DC-Police-Chief-Cathy-Lanier-Announces-Retirement-390325021.html">
             news/local/DC-Police-Chief-Cathy-Lanier-Announces-Retirement-390325021.html
            </a>
            she left for an NFL security position in August of 2016.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Acting D.C. Police Capt. Anthony Haythe, head of the homicide unit, said detectives are examining several recent robberies in the area
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Also, she along with Heather Podesta were on the
            <a href="http://www.dcpolicefoundation.org/board-members.html">
             Board of the DC Police Foundation
            </a>
            Also, ties with Debbie Wasserman Shultz....All three were are at the 2015 Women in Washington Powerlist event
            <a href="http://m.zimbio.com/pictures/uf4TSRj_G1C/Women+Washington+Power+List+Dinner/QqOCYdm3MhJ">
             http://m.zimbio.com/pictures/uf4TSRj_G1C/Women+Washington+Power+List+Dinner/QqOCYdm3MhJ
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Still a bit odd the panda fixation, I like cheeseburgers but I don't dress as one from head to toe:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He wore a panda suit whenever he could — his mother said he simply found them “cute and adorable”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            and just curious, any one looked into the two detectives regarding new SEIU info we now know? info flyer MPD posted;
            <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/rich_seth.pdf">
             https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/rich_seth.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, when they publish it, we can look up and annual report on the MPD site that will basically list everyone's equipment they purchased, but more importantly give us a name of everyone that was employed there that received equipment. Why is this useful? anyone that gets a cell phone, so essentially names of everyone in MPD that's possibly relevant.

             This is brilliant. I believe Cathy Lanier was the head of DC Police, Anthony Haythe appears to be a Police Captain, Head of Homocide Division. Someone else to look into.

             I'm unaware of any information regarding the two detectives, other than one, Robert Wingate Robinson was found to be the brother of someone who worked closely with Hillary and the DMC. Post by

            There's still lots of great work going on with the NCMEC, so it's a pity to give up when something doesn't make sense. Saying that, you're still here, so you must still be on it somehow and I wish you God Speed. We can't all be on one subject at the same time : )

            Georgetown law is indeed very suspicious, and was before this massage came out.

           <p>
            My thinking is, regards the cryptic messages is, so that we gather the information surrounding the people / orgs. If someone was to come out and say it, everything would be scrubbed in an instant and we'd have no research of how we got there.... just a name.

            This seems legit. "It is related to Seth Rrich, indirectly through the Awan brothers who worked for Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Whisenant was investigating fraudulent diplomatic passports used by the Awan brothers." this could be Georg Webb speaking. He is right. Everything is connected. You solve the Awan Brothers you solve SR you solve PG.

             Why disinfo?
Finally this is a first logical explanation about SR's obsession with PANDA and the strange behaviour of his family.
            </p>
            <p>
             Their behaviour immediately reminded me what we know from mafia movies: the Mafia may have killed your son, because he was a traitor - but that does not mean you can be honest to the police, you must follow the Mafia's rules, because otherwise they will go after his sister, or mother or the rest of the family. And you also don't want that certain details about your son could become public...
            </p>
            <p>
             If you call this theory disinfo, you are suggesting that PANDA references by SR and Alefantis and many potential pedos are just coincidental.
Coincidences just like #spiritcooking of #chickenlovers and sacrificing to Moloch...

              Sometimes pandas are just cute, and Seth first started liking them when he was young, it could have been stuffed bears, but it was pandas.

              I think we need much more proof than this to make the leap George Webb and this anon are trying to make. Calling people pedophiles (particularly a grieving family like this one) requires a bit of proof, otherwise there can be serious consequences. Seth also seemed like a very happy and well adjusted guy, which isn't so common for victims of the kind of childhood abuse being suggested here.

               For two months you've been calling Alex Jones a pedophile CIA agent who is in charge of protecting Alefantis. In this thread:

               you imply Joe Biggs is one too, and now you want to pretend you're concerned about the serious consequences of calling people pedophiles without evidence? You're hypocrisy blooms like algae in stagnant pond water.

            It doesn't matter. Some are real some aren't. The whole point is if you can get people to fall into the trap down at CPP they'll call the police who will correctly find nothing there and in the process destroy the credibility of anyone suspicious.

            Definitely not. I think he salted those words in there as insurance. And I should clarify I believe some of the pedo words are actually referring to pedophilia. But all Podesta had to do was salt enough words in there to get people to make their way over to CPP and start freaking out at all the blatant pedo references.

            These people are very smart. The problem is they got lazy. They were over-confident because they'd run the table for so long, since 1993, they thought they were untouchable.

            "Podesta using code in his email to signal a satanic child murdering ring?"
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know for sure but my theory is he salted his emails with a bunch of pedo terms in the event the emails would be intercepted and someone would say "Hey look! John Podesta is into walnut sauce." (Don't ask what walnut sauce is.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the deplorable shit lords like us would follow the trail to CPP and Buck's Fishing and Camping and see all the blatent pedo stuff like a napkin folded like a child's underwear or the "Shut up and fuck" on the bathroom wall along with an alien ejaculating over a ping pong table while he played with a little boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            That stuff was waaaaaaaaaaay too obvious for any sane person to put there. Pedophile don't general advertise they're into Pedophilia for obvious reasons. Raping children tends to upset any non-psychotic into reporting it to the police.
           </p>
           <p>
            But in CPP's case they wanted people to report it to the police so they could be investigated and absolved of guilt because whatever crime happened it was somewhere else and the CPP Geraldo Rivera moment would make deplorable shit lords look like insane conspiratards.

             I think it would be very risky and stupid to salt your emails with pedo terms if you are already fingered as some type of complicit   cover-upper,  even for skippy's all powerful perspective of himself.   However,  these freaks clearly think they are untouchable and invincible, so maybe they're just this insane on all levels.
             <br/>
             Re-directing oneself away from other crimes by eluding that you are a pedo doesn't sound like a wise play.  Especially considering the fact that  the public might overlook a killing,  but may not overlook political pedo's as easily.   (see the avoidance of pedo investigation in the franklin scandal and  project flicker.)

             I wouldn't count on that.  Have you read some of the  obvious comments that pedo pervs make online?    They have been given a platform and a sense of being untouchable for so long  that  their sense of protection and untouchable invincibility is held up,  meaning that they become more and more open and cocky.
             <br/>
             Some of the shit these pervs put on facebook and youtube is outrageous.   What makes you think a politically connected person wouldn't feel even more protected and cocky.
             <br/>
             The police Newsham came out to support them,  I mean come on,  when you have your local police in your pocket, not to mention the podesta's, what makes you think they wouldn't be cocky ?

They must feel very untouchable (read psychopath/sociopath) to deliver such big lies.

                Not anymore. They ran a very dangerous game. Deplorable Shit Lords outnumber these people about 300 to 1. Those are terrible odds. And if you're anything like me you know some of the men who spent the last 15 years getting slowly shit out of the bottom of the lower middle class. I was lucky. I caught a tree root on the way over the cliff and was able to hold on. I know many good men who weren't so lucky...........the perps that did this are so fucked. They should have known you never pick a fight with someone with nothing to lose but their chains. But as you point out they're psychopaths. They lack the ability to judge how people feel about them due to their lack of empathy. That ain't good.

                 Unfortunately  I didn't catch hold of the tree root on the way over the cliff (long story)  and right now the math is not looking good between my race against time and  future retirement $ panic.  It's no coincidence  that at the same time the public are becoming educated toward action against the multi-layered abusive system  Zuckerberg  talks about  a base financial system.  It seems like their solution to tricking people out of  chains and into ropes.

              No one covering pizzagate and red pilling people by the 1000s on pedophilia is a disinfo agent.....that logic is so stupid.   You may  ot like Alex Jones but he was reporting on SRA while you were still a nipper sucking on your mums teet.

            I'm saying Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong were pre-positioned to trip up any investigation of the Deep State whatever or wherever that was. In this case it was to blow any credibility Deplorable Shit Lords have and to make any and all investigations into the Deep State look like little more than a Salem Witch Trial.

             So what was the point of Alifantis' reaction? Were the CPP a setup or limited hangout, he would have been party to it. But he seemed genuinely pissed off. I don't think any part of the CPP connections was planted. They were just lucky it didn't contain the full breadth of evidence.

              I'd speculate Alefantis never thought his restaurant would be "engaged" and used as a psy-op or red-herring. And he really wasn't that pissed off to be honest. In fact he got a whole lot more pissed off when pizzagategear discovered the basement at the Transformer art gallery.

             <p>
              Podesta spent most of his early years in Chicago, where he was born, growing up in the neighborhood of Jefferson Park on the city's Northwest Side.[5] His mother, Mary (née Kokoris), was Greek-American, and his father, John David Podesta, Sr., was Italian-American.[6] Tony Podesta, a lobbyist, is his brother.[7][8] Podesta's father did not graduate from high school, but encouraged Podesta to attend college.[9]
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1967, Podesta graduated from Lane Tech High School in Chicago. In 1971, he graduated from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he had served as a volunteer for the presidential candidacy of Eugene McCarthy.[9] He received his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1976.

Dear Professor Podesta,

                 <p>
                  Good evening. I am interested in whether the White House can block the testimony of senior White House officials during House Oversight hearings. Though, I would like to discuss the White House as an institution - and not just the Obama White House.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Would you be available to discuss the topic in the next couple of weeks?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Thanks,
                 </p>

            I'm saying Seth Rich was murdered because he was the DNC leaker. However the FBIAnon guy says it had something to do with Pedophilia and Seth growing up in Nebraska.
           </p>
           <p>
            Things are kind of fluid in the 4chan AMAs but I've got a problem with someone possibly putting out disinfo to distract from the real story which is a DNC Leak and not someone shutting Seth up because he was about to divulge dirty secrets about being sexually abused as a child.

             Amen.  I heartily agree.  We will be going off the rails if we believe this story.  We have no proof that this Anon is telling us the truth.  Where is the evidence? We are just taking the word of someone that is ready to dirty someone's past in a heartbeat. This takes our research  down an entirely new path and could derail the whole investigation.  Which would be a feather in the caps of our challengers and shills. I fear that this is a cooked up plan.

             Firstly, I don't know if this is legit or not, it's all out there and information we can take or leave, like the document yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think it's implied by anon that SR was killed for being a victim of abuse. I didn't interpret that from it at all. We all know why he was killed and anon isn't disputing that as far as I can tell.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe he's saying it's all connected, that SR landed a job in the DNC because he and his family were compromised already. That's what I read into it.
            </p>
            <p>
             This info doesn't change anything imho, it may simply give us more information into how everything may be connected. It may provide us with an understanding of how the family reacted on film. It may give us an understanding of why the family are agreeing to being handled by the dems.
            </p>
            <p>
             It may give us a greater understanding about what could be going on behind the scenes. It may also give us an understanding about the Panda reference which many here were interested in discussing. That's my reading of it.

              I see what you're saying. That makes sense that FBIAnon would try to give the pedophile background then. At first blush I saw the pedophile and the Nebraska is the occult capital of the U.S. as hyperbole.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why hyperbole? Because I think Offutt Airbase is the Deep State drug capital of America. I would have thought FBIAnon would have mentioned Offutt and how it was a super-sized Mena Arkansas operation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I get the feeling we're going to find out sooner rather than later. I think it's now obvious the Seth Rich case has been solved and that puts the Deep State into check-mate.

               I really hope we'll find out sooner rather than later and that it's game over. I feel we're a way off personally, but feel it will indeed come. God willing alongside many others from the 'Clinton body count'.

               Your theory on Offut sounds very interesting, I look forward to seeing it sometime. Peace.

                Don't. This cluster fuck is will be coming down within days. Proving Seth Rich was murdered by someone hired by John Podesta or Robert Creamer will obliterate the "It's those fucking Russians(tm)" defense which I gather was Podesta's way of wiggling out of this.

               <p>
                The gigs up. It's all over but the cryin'. And to be brutally honest I wouldn't be surprised if the perps behind this start offing themselves directly.
               </p>
               <p>
                The crimes underlying this are so fucking horrible and depraved I have a hard time believing those behind it will skate through this emotionally. Their entire world is about to collapse and that is far more traumatic than people realize.

                  Yes it was George Webb saying that so I don't know for sure. But I highly suspect George Webb is Mossad and knows what he's talking about.

                    I think the problem you are experience is a natural response to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie">
                     The Big Lie.
                    </a>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I was a European History major in college and wrote a lot about Hitler and how the Fascists took over in Germany. I've know about The Big Lie for the past 20 years and it's been in the back of my mind since 9/11. I never thought 9/11 could have been an inside job because it was TOO BIG of a job to have been carried out by the government. But that's the point of the Big Lie. The bigger the lie the more it's believed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So when the Podesta emails came out The Big Lie would be in the front of my mind the whole time. And then at some point in the past couple of months it hit me. The Big Lie is exactly what these people relied on to construct everything. Whenever in doubt they would make things bigger and more in your face.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trust me, I've been here for about 7 months. This fucker is coming down and it's going to come down sooner rather than later given the pace of evidence discovery.

                     Good for you figuring out 9/11 so early. It took me until about 3 months ago for me to finally get it. I took the Big Lie hook, line and sinker.

                     These past 6 months I feel like I've awoken from a 16 year nightmare. It's exciting and terrifying at the same time. I'm excited it was just a nightmare and terrified what at least 100,000,000 Deplorable Shit Lords are going to do. I'm waiting for "That Guy" whoever he is that shows up down in DC with a Gatling Gun and about 100,000,000 rounds of ammo. You know it's going to happen.

                    <p>
                     To be honest I don't think the government down in DC is going to survive. I think there will be another Constitutional Convention to guarantee nothing like this can ever happen again. It should be an interesting summer.

                     On the contrary, I have no issue in believing the big lie. Having been brought up to question everything, especially media and government, I have always believed that whatever we're being peddled by those who control the masses is most probably is BS. From the second it happened it was obvious to me that 9/11 was BS, as is, I believe, most of the other 'happenings' of our time. What my personal issue is, believing that it'll ever end, ever change. We have internet now, yes, it's very different, however until I see it happening, I won't rest on believing it'll happen naturally. I will keep on pushing.

                     I also think the roof is about to cave in.  And when it does, batten down the hatches. I also believe in your analogy and that the opposition will go to pieces, because they cannot handle failure. Fires and suicides of all kinds will happen. I will have no remorse for any of them.  If there are innocents in their families I will be happy for them for it will only make their lives better.  Get Ready for the Judgement Day, It Is Coming.

            Our bias that Seth Rich was murdered because he was the leaker? That doesn't make sense because we're dismissing this as probably disinfo.

             I have to be honest, as much as i want a real FBI anon to come forward asap, as someone else here mentioned, the fact that this info is just in time to corroborate what George Webb is saying is just a little too convenient.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree that the Omaha info is interesting, it does align with something I heard in my distant past. I knew a psychotherapist who was invited to attend a meeting in Omaha nearly 30 years ago, it was mostly cops from across the US, and they had been gathered there for an announcement. It had been discovered why there were so many missing kids: it was due to satanism - they were being used in satanic ritual sacrifices. And, they were told, Omaha was pretty much the hotbed for this activity. I heard later that satanic ceremonies were held underneath the streets ("subterranean", as Podesta likes to say) at the main cross section in the Old Market, 11th and Howard. Exactly where this explosion took place a couple years ago:

             </a>
             - the area said to be where ceremonies took place is in the bottom left part of screen at beginning of video. Here's more about the sudden explosion

              Interesting about the police conference calling it out.  A few years ago I drove through Iowa and Nebraska on my way to Denver.  I can't recall but I think I remember some really strange gigantic sculptures on the. Ridge crossing from Iowa to Omaha.  It was a head scratcher at the time.

               He lives there, and I know that all the big wigs in Omaha hobnob together. I know that he was pretty close with Hillary, but I haven't seen any proof of him being close to the pedophile satanic cult at the heart of pizzagate. I'm looking, just haven't seen it yet.

             Have you read Trance Formation of America before?  It mentions Boys Town, Bohemian Grove, Haiti, and much more.  I am reading through it now, but I am not too far through it.

               yep, FBIAnon uses it but there are a lot of LARPERs and Disinfo

              I'm interestind in hearing more of your logical reasoning on why you think this is a troll. I'm neither here or there, and it would be good to know who you think benefits from this.

                Well, if they are insiders, they don't have a choice really, if they want to keep their jobs, homes, cars and professional reputation. The history of anonymous leakers is long. Rich leaked anonymously, Chelsea Manning..... and George Webb, not anon, bands around names constantly w/o evidence. We have to take or leave, take his names and look for evidence ourselves. I don't see what's different. We can take what these anon leakers say and look for evidence ourselves to prove their claims. We may find something, we may not. If we don't want to follow we can ignore.

                 Also,  I would like to point out, there is a BIG difference between what rich/manning did and fbianon.  Both rich/manning leaked DOCUMENTS.  These documents are verifiable.  Fbianon is some random ass dude on 4chan probably getting his jolly on trolling because, well, why not,  IT'S FUCKING 4CHAN.  Home of the trolls.  If fbianon leaked documents that can be verified, then that's a different story.  Until then, I hope every stfu about fbianon.

                 Yes,  they can stay anonymous for the sake of their reputation, jobs, etc.  That's fine, but it's useless information in a fact based investigation.  Without a source to point to, then it's just speculation at best.  This investigation isn't about speculation.  I never said it couldn't be true, I said it's an anonymous source, which is I fact no source at all.  Sure,  read everything.  I have no problem with that.  But don't post it as if it's fact.  This type of material, and probably 50+% of everything that makes it to this forum actually belongs on pizzagatewhatever.

             If they can link Seth to Pizzagate, they can spin it as one giant conspiracy theory. It would be too easy to destroy both investigations of you can lump them into 1!

               I, like others have not proof as to who is real or not, but one think I do know for sure is that there are many to benefit from this investigation going down the wrong path.  The Clintons, Podesta, Alefantis, BO, John McCain, Chuck Shumer, Huma, and nearly a cast of thousands.  Not to mention Soros and Rockefellers.   Let's not even start on The Crown.  I am holding off on this for I just am not sure about this.  It just does not pass the smell test, at least not for me.

            I don't see any link to any pedophilia. It looks like Seth Rich was murdered for being the DNC leaker and for no other reason. So I have a hard time understanding how CPP and Pedophilia is involved.

              I agree and I don't think I was busting anyone's balls over it. I just don't see the motivation Seth Rich was murdered having anything to do with Pedophilia and SRA he may or may not have received in Nebraska.

             <p>
              I do see a connection to the Awan brothers and the Seth Rich murder. But that doesn't have anything to do with Pedophilia is what I'd say. Seth Rich was murdered purely for leaking DNC emails and other shit. End of story. It doesn't really matter who pulled the trigger. They're long gone. The issue is who gave the order and that looks like Podesta.

               I guess the connection to pedogate is the closet skeletons of SR's family and hence their compliance in the cover-up? Too many potential false leads admittedly

                Yep. Whatever the case with Seth Rich being murdered or not the reaction of his family was just plain bizarre especially the brother. Who would be smiling during that interview. Maybe he's like special needs or something. The whole thing was bizarre.

             They're clues, to solve, apparently. And it's obviously a bombshell regards Seth Rich, if true. May explain the family's behaviour.

            If some anonymous 4chan poster says it, it must be true.  /s  Keep your critical thinking caps on, guys.  Shariablue is planting disinfo like mad right now.  Don't trust anything unless there is real verifiable evidence.

             I could not have said it better.  I think the Brock chat hack (although old news) was put out there for a reason, maybe a a reminder?  They are buy hatching ideas day and night trying to derail our investigation.  Better yet, to make us out the CT that they keep saying we are. Thank you.

             Fair enough, but FBIAnon sparked Pizzagate. Without his information (plus Wikileaks), many of us old school wouldn't have been here.

              That's the thing, I didn't get the feeling it was FBIAnon, he was much more organized and gave clearer explanations. I'm leaning toward that was someone pretending to be FBIAnon.
             </p>

              But as always I've been wrong countless times and in about an hour I'll be telling you it really was FBIAnon.

               You know you may be right, it wasn't in the same style at all. And.. a poster here is saying that the original fbianon didn't use a username. So .... this may be disinfo after all. I may be close to holding up my hands ; )

                Bingo! I noticed that too but didn't mention it but that was definitely one of the tells.

                I sure hope when this war is over we can finally meet the Disinfo Agents that ran cover for the Deep State because at this point I'm having a hard time considering them fully fledged human beings. They were paid to defend child rapists and thought nothing of it.

                Unless they were lied to which I think could be possible as well. If that's the case boy are they in for a surprise. I would pay good money to see the shock on their face when they find out.

              However, it can not be proven or disprove. What is a fact is that this individuals transcript is vague and too eager to link Seth to pizzagate. They have already led a fairly successful campaign against pizzagate and providing enough dis - info to keep nearly the whole community chase its tail.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other hand, OP fbiANON was rather specific to just shy of revealing or of fear of being discovered.

              I'm afraid this is A+ larping. Aside from the Omaha reference (my first time hearing this info), it lacks similarities in both style and presentation.

               I have exactly the same feeling.  I t just does not feel right.  Just jumping to the panda pedo Omaha accusations are so very obvious to me.  Would they just love to discredit Seth.  Remember he has been somewhat of a hero.  A Patriot that risked his life to out the scumbags that railroaded his candidate and that of millions in the country.  Would they just love to bring him down in the most vile way.  Connect  his family to pedophilia.  Something they know this country would revile.

               You know, you may be right. Your points are valid and make sense, and we have to be aware of disinfo, which for sure is being attempted. I'll take this on board and may be swayed. Thank you.
