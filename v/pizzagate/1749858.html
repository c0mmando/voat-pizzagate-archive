            Here's why Hillary, Podesta and Alefantis are all potentially involved in something pure evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis is great friends with Michael Maccoby whose son is a director of friends of the orphans, the charity Laura Silsby was given children from(for child trafficking). Max Maccoby, director of friends of the orphans, also represented James alefantis and David Brock for a $850,000 blackmail case (I'll link with all the info). Alefantis had several strange photos of children on his Instagram(there's more to the story than just this), he's close friends with the Podesta brother (the brothers who love child torture and morbid art so much that they put it up in their homes), hosts private political party's, has rock bands that almost blatantly promote pedophilia play at some of these private events. Heck, even former D.C. Councilman Frank Winstead accused Alefantis of this in 2008. He's a small piece in a giant ring of potential pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prove this info wrong and I'll leave you be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh and here.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also...you know you're on to something when bots start appearing with the same messages.

            Isn't it weird how people keep making accounts with your name in different variants posting the same photo and message?
           </p>
           <p>
            This has happened in other governments.

           </p>
           <p>
            And since Podesta received strange emails such as
            <a href="https://twitter.com/_makada_/status/805656957109567489">
             https://twitter.com/_makada_/status/805656957109567489
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And this same lady that offered her children also offered their services on this website

           <p>
            Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta(hillarys potential Secretary of State brother and close ally)also mentions a torture room in a Wikileaks email.
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56492">
             https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56492
            </a>
            They both own art of children being tortured and rape.
            <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NHQObjFyJzM">
             https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NHQObjFyJzM
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And how are Podesta and Alefantis tied together in this Pizzagate discussion? The New York Times calls them friends. Both own art containing pedophilia, murder and cannibalism. Alefantis Instagram photos are riddled with images of children, jokes of murder and selling kids. He even posted an image of a guy with a baby calling him a chicken lover.

            Explain these points with a thorough lineup of disproof and I'll leave this topic alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            I never posted any of the pictures that you're referring to...so it's strange that you post those and your only response to my link is "it's not" 
You're so lazy and it's funny how you deny but don't have actual proof to dispute. I provide links and all you provide are opinions and photos that I agree are nothing...

             That's because I get banned after each post you dumb fuck. That's completely irrelevant to the truth of pizzagate. If I'll get o a flat earth forum and mock those dumbfucks I'll probably get banned there either. Does that mean that I'll be on the losing side? What a dumb fuck you are.
