           I think breitbart was onto podesta but I don't think that's what got him killed.  It was proof of him being a foreign exchange student (not an American born citizen) and proof of his working with Ayers of weather underground.  There is video of him saying he would release the tapes March 1st.  He was killed on march 1st.  The coroner WAS indeed poisoned, but the media tried to say that the coroner that was poisoned was not the coroner assigned to breitbart.

            Given what we now know about Podesta, it seems by far the likeliest motive. We KNOW now that Podesta had a lot to hide and Breitbart's death seems to have been the only thing that allowed him to keep it hidden for several more years. The article you cite admits that the tape, which has since been released, was no big deal.
