<p>Alright... So I think this is a good Idea, But I\'m sure someone will explain to me how I\'m wrong.</p>
<p>So I\'m basically throwing away my anonymity, but only because I feel I\'m adequately protected at this point... Believe it or not, there are many more powerful &quot;Good Guys&quot; then there are bad guys (At least where I\'m at) Plus Now that trump is actually are president, the powerful bad guys have lost a lot of their power. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not naive enough to assume that the bad guys are now <strong>powerless.</strong>  If they still want to kill me, or any of us for that matter... They can. But the odds of that happening today, are substantially less then they were 24 hours ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I\'m also not narcissistic enough to think that I\'m important enough to even warrant a hit... But ya never know. I\'m sure  If my car breaks down in the middle of a desert, and a CIA agent happens to be the first person to stop and help.... I\'m sure they would kill me if they knew I contributed anything to the pizzagate research.... Luckily my cars reliable and I don\'t live near a desert. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>==============================================================================================</p>
<p><strong>So anyways, I  have a dog, who happens to be the best Skateboarding Dog In the World.</strong>  I\'ve been given countless offers from liscening companies, managers, news outlets, t.v shows, all interested in Harley and I (Fine...Mostly Harley).  <strong>I have turned them all Down.</strong> </p>
<p>I\'m going to give you some context, as to why I think it would be extremely valuable asset, If utilized properly.</p>
<p>but if you want to skip to the point of this post, Skip to the TLDR.</p>
<hr />
<p>She made it to the front page of deddit a year or two ago, and beause of that she became youtube \'famous\'.  Then last july one of the original videos, went viral again... So  One of her 30 second videos received over 3 million views on single facebook post, within a couple days. That does not take in account my Youtube views, Or any of the \'shared\' views, or uploads by others. </p>
<p>Bunch of shitty news outlets wrote stories on her and I... Well Mostly her...One of the outlets said I was a professional Skateboarder, when in reality, I don\'t even skateboard, Literally bought a board solely to ride with her.  So that was a nice eye opener as to how news outlets, write what they want. </p>
<p>IF you\'re in the UK you might remember her, because she went viral The day of brexit...hundreds of people shared the video with titles along the lines of &quot;Here;s a dog to take your mind off the fact that UK is leaving the EU&quot; or whatever the fuck. </p>
<p>==========================================================================================================</p>
<p>At the time it was kinda a big deal in my life (Because my life is usually boring as fuck) so I was really enthusiastic about trying to build a following for harley...But then I got over it really quick.</p>
<p>So I ultimately turned down every offer... Mostly because I couldn\'t help but feel silly about the whole thing.  So all my views came without the help of licensing company, and to date, I have not made a single penny from Harley, nor will I.</p>
<p><strong>Like, my intentions were never to profit from Harley.  I originally just uploaded the video to show her off to my friends</strong>... And although I never used Harley for monetary gain, I did use Harley to get laid... I\'ll never know If I would have gotten a single tinder match were I not exploiting the shit out Harley in my tinder profile... </p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Ok, So I\'m telling you all of this, So that It\'s clear what my motives for doing this are.  I originally made an Instagram account for her, When she went &quot;viral&quot; uploaded a few videos and pics... And then I just stopped. I was over it.  That being said, I have a shit ton of videos of her, that I have not made public yet, and these videos have the added bonus of NOT being filmed horribly</strong>... </li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah I forgot to mention, the original videos that went Viral, Might be the worse filmed video\'s of all time.  So now I have good quality videos, and I think I now have a motive to start posting them again... </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motive being, trick people into learning about Pizzagate.... I was thinking about adding links to easy to digest Pizzagate facts in all of my old videos, as well as my new videos I plan to upload.  People Click the video because of a skateboarding dog, then they end up going down the pizzagate Rabbit hole...</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>==========================================================================================================</p>
<h6>HERE\'S AN EXAMPLE f the sorta thing I was thinking about...</h6>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/he1cc">http://imgur.com/a/he1cc</a></p>
<p><strong>I\'m not saying that\'s what I would do exactly, I just whipped that Up to give you a possible idea.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>I also Have a lot of new information, that I plan on spreading this way, IF I start getting enough followers.  If I don\'t, I\'ll just give the info to someone else with a lot of followers. In case I\'m confusing anyone, My point of doing this is to draw people in with these cute videos, and then flip the script with some hardcore facts.  
</p>
<p>And to be honest, I Feel weird about posting about pizzagate on my youtube, since it\'s actually a youtube channel for a skateboarding dog... So If I can start it off with a skateboarding dog clip, and then come in there and give a quick run down of some new information or w.e... I would feel less weird. </p>
<p>LIsten people, this is just an IDea, Hence why I\'m asking you guys opinion...</p>
<p>================================================================================================================</p>
<h6><strong>TLDR</strong></h6>
<p>So retardedly long story short, how do we feel about exploiting my dog for the sole purpose of bring attention to pizzagate, To those who would otherwise ignore it?  
</p>
<p>Good Idea,? Bad Idea? Good Idea but needs improvement? I should mention, I\'ve already uploaded 2 videos in the last day, And made the hash tags relevant to pizzagate. OH and I deleted my youtube page, from the &quot;website&quot; area on my Instagram, and put in the voat.co./pizzagate/1497611 Which is a link to the fully sourced executive summary sticky. </p>
<p>If this seems like a good Idea, Then You need to share and follow the instagram... <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shreddingharley1990/">https://www.instagram.com/shreddingharley1990/</a> </p>
<ul>
<li>Because I lose followers everytime I mention Pizzagate... And I Hate asking for followers, but that\'s what I did in my latest instagram post (Lost 4 followers so far lol)... which is actually what lead me to writing this post...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I do understand how that comes off, and I feel extremely dirty doing that..  I don\'t mind asking for followers here on voat, Because I think my post and comment history confirms I have only good intentions, which I hope leads you to the conclusion that <strong>I&quot;m using my dog for pizzagate, Not using pizzagate for my dog.</strong>   If any of you do get that impression from this post, Please say that and give me suggestions on how you think I should handle this.</strong> </p>
<p>If you guys think this is a bad Idea, tell me that, Without being a dick... I will look at post history of any dicks, and go from there. </p>
<p><strong>My post history also confirms That I can be a MASSIVE asshole... However I can honestly say that I\'m only an asshole, to those who are being an asshole to me first, or if I see them being an asshole to someone else... I Know that\'s childish and I should probably just not be an asshole ever, which I\'m working on.... Kinda.</strong> </p>
<p>So if you are an asshole to me in conveying your feelings about this post, I will be a bigger asshole to you...  That\'s If I feel like your an actual researcher being an asshole. If I think you\'re a shill, I\'ll ignore you...(I hope... I haven\'t been able to yet, But I think I can with hold this time)</p>
<p><strong>Side note, I\'ve deleted all of my heavily upvoted posts.. But you can still see them in my history if you go to the other posts that link to my original posts.  Or If you ask me, I\'ll provide them to you. haven\'t edited my youtube videos yet, But I will if we think this is a good Idea.  I should mention I have a ton of videos stashed away for a rainy day... And today is a rainy day. They are all shot with a gopro this time, versus my shit Ipad.</strong></p>

            Harley should be the founder of D.A.P.   Dogs Against Pedophiles. Can't argue with that.

            To the person Who down voted me In less than 20 seconds after I posted this. FUCK YOU. You're the worst type of person. You piece of shit.  At least wait a minute, So there's the possibility you actually read it before down-voting.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you don't want to read it, That doesn't make you an asshole, But if you don't wanna read it, and then you downvote it, You are in fact an asshole.
