            "The Party's Over" Lyrics
           </p>
           <p>
            Prophets of Rage
           </p>
           <p>
            [B-Real:]
Here comes the prophets while devils making the profit
It's like the pill when you pop it you may never get off it
Now you look to the skies and you searchin' for something
Are you one of the blind?
Are you standing for nothing?
Guess the message is ___?
You can be apprehensive
And they changing the lesson
Cause the damage it stiffens
The brutality, casualty, mortality rape elevates
Raise your fist and with one voice the people say
           </p>
           <p>
            [B-Real and Chuck D:]
The party's over, it's over, the party's over
The party's over, it's over, the party's over
The party's over, it's over, the party's over
The party's over, it's fuckin' over
It's over now
Yeah it's over now
It's over now
Yeah it's over now
           </p>
           <p>
            [Chuck D:]
Bullets, missiles and bombs
See you gonna raise hell
So I yell to the devil get back in his hell
In your party commercials, illuminati rehearsals
And your lies uncivilized, systematic reversal
As you can see in the tease, tricked by government green
Border wars on the poor, new world order machine
The future of youth goes to your funky militia, enlisted
Yeah your fuckin' party's over, ya missed it!
           </p>
           <p>
            [B-Real and Chuck D:]
The party's over, it's over, the party's over
The party's over, it's over, the party's over
The party's over, it's over, the party's over
The party's over, it's fuckin' over
It's over now
Yeah it's over now
It's over now
Yeah it's over now
