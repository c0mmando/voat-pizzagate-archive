<p>I am on a tear this AM. Woke up to find out that the guy most on my radar Craig \'\'SAWMAN\'\' Sawyer is a POS and part of CONTROLLED OPPOSITION. </p>

<p>Put Laura Silsby on steroids, and you\'ve got SAWYER! </p>
<p>AN OPEN SECRET, the POS producers that had the nerve to fund the movie allegedly outing PedoWood\'s pervs heralded a new video from Sawyer! It\'s here we should get into what disinformation is. As I put in my previous post, Assange said it best. </p>

<p>So here\'s AN OPEN SECRET commenting on [1] Stormy Daniel\'s brand and now [2] a possible Tucson child sex trafficking site? Hey, fuckers! You\'re supposed to be investigating PedoWood! So what have you come up with about outing pervs in Hollywood? Oh, FUCKING NOTHING! You haven\'t even outed a NOTHINGBURGER!!! Even shill Corey Feldman did that! In fact, he did it twice! But, of course, Feldman was the shill that SAWMAN \'\'protected\'\'. What\'d he do? Protect Feldman from himself, because Feldman is one of the biggest P\'sOS out there! </p>
<p>By carefully digging into Feldman\'s background, I found lots of things to solidify the shill claim, but Sawyer? He had that shiny armor of being a hero and not all heroes are right all the time and ... there just was never anything definitive to stamp him one way or another. I mean, he could have just been a guy building up a business which wouldn\'t necessarily make him dirty. But today? All questions have been answered! Here\'s the tweet: </p>

<p>Again, WHO THE FUCK ASKED AN OPEN SECRET A QUESTION? Next, it\'s June 9th, 2018 and yet the YouTube preview says this: </p>
<blockquote>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 8th, 2018?!!!! </p>
<p>Remember, this fucking guy Sawyer is purporting to be an expert. An expert doesn\'t give the wrong fucking date when releasing a fucking piece of important news about an alleged child sex trafficking site! They just don\'t! But in case you have the stomach to go on, here\'s the May 8th video that was really released on June 8th: </p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are so many discrepancies in it that it\'s blowing my mind. He basically reverses everything he stated and disavows himself being an expert which is wtf he claimed to be! I mean, if he can\'t interpret and process evidence, why is he showing up on sites to proffer \'\'expert\'\' opinions? An in case you didn\'t listen to his previous words, I\'ll post the link to not only one video, but several. And one is the \'\'Hagmann\'\' video. This is the one that AN OPEN PROPAGANDA SECRET touted their followers to watch!  
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Oh, but wait!!!! The first video ... the one I quoted from ... why .... why .... it\'s GONE! BEEN DELETED! Does anyone have any idea why that POS Sawyer would delete his first video? Maybe because it contradicts what he\'s saying today? But the Hagmann video is still up there ... for now ... and note the date June 4, 2018. That\'s important. The video that\'s been deleted was I believe made on May 29th or immediately after. So Sawyer\'s memory should have been crystal clear. </p>
<p>DISCREPANCIES: </p>
<p>New video: He says he got involved because he was lied to about children being on the premises. 
Old video: He clearly states that A THIRD PARTY contacted him. 0:54. Why is he NOT saying that now? It leads one to believe the VOP lied to him, when they never made the call? Was this THIRD PARTY excuse sort of like the NYT and CNN\'s unnamed sources? In other words, did this THIRD PARTY ever exist? If so, why is not Sawyer calling them out? Unless, of course, this non-existent third party was just an excuse for him to stick his nose into things and get involved n controlling what was going on! </p>
<p>New video: Says there\'s no evidence. 
Old video: Delineates and details the evidence, and on the basis of that evidence, he says he called the FBI!!!  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9:30</p>
<p>I HAVE NOTIFIED THE FBI!!! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this POS notifies the FBI on the basis of what he\'s personally seen, and now ruffles TPD\'s reports in our faces and basically calls this NOTHING?!!!! </p>
<p>I don\'t understand that ... do you? Does anyone? And remember this video is dated June 4th!!!! It means he had almost a week to think things over and re-evaluate what he said! And yet he\'s standing firm on him calling in the FBI and giving a pretty vivid description of the evidence found. </p>
<p>You can make your own analysis, but I\'m fucking done with these shills. DONE. And Liz Crokin must be a shill also. Why? Because she defended Craig Sawyer and Jack Posobiec. She\'s supposed to be a journalist, but has anyone ever seen her investigate anything? All she does is RT info people send her! And half the time it\'s wrong! Like that stupid fucking faux pic of a video of Huma and Skankles filleting a kid\'s face? Yup, there was Liz putting that shit up there! Crokin and her fake fights with Teigen! They\'re most likely friends. Then there are her trips taken on pizzagater\'s nickel? Do any of us fly to secluded islands for vacations because things are just so tough? Not! And what photo does she choose to put up on election night when Trump wins? This one: </p>

<p>So skank, what are you telling us here? Lucferian much? She was seduced by PedoWood and has never recovered. Not even after everything that was done to her. But it\'s the same with all of them. Those kids who were abused ... like Haim ... he never gave up trying to serve the place that destroyed him.</p>

<p>UPDATE: </p>
<p>Tucson\'s Chief of Police Chris Magnus was sued for covering up a sexual exploitation case. </p>

<p>She claimed it was an open secret in the Richmond Police Department that she was available to officers “for sexual favors and pleasure in exchange for paid monies, protection, or other forms of consideration.” Abuslin, who worked as a child prostitute, described her role there as an “exclusively department retained sex worker.”</p>
<p>One officer promised to help Abuslin escape prostitution after meeting her on 23rd Street in Richmond, a sex trafficking hub, Abuslin said. Instead, he began having sex with her in exchange for immunity from arrest and confidential police information.</p>
<p>Richmond Police Chief Allwyn Brown and former Police Chief Chris Magnus knew what was happening but refused to investigate or discipline their officers, she claimed.</p>

           Oh, but wait!!!! The first video ... the one I quoted from ... why .... why .... it's GONE! BEEN DELETED! Does anyone have any idea why that POS Sawyer would delete his first video? Maybe because it contradicts what he's saying today? But the Hagmann video is still up there ... for now ... and note the date June 4, 2018. That's important. The video that's been deleted was I believe made on May 29th or immediately after. So Sawyer's memory should have been crystal clear.
          </p>
          <p>
           DISCREPANCIES:
          </p>
          <p>
           New video: He says he got involved because he was lied to about children being on the premises. 
Old video: He clearly states that A THIRD PARTY contacted him. 0:54. Why is he NOT saying that now? It leads one to believe the VOP lied to him, when they never made the call? Was this THIRD PARTY excuse sort of like the NYT and CNN's unnamed sources? In other words, did this THIRD PARTY ever exist? If so, why is not Sawyer calling them out? Unless, of course, this non-existent third party was just an excuse for him to stick his nose into things and get involved n controlling what was going on!
          </p>
          <p>
           New video: Says there's no evidence. 
Old video: Delineates and details the evidence, and on the basis of that evidence, he says he called the FBI!!!
          </p>

           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So this POS notifies the FBI on the basis of what he's personally seen, and now ruffles TPD's reports in our faces and basically calls this NOTHING?!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't understand that ... do you? Does anyone? And remember this video is dated June 4th!!!! It means he had almost a week to think things over and re-evaluate what he said! And yet he's standing firm on him calling in the FBI and giving a pretty vivid description of the evidence found.

           You can make your own analysis, but I'm fucking done with these shills. DONE. And Liz Crokin must be a shill also. Why? Because she defended Craig Sawyer and Jack Posobiec. She's supposed to be a journalist, but has anyone ever seen her investigate anything? All she does is RT info people send her! And half the time it's wrong! Like that stupid fucking faux pic of a video of Huma and Skankles filleting a kid's face? Yup, there was Liz putting that shit up there! Crokin and her fake fights with Teigen! They're most likely friends. Then there are her trips taken on pizzagater's nickel? Do any of us fly to secluded islands for vacations because things are just so tough? Not! And what photo does she choose to put up on election night when Trump wins? This one:

           So skank, what are you telling us here? Lucferian much? She was seduced by PedoWood and has never recovered. Not even after everything that was done to her. But it's the same with all of them. Those kids who were abused ... like Haim ... he never gave up trying to serve the place that destroyed him.

            She claimed it was an open secret in the Richmond Police Department that she was available to officers “for sexual favors and pleasure in exchange for paid monies, protection, or other forms of consideration.” Abuslin, who worked as a child prostitute, described her role there as an “exclusively department retained sex worker.”
           </p>
           <p>
            One officer promised to help Abuslin escape prostitution after meeting her on 23rd Street in Richmond, a sex trafficking hub, Abuslin said. Instead, he began having sex with her in exchange for immunity from arrest and confidential police information.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richmond Police Chief Allwyn Brown and former Police Chief Chris Magnus knew what was happening but refused to investigate or discipline their officers, she claimed.

             the cash payment book &amp; blue print map sound promising &amp; awful. Glad to hear they're still adamant about retired &amp; active duty leo &amp; military on safety patrol. His story about invitations to public &amp; why &amp; how they're conducting patrols hasn't changed...just sayin' he seems a little calmer in this video, but this is the same plan / story told every time I've seen the update videos. Until I can drive out won't know for sure but am liking the consistency.   So RAD!!!! the homeless on lookout. Love this so much. Thanks for the good word! This is super encouraging. wonder / hoping operation backyard brawl has some sort of pigeon hunting effect too. Maybe the career runners - traffickers using these paths will scatter- off pattern, do something stupid and get caught in the act.

              <p>
               Yes, brilliant move finding it and hanging onto it! Absolute proof. It's proof to any law enforcement agency that actually cared about stopping the child trafficking. And even the videos are priceless. AN OPEN SECRET / Sawyer were debunking the restraints as what campers use to tie food to trees? Did you see the size of those restraints? You couldn't even put a package of rice in there! At most a Slim Jim ... or WRIST!!! That's it! And women's underwear around the trees? Seriously, come on! But the books ... the book!

              <p>
               People are sick of THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING GOING ON! They will not be put aside by stupid reports written by stupid people. Or shills that come out of the woodwork and try to put the lid on things.

            Liz isn't dirty, she's just a fuckwit when it comes to Satanism.

            Still trying to make sense of the 'camp' situation myself, however, all things aside with that... the takeaway is CEMEX. You want connections  between CEMEX and human trafficking and/or other levels of corruption? Well, the pieces are all there...
           </p>
           <p>
            As for current thoughts on Craig, well... gut instinct is that I shouldn't worry about him or V4CR, more about VOP and/or whoever made the 'camp'.

                Personally, I'm more interested in CEMEX before I worry about the rest of the situation.

                The irony is that we can discuss CEMEX and the connections there, without ever having to mention the camp.

                  That's the fun part; regardless of whether the claims of trafficking at the camp can be denied/confirmed/verified, there's enough there regarding CEMEX to start a conversation about corruption which yields interesting potential leads.

            There's a reason why certain people are allowed to keep running their mouths while others are "suicided."  They succumbed to the pressure and made a decision to join the bad guys. Those who didn't join well, they were silenced for good.

             Unfortunately, it's true. But here's the thing, in a group that depends on loyalty, like the Navy Seals ... or any militaristic body that is expected to express loyalty not only to the members of that group, but to their country ... in succumbing to pressure ... they betray and are a traitor to the group that they swore an oath to. Now the thing is, some of these individuals have already sworn an oath to another group that they believe has a higher importance, but it doesn't matter. In infiltrating a group that that individual had no intention of being loyal to, they betrayed every single individual in that group and their country.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now we can't say that applies to everyone. Some just sell out for money or because of being blackmailed. Or to keep a loved one safe. It's very difficult to discern motivation because while someone does out themselves sometimes, that underlying reason is their secret. I keep thinking if these individuals would have made the same choices if they knew they would be found out and have to face justice. How will they view this misguided ''loyalty'' then? Will they want mercy when they have showed none? Will they want fairness when they have turned their backs on the weakest in our society -- the children?

             Yeah, Liz ... I'm just puttin' it out there. I've seen her do a few very shaky things, but again, we're not a cult. People don't have to think one thing. Diversity of thought shouldn't mean that someone is a shill EXCEPT when it actually protects those who are doing harm. Like with Lady Gaga and other celebs. Crokin LOVES these guys! LOVES! I've never seen anything like it. There was something about Chelsea Handler, too ... I think three actress put on a surprise comedic intervention -- emphasis on comedic. Well, Crokin starts going off on how they're serious and that Handler might listen if we pray and she can change because she's really nice and yada yada yada. Then she starts yapping about how wonderful Jennifer Annistan and, Sandra Bullock are and I'm like WTF? Anniston and Bullock are two whores from hell and Bullock likes to get her Nazi on while having shit smeared under her nose [according to her ex-husband] and then there's the two kids she adopted from New Orleans who are probably acting like her personal blood banks and Crokin is going off on how NICE she is? Really? It was at that moment that I realized this bitch was seduced by Hollywood. Now I'm starting to think it's more, but will hold off until I get more proof.

               Know many, many, many people that got blocked by well-known investigators for asking a question. Really? A question? I mean, I read the tweet and there wasn't even the slightest disrespect going on, but there was the block. And you're right, it's a huge tell. Be grateful they're unhinged control freaks because they're making it easy to tell when we're onto something.

            I have never watched a Craig Sawyer video or listened to a word he has to say on this subject.  Why?  Because of how and why he was brought into the pedogate investigation scene.  Within a week or 2 of Alex Jones getting down on his knees and begging forgiveness from Alefantis for even suspecting any untoward activities from him or at his pizza establishment, and fired one of his reporters for looking into the possibility, Craig Sawyer is brought onto the Alex Jones staff to be a caped crusader kicking down doors and rescuing children from the clutches of degenerate pedophiles.  For anyone who has looked into pizzagate and all of the sick creepy things and people surrounding Alefantis and his pizza establishment, this was the disinformation move of the century. Everyone here is well aware of the list, so i won't bother to rehash it all.  But when A.J. announced bringing Sawyer on board to be a caped crusader, i think i laughed out loud.  Disinfo move of the century.  How could it have been more obvious.

             Yes, when you put it like that: OBVIOUS! Timing should always be taken into account because it is a big tell.
            </p>
            <p>
             Definitely, try to include facts and documentation. It's what the videos are for. People can look and hear Sawyer's words coming out of his mouth. I don't know any kind of harder evidence you can get.

            After Alex Jones appologised to that creep of the universe and potentially the worst child killer in History (along with Bush Sr, according to David Icke) he then introduced Craig Sawyer and funded his 'operation.' I knew right then it was a shill operation.

              I unsubbed him immediately. And I have been Alex follower since 2002. And let's not forget that crisis actor on his show, you know the one who takes his kids to a suspected pedo/friendly pizza joint! With Craig Sawyer Alex really out did himself.

               It would have been nice if someone like AJ really was what he purported to be. Hell, it would be nice if anyone was what they purported to be! But you and I know that it's just not what's going on.
              </p>
              <p>
               And the thing is there is occasionally a bit of truth in what they say. Shills/disinfo have to speak the truth once in a while to keep credibility so once in a while you do hear something useful. But once you know someone is working against you, cut the strings. I had to do it with many many people I admired. They're not who I thought they were and the facade was just lovely, but they're not. I was admiring of the facade ... the phony character they presented.
              </p>
              <p>
               I understand and respect your decisions and actions. It's especially hard when no one else in the mainstream media is dealing with these subjects. I mean, before pizzagate, who the hell were we supposed to listen to to find out things?

              That's what Alex does though, the motherfucker gets cozy with the unsuspecting. Hence his extending an invitation to Roseanne as well, when ABC canned her. Ironic that VOP call Craig in, Alex has made himself buddy buddy...
             </p>
             <p>
              Seems to me, at the moment, like someone's trying to get Craig and indeed the rest of us, in trouble.

              I know he said it his own words GAS station, "3rd party", septic tank underground concealed bunker unventilated with child items needs to be dug up DNA and etc. in there checked.

            , I am giving this an "Accuracy in Question" flair. This post is 99% speculation -- you aren't providing research to an audience you respect to judge for themselves, you are spewing your own enraged interpretation of Sawyer's statements and Crokin's tweets and ramming it down people's throats. I don't know if you are trying to help them by smearing them, or just lack self-control, but this Reddit-style thread does not help the argument you are trying to push.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only a couple of lines in this diatribe contain any research/facts. And you completely ignore the possibility that both Sawyer and Crokin are just as capable of being snared by disinfo as any of us; especially regarding all the recent news which the majority of users here are questioning and requestioning.  You should be aware that your name-calling, jumping to conclusions and vitriol make this piece look like the kind of smear-job we usually see from shills. It's not effective.

             Its hard to keep up with all the new incoming information and people involved with this pedo shit. Threads like this one make it even harder when someone claims "CONFIRMED", but really hasn't confirmed anything, but their bias.
            </p>
            <p>
             Situations may look one way, but that doesn't mean the guy is a CONFIRMED disinfo agent aiding the PEDOs. Its almost as if everyone in the spot light is a shill for the pedos.
            </p>
            <p>
             The people in the spot light are doing more for the movement than this poster and threads like them. A bunch of outsiders, looking in, thinking they know it all, with mostly just personal opinions and feelings on situations that COULD be shady, but its not CONFIRMED.
            </p>
            <p>
             This thread is more disinfo than Craig Sawyer.

            I keep saying this, not that its right or wrong, but have seen too many heading to the cliff without looking/ thinking first

            that camp could go both ways, but for some it was only one way

            for Red Pill researchers, it's really disheartening to see so many people jumping on a wagon, headed where you cant see if it's a cliff or a hill
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm just as guilty, but at least I'm aware of it and have now stepped back when something " big" hits

             The reason for multiple posts is not piling on, it's so information doesn't get lost. Since Voat, in all its infinite wisdom, disallows changing headlines, if you discover something that you would have put into the headline, you have no choice but to bury the information or start a new post.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't see anything wrong with crowdsourced investigatioin. Multiple people coming at things at different angles is good. NXIVM had a kabillion post and that rabbit hole is yet to be scratched. And look at Kate Spade and Boudain, people aren't supposed to post about that? Hell, no!
            </p>

             You have your style, I have mine, others have theirs.

             Hell, yes, if you have a valid point, post the damned thing! You never know what you'll trigger and where another member can take it in uncovering the truth.

                Thanks, its not so much the OP as it is the reader

                I believe finding out as much as you can about something is the best way to handle it

                I'm so analytical sometimes, hard to go to point B from A without circling, unless been there done that lol

                just dont want us to become predictable

            I am in total agreement with having an open mind, this subject deserves it. It opens up to so many other subjects needing attention that to bring angst filled aggression with the same passion you are technically bashing others for, is not helping. The overall message, is to come together in unity, the infighting has to cease. If this is you calling people out who are guilty of such disinfo and infighting, you'll get a better response then presenting a theory or argument with angst infighting language and overall message. No one truely knows what the actual hell is going in any one particular situation in this subject which is unraveling from a very tangled web of a myriad of problems for us. It's not easy to have passion bubble up into rage because we are talking about saving children lives and basically our future as a species. We have to rethink, respeak, react differently then we ever thought we could push ourselves before. Discussion is 100% how we need to keep doing this, but to call out others for being disinfo and infighting while coming at it with the same attitude your trying to go against, just does not work anymore. We've collectively gotten ourselves in this hole, we need to work together to get out or remain in a lower density... Again...

             Cut the holier-than-thou BS. If we weren't supposed to be raging, then God wouldn't have destroyed the world except for one boat, would He? He hates evil and so do I.

             There's nothing to understand. No one is talking about the situation in Tucson, we're talking about AN EXPERT who stuck his nose into a situation HE knew nothing about because a THIRD PARTY contact him and LIED about children being on the site in question. He then gave filmed a video reporting on his findings on 5/29 and gave an interview on 6/4 in which he gave a detailed account of evidence he saw, and based on evidence, he states that he called the FBI TO INVESTIGATE! Now, on 6/8, he REVERSE EVERYTHING HE SAID AND SAYS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE.

             THAT'S what this post is about. If it's not warm and cuddly, I don't fucking care! You be the one to cry over pedos being sent to jail for being involved in molestation/rape. You be the one to cry over monsters who tried to destroy our country. That's not me so STFU and stop trying to control how people act.

            It's definitely getting harder to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Some are easier to identify than others.

            I have a question: Was Sawyer part of the original team that supposedly extracted and killed Bin Laden? If so that's a major red fucking flag considering 95% of that team is now dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also understand that VOP redbeard is very vocal and that passion may come across suspect to some, however it's also what we need to get eyes on. Cemex is suspect as fuck and anons have clearly shown why. Tucson is no doubt important but there are a shit-ton of locations that still need to be investigated. I'm going to a location today in North Texas. The I-35 corridor is an artery.

             Cemex owns over 300,000 acres of the Sierra del Carmen (AKA Maderas del Carmen) in Mexico.  This land is directly adjacent to a massive amount of acreage that they own in the Big Bend, Texas area.  It flows seamlessly.  They literally own their very own border crossing.

             It is. As for him being part of the bin Laden team, I have no idea, but you are right. Huge red flag. You know what else is a red flag? They keep complaining that VOP trespassed on private property, but if that is private property, it's why the police not getting involved makes no sense. A company's private property is searched and kept clean. If it was a common everyday citizen's propety, maybe yes, maybe no, but a corporation? Come on! They'd be cleaning that out and putting some type of monitoring on it which they didn't do because there's nothing there, right?
            </p>
            <p>
             Right. wink wink.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for the comments. Appreciate the support. Sawyer sold those guys out and that ain't right.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thank VOP for what they're doing and anyone else that really wants to clean up this swamp.

             Let's not enable him by creating false scenarios. He is absolutely on firm ground for stating an opinion. In other words, in his opinion, the evidence looked like this. There's no grounds for lawsuits or arrests.

            There was what I call a "Golden Age" in the truth community a few years ago when truth was abundant. The truth community was properly aligned against both parties of our government and progress was being made. This last year of "Super Anons" and infiltration of of the truth community by gov psyops has caused me to stop teaching history and combat disinformation.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Combating disinfo is more important than teaching. I love teaching and I hate combating disinfo, it makes me a miserable fuck. Mods please flair this thread unless OP proves His/Her headline. This headline is complete bullshit. This poster needs to be be brought to the same standards as other posters.

             According to all the locals VOP and hundreds of witnesses none of that shit was done NOTHING zero nada. On my channel I'ce spoke to some, go read the FB feed, and talk to the locals. they did shit cept fake dog sniff one area(if that) and bulldoze. Why aren't you researching ground level stuff instead of using "Mockingbird" crap?

             My thoughts exactly. One has got to prove one's points properly. This post reeks of an inconsistent narrative, trying to derail the investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             What we do know though, comming from VOP is that Sawyer has been hired to protect various VIPs. Including HRC. VOP is however fully aware of this and talks a bit about it in one of the latest videos.

            Competing hypothesis: Sawyer/VOP stumbled into the trafficking camp and unrolled eveyrthing too quickly for the white hats to keep up.  It's very possible they ran into an active investigation and spooked everyone.  The retractions, disinformation, misinformation may be intentional to try an tamp things down until white hat law enforcement is able to take down the entire operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm on the fence on this whole saga.  I've argued both side, but I'm not seeing anything compelling one way or another.  Getting a date wrong?  Happens all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, using your theory about answering the question which isn't asked.  Who (shills) does and does not comment on this (and other) topic is also very telling.

             No, there's no way to excuse what Sawyer did. And when did a newspaper get the date of publication wrong? Once in a century? It doesn't look good ... it looks sloppy and an expert isn't sloppy. He blatantly contradicted himself ... and that third party. Why would a third-party involve him in that? The only third-party I can think of is AJ. Did Alex freakin' Jones send him down there to screw things up?

              "It was not an active investigation." - None of us have any idea if this is true or not.  You are guessing.  You should not be guessing.
             </p>
             <p>
              "An active investigation would be monitoring that site." - Again, you have no idea.  There are a lot of ways to conduct surveillance on multiple sites - Aerostat, wide area persistent surveillance (WAPS), drone, satellite.  All could be watching.  You NEVER abandon the eye-in-the-sky to go check out what's happening on the ground.  Not under those circumstances.

               If you're saying the site was monitored, then they'd know this VOP group was getting too close. I mean, stop. You're not making any sense.

                You have absolutely no understanding of how ISR operations work, do you?   Do you think they have a white hat QRF waiting in the bushes to snatch the traffickers on a site which may be used once a month?  No...all you can do is sit an observe.  Now you understand one thing about large-scale ISR operations.

            </p>
            <p>
             She was defending Sawyer to ANOPENSECRET, but then they shocked me by saying that they hadn't been referring to Sawyer in the series of tweets aimed at calling Tucson a hoax and saying VOP were a bunch of fame-seeking clowns.

             Either it was a deliberate distraction from some trafficking operation that took place somewhere else at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
             And/or it has been meant to discredit any accusations that child trafficking takes place in the Tucson area.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either way, the only solution is imo to continue looking at the hard facts about child trafficking across the border.

             Especially getting Sawyer involved in the Tucson find. Question is who was the third-party? I already guessed above in the replies, but will state it again. AJ might be the one that told Sawyer about the find.

              AJ is heavily invested in Sawyer, and Sawyer needed footage for his doc. I can;t believe for the life of me that anyone ever followed any of this. My God you can tell by looking into his tiny beady little eyes he is not one to trust.

               It's why I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I wouldn't say I ever trusted him, but his service earned him the right to prove himself one way of the other.

                I don't see how working for the US govt as a killer earned your trust? Do we kill people for benevolent purposes? Is there ever justification to take a life? Why would anyone obey a govt over their own heart or God?

             And here I was standing up for this guy a long time ago; although I did have some warning bells in the back of my head. Namely; the over abundant twitter reporting, the quest for donations (this is always a strong indicator), the passive action (creating a movie).
            </p>
            <p>
             But I kept faith regardless of these warning bells. So now I get to read he supports Rothschild, along with the other findings. Well, that seals the deal. Controlled opposition indeed then.
            </p>
            <p>
             By the way; as far as my personal experiences, the fight is not over. Like I've said, I've been laying low and have not been able to update you all very well. This has to do with the fact that I've not been able to contextually tack on to posts given the rules of this forum.
            </p>
            <p>
             But yes, my personal encounters with satanic minded Zionists and their lakeys continues, even at my new, current job. Already a hint: one thought of me as a "scrawny bite". They are on to me and are trying to plan, in their jargon, a "confiscation mission".
            </p>
            <p>
             In the meantime I've been able, through input of their synthetic telepathic network they use amongst themselves, the mental profile of their Luciferas, a rank within their culture belonging to sectarian assassin women with a purpose. The purpose being the confiscation of the blood of their victims. I may or may not tell about this. How they work, how they operate and what is the procedure they employ.
            </p>
            <p>
             A big hint here: It involves the removal of their cervixes. The HPV and cervix cancer is in part a cover-up to make it acceptable and believable that some women want their cervix removed.

             My first thought is, why no kids on dirt bikes were on this? Too busy playing video games, too hot out, no computer access? Tuscon still has a couple thousand people living there, right? Must be there is an information blackout there. Sawyer was calling for people to bring their RVs and camp in the desert with no water or electricity, and it would be perfectly legal. He was also walking through the desert in the hottest part of the day (against recommendations of desert survival booklets I have read).

              i was thinking, these big time money guys, politicians,  and priests don't go out to the desert to rape kids.  They get them straight form the orphanages that they own.
             </p>
             <p>
              This could definitely be a human trafficking pit stop they are covering up.  But, i doubt the big wigs are scared of anything there.  Not saying it shouldn't be investigated though...

               George Webb 49 minutes ago You actually get good metadata from people who approach Jason. DWS folks obviously see him as an easy "plant". Imran's lawyer calls him and generates a tirade, taking the news cycle away from this channel and Awan server.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Palm Beach cop calls in to Jason and says he got thumbdrives from Seth Rich. He may very well have, but I am saying Seth played the role of a Bernie supporter to out Bernie supporters who wanted to leak. The thumbdrives had leaker names, and those people were Crowdstrike "Falcon"ed - Crowdstrike tracking software. Most laptops and phones were confiscated in Las Vegas, and the "chair throw" incident in Vegas was literally a "throw" from the hotel room raids on May 1st. The Pelosi meeting with Imran on May 12th was to summarize the leaker suppression. I am sure the leakers were being surveilled. Crowdstrike was officially at DNC for six weeks, but I think they were actually at DNC for over six months. Seth Rich's computer "phoning home" was downloading leakers every day at 1222 Euclid, not over in Howard area.﻿

George Webb George Webb 1 hour ago (edited) Or the opposite. Seth was a Panda - someone who roots out people who might leak - Pandas eat roots, bamboo. Kim dotcom was a criminal that ran a color of law Napster for Five Eyes Guys, and he still is a Five Eyes collection point for whistleblowers. No metadata for Seth Rich death is your tell that he was a Panda.﻿

            Wrong. They suggest that children "slept" there. The rest came from Screwy Louie the leader of Veterans On Patrol. If I was homeless in the desert a Septic Tank buried in the ground would be a gift from Heaven. It gets cold as fuck in the desert during the winter. That buried septic tank would stay a cozy 56 degrees and with some blankets I could be comfy.

            <strong>
             There IS CHILD TRAFFICKING ON THAT BORDER but Veterans On Patrol needs a new leader because "MIchael Lewis Arthur Meyer" is a fraud.
            </strong>
            Why does he have so many damn names? Because he is a scumbag and an opportunist hiding from his past.

           <p>
            The easiest way to make a free living in this world is to pretend to help children, and Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer is doing exactly that. He is also helping people, but his damn insane, and we don't need his crazy ass.

              Actually, I think we did pretty well since we found out within 2-3 days that parts of the story didn't add up.

               THIS - this is shameful. Why would this be stickied and not the WalMart in Texas? They should both (or neither) be stickied, with AZ saying "unverified".

                did. Maybe he'll decide to unsticky it, now that we have researched that the initial claim that is must have been a child trafficking camp couldn't be substantiated.

                I will also discuss with

             Craig Sawyer: [1] completely contradicted his statements made on the 6/4/2018 Hagmann video; [2] has taken down his first video where he stated he was called in by a THIRD PARTY and in the new video omits this fact and makes it sound as if VOP lied to him; [3] gives detailed compelling statements as to the evidence found at Tucson on the 6/4 video. He poses as an evidence expert and states that he CALLED THE FBI on the STRENGTH OF THAT EVIDENCE FOUND AT THE TUCSON SITE, but now says NOTHING WAS THERE!

               No doubt he was given the script and read the words he was told to. Sold out. Plain and simple. Or maybe he just figures he's being loyal to the other side. Could be that, but I'd rather think of him as a sell out than to actually believe he supports such activity.

               That windbag full of shit from Veterans On Patrol is not a military guy and never been in the military. When he announces himself as "Veterans On Patrol" people immediately think he is a veteran and HE KNOWS that and takes advantage of it. This is called "Stolen Valor" because that faker is not a military guy.

                Oh come on, Esoteric. To my knowledge, he never said he was a veteran.
                <em>
                 That
                </em>
                would have been stolen valor. 'Veterans On Patrol' is the group's name, and they openly say that homeless people they've helped in the past joined them. Even calling for more support from non-veterans now.
               </p>
               <p>
                So everybody knows or can know they're not only veterans.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I haven't heard any accusations that they only

                 pretend
                </em>
                to help homeless vets. It seems they've been doing some good work during the last three years. And they don't accept money.

                 I can show you a video of him knocking on a door. The people answer the door and ask "Who are you?" He answers "Veterans On Patrol." So of course they think he is a veteran and he plays on that. You know he does.

                   True that. The VOP meth tweaker will fade but Sawyer will be with us for a long time. Everybody wants to make money and i'm sure he does too. Hell, if I had a chance to make a lot of money doing something honest I would do it too. But is Sawyer honest? Does he have a good heart? I have no reason to trust him or distrust him. I have not made my mind up about him yet. I'm leaning toward not trusting him as my default position.

               Oh, yeah! Supporting vets is gone. They lost that. They blew a lot of shills they had in place to try to cover this up so that should tell you something. I'll never trust any of the three again ... four if we're counting Prosobiec and we are.

                     Have looked into this and can report there is no hard evidence this site in Tucson was used for child trafficking, the same as I reported there was no evidence for Comet Pizza. Appears to be another example of mass hysteria

                 So Posobiec is not only debunking Tucson, but using it to debunk Comet Pizza and calling both MASS HYSTERIA.

              Every day that goes by people are backing away from crazy drug addict Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer, the leader of Veterans On Patrol. Now that people have had time to watch a lot of his videos, and examine his "evidence", it is obvious that he is unhinged. His past is also surfacing and its a fucking mess. He is a loser, a liar, a drug addict, and a fame whore. People with common sense don't want to be affiliated with him.

            I don't know what Craig Sawyer is but I know what "Screwy Louie" from Tuscon Veterans On Patrol is. He is an instigator, embellisher, senasationalistic fame whore, trouble maker in the truth community, and has not provided a shred of evidence for any of his claims. He has a LONG HISTORY of starting trouble in the truth community and he was given the nickname "Screwy Louie" BACK IN 2014.

            He went to Ammon Bundy's ranch and threatened to cut their supply lines so they kicked his sorry ass out. He went to the Oregon Wildlife Refuge situation and caused a ton of friction there. He is a drug addict and a nut bag. Many people think he is an "agent provacateur."

           <p>
            I have watched about 30 of his videos and he talks to God every day, according to him, and he gets his intel from God. He is a drug addict and a liar. He divides and he does not unite.

             I gotta say, that vop guy is a bit of a fucking idiot. If he did find a skull, he moved that shit around. You can't fuck with a crime scene like that. Dude was talking about evidence he had collected and buried nearby for safe keeping. The Retard also keeps saying he found 30 pairs of shoes but won't show any photographic or video evidence of any of them.

             I got really excited for this discovery but the more I read about it, the more fucked up this guy seems to be.

              Thank you for being sane. That guy is a whackadoodle, regardless if his intentions are good, and I think maybe, hopefully, they are, but he is a drug crazed idiot. You don't move crime scene evidence because it IMMEDIATELY becomes contaminated and can be discredited. You don't find a skull and kick it around like a soccer ball to get a photo op of it. That was stupid as hell because he destroyed the crime scene. He took evidence and buried it according to him. Bye bye evidence because now its worthless. This guy is a loser nut bag. Everything he does is a bag full of stupid.

              I usually always agree with you, but on this, I disagree. The leader of Veterans On Patrol is an antagonist and a sensational liar. Watch 40 of his videos like I have. Combating these frauds is as important as spreading true dirt.

             It's why I posted that first submission. You want to know the HUGE mistake AN OPEN SECRET made? Answer:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <h1>
              THEY DIDN'T ATTACK SAWYER!!!
             </h1>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             No, they viciously and unfairly attacked VOP, but bowed to Sawyer. That was a HUGE tell! If they had played the game being run correctly, they would have called out Sawyer, too. Said he was part of the problem. Then when Sawyer released the June 8th video, they could have apologized and said they retracted what they said about Sawyer and now think he's okay.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second strategic mistake they made was in focusing on Sawyer being misled by the call saying there were children on the site. They defended Sawyer getting involved on the basis of this call. But they used to call to INVALIDATE VOP!!! This even though Sawyer put out a video ... two videos if you count Hagmann's, that a THIRD PARTY notified him!!! Makes a huge difference, no? Guess Sawman screwed up in revealing thart part! He takes down his video where he tells this, but Hagmann's is still up there, so see/hear for yourselves while you can!
            </p>
            <p>
             Nope. Not gonna work, shills! Then there's the way Sawyer speaks. He's always out-of-breath and nervous as hell. It's not the body posturing/signals that a confident leader gives off. It's more like he's lying. I gave him a pass about being nervous in the beginning, but I mean, come on! He's been doing this for months and he still can't control his breathing? And this is a guy that was trained in tactical warfare? YIKES!
            </p>
            <p>
             Luckily, they don't know what we know and that is that pizzagate is an ORGANIC movement ... always has been. We think for ourselves and don't have a goddamned leader. No one is taking this movement over. Some still distrust our POTUS and that's fine. Then there's the Q split. That's fine also. Members thinking for themselves makes us very very hard to control. And let me emphasize that it was not the finding that the Tucson site wasn't a child trafficking site that ticked me off. It was the carefully constructed narrative to BURY what was there. To me it's a red flag that there IS something there and that the Tucson site is the tip of the iceberg.

              Upvoat! Thank you!  We do like to disagree, and that's what makes this so great. We're allowed to. I believe what Patton said, "if everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking."
God Bless the schills, they make us stronger.

              Pretty f'd about Sawyer. Dammit. I think he reads a lot better than Aurthur Lewis. 
I don't have the anti-God bias, but I knew that him mentioning and BELIEVING in PRAYER would keep self-righteous scientists away and the mania would immediately turn people off. Especially those already neck deep in confirmation bias. Reaction seems to be : "This isn't Rachel Maddow! This isn't confirmed narrative. I might not have any virtue signaling communist friends left If I take this seriously, so I'll go with ... just some crazy, ex-junky, religious zealot looking for their 15 minutes . "

               I'm most happy about VOP continuing and the actual people of Tucson getting behind them. There was also another independent journalist getting onboard so I hope that pans out and that we can discover what was really going on.

                 VOP was smart in documenting everything. And did you see the size of that skull. That ain't no adult. In drawing, the head is as large as your foot. It means that head was that of a child.

               Actions speak so much louder than schills...the heat here is disgusting. This isn't a Larp. And, yes, attacking vets and the homeless got the left looking super classy. Why is it ok to dismiss dead immigrants as a non-issue? b/c happens all the time?  Surprising response from those that  "care so much it hurts them."

               VOP has done NOTHING to be attacked so viciously. They immediately informed the police just like they should, and Sawyer AGREED with their actions. He stated in the first video that he took down, that the police responded to the VOP's initial call on May 29th and met with VOP and Sawyer in a GAS STATION PARKING LOT!!! They weren't trampling the site or any other such nonsense, but after taking the report, Sawyer stated that the police LEFT!!!! He then went onto say that after the police left, VOP brought him to the site to investigate and that's where he viewed the evidence. The evidence that he thought so compelling as to call the FBI!!!!
              </p>
              <p>
               Please! This stinks to high heaven! Sawyer out to be goddamned ashamed of himself!

They discovered it lightly secured it and met them there the cops ran the fuck off after a hitty 2 second report did no REAL DAHMER HOUSE INVESTIGATION AKA MONTHS OF DIGGING and dna fingerprints etc. Forensics. and FOR 5 DAYS DID NOT RETURN not once.
