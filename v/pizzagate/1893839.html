            This is talking about women, not children. These are not victims. They even got a free breast implant out of the deal.

             Gross. How could you even *write *something like that? Do you really think those women led charmed lives? How would *you *enjoy life as a slave (or a prostitute, for that matter)? Human beings deserve respect.

            <p>
             "Hundreds of women were brought from Thailand to the U.S. and

              forced

            <p>
             I can't help but conclude:
            </p>

             Hundreds of women were brought from Thailand to the U.S. and

                I did not see any mention of guns pointed at these women. What I did see was that they are getting paid off with breast implants and who knows what else.

                 What if they did not want the implants?  What if they were forced by the point of a gun to go under the knife.  You are blind as can be.  Quit your shilling Everyone is on to you.

                  Shilling? I've directed people away from worthless false flags here.
I've made submissions of real value, such as sharing about daycares in my cimmunity that have the swirly logo.

                  I have spent a lot of time and lot of money on women in Thailand and the Philippines. I can tell you that nobody is in the industry who doesn't want to be. In fact, a vast majority enjoy what they do.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Do you have any experience with companions for a tip other than what you watch on TV or read on the Internet? I didn't think so.

                   I don't have the type of companions you consort with. I don't buy my companions.  I also get out and spend time away from the internet and rarely watch tv.  I am directing people away right now from a False Flag.  You.

            From the article:
 "Naturally, the root cause of the state finding the organization wasn’t the sex slaves — it was was the concealment of millions of dollars. This latest indictment goes after the money as outside of the conspiracy to commit sex trafficking charges, are the charges of conspiracy to engage in money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business."
           </p>
           <p>
            “From coast to coast, IRS Criminal Investigation is determined to team with our law enforcement partners to track down the individuals who facilitate and launder the proceeds of sex trafficking crimes,” said Special Agent in Shea Charge Jones, during the original indictment in October.  “Those who seek to enrich themselves by exploiting the desperate circumstances of their victims will not be tolerated in our cities.”
So--perhaps the money route will lead to more disclosures of parties (foundations!!) involved??

             Look at the Hastert case--the known pedo is in jail for suspicious financial transactions related to hush money, not the child molestation.
