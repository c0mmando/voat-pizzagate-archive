<p><strong>It will allow charities to access the international register when carrying out criminal record checks</strong>  The officials said the scheme would aim to foster greater information sharing between law enforcement agencies and is meant to be used to arrest more perpetrators across the globe. </p>

<p>The announcement follows the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti">Oxfam sexual abuse scandal</a>that rocked the aid sector. </p>
<p>The British International Development Secretary told the Times: “The most shocking thing [about the Oxfam scandal] was the inadequacy of that organisation’s response – the utter lack of moral compass as to what the right course of action was towards the victims and in allowing someone who shouldn’t have been in a position of authority to transfer to other organisations.</p>
<p>“The attitude and the culture set by the leaders of that organisation at the time demanded a big response and that response had to be wider than one organisation because this is a global problem. What you saw in Haiti was a complete abuse of power and that cannot happen again.”</p>
<p><em>Well, unless this attitude doesn\'t change, nothing will change for the better, and a register like this will likely not really help. Only a small number of perps gets convicted anyway, and if the heads of a charity, superiors and colleagues look the other way, or are into it as well, rape and sexual abuse by aid workers will continue as usual.</em></p>
<p>Efforts are also to be made to enable a team of seven to nine specialists and investigators to work out of Africa and Asia to provide support to national criminal bureaus in high-risk countries.</p>
<p><em>\'Seven to nine\' specialists is really an impressive number. /s How many aid organizations are still operating in Haiti alone?</em></p>
<p><strong>“Those in the aid sector will be able to submit a request for checks on prospective employees against national criminal records and Interpol criminal databases,” the Department for International Development said on Tuesday. “Interpol will process the requests and when an individual who represents a threat to vulnerable beneficiaries is identified, they will work with the relevant authorities to determine the course of action.”</strong></p>
<p>Officials added: “This initiative will help prevent abuse by stopping high risk individuals from being hired and increase the chances of perpetrators being arrested by law enforcement agencies.”</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: The British Government felt it was adamant to show that they <em>really make an effort</em> to fight sexual abuse in the aid sector. /s They will even spend some money and employ less than ten people scattered across the globe!</strong></p>

               'The British International Development Secretary told the Times: “The most shocking thing [about the Oxfam scandal] was the inadequacy of that organisation’s response – the utter lack of moral compass as to what the right course of action was towards the victims and in allowing someone who shouldn’t have been in a position of authority to transfer to other organisations'.

              The officials he is blaming were SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN for their positions because they could be counted on to keep their mouths shut.  There is so much $$$$ in human trafficking, none of these money grubbing Royals could keep their hands out of it. It's been their lifestyle for hundreds of years.
