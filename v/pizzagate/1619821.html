            The goal of prosecution is not to collect restitution, it is to stop the fraud! Those DAs need to be exposed in the media. Whoever has evidence should take it to small TV stations or right wing blogs.

            I keep thinking about it. All hell is going to break loose. You're right. They are going to blame Trump. Mainstream media will lie and the mind controlled liberals are going to fall for it and get even more violent. This could end up being a fricken war. Those of you who pray need to be on your knees for Trump more than ever.  Even the dirty republicans are going to be after Trump. These people have nothing to lose if the face prison. So many people want him assasinated.

            I can't imagine his life. How can he even trust to eat meals that they give him? The fact that he is having to work so much, have his name slung thru the mud and risks his life for our country makes me like him even more. He won't give up.

            I'm living in a world and around people that I don't even recognize anymore. Racism is back full force but now white people are the enemy. Rioters have been saying kill the pigs. Our cops are in danger. These stupid people don't realize the hell they would live in if there was no law and order. It would be like the movie Purge! I keep checking the news to see if there are any "suicides" yet. I'm so excited and hope to God the sickos are arrested. But I am scared too! I live in a democrat state. Ugh.

             ^ this. Something huge is about to happen. It is exciting yet frightening at the same time. Its so strange how all these pedos/pedo stories are popping back up into the news after not being talked about for months/years. And on top of everything else- FBI anon dropped a doc on their twitter yesterday tying together Soros/Berkeley/communists/China and the recent protests (riots), which is fucking HUGE.

            Not sure what to make of AJs comments in the JR podcast, he's been flippant on CPP, best guess he got a cease and desist from JA regarding CPP specifically. If JA isn't in the dragnet, even if a bunch senators are, that could actually embolden JA to say he wasn't part of it and sue for damages to CPP and especially his name. Won't mean he isn't guilty, may just have enough plausible deniability and no smoking gun. If you're painting a picture at some point you have to call it done and sell it. Same thing here, if law can get done big fish they need to bring up the net, even if it isn't full. My personal hope is JP and TP are in that net, bc that ties the whole thing back to the Clinton's tightly enough for a big fat I told you so to the Dems when everyone around them is going down with plausible deniability the only thing keeping them out of the net too, and everyone knowing, in the new reality, that they are guilty. On the other hand it's probably going to take Jeffery Daumer level imagery to wake up the severely brainwashed left.

              Sorry : ) Jones was very vocal about pizzagate and comet at first, then suddenly stopped talking about it altogether, then came back to it, but started calling comet a false flag. Personally, I don't buy into the false flag distraction theory. I don't think comet is the center of things either. Regardless, comet could sue the shit out of Infowars, like for many millions. Comet and company, probably via Brock, maybe even Soros and Obama, got the entire msm to '
"Debunk" pizzagate as "fake news" making for a strong case against anybody covering it in the media, especially broadcasting companies. The Alex jones show radio broadcasts I assume put a huge number of broadcasting companies at risk too

               Comet may not be the center of it but I'm sure not going to defend them. If suing people was a thing they could do, then there are far more people than Alex Jones to go after. Whatever Alex Jones has had to do to make it until Trump was in office I'm not going judge. He knows a lot of behind the scenes things and talks to Trump all off the time. Him and Milo were both told to wait to talk about it.  Whatever his opinion is regarding Comet does not mean he doesn't believe in Pizzagate. He has said for years this is going on.

            In general, I'm just kinda sitting back and watching the whole thing pan out. Like David Seaman said, I'm gonna let the administration take care of it. Trump is in office now, they're already setting up to clean house, so it's just a matter of time. I think the Pizzagate guys are just one of the groups that are gonna get caught in the net.

            People are spreading these names all over mass pizzagate groups/ Facebook. I don't believe it one bit. You do not warn your enemy of attack. And if this was truly a leak,  shame on that insider for giving them the heads up. Especially with fucking names!

            I'd say we put too much faith in a potential larper (maybe). Something is going down for sure, we just need to wait until AG Sessions gets in, which I would think the democrats, even republicans, would do everything in their power to stop this from happening. Lets just hope these pedos are put to justice if this is true. If there is some weird news like some huge discovery (apparently about Antartica) then I'll know something is up.

            Agreed. It did give me hope however hearing Alex Jones and Joe Rogan do a fairly decent disect of it all. That audience is HUGE! Hopefully it adds more fuel to the fire to put pressure on authorities to prosecute. 
We must not allow them to throw a few minor politicians under the bus to placate us.

            I'm sure we could look at the news outlets that have deemed pizzagate as, "Fake News" that decide to cover Pizzagate arrests as suspicious.

             my statement leads everyone to believe i assume it's true.. but I'm almost equally suspicious as you. The FBI leaks helped to embolden me to make the vid.. but this could all be a ruse, and I state so in the vid.

               I'm skeptical as well that it could just be another LARP. Even without it though, more and more things are suddenly "coming out" about it--Rogan and Alex discuss it, Alex replays some of of it on his own show (or so I've heard), now this DHS ad. Don't have hard evidence but it "feels" like it's escalating.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hope one of the first they arrest if and when this happens is the asshole who threatened you.

            I agree. Some of have said its to prevent it from just going away like the Franklin Scandal and be buried, But I think people need to be more cautious of what they are saying in regards to names etc.

               I meant from news reports.   The leak on Weiner seems to lay out the worst of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               In recent weeks, according to some of the people familiar with the matter, attorneys for Mr. Weiner have had discussions with federal prosecutors in Manhattan in hopes of dissuading them from bringing charges, or at least from bringing the most serious one: production of child pornography, which carries a 15-year mandatory minimum prison sentence upon conviction.
              </p>
              <p>
               These types of discussions can indicate both sides are trying to reach an agreement in which the defendant pleads guilty in exchange for a less-severe charge.
              </p>
              <p>
               This does not seem to involve anything more than the one case

                He's singing like a canary. That shit was on his computer. He's being charged with one case, are you really trying to tell me they don't have a lot more literally hanging over his head? SRSLY? Someone familiar with the case should not be discussing discussions.

                 Just to be clear most of my post above is a quote from this article
                </p>
                <p>
                 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-weigh-child-pornography-charges-against-anthony-weiner-1485894771">
                  https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-weigh-child-pornography-charges-against-anthony-weiner-1485894771

                </p>
                <p>
                 look at the language, it seems they still considering what the charges are, so yes, I don't see evidence of literally a lot more hanging over his head.  I see them arguing about a single case with a single defendant.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Federal prosecutors
                  <em>
                   are weighing
                  </em>
                  bringing child-pornography charges against former Rep. Anthony Weiner .....
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Mr. Weiner *could face *the production charge, some of the people familiar with the case say, because he allegedly solicited explicit images from the teenager.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Prosecutors
                  <em>
                   also are weighing other charges,
                  </em>
                  including receipt of child pornography, for which conviction carries a five-year mandatory minimum, and possession of child pornography, which has no mandatory minimum. Legal experts say receipt and possession encompass virtually the same misconduct, but the two charges are a way to give prosecutors more discretion in their charging decisions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Prosecutors
                  <em>
                   could decide not to bring any charges.
                  </em>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It isn’t known what images prosecutors have found in the course of the investigation. Federal child pornography laws are broadly written, and lawyers who have defended people charged with child pornography say certain types of images could receive lighter treatment under the law, such as photos of nude minors who aren’t engaging in sexually explicit activity.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <em>
                   In determining child-pornography charges,
                  </em>
                  prosecutors often take into account a range of contextual evidence, including whether a person specifically sought out a minor, whether the incident fits a pattern of similar behavior with minors and whether the person knew the individual was a minor.

                   Downvote/sass me if you want, but I haven't seen any of this so-called huge investigation from any news sources either. Take the chip off your shoulder and post a source. Isn't that the point of a discussion? Or is it just to talk down to the people who don't agree with you? I've been a Pizzagate believer/follower/whatever for months now, and that has taught me to be skeptical of everything I'm told.

                   You understand that the alternative scenario that you seem to be pushing  -- Wiener singing like a canary and ready to bring down the whole operation -- is a fantasy right?
A shared fantasy that is fervently wished for, but built on nothing but pure speculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'm speculating too, but it's based on my read that the Weiner's lawyers feel like they have a good shot at the lower charges.

                    "You understand ......Wiener singing like a canary and ready to bring down the whole operation -- is a fantasy right?"...... The NYPD found 650,000 emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop in a folder named "Life Insurance" and you're browbeating MAGABoomer for suggesting Weiner is singing like a canary.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The folder was literally called "LIFE INSURANCE" AreWeSure. Here I'll type slower:

                    <p>
                     I think there's a weak link in the ShariaBlue posse...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I also think people who have been diddling kids and who are obsessed with it, are starting to get a bit scared.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I am the most peaceful war hating person, I disagree with the death penalty...but I'll tell you this for free, kiddie diddlers must be put down without mercy, without thought, just eliminated. Why do you think they don't last long in prison? I'd bet that 90% of the prison pop has been abused.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     By putting down the kiddie fuckers we would be 1. saving generations of kids from perpetuating the abuse 2. save generations of kids from the pain/suffering it causes, and 3. enjoying mass savings as our prison population drops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If you're a kiddie diddler, there should be no safe space. They never get well, it's impossible to tell recidivism rates on the most under reported crime in the US. No chances, getting caught with a kid is immediate HANG THEM in the street. Shoot them in the head. Burn them at the stake. You do not fuck with children. Ever. If you're bent in that direction, go kill yourself. I'm serious. I've seen so much shit...kids never have a choice. We've been giving lip service to  the protection of children for centuries. It's time to put them away and hope humankind can recover. Because they are literally everywhere. In your church, in your schools, in your sports teams, in your charities, in your HOMES, in your doctor's office (srsly pedo pediatrician went down for it....)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     ANYWHERE there are kids, there also flock the pedos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Whatever fucking motive there can be for hoping the Weiner doesn't talk...or asserting that he won't or he hasn't...is coming from a asshole that's puckered in fear. You don't walk away from the shit I've seen on the Internet. Fuckin AYE these people must be done away with.

              Gotta agree with you.  I suspect it may be a demoralization tactic to get our hopes up the crush us emotionally to break our resolve.
