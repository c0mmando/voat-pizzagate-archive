           <p>
            Whatever is done through necessity, is done without any intention, and as the act is done without will, and is compulsory, the agent is not legally responsible. Hence the maxim, necessity has no law; indeed necessity is itself a law which cannot be avoided nor infringed.

            Pursuant to this power, Congress in 1790 passed the first naturalization law for the United States, the Naturalization Act of 1790. The law enabled those who had resided in the country for two years and had kept their current state of residence for a year to apply for citizenship. However it restricted naturalization to "free white persons" of "good moral character".

           </p>
           <p>
            Define "fight". I hope it doesn't mean grabbing weapons and ammo. That's the very last thing to try not to mention the Deep State would LOVE it if people got violent. Why? They'd have the perfect excuse to declare martial law!
           </p>
           <p>
            It's obvious. I'm surprised you didn't mention violence is always the last resort. This is the world's first digital Civil War. Victory is as easy as a few videos going viral. I personally think God's already chosen the victor and it ain't the Deep State. All we're seeing right now is Hillary &amp; Co circling the toilet bowl.

            The Pen Is Mightier Than The Sword is truer today than it's ever been.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fear not, the Deep State's implosion is nigh. Any momentary lapse will be quickly re-ignited by the Deep State who could teach Adolf Hitler a thing or two about snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory.

              Robert make sure to notify Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of his error in thinking there will be prosecutions or even arrests of those involved in human trafficking "including police and government officials".

               The fact that there will be prosecutions of those involved in human trafficking does not imply that there will be prosecutions made based on fictitious stories that you conspiretards tend to buy into.

                Seriously Robert you're a fucking idiot. You need to stop embarrassing yourself. If there is something worse than a convicted child rapist, shit freak with no front teeth it's a convicted sex offender, shit freak with no front teeth with no college degree and a job at a place like McDonalds trying to make a cogent argument on the Interwebs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Where do you work bee tee dubs?
               </p>
               <p>
                There's not fucking way it's McDonalds. Your sex offender status would rule you out of that job.
               </p>
               <p>
                Oh I KNOW! You work pumping cesspools! Right? Am I right? You're a shit freak! That's the perfect job for you.
               </p>
               <p>
                It would be like a sex addict who worked in the porn industry. Adult porn that is.

                 The reason why you're talking to me as if I'm someone else is because you're extremely irrational. Maybe not as a whole, maybe in other areas you're a reasonable person, but in the area of conspiracy theories you're the worst of the worst.

                <p>
                 The fact that there will be prosecutions of those involved in human trafficking does not imply that there will be prosecutions made based on fictitious stories that you conspiretards tend to buy into.

               You don't think, you spout the talking points you're given which for MONTHS have been "the deep state is about to fall" as if there's any indication that's true, so these new violent antisemites are a breath of fresh air.
              </p>
              <p>
               You have ZERO balls and ZERO foresight and ZERO HINDSIGHT EVEN otherwise you'd acknowledge multiethnic societies always experience violence.

               SO IF A RACE WAR IS COMING WHO BENEFITS BY DELAYING IT? CERTAINLY NOT WHITES WHO WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE MINORITY IN 20 YEARS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY

             Violence can be defined in many ways, including "virtually" now a days. I did not fail to mention it, rather, purposefully omitted it as a recourse. Why?
             <strong>
              Because I agree with you
             </strong>
             . It is the last thing "we the people" need right now.

             This war, unlike those before us, will not be won with weapons. It is a war of words, words that hold meaning and truth. Words that cut deeper than the sword, because you cannot kill what stands behind a word, the idea itself, only stifle it, only try to bury it alive. But words will prevail. Truth will prevail.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're here today because so many of us remained silent for so long. And in silence lies the only weapon capable of stopping the word of truth. This is not religious-speak. I do not intend to comment on such. Rather, this is our best call to action. To remain vigilant. To stay focused on the right, not the fight itself. To speak truth and spread truth. And above all, wish no ill. For evil exists in words as well, and spreading those will only infect and negate the good we've done.
            </p>
            <p>
             History tells us there are those who rise and those who regret to. Let us be the former. Rise.

            </p>
            <p>
             Kind of but I'd argue a better description of what's going on is The Federal Reserve is owned by the English branch of the Rothschild Family.
            </p>
            <p>
             We should rename The Federal Reserve to something like:
            </p>
            <p>
             "The Bank of England and Her Former Colonies.(tm)"
            </p>
            <p>
             The pen is mightier than the sword. Rename the Federal Reserve like that and it would be liquidated by the end of the year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now because I'm a European History Major I can't leave it right here. I've got to defend The British and their de facto and de jure Royal Families because way back in 1913 they secured our support against Germany which let's just admit right now are way to sexually perverted to be trusted with a world wide banking cartel. If you think Pedophilia is bad God knows what control mechanism the fucking Germans would have come up with.
            </p>
            <p>
             Moving on I'll for the course of argument rename "The Bank of England and Her Former Colonies.(tm)" to:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The House of Rothschild-Windsor
             </strong>
             . (THORW)
            </p>
            <p>
             Like it? I love it. It's got the Viking god Thor in the name and I'm half Viking so it's doubly good. And appropriate given the fact the last truly English King came from the Welsh House of Cadwalader let's just all get it out in the open. THORW makes England more German than Germany who got rid of their Royal Families years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I like THORW because it sits so nicely on a feast table with all the other

             The EU of today didn't begin its life just after WWII. The EU of today began its life around 300 ad when Feudalism was born out of

             making it illegal for farmers to abandon their land no matter how unprofitable their farms were.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ever since then aboriginal Europeans gave up their sovereignty to an ever more rarefied  elite of land owners who finally killed each other down to one supreme royal victor who go by the name of the European Union to fool the gullible common folk of Europe into believing they have a representative Democracy. They don't. There's only one club and they ain't in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             So why am I droning on about gullible common folk? Because the House of EU was created AFTER WWII. Before WWII and WWI the House of EU was just a pipe dream among the two or three remaining Royal Powers which technically were all related anyway but whatever. The remaining two or three were branches of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a last ditch effort to secure a victory over their German cousins England's franchise, The House of Windsor, secured the support of their former colony who go by the name today of the United States of America. How did they guarantee that support given the U.S.A. is also on paper a Representative Democracy or Democratic Republic? Why they in the dark of night right before Christmas in 1913 got those American hay seeds "agreed" to let the THORW set up a National Bank. Yada yada yada in a few short years America sold their controlling interest to the highest bidder during THORW engineered market collapses designed to, DING DING DING, force American hay seeds into thinking they had no money.

              Wall of words, and most of it's not even relevant.  It's just a regurg of the BULSHIT they filled your brain with during your indoctrination sessions (aka "college").

              The FLAGS of the two countries, the TREATIES (especially but not limited to the Treaty of Paris of 1783), and the fact that QE II signs off on changes to our SS system are just some of the factoids comprising a MOUNTAIN of evidence that the U.S. is still a British colony.
