             No.  She did not.  Silsby was convicted, did prison time and was freed.  State Department can provide consular services and they did.

            <p>
             Because she didn't free the woman and providing consular services to AMCIT overseas is a routine part of the State Department's job.

              AreWeSure it's absurd to imply CHILD TRAFFICKING is just another run of the mill crime the State Department deals with. Haiti is the child trafficking capital of the world:
             </p>
             <p>

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              You're implying it was all just a misunderstanding. It wasn't. Laura Silsby is a convicted child trafficker and this was no misunderstanding. It's also misleading to imply Killary wasn't even involved. She had Huma Abedin constantly sending her
              <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772">
               updates on the Silsby case.
              </a>
              Killary was almost obsessed with Laura Silsby's case. That's not good.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem AreWeSure is you're a Limousine Liberal who is incapable of believing a rich old white lady may be guilty of horrible crimes like child trafficking or making millions selling Morocco's phosphate reserves to weapons manufacture's in Bulgaria whose product does

               this

              to children.
             </p>
             <p>
              You should be ashamed of yourself AreWeSure. Your blatant disregard for poor brown people makes me want to vomit. You're a Racist and an Elitist Ass Hole.

               You don't get or not get consular services based on what you are accused of.  You get them because you are an American.  Amanda Knox was accused of murder.

               No. I'm not implying it was a misunderstanding.  I'm stating the State Department got involved because that's what they do when American citizens are arrested overseas.

              <p>
               You have a definite misunderstanding.  Silsby was not convicted of anything at the time and she was not known to Clinton or those around.  At the time of these emails she was arrested and accused.  Also not what she was convicted of.

               Again.  Not what I did.  I stated that the time of her arrest Clinton and Abedin and the rest of the State Department had not idea who this woman was.

                You don't know that. You're speculating. The rest of your reply is your standard fair: splitting hairs in an effort to make it look this was no big deal. THIS WAS A BIG DEAL.

               <p>
                This is your M.O. isn't it AreWeSure. You did the same thing with Eric Braverman. The CEO of the Clinton Foundation is asked to sign off on the financials and he can't do it. He quits and goes to the FBI and then to the press saying "Follow the money.".
               </p>
               <p>
                Let's move on because we're never going to agree. There's something more important you need to address and that the Larry Silverstein evidence he had prior knowledge of 9/11 and therefor his statements are evidence of a Controlled Demolition.
               </p>
               <p>
                Stop avoiding the question and lay it on me AreWeSure. Why can't Larry Silverstein's comment be evidence of foul play?

                 No. I"m not.  Nobody in the State Department had any idea who this group of Baptists from Idaho were and that's quite clear in the emails.   You don't think the State Department treated this as a big deal?  You just claimed the State Department was obsessed with this case.  They treated it as a big deal, because it was a high profile case in the press, not because anyone knew who Silsby was.    You may not know this, but the State Department came in for a lot of criticism in the Knox case for acting slowly and not going to see her immediately and that was just for some hippie chick, not Baptist Missionaries.  It's not that the State Department was involved and was monitoring the situation, the point is there were doing despite NO PERSONAL connections to the 10 people arrested, because consular services are routine.

                  AreWeSure you wrote earlier "she was not known TO CLINTON or those around". You don't know who Killary knows and doesn't know. Sure there was nothing in the emails but if you were abducting children for Brownstone Operations YOU WOULDN'T PUT THAN IN AN EMAIL!!!

                 <p>
                  You are speculating and making assumptions because you can't even entertain the thought Killary K Klinton could have broken the law. That's called White Privilege and you should know better!

                   There is no Larry Silverstein evidence just as there is no evidence any of code in the Podesta emails. You don't know get to twist people's words into a what you what them to mean and then claim that as evidence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And you again don't know what strawman is.  Silsby was not known to Clinton.  Not known to Huma Adebdin and not known to anyone at the State Department.  The idea that she did was started as a deliberate deceptively post on TheDonald, by someone claimed there were emails going back years.  Completely false.  There's absolutely no mention of Silsby in Clinton's emails prior to her arrest and when she is mentioned it's by the consular team in Haiti and works it's way up the chain to Clinton.

                    Again you don't know that for sure. But we'll have to agree to disagree. Moving on.

                   <p>
                    You are basing that on more "white privilege". You've given Silverstein an automatic pass he doesn't deserve. Why? Because Silverstein made BILLIONS in insurance payouts after 9/11. Almost immediately after he leased the WTC complex he took out so much insurance on the property it took 25 insurance companies to carry the risk. That was unusual given this is the exact behavior that starts off countless insurance scams. It's classic. By a property, max out the insurance and then burn it down and hope you don't get caught. You're naive but not that naive to have never heard of that scam. So in the light of insurance fraud 1) and 2) below are strong evidence of a crime.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    2) Working on a replacement for WTC 7 a full year before 9/11 is screaming insurance fraud.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Both 1) and 2) would be admissible in a court of law and therefor may be considered evidence. You can't dismiss such strong evidence without compromising your objectivity. But we knew this already. Let's review the Scientific Method again:
