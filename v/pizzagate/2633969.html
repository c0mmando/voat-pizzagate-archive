<p>Does Facebook have an Infowars problem? That depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>Since the social networking giant held an event last week to tout how it\'s fighting false news and misinformation, Facebook has faced some blowback for how it handles Infowars, the far-right site led by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.</p>
<p>Since misinformation on the internet during the 2016 presidential campaign sharpened political divisions, Facebook has publicly mounted an offensive against the spread of false news on its network.</p>
<p>But many journalists have challenged Facebook saying if the site is truly fighting the spread of misinformation, how can it justify continuing to allow an official page for Infowars, which has propagated stories about hoaxes such as Pizzagate, and most recently, the Democrats\' plan on July 4th to attempt to foment a civil war.&quot;</p>
<p>Jones also promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton operated a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C. On Dec. 4, 2016, a North Carolina man opened fire inside the pizza shop. Jones apologized to the restaurant owner. </p>

<p>&quot;Facebook won\'t ban Infowars in its fake-news purge — a site that says 9/11 was staged and the moon landing was fake&quot;</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;fake news&quot; has seen its meaning blur over time. Around 2016 it was widely used to describe false or misleading news designed to influence social-media users politically or to gain advertising dollars, but President Donald Trump hasince popularized it as a phrase to dismiss coverage he doesn\'t like or to discredit accidental mistakes made by news organizations.</p>
<p>Infowars, whose Facebook page has almost 1 million followers, is known for pushing conspiracy theories on its site and on YouTube. Its host Alex Jones has claimed that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax with actors. The outlet has also said 9/11 was a so-called false flag and that the moon landings were faked. Jones also promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, for which he apologized after being threatened with lawsuits.&quot;</p>
<p>Has Alex Jones said something damning recently about Pizzagate or about to? It seems like all of a sudden InfoWars is being attacked and there\'s a call across MSM to ban it and they all keep mentioning Pizzagate. Why?</p>',

            Alex should use the lawsuit to expose Sandy Hoax as the psy-op it was. No kids were killed. The school had been closed for 3 or 4 years. It was all a FEMA drill to terrify Americans into giving up their gun rights. All the fake families were paid in free houses and millions of dollars. They used old photos of the kids when they were much younger. They all sang at the Super Bowl three months after the fake shooting. Alex can win if he goes on offense and brings in expert witnesses researchers who can prove every single aspect of Sandy Hook was Fake.

            I can't remember my login and as a "new" member I can't start a new thread but can someone please look at this info and post or dig on it?  It relates to pizzagate because it is confirmed cases of sexual abuse of kids that was covered up by a mega church in the DC area.  I will post several links below to start your research but there is TONS of info online about the church, the abuse scandal, the pastor(s) involved, the resulting convictions.  In short, CJ Mahaney started Sovereign Grace Ministries (under a different name at the time) and than planted several churches around the U.S. some of the largest being in the DC/Maryland area.  Apparently back in the 1990s there was a pedophile network operating in some of his churches (civil lawsuit
            <a href="http://thewartburgwatch.com/tww2/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20130514115743611.pdf">
             http://thewartburgwatch.com/tww2/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20130514115743611.pdf
            </a>
            lays out the details). I believe the angle that should be investigated in part is WHY the church has never been more thoroughly investigated in spite of multiple claims of abuse, why so many pastors within the church covered up abuse, hid it, helped the perps and discouraged victims from sharing, and especially what potential political connections CJ Mahaney and other prominent pastors involved may have had.  The Catholic church is well known for the sex abuse but the evangelical church scandals are just beginning to come to light.  I think a mega church in DC with a history of abuse and cover ups is a good place to start!  (Once again, please note, the "churches" I speak of in this post relates to Evangelical churches. NOT Catholic churches or scandals.  I believe evangelical churches have just as much if not more corruption, abuse and scandals that have yet to be fully discovered.)

            Also relevant because in the recent Larry Nasser trial, Racheal Denhollander was one of those who publicly spoke out about the abuse she suffered from him.  She had also grown up in a Sovereign Grace church and spoke out about their own sex abuse scandal.
            <br/>
            She called for an independent investigation into SGM

            This civil suit ended up being dismissed on a Technicality-statute of limitations. Its 46 pages long but details the extent of abuse and cover up by pastors at SGM. SGM now uses the case dismissal as "proof" that they were falsely accused.  The details are very horrible and the document hard to read.

            I believe we will find political connections between CJ Mahaney and someone more powerful especially given the location of several of his largest churches in the DC area.  There was a pedophile ring operating within his church and Mahaney claims to have no knowledge of it.  Someone please do more digging on this.  I believe it deserves its own thread if someone could start one.  I have added several more links at the end of this post that are relevant to the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to this church I know of several other mega churches that I believe are operating pedophile rings or allowing pedophiles to access children under the guise of "ministry". Because I have no direct proof I won't post the names because I don't want to be accused of defamation.  I have heard stories tho of a private school (run by a church) principal taking pictures of children on his cell phones, separating a 6 year old girl from her mother and threatening her that she had to come to school that day so her mom could work (child terrified and screaming-was resistant to going to the school-he was alone in a room with her) and other questionable behavior.  Incidentally the man is the son in law of one of the pastors.  A theme I see in churches with abuse issues is relations, pastors and leadership are all related.  This incident was brought to a senior pastor's attention who did nothing about it.
            <br/>
            Another DC area church and my personal experience, a sunday school teacher (nasty old man) who talked to us about sex and later it came out that he sexually abused kids within the church.  Church leadership did nothing when parents complained about his inappropriate conversations with kids.  After years of nightmares about that building and a "secret room" that I was always looking for, I returned to the church and actually found the secret room I'd had nightmares about for the past two decades!  Whether he abused kids in that room, whether I was ever personally abused by him, I don't remember.  But point is, another case of church leadership burying allegations of sexual misconduct.

            Maybe something is going to come out re: pg, and they're trying to do damage control and limit the sources for the info?
           </p>
           <p>
            PG exposure has been a huge thorn in the side of the globalist paedos, from the collapse of the Clinton campaign to our exposure of the trafficking routes. They're also trying to win in the mid-terms and are failing.

            They are trying to legitimize infowars and you are helping. Stop being duped. Do you not remember Alex Jones apologizing for covering PG, on queue, with all the other controlled truther sites? Do you not remember his interview earlier on when he talked about PG, then, at the end of the video said, "now, lets talk about Dogmen..." You guys are tiring. I am rooting for the elite. You all deserve what is coming. No tears over hear. Popcorn.

            This will backfire, by bringing more attention to Infowars. And Facebook knows that Jones will sue them if they do and they don't want that. Jones runs a pretty tight ship when it comes to covering his ass. That's why he won't discuss pizzagate which makes it funny they are saying he started pizzagate in the first place.

            Disclosures are coming. MSM want to fully control the narratives on SheepleBook and the rest. Can't have a site like Infowars holding similar credibility as them. They keep mentioning the 'hoax' pizzagate because Alex Jones was forced to retract his pizzagate stories and apologise. This is also a warning to Infowars. They've became mainstream in themselves with revenues, ads, huge servers required and a business to run to keep their brand going. They may not interest a lot of people here who think theyr too mainstream but for the 'normies'...
If there are major disclosures then normies are more likely to look to infowars for the lowdown.
It is a desperate last grasp at control.

            Alex Jones and all his infowars crew stopped using the term pizzagate on their twitter accounts on December 5th 2016. They then ran with the line that it was a "conspiracy theory" Someone in the establishment got to them on that date.
           </p>
           <p>
            Infowars are therefore disinfo trolls working for the establishment/shadow government. If they go down it's tough shit for them.

             Alex Jones going down is bad news for us. There is absolutely no way it's a good thing. Anyone trying to say it's a good thing is shilling for the other side. They don't want resistance to their censorship

              Thats exactly it Infowars is mainstream and so will appeal more to the mainstream crowd who would never find themselves on voat. If they censor infowars they can control the narrative even more when shit goes mainstream.

Good point. Alex is the Straw man, alternative citizen research and free speech sites are the true targets.

             Maybe, but why the sudden mass call to ban it? All of the MSM are bringing up Pizzagate in their articles.

              I think Alex Jones is controlled opposition, but he is not 100% controlled. He seems to be able to talk about things until someone in the CIA or something tells him to stop talking about that thing, e.g. Pizzagate. In spite of being controlled, he still gets a lot of true information out to a lot of people.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is an election coming up in a few months, and Alex Jones, with his large following, might have enough influence to threaten the Democrats, so they want to shut him down well in advance. Also, there might be some damning information set to be released which they don't want Jones talking about.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think they are bringing up Pizzagate and Sandy Hook because they assume that their readers think that those two "conspiracy theories" are some of the most shameful, disgusting, poisonous, irresponsible and socially dangerous ideas Jones has ever promoted. They probably think that bringing these up will foment public outrage against Alex Jones and contribute to him being shut out of the sphere of public discourse for good. This is just my opinion.

               Alex Jones Info-Wars has always been a straw-man. The power of the truther/research community is that it is decentralized (that's why Communists always organize by "cell groups") and the MSM needs a single target to effectively neutralize it. Sights like VOAT are a big concern for them. We are winning. Over the years, and recently, I have seen a HUGE amount of red pilling evidence by monitoring the comments of You Tube, MSM websites, etc. Have you noticed that many MSM news sites no longer allow comments? VOAT has continually been exposing Pizzagate - not Alex Jones.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here are some of Alex Jones' questionable associations:
              </p>
              <p>
               "The Alex Jones and Bronfman connection
So with the NXIVM news featuring, to name two smallville Allison Mack and the Bronfmans, I came across what I realized to be old news
Alex Jones has a strange, seemingly benign connection with the Bronfmans.
Uses same lawyer and uses the same address as them, as well as 25 pages worth of other companies, it's a huge building. Also on same floor according to filings, which in itself doesn't mean or imply anything.
Alex Jones and the Bronfmans lawyer is Elizabeth M Schurig see here. She is a Bronfman super lawyer.
Holly M Bronfman, sister of Edgar Jr. Bronfman, son of Edgar Bronfman that appears in the address book (black book) of Jeffrey Epstein see here.
Holly Bronfman, also known as Bhavani Lev, or Holly B. Lev.
So, the BET LEV foundation, see here has Holly as the director, and Elizabeth as as the registered agent.
Here is the filing for Infowars - see here.
However, Magnolia Holdings as the governing authority, not Alex Jones until it was updated. (Which seems to just be another company on the list of many others, such as Infowars, Prison Planet, Free Speech Systems and so on.)
See here
               <a href="http://seektress.com/soc11.pdf">
                http://seektress.com/soc11.pdf
               </a>
               Magnolia Holdings seems to be the ghost here, I've checked for places in Austin TX, none seem to fit the bill. Okay it's Alaska / AK and just looks like another company Elizabeth setup for AJ

                https://www.bizapedia.com/ak/magnolia-management-llc.html
               </a>
               David Sewell was originally the Alex Jones lawyer, another "super" lawyer apparently, assigned to Jones from around May 2007 until Elizabeth seemingly took over the duties and began filing all the Infowars companies and so on from Nov 2007 onwards
Sewell -
               <a href="http://sbaustinlaw.com/attorneys/david-sewell/">
                http://sbaustinlaw.com/attorneys/david-sewell/
               </a>
               So if the website is correct, he would've been his Stahl, Bernal, Davies, Sewell, &amp; Chavarria, LLP lawyer for his Alex Jones companies, which was stopped after the Emeric productions filing when Elizabeth took over filing for Infowars, Prisonplanet and others.
This was the time when she was filing the governing authority as Magnolia Holdings LP.
The building and address of infowars dot com governing authority Alex Jones from 2007 onwards -
               <a href="https://100congressave.com/leasing-management">
                https://100congressave.com/leasing-management
               </a>
               I was using corporate wiki and
               <a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/">
                https://www.bizapedia.com/
               </a>
               to look into names and so on, struggled to find anything on Magnolia Holdings LP in Austin TX, at least at the address stated.
Looking at the numbers Magnolia Holdings would've been around from November 2007 to first quarter of 2008, at the very least. Which, upon further digging, appears to just be another company, except at one point Kelly Jones was the manager, pretty normal so whatever.
Main thing I'm curious about, is who Alex Jones handed over governing authority to, with the creation of Infowars and so on, through his Bronfman lawyer, Elizabeth Scurig. No idea how to look into history of manager roll so can't see if Elizabeth was ever more than his filer as a manager etc.
Stuff without links should be sourced through here link which is an extensive piece on AJ, but tbh I couldn't care less I just want to figure out the Bronfman reach and see if it extends to other dodgy shit such as Nixim whatever it's called."

               Alex Jones’ Ex-Wife Seeks Stormy Daniels’ Lawyer in Custody Battle
Ex-wife appears to be in the game. She uses the children to claim Jones' conspiracy beliefs (most are classic alt-news) are dangerous. So, the MSM meme is "conspiracy researchers are dangerous to CHILDREN."  Did a pedo write that script?
Kelly Jones filed for divorce from Alex Jones in 2013 and has been involved in a long-running custody battle to see her three children. She told Newsweek that her ex-husband is not acting in his role on “Info Wars” and that he believes all of his theories.

               Shutting down Infowars will likely be a net positive.  Someone else will rise to fill that void.  Hopefully someone less controlled. And the act of shutting it down itself would be one of those "hmm" moments.

                I think Alex Jones is controlled opposition, but he is not 100% controlled. In spite of being controlled, he still gets a lot of true information out to a lot of people.

               I agree with you that he's controlled opposition. And that's exactly what a limited hangout does: providing some valid info, mixed with false ones.

                Yup. There is one that works this sub regularly. He used to be crafty but after outed has started to go full troll mode.

                I also say "good observations and diagnosis, terrible prescriptions", regarding controlled opposition. They say things that get you to think they are on our side "oh look how they talk about white men being attacked"  ... But their solution is just leading one to the same path we've been on.
