            You guys understand they are trying to achieve immortality whether it is through Singularity or other transhuman ways. They are attempting to "become a god" in their own right.... I know it sounds crazy and most people won't analyze it from this spiritual angle, but this is the angle they view it from.

            Less important side-note: Jimmycommet says, "Loves spending Euros" and then is questioned by "Cummings" "Hahahah, what?!" and Jimmycommet corrects himself,  "Loves being in Europe spending Euros", which I take, (perhaps wrongly), as ,"Don't try to trace large amounts of Euros being transferred into US currency by any of us."

            HELP I MAY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING! 
So I was doing some googling after I seen a post on "Goat Hill Pizza" The goat symbolizing the devil, and I came across this in Wiki: Lévi combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles Devil card and refigured the ram Banebdjed as a he-goat, further imagined by him as "copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes".[citation needed].... An artist who took 2 pictures and turned them in to one and he called it a fucking HE-Goat!!! Cld this be why he refers to it as a HE-Baby??! I'm starting to think this thing is getting a whole lot more disturbing!

            You're  "pretty sure"   it's the same kid.
And you know that   'pretty sure'   how exactly?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you have an expert photo analyst  (at this point partisan and not paid off by a Clinton foundation exec)   who can do an accurate digital evaluation?
Do you have  dna to compare?
Where are  the kids and can we get a digital comparison of these real live kids along with dna?
           </p>
           <p>
            yeah,  but you're  ''pretty sure''.

            Oh,  I'm pretty sure  Podesta's  are up to their  middle fingers in all kinds of scum.
After all,  they are photographed together.

            I'm just asking on behalf of children who have no voice.

            After looking through the Instagram again, a couple observations:
The "chicken lover" remark could be attributed to the way some gay males sometimes turn everything into being about homosexuality (if you've ever hung out with some, you know what I'm talking about). If that was an innocent picture of a father with his baby, this might be the case. It also looks like #hotard was originally stated by someone else and Alefantis was repeating it. If this was an inside joke within their group at the time, such as marking alot of pictures with the hashtag, then the whole thing sort of falls apart. Not shilling, just offering some different possibilities.

            tags are used to identify data so it can be indexed, organized, searched and shared.
Do the kids here not understand that?
           </p>
           <p>
            No matter what crimes were committed by whom it's a safe bet that the tag #carisjames is used to help JA, parents, friends and some day, the child find these images and postings. 
No amount of paranoia or suspicion can convince otherwise.
           </p>
           <p>
            To clear up another possible misconception, caris does not have an iris coloboma, at least not complete. The complete circular outline of her right pupil is visible on all my monitors. It may be possible she has an inferiorly located iris nevus, but that too is dubious. Also possible she has coloboma of other structures, iris not fully involved.  More likely her eyes are just starting to turn dark as she continues normal growth and development (hopefully as normal as possible in Portlandia, at least).
           </p>
           <p>
            It remains noteworthy, a chance association of 3+ with iris coloboma is bloody unlikely (soros, caris, madeleine). Mathematically likely there is none.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, the instagram of JA is pretty incriminating especially in how money is displayed. If there is an association at all, it is about 1x10^12:1 a meaningful one rather than coincidence.

            What is carisoprodol?
Carisoprodol is a muscle relaxer that works by blocking pain sensations between the nerves and the brain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Carisoprodol is used together with rest and physical therapy to treat injuries and other painful musculoskeletal conditions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Carisoprodol may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.

            I wonder if Caris James or some variant of that name was his name before he changed it? I don't know how to sift into that and find record of his original name, but it's an idea.

            Ok I'm checking here and the name of the girl is really Caris. James is Alefantis name. Carisjames looks like is "Caris with James" or something like this.
Maybe it's a dead end.

            Her parents are friends with James alefantis but they are definitely her real parents because there are multiple photos of the mom pregnant, as well as different photos of her growing up.

             I get an "image not found" error on that photo. I found the YT videos of Fy, it shows Fy as a young baby and I can't tell the gender, but could be a boy. "Ceris" possibly a misspelling of "Caris."

             Looks like the girl is Caris, he mispelled for "Ceris". Fy is the boy probably. Maybe a dead end.

            I think #CarisJames is some kind of code for his pedo activities. "James" is himself, but I don't know what Caris means. The fact is: Caris James is not a person, it's an alias for himself. It's like "Pimp James" or something like that. He's a pedo pimp!

            I've looked at these and I do not believe that the Caris in these photos is the same child that Alefantis tagged #carisjames, at least most of the time. In some cases, they look VERY different.

            A lot of us on /pol/ wondered if "caris" was meant to refer to the muscle relaxant, carisoprodol, which goes by the trade name Soma in the US. You can imagine the applications... Although, Caris is also an actual name.

            Are we sure these photos aren't the same girl at different ages?

             Some may be, but I'm sure all are not. A photo layout would need to be created to do this carefully, however.

             That said, if she's not the mother, how does Izette Folger know this baby? This highflying painter/Washington socialite who lives in Jerusalem. What would bring her into contact with the child of a minimum wage CPP waitress?

            Cmon guys James is a tongue in cheek voyeur for the peados, he is their very own celebrity. He's risqué and has a hangout for people who are like minded. The silly bathrooms, kids playing ping pong, late night all ages gigs and the paintings are all for a thrill for those who get kicks out of it. I doubt anything has ever happened in that building, when the worlds your oyster there's better, safer places to go.

            To say it's a 'SHE baby' doesn't strike me at all unusual. Izette Folger is just saying 'it's actually a girl' in a more interesting way.

            Looks like code, or some kind of sick inner joke. He keeps repeating that he/she loves SPENDING EUROS in EUROPE, and it seems like the other people are not getting the "code".
I think he doesn't know the baby. Some european pedo friend sent him the photo, and he shared it, that's why he didn't knew the baby was a girl. Maybe his organization arranged to send the baby to europe to some sick bastards, and he's bragging about it.
Also he says the money belong to the baby. Maybe the baby "earned it", maybe it's the payment for the "services" done by the baby, if you know what I mean. But the money is probably his, the baby will bring the money home for him.
Any thoughts guys? Am i hot or cold here?

             one thing occurred to me - in that pic, the baby is holding 5 x 1,000 Euro stacks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could JA have been implying that this baby cost $5000?
            </p>
            <p>
             The "German Baby For Sale - $1200" pic also comes to mind as another winking price reference.

              Yeah definitely, it's a price tag. Who would walk with that amount of cash if it's not earned by some illegal activity? Cash cannot be traced, that's why.

            Another thing about the instagram is that photo of a baby doll with a price tag.
           </p>
           <p>
            And a comment: "Way overpriced"
           </p>
           <p>
            Why? I don't keep track of dolls price to know if something is expensive or not.

             if you look at that pic in the context of the OTHER pic where the baby is holding 5000 Euros, it sounds even more like a sick derisive pedo joke. If the real baby is 5000, then saying that $1200 for ugly doll baby is "too high" is kind of like saying "i wouldnt eat that disgusting looking burger if it cost 3 cents!"

            Carisjames is not a name. It seems to be a designation, because he uses the tag multiple children.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            In this photo, the little girl is llweynhinkes daughter, Fy. We know because her parents have posted many other images of her with her name on other places like YouTube and such. But Alfantis has tagged her #carisjames even though it is a different child and that is not her name.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it's obvious that the tag refers to a designation rather than a specific child.

             If you look at the dates from each photo, the baby photo is from 205 weeks ago, and the second Toddler photo is from roughly 98 Weeks ago (31 January 2015) + the similar characteristics like eyes / nose etc... Guys, I think we are looking at the same person here, maybe a dead end.
            </p>

            <p>
             This shows the photos as being taken almost 2 years apart, make up your own minds put I'd say that's enough evidence.

              "Even though I am convinced that #pizzagate has validity to it, especially when looking at the big picture (podesta &amp; clinton foundation), and even though I think James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong are extremely creepy &amp; suspicious, I just stumbled upon a comment one voat user made (u/thecoonlol -

              )) with respect to James Alefantis instagram pictures, and thought this should be addressed / clarified:
             </p>
             <p>
              If we look at some of jimmycomet's instagram pictures of babies, we see that "#carisjames" is sometimes added. When looking closely at the pictures of some of these toddlers, and when considering that the timestamp of these pictures spans several years, it appears that the toddler on each of the below pictures is very likely the same baby (the physical features of the baby are also similar).

              Taken together with Alefantis' explanation that he posted pictures of his Godchild for fun (
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyMvYT0vBV0&amp;feature=youtu.be">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyMvYT0vBV0&amp;feature=youtu.be)YouTube)
              </a>
              YouTube)) , there may be some truth to what Alefantis said with respect to the above instagram postings (as strange as they may be). This does not take away from the fact that he posted many other suspicious instagram pictures, but for the sake of clarity to our investigation I thought I should point this out.

              *EDIT: Also just wanted to mention that I have been reading the old reddit sub &amp; the new voat sub for a long time, but have only created my voat account yesterday. I am not a shill. I really believe in the #pizzagate investigation, but I also want to make sure we are critical about the evidence and dont miss details. To be clear: Even if it is the same toddler, this does not change the fact that Alefantis' posts are extremely disturbing *"

               sorry you were called a shill.  I have been called that too a couple of times - it is the go to attack for anyone upset and also I think actual shills call everyone else shills to derail thoughtful, reasonable posters.  This type of observant commentary is much needed.  There are many many more here that support this type of offering.

              Can confirm, at least as much as a second set of eyes can. Look at the recent picture - nose and under eye features match 100%, and if you look at the older photo (of when she was younger) and imagine her with hair, it matches perfectly. The gender confusion thing is definitely weird to me though!

             I agree with this totally. What I was trying to suggest, but did not spell out, was that he tagged the photo #carisjames even though he did not know its correct gender (making it highly unlikely he actually knew its name). So as you state #carisjames seems best understood as a designation for a CATEGORY of babies.

             see my theory on this page.  I'm wondering if it's code for Caris,  transhumanism genetic experiment  (my post on this page has links to Caris)    plus his last name tagged on the end, claiming it's his genetic experiment?

Another post From pictures of "Goat Hill Pizza" and found this artist: Lévi combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles Devil card and refigured the ram Banebdjed as a he-goat, further imagined by him as "copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes".[citation needed].... Could the HE-Baby Alefantis speaks of actually be a sickening experiment?

            So many of these kids look alike it's creepy.  Especially the photo taken on the  voat Antinous avatar displaying a pic of Alefantis next to the child whose hands are taped to the table looked   like Alefantis it's creepy.

              um,  no.   but I'm sure that won't stop you from trying  again.
              <br/>
              I'm sure you'd say that all adults look like each other too?   Perhaps you need to get your eyes tested.
If by looking alike you mean a nose, eyes and mouth, then you'd be right.
              <br/>
              I find it a little concerning that you'd have such little  ??  in thinking that kids are generalized.   hmmm.   Maybe you're on the wrong board?

                Have you really looked at children?    You don't need to be a mom to notice that children look different.  You just need a sense of observation.   This is especially true of white children, because they have different eye coloration, hair color and nose and mouth shapes.

                 I mean, once they get to a certain age, sure. But aside from racial differences, infants are hard to distinguish. They aren't usually marked with memorable, differentiating features.

             The medical uses of the word Caris may be very relevant, because of what we know now about medical experiments conducted by Synthes and The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard. The hashtag #carisjames could be a category of babies that for some reason are particularly suitable for experimentation by one of these kinds of institutes. A working theory might be that Alefantis is bringing babies over from Europe, some for sale to pedos, others for sale to medical institutes.

             I'm linking it with the above info because there's a similar thread here...   google/youtube  controls information that could lead to Alefantis.    It's alleged in the above articles that links    transhumanism.    Caris links have a lot of child locating and  robotic/transhumanism  biology study... not to mention the child placement links to the name Caris, and one that describes internet technology.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why in god's name would a  Caris Chicken factory after the Greek name for grace, - appears to have a lot of photos taken in India,  and a need to  mention that it's  PURE.   What else could chicken be?

             edited to add:   This reminds me of the thread about  the eyes anomaly  coloboma that appears in Soros and  McCann and a few others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also,  an interesting post appeared on this forum just after LegionWills thread about Coloboma, telling us to avoid  looking into the coloboma topic.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where do these  transhumanist labs  get their human  guinea pigs?     Just wondering.

              Ok this might just be an artifact of this image, but look at the pic of the kid again. Does it appear that there is an eye anomaly (right eye, left side of pic) that seems similar to the colomba anomaly of McCann and Soros?

              okay,  this is just an alleged  thesis,  but is this why he keeps calling the kids his ''god children' even though we've heard nothing from the parents in response to his accusation that  people's children are put on the internet?
             </p>
             <p>
              Does the name Caris refer to a genetic experiment and James is his i.d. to it?
             </p>
             <p>
              People keep commenting that the kids  all have the same look.

               That baby with the euros and toddler tied to table are the same. She's in a few of his posts. You can tell just from the big eyes and little bags under them.

                And you know this how?
               </p>
               <p>
                How do you know there isn't   Caris biological engineering involved?
               </p>
               <p>
                Where is the Caris companies  getting their  guinea pigs?
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you know how many siblings look identical?   For example,  my  friends 6 year old girl  looks  exactly like he did when he was that age, except long hair.   I  saw a pic of his kid and thought it was his pic, but he didn't have long hair as a kid.
               </p>
               <p>
                Where are the kids and why doesn't he know its sex if it's the same?
               </p>
               <p>
                Instead he hashtags it  CarisJames and has to be told what sex it is.

                  Would he be able to keep track and remember?   I wonder?   According to one person on this very thread writes that all children look alike.
                  <br/>
                  If a person on this thread has that opinion,  I don't think it's hard to see how a person who may  ''allegedly''  be involved with large numbers may not be able to keep up.
