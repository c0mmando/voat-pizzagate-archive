            I know this does not really belong here but i figure i would find people here that might be interested in participating... basically the idea is to just REWORD mainstream articles that clearly are bs or not... does not matter and then post em on this REALLY FAKE NEWS SITE... so if someone looks up something from a mainstream site they also find it on a FAKE site so they no longer can say with certainty what is fake an is not... in other words take away their power to brand fake news as fake by writing its fake on it ... u know kinda like saying ... ALL MEN LIE ... was that a lie since i am a man... Either way anyone that is interested in helping please PM me ur email and i will send u login info so u can post away.... again i know its not directly pizzagate related but kinda is if you know what i mean .. .also feel free to write whatever you want because hey its all fake right? pizzagate away if u want ... Thank you for your attention.. and sorry for the interruption and bad gramma :-) ..... Also how i could use help getting a share on voat botton... and if people are willing to run instagram or whatever accounts for the site i will gladly link...   no adds no money ... just really really fake news
