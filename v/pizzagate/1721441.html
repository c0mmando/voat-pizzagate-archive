<p>Transcription of Ella’s statement~</p>
<p>Ella; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, my name is Ella Gareeva, and I am the mother of two children from Hampstead, Alisa &amp; Gabriel, who have been unlawfully removed from me 11/9/2014.
This is a high profile case, and you can find the details on our websites HampsteadCoverUp.com and FreeTheHampstead2.com  You will find the links on the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>The Hampstead case is a criminal case which has been blatantly and shamelessly covered up by the British authorities and we have more than enough documented evidence to prove it.</p>
<p>The judgement of notorious High Court Judge Anna Pauffley was fraudulent and in breech of several articles of human rights. She unlawfully assumed the duties of a criminal judge and jury within a secret family court in a case concerning sadistic, satanic ritual abuse of children and the trafficking, torture and serial killing of countless innocent infants. A case which was never a matter for the family court.</p>
<p>Pauffley, further abuse of power by criminally perverting the course of justice throughout the fact-finding or fact-hiding hearing. The crucial evidence, a two and a half hour recording made by the Special Constable, Jean-Clement Yahirou, was hidden away on the second day of the investigation. Pauffley acknowledged this fact of concealment yet failed to order a re-investigation. She dismissed and ridiculed the medical findings of a respected medical specialist in child sexual abuse with 26 years of experience that conclusively confirmed the childrens allegations.</p>
<p>My children, Alisa &amp; Gabriel suffered horrendous sadistic physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual abuse in school at the hands of their father Ricky Dearman, head mistress, Kate Forsdyke, Louis Hollings, Nina Marden and the rest of the teachers at the Christchurch school. Social workers, parents and the members of the Metropolitan Police Service.</p>
<p>They were then further abused, damaged and traumatized by the authorities who removed them from the care of a loving mother and family. Alisa and Gabriel were essentially jailed and held incommunicado for all this time since September 2014. My entire family, my parents, my son, their brother, my sister, uncle and aunts all of whom children are very close to, have been denied contact without any court order in place.</p>
<p>Initially, my children were taken away from me on the pretext that I wasn’t capable to protect them from the abuse of school. However, once Gabriel &amp; Alisa was snatched, they were forced to retract and the criminal acts were covered up.</p>
<p>The satanists who have my children, tattoo and pierce the genitalia of the “special” children. I would like to remind everyone that all the children from the so-called “special families”, all the teachers, and a lot of the parents have devil tattoos on their private parts. Many of them have irremovable distinguishing marks such as birthmarks as in the case of head mistress Kate Forsdyke with her port-wine stain all over her thighs and pudenda, Galyna Upson’s birthmarks and Nina Marden’s mole the size of a 5-pence piece.</p>
<p>All this evidence has been forwarded to the police including the children’s drawings of the distinguishing marks. To this day, none of the perpetrators, including the children’s biological father, Ricky Dearman, was arrested and investigated. Not a single mobile or laptop has been seized, apart from Jean-Clements laptop with the children’s testimonies. No CC-tv footage acquired and watched, no property searched.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Kate Forsdyke was invited to the strategy meeting on the 8th &amp; 9th of September, 2014, literally a few days after the first children’s disclosures on the 5th of September, even though she was named as one of the main abusers and a cult ring-leader, way before the forced retractions. In spite of the well-documented cover up, the British authorities remain quiet. We still await the response from the Home Office and other government organizations.</p>
<p>Since May 2015, at the start of campaign to release Alisa &amp; Gabriel, we learned that the key child protection organizations are unwilling, unable to take any actions, therefore are also complicit in crime and the cover up of that crime. For example, the NSPCC are not interested in investigating the horrendous abuse of my children, Alisa &amp; Gabriel, neither are they concerned with securing the safety of other children who are still being sadistically gang-raped, tortured and traumatized. Amongst them, Sophie, Millie, Clark, James, Ella, Annie, Mia, Georgia, Amelia, Max, Calypso and many others. The majority of these children have tattoos and some, pierce rings like Cartney.
(This author has purposefully left out the family names of children mentioned in the video)</p>
<p>For the second time, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has ordered the police to re-investigate the case with no avail. All major media outlets were served with a Defense Advisory (DA) Notice. This is a notice sent out in questions of national security. According to DNotice.org.uk the objective of such a notice is to prevent and advert public disclosure of information that would compromise UK military and intelligence operations and methods or put at risk the safety of those involved in such operations or lead to attacks that would damage the critical national infrastructure and/or endanger lives.</p>
<p>Is the Hampstead case associated with military and intelligence operations as in other high profile cases, the Jimmy Saville cover-up, the Franklin cover-up, the McMartin case, Finder’s…our research shows that it is. Which means ALL children in this country are in immediate and present danger.</p>
<p>I only had several contacts with Alisa and Gariel, between September and December 2014. Once my children asked to go home and we discussed writing the letter to the judge, all the contacts were immediately suspended. We don’t know if Alisa &amp; Gabriel are still suffering the torture and abuse. They were kidnapped and held by the same people who subjected them to it. We don’t even know whether they are still alive.</p>
<p>According to the fraudulent, unlawful judgement of the above mentioned judge, all my parental right were removed. The local authority is under no obligation to notify me of my children’s health, education or well-being. I, myself, have had to leave the UK in order to protect my life and freedom. I was essentially framed for arrest and prevented from participation in any trial.</p>
<p>When a government agent, Sabine McNeill, published confidential court material on-line, behind my back and without my consent. On the 12th of February, 2015 ten policemen including two person’s with medical kits showed up at my door step threatening to force entry. Luckily I escaped.</p>
<p>We know that the father of the children, Ricky Dearman, accused of torture, cannibalism and serial murder was given double-time access to the children from the beginning and according to the order from August 2015 was considered to be the main guardian and was supposed to receive the full-custody of Alisa and Gabriel within six to twelve months from that order.</p>
<p>In the Hampstead case, we have witnessed the illegalities of police and local authority actions, ignorance of children’s rights, ignorance to risks of multiple children and the abomination of justice delivered by high court is now supported and endorsed by the BBC.</p>
<p>My children were damaged by authorities, unlawfully removed from my care by those authorities, further abused by those authorities who to this day, hope only to arrest and imprison myself for breaking family court secrecy rules where a thoroughly unlawful judgement which has judged me guilty of crimes I did not commit.</p>
<p>The cover up is blatant and is itself, yet, further evidence which most disturbingly gives insight into just how deeply the criminally insane sadists are embedded in every British authority and to the extent that they have full control of BBC news because surely, the BBC news team are not that stupid to miss all of the points now upheld by the IPCC.</p>
<p>We have come up with alternative ways to make general public aware of the injustice that has been done to the children, of the criminal activity taking place in the schools, in the courts, within the police service, social services, local authorities and the danger to all of the children of the UK . With various strategies in mind and the vast support of the public, we appeal to everyone concerned with such a horrific situation to start acting to put an end to these atrocities happening in our society and support our initiatives to free Alisa and Gabriel and all children held captive against their will.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely and whole-heartedly express my deepest gratitude to so many people around the world who are supporting our Alisa and Gabriel. Making and re-posting videos, creating and running websites and blogs, writing to the authorities, disseminating leaflets and spreading the story every way possible.</p>
<p>May God bless you all and keep our children free and safe.

            I don't mean to start anything with you, there's a lot of disinfo surrounding this case...because if you discredit the mother, you can discredit the case.  There are people saying Ella was complicit in the abuse of her children, which is not true.  I've been battling disinfo agents on this premise for almost a year now.  One woman, Angela Power Disney is the single source for this, unsubstantiated. She claims to have viewed (for 3,000 euros) video evidence of Ella masturbating her 3 year old son to sleep, as well as snuff videos produced by Ella herself, supposedly obtained through an MI5 computer hack of Ricky &amp; Ella's computers.  She's not worried about what was supposedly found on Dearman's computer, but what was supposedly found on Ella's computer.  However, when Ella reported the crimes committed against her children her laptop and mobile was confiscated as evidence.  Once in police custody, had police  found this alleged evidence you would have heard about it.  The evidence would have been used in court, yet the court documents say nothing about this.  At all.  Once the police had possession of laptop and mobile, do you think it could have been hacked by MI5?  Maybe...but doubtful.  No, this woman is straight up lying to discredit the case because Ella didn't agree with the recording of every conversation they had and making it public.

            , a description of Ella, pre-cover up
“Originally from the city of Rostov in southern Russia, Ella Draper – or Ella Gareeva as she then was (and has returned to) – attended Moscow State University, where she graduated with a masters degree in history of art.
“It was in Moscow in the Nineties that she met a British banker who would become her first husband (Will Draper).
“She became pregnant and moved to Britain around 17 years ago to raise their son; he still lives with his father (Will Draper) in the Home Counties.
“The marriage eventually ended, but she kept her married name and went on to have two children with the actor Ricky Dearman.”

             “The Past of an Abuser as Father”
            </a>
            “Mr Dearman has never provided financially for the children, except £10 per child per month taken off his benefits during the last 3-4 years. He hardly ever spent any quality time with them at home. He would never read a book or play games with them. The only game he seemed to play was the “tickling game”. I wasn’t happy about this since it always led to some kind of abuse. For example, Mr Dearman wouldn’t stop tickling children even though they would scream for him to stop. Besides, he would normally start this odd game late in the evening when the children would already have taken a bath and be ready for bed. This would send them hyper and those situations would almost always end up in arguments since I wanted to protect the children.
Furthermore, all of a sudden James started to dislike Mr Dearman. Mr Dearman responded with humiliating remarks and attempted to discipline James in strange ways. For example, he would lock him up, while I was at work or shopping, and he would give him a bucket to pee and poo. This would almost always also result in arguments.
He also harassed me sexually, pressuring me to have anal sex with him. He then bought a gigantic artificial penis suggesting for me to use. On many occasions he attempted to get me to watch online pornography.
I objected to his perverted sexual attempts, threw the sex toy in the bin and asked Mr Dearman to pick his stuff he had in my house and not to come there again. (2007) However, he came to school to “surprise” the children and often stalked us, showing up from nowhere: in the park, or on the way to school and in shops.
I warned him on many occasions to stop doing this. But he requested to see the children. Many times he came and knocked on my door without prior notice and several times he broke in through the garden door. On one of such occasions he was violent and humiliated my mother by screaming and hitting her. He ran away before I dialed the police.
Since stalking continued, I applied for an Emergency Court Order, and a Non-Molestation Order was granted for a month initially and then extended for 8 months while proceedings for contact were going on.
I sent Alisa to Russia to stay with my parents. Unfortunately her passport ran out and she ended up staying slightly longer than anticipated.
A week after my application, his solicitors applied for a Prohibited Steps Order since he claimed that I was trying to take the children out of the country. This was dismissed and there is currently no such Order in place.
Mr Dearman also made an application for contact. This was eventually granted in spite of my concerns for the children’s safety. He started to see them regularly: every Saturday from 10am to 6pm.
However, contacts were not going well at all. Mr Dearman was consistently returning the children late. He rejected my advice regarding their diet and was returning packed lunches of home prepared food.
Alisa and Gabriel were frequently getting sick during contact. Many times they vomited while in his care or after they came back home. Sometimes they developed headaches and stomach aches. I blamed this on food that Mr Dearman was feeding them with.
My solicitors and I have sent numerous reminders, requesting not to feed the children with processed, sugary snacks. On one occasion Alisa developed high fever and hardly moved. I contacted the emergency doctor’s line and almost took her to the emergency room.
Not only were the children returning sick or becoming sick shortly after, each time they were coming back in a terrible emotional and psychological state. A lot of Mondays or first part of the school week were missed as a result and affected the children’s education.”

           <p>
            Ella is an intelligent woman, cared about her children's health and objected vocally about Dearman's "perverted sexual attempts."   There were prior violent episodes with Dearman

            "If she ever wants to be convincing..."  The facts of the case are convincing enough.  It's not a story she has to "sell".  She is a mother who's children were being abused by a

             father with a violent past
            </a>
            .  Ella already lost her two children, she doesn't have to go around to the likes of you and sell you a story.  You either want to help her get her children back or you're opposition.  Pure and simple.  I believe the children and think they should be returned to Ella, she was not complicit in their abuse.

            This story is NOT about Abraham Christie.  This case is about the abuse by the father and his cult.  Period.
