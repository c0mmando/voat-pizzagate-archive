<p><em>I\'m not sure what\'s going on with Johnny Vedmore, the independent \'journalist\' that wrote the original piece about Nicole Junkermann which triggered a stream of research about her connections with Epstein.  In his latest piece on Junkermann, Vedmore writes a relatively weak piece of facts which have mostly already been garnered here on Voat. And he seems quite enthralled by the former <s>high class hooker</s> Elite model. But I\'m drawing attention to his latest article because he mentions Voat quite a bit and seems to think that we have been taken permanently offline.  We need to fix that misconception.</em></p>

<p>Before I published my original article, I spent a very long-time contemplating the various potential outcomes. It is within Nicole Junkermann’s character to fight every battle, even if it’s a battle against the truth. I knew what I was letting myself in for by highlighting her powerful links so concisely. But it was the right thing to do. In fact, the article was just a collection of information which was already available in various places online. But Nicole Junkermann didn’t expect anyone with an independent opinion to scrutinize the scattered evidence. <strong>When the quirky investigators at <a href="https://archive.fo/ArZdi">VOAT.com started to develop her associations further</a>, the entire site came under a massive cyber attack that would literally take VOAT offline permanently.</strong>  That was the moment when everybody involved truly began to believe that Nicole Junkermann was actually an agent of the Mossad. That decision to illegally attack and destroy the work of many clever VOAT users and the livelihood of the website\'s creators caused a tidal wave throughout some of the independent media’s vast community. To the thousands of people involved, that act of unadulterated and unlawful cyber-terrorism, committed to protect Nicole Junkermann, was an obvious sign of her importance. Whether that act was actually perpetrated by Nicole Junkermann and Carbyne911, or by another conspirator, is irrelevant. That is the moment everybody began assuming that Nicole Junkermann had definitely been a member of the Mossad for decades. To those who witnessed the online aggression and extreme censorship of VOAT, Nicole Junkermann’s links to Jeffrey Epstein and Israeli intelligence were fused forever. After all, if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and cyber-attacks like the Mossad, then it’s probably not a duck that you’re dealing with. </p>

<p>I thought I\'d do some scratching around to see if there is anything else we can find and found this blog : <a href="http://nicolejunkermann.blogspot.com/">http://nicolejunkermann.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>So here\'s one story about her connections to the Serpentine Gallery in London <a href="http://nicolejunkermann.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-serpentine-summer-party-2014.html">The Serpentine Summer Party 2014: Brendan Mullane and Nicole Junkermann amongst the guests</a> [archived: <a href="http://archive.is/wip/CdUZU">http://archive.is/wip/CdUZU</a>]</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the social calendar in London, the Serpentine Summer Party welcomes A-list celebrities and art enthusiasts from around the world. Paparazzi flock to the event to capture a shot of the varied fashion labels on display, while the famous revelers enjoy mingling and being entertained by various speakers and acts throughout the evening.</p>
<p>..In 2014 the party was attended by well-known personalities from around the world, including Bradley Cooper, Lilly Allen, Naomi Campbell, Noel Gallagher, Mark Ruffalo and Cara Delevingne. Influential and successful businesspeople from around the globe also attended and included Brioni\'s creative director Brendan Mullane, entrepreneur Nicole Junkermann, and the French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault. </p>
<p>..Guests like Princess Beatrice, Kiera Knightley and Nicole Junkermann continue to support the work carried out by the Serpentine Galleries so it continues to inspire generations of art lovers all over the world.</p>

<p>I tried to find any images of her at the event but couldn\'t find anything further. However I did find an image of her at a 2018 Serpentine Galleries party, listed under her married name Countess Nicole Brachetti Peretti <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/serpentine-gallery-summer-party-kensington-gardens-london-uk-19-jun-2018-9721954hx">https://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/serpentine-gallery-summer-party-kensington-gardens-london-uk-19-jun-2018-9721954hx</a></p>

               kept submitting rule-breaking posts

              . I don't know why. I tried hard to help them edit, but they kept doing it. They posted a lot of interesting stuff about vaccines, which I have always thought play a large role in the pedovore depopulation control agenda.

             "As a production company working exclusively within mixed reality, we wanted to take advantage of something that has never been possible before, which is the ability to convey the truth of a human being in the room," said Eckert in a statement.

Influential and successful businesspeople from around the globe also attended and included Brioni's creative director Brendan Mullane, entrepreneur Nicole Junkermann, and the French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault.

            The CEO of the Serpentine Galleries in London resigned from her role following a Guardian article alleging her connection with Novalpina Capital Management, a company co-founded by her husband which has investments in an Israeli cyber intelligence firm called NSO Group. She said in a statement, “The work of the Serpentine … cannot be allowed to be undermined by misguided personal attacks on me and my family. These attacks are based upon inaccurate media reports now subject to legal complaints.” | BBC

              Sir Elton John, a part-time Atlanta resident and passionate HIV/AIDS advocate, was originally drawn to Open Hand Atlanta’s mission as a volunteer in the early 90’s, and he has remained an avid supporter, delivering the agency’s one millionth meal, granting funds through the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and personally contributing to Open Hand’s recent capital expansion project.

             That comment also shows some connections to United Way. I have done many posts and comments on United Way.  We know that Bill Gates's mother was on their board.

             Sorry I'm two days late on this. This is such a PG NWO prime example, and important story with regards to COVID-19. I'm glad its come back up and you're all aware of the web connected to Serpentine. Seems to be a Comet worth getting the telescope out for, if you catch my drift.
