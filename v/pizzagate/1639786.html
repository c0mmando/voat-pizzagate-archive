<p>The site is waxing poetic about a place called Amsterdam Design Glass. No big whup, except that a heading states, “Amsterdam Studios Design Glass – Glass Pipes, Smoking Pipes” Smoking pipes? I scroll down and there is a link to SMOKING METH and MAKING YOUR OWN METHAMPHETAMINE? And right under that? A paragraph on a new studio in South Amsterdam run by a Lebanese woman named PAULE-CARRES. </p>
<p>Why her name is on that website I don’t know. There is no evidence that she’s involved with drugs, only that this site is alluding to her selling paraphernalia that might be used to ingest both legal and illegal substances. Since I didn\'t know she was involved in glass design, I was more than surprised. Shocked would suffice. As for Amsterdam Design Glass, if you do a search, a number of hits come up, all hinting strongly at drug usage. Here’s a capture of a search: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/2s3j8">http://imgur.com/a/2s3j8</a> And a forum search shows the same thing: <a href="https://forum.grasscity.com/threads/amsterdam-design-studio-bongs-water-pipes.1347262/">https://forum.grasscity.com/threads/amsterdam-design-studio-bongs-water-pipes.1347262/</a> </p>
<p>As said, I have no idea what this means other than that’s what’s there. However, this weird ass clue was enough to get my mind spinning in the direction of drugs and usage and prompted another search. I was more than surprised when an article popped up about an attorney named Paul Hampton Thomson. Here’s the link: <a href="http://www.nvdaily.com/news/2011/09/thomsons-issues-stemmed-from-tragedies-lawyer-says/">http://www.nvdaily.com/news/2011/09/thomsons-issues-stemmed-from-tragedies-lawyer-says/</a> </p>
<p>Summarization of article: Dated September 28, 2011, an attorney named Paul Hampton Thomson was arrested for tampering with text messages, possessing cocaine and two counts of witness tampering. His former legal assistant, a Nannette Susan Boden, was cooperating with the prosecution and was facing charges of her own for the sale of cocaine. A letter from Mr. Thomson’s psychologist stated that the drinking and drugs were brought on by the death of his son, Tom, and that the tragedy brought on PTSD, but here comes to kicker: The psychologist who wrote the letter is none other than Glenn Paule-Carres, Ms. Patti Paule-Carres’ husband. </p>
<p>Warning bells went off in my head? Drugs? Death of an INFANT son? Three teenage sons sticking up for him? Were they all biological? Remember that the Paule-Carres were involved in those shell companies and adoption services, so was this a client? (Original post detailing Paul-Carres’ involvement in the adoption services: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1517186">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1517186</a> ). If not, what was the relationship? All those questions were on my mind as I dove back into the dumpster. It wasn’t long before I came up with this article that gave a little more info and whole lot more questions. <a href="http://archive.is/wS95m">http://archive.is/wS95m</a>   
</p>
<p>1) First off, that former legal assistant Susan Nannette Boden, is not Susan, he’s Neil…or was Neil and is now Susan. This is so poorly written I can’t tell, but it is clear that CSI did not inquire about Neil/Susan’s customer list even though this is a known dealer? Really?!!!</p>
<p>2) That a call came in the next day and reported that a man walking on West Clifford Street was wearing a green vest, carrying a pole, and shouting that he was going to kill someone. Police responded and took him to the Winchester Medical Center. He was released after a counselor determined that his actions didn’t meet the criteria for a temporary detention order. REALLY? So wandering around with a weapon in your hand shouting that you’re going to kill someone isn’t enough. And a friend of Mr. Thomson witnessed it (A William A. “Beau” Bassler”). What the friend was doing there is never discussed. </p>
<p>I still wasn’t satisfied. I was sure there was more to this story, so I dug deeper. I first went to Linked In and found that Mr. Thomson is another big time supporter of children. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hampton-thomson-b3364782">https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hampton-thomson-b3364782</a> 
Causes Paul Hampton cares about:
    Arts and Culture
    Children
    Civil Rights and Social Action
    Disaster and Humanitarian Relief</p>
<p>Yup, that about covers the talking points, but I kept scratching and hit pay dirt!!! <a href="http://archive.is/7BJ8H">http://archive.is/7BJ8H</a></p>
<p>Summarization: Dated February 5,2011. Written by Barbara Hollingworth for The Examiner. She article states that Attorney Thomson is reportedly a nephew of state senator Harry Byrd and that his Democratic &quot;Organization&quot; consisted of a statewide courthouse clique that controlled Virginia politics for 50 years. She asserts that the “crony-run Byrd Machine” lingers throughout the courthouses of the state.</p>
<p>She also states that the charges throw into question all Thomson’s cases, including the conviction of Franklin Washington’s son on murder charges. Commonwealth\'s Attorney Alex Iden asked that the erasure of a potential witness be looked into because it was rumored that Thomson slept with a court reporter. Then there’s the attorney for the defendant pocketing money, but telling his client that if he doesn’t plead guilty, they’ll kill him. I should add that Prosser was now a circuit judge! It goes on and on, but the Big Magilla is the charge that Paul Hampton Thomson, the one that Glenn Paule-Carres wrote that letter for, was skimming money off of drug dealers. Here’s the quote: “a Feb. 17, 1999 report filed by Winchester Sgt. David Sobonya, who said he ‘received information that (redacted) wants to provide information that Paul Thomson is skimming money from drug dealers’.&quot;</p>
<p>The reporter asks if this was followed up. It certainly should have been, but perhaps not in the “Byrd Machine”. It certainly adds no legitimacy to Mr. Paule-Carres’ claims that the behavior was an aberration caused by PTSD. It seems he’s been acting lawlessly for years (if these charges are to be believed) and that nobody in Virginia cares! </p>
<p>Seriously, this case is ripe for opening and getting convictions. If there is a “Byrd Machine” and it is gotten rid of, it would rid Virginia of the tyranny. And notice how the dems don’t seem to care about race when railroading scapegoats and throwing them in prison. But this is more than enough for officials to launch in and try to clean things up. This is most likely how they\'ve been keeping clean for years. Get someone sympathetic to the cause/narrative, have them skim money from people engaged in drugs/human trafficking (who would they complain to), find a scapegoat so they can cover up their crimes, and keep everything under control by controlling the courts. Really DISGUSTING!!!</p>',

            This is not as shocking as it should be.

            Lets see how many Judges the Pizzagate can take down. If its zero, thern we know they selectively targeted. 
At this point, the PEDO network must be destroyed, utterly. If not by Sessions, then by us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Delaware has an even more sinister set-up, btw. DuPont and Bidens.. And now deceased beau biden has a child protection organization posthumously run in his name.. Too bad he wouldn't apply the law to a rich pedo. It was only his sworn duty.

             I'm sure this is going on in other states, but Thomson's getting caught because of one cop who wouldn't give up and give him a pass allows us evidence of the wrongdoing. A convict's father proclaiming his son's innocence is dismissed, but when you can see the machinations involved in scapegoating an individual, then we have something conclusive that we can work with. Now I'm so curious as to why the drug dealer was eliminated. Did he have  black book and a list of names that could be used as blackmail? Or did he simply refuse to pay out the dems cut that month and pay the price for not going along with the network? I think we should all send a medal to the cop mentioned who made Thomson's life miserable. We need more officers like him.

              Have you watche dany of George Webb.  I think you can use his format.  Create a visual board that links the dots as you posted.   Get others to add further information, as it builds create more boards until we have it mapped out for this county/state.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think it is the only way forward and if we do it this way.  We can see who in LE might be part of the ring, who in legal is involved and who in govt.

               Hmmmm .... that isn't a bad idea. I'll have a look. I really would love someone to reopen that investigation. Maybe George Webb or another pizzagater journalist could speak to that reporter for The Examiner? I'll bet there was tons of stuff she didn't use. Hey, come on, guys! Talk to her.

            Great work.   The legal system protect their own.  Everything is set up to keep the serfs in their pen while giving the patina that the rule of law is applied to all.    I think if we can start gathering information like this and show state by state how it really works maybe we can start to unravel the corruption

             this is absolutely true. If you go against the legal system they ruin your life. The lawyers on both sides are bought off before you even begin. They will also ruin the life of anyone who tries to help you with false accusations of practicing law without a license.

             You're welcome. I'm so angry about this stuff. If someone would just investigate this crap when it first happens, it would never rise to this level of corruption. When it does, they can pretty much do whatever they want because they're policing themselves, and involving others in the cabal by making them scapegoats. The thought of someone railroaded and shut away in prison because of this is outrageous.
