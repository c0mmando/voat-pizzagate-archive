<p>Corey Lewandowski, Trump\'s former campaign manager and very staunch ally, has just called for the Senate to have Patrick Byrne testify about his involvement with Maria Butina. This gives even more credence to the legitimacy of what Byrne is saying. Lewandowski is nothing but a stand-up guy who is hell-bent on supporting our POTUS and getting the swamp cleaned of saboteurs. He would never jeopardize Trump\'s legitimacy or administration, and if he dared do this to a LARP or somewhat whose motives were not as stated, that\'s what he\'d be doing. </p>
<p>Here\'s the tweet from Sara A. Carter who is another bulldog of supporting #MAGA and the Trump administration: </p>
<blockquote>

<p>says the Senate should call former <a href="https://voat.co/u/Overstock">@Overstock</a></p>

<p>Let me know if you think #PatrickByrne should testify.</p>
<h1 id="md-mariabutina-russiainvestigation-thesaracartershow">MariaButina #RussiaInvestigation #TheSaraCarterShow</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>The tweet is linked to an article she wrote about Patrick Byrne sitting down and revealing his story to several journalists who included Sara A. Carter: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://saraacarter.com/russia-probe-twist-a-billion-dollar-ceo-a-convicted-russian-agent-and-the-fbi/">https://saraacarter.com/russia-probe-twist-a-billion-dollar-ceo-a-convicted-russian-agent-and-the-fbi/</a></p>
<p>There are only several other reporters with knowledge of what you are about to read and another who is aware of the situation with Byrne. Byrne recounted his story of his involvement with the FBI and DOJ on video during the private meeting he arranged with this reporter, and several others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is a link confirming that Lewandowski did call for Byrne to testify: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/corey-lewandowski-senate-should-call-ex-overstock-ceo-patrick-byrne-to-testify-about-alleged-involvement-with-russian-agent">https://www.foxnews.com/media/corey-lewandowski-senate-should-call-ex-overstock-ceo-patrick-byrne-to-testify-about-alleged-involvement-with-russian-agent</a></p>
<h1 id="md-corey-lewandowski-ex-overstock-ceo-patrick-byrne-should-testify-about-alleged-ties-to-russian-agent">Corey Lewandowski: Ex-Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne should testify about alleged ties to Russian agent</h1>
<p>Speaking on Fox News\' “The Story” with Martha MacCallum, Lewandowski, who was mentioned several times in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s report on the Russia investigation, weighed in on Byrne’s resignation after 20 years at the company amid his ties to a government investigation related to the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>Last month, Byrne disclosed he was involved in an FBI probe of Russia and admitted he had a relationship with Maria Butina, who pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to act as a Russian agent without registering with the Justice Department. ... </p>
<p>Lewandowski responded to Byrne’s announcement and his interview with MacCallum saying, “it may have been the craziest interview I have ever seen in my life.”</p>
<p>He went on to say, “I have been unfortunately knee-deep in this investigation.”</p>
<p>He continued, “I’ve testified in front of the House on two separate occasions, the Senate already, the Mueller investigators. Never had I ever heard of this individual, never has he even been brought up in conversations. He clearly had nothing to do with the campaign and if he was somehow involved with this former Russian spy, she was likely using him as a source for information.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another quote from Lewandowski: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last summer, watching television and some congressional hearings, I figured out where these orders came from. They came from a guy named Peter Strzok,&quot; Byrne said, adding the names of other individuals, who MacCallum pointed out also worked at the FBI.</p>
<h1 id="md-in-response-lewandowski-said-this-seems-like-a-lot-of-black-helicopters-flying-around-this-guys-world-things-that-he-cant-talk-about.">In response, Lewandowski said, “This seems like a lot of black helicopters flying around this guy\'s world, things that he can’t talk about.”</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you go! IF any part of Byrne\'s allegations are true, they would reach to the highest levels of the FBI and even Mueller! Remember, the contention is that exculpatory evidence was withheld at her trial and that would mean Mueller was in some mighty big hot water. </p>
<p>So, yes, Lewandowski admits that this is a strange story ... and it is. But he also crowns it with merit by wanting him brought before the Senate. This would not only protect Byrne because it would all be out on the table, but it would get the truth out and that\'s, ultimately, what we want. </p>
<p>Lewandowski is putting himself on the line. He has an upcoming Senate race that he needs to win. I doubt very much he\'d do anything to crush his chances by backing someone who was a LARP.</p>

             Look, I feel this is important. The Mueller investigation to take down our POTUS has always been considered part of pizzagate because of the links to Skankles and the cabal being behind this.
            </p>
            <p>
             If people aren't interested -- fine. I don't have a problem with that. But the interesting thing is that I didn't know anyone was making these types of comments because I wasn't getting notifications. Now if I wasn't getting notifications, then they must be being made from those I've blocked and know are troll/shills. You're the intermediary and are now telling me which again is fine.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lewandowski was part of pizzagate as he had the same type of wrap-up smear pulled on him as Kavanaugh. Now Kavanaugh's confirmation was also considered pizzagate and I don't remember that being taken down. Don't you remember that very believable story about the reporter being wrestled to the ground by her wrist that sustained an ugly bruising only the wrist she showed had a mole on it when her actual arm didn't have a mole? And then the embarrassment of a video of the non-incident showed her statements/allegations to be completely falsified. Unfortunately, there wasn't a camera in the bedroom where the skank from California said she was assaulted, but there were those pesky inconsistencies.
            </p>
            <p>
             The upshot is if you're trying to get me upset, I'm not. If you believe this isn't pizzagate, remove it, but it would be ridiculous since the previous submissions were deemed pizzagate and allowed to remain so .... ????? As to the people trolling, I don't care, will not care, and can only say the best feature on this site is the block function. No, I do not read comments from those I block and will not start now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Have a nice day. If you need me to add anything or have any suggestions of what I should add, pls do so. It might even be from the list of things above or it might be because three other submissions were deemed pizzagate-related.

             It has everything to do with pizzagate. The Mueller Report always was considered pizzagate since it was the failed coup of Skankles. Has that changed?
            </p>
            <p>
             This has ties to that because, according to Byrne, the FBI was committing political espionage by planting contacts in three (well, actually four because he maintains they were doing it to Skankles also but I'm concentrating on Skankles' opposition) GOP presidential campaigns. The common link is the FBI, Strzok, and, yes, Comey. Since when is Comey not considered pizzagate? I'm really kind of amazed here, but then I've just woken up. This story, if true, ties directly to Comey and indicting Mueller for: conducting an investigation where there is no crime for the purpose of what? Blackmail? Learning something they could use as blackmail? Again, pizzagate ... blackmail is pizzagate and has to do with how they keep people in line.

             I'm not sure what you want me to say. If a submission is deemed relevant and an update is done, how can it not be relevant? But I don't run this site. I am not a mod. I'm posting so pls just do what you are going to do, it's fine. I'm not upset. I'm not upset with some not finding this interesting. I'm really not. So you decide ..... or tell me what I need to do. I'm really just trying to submit things that I believe are relevant and important and stories that we need to keep up on and this is one. There also is a HUGE tie-in to something the I plan on posting about that is most definitely pizzagate ... pizzagate in my opinion ... maybe not yours ... and if it's not? That's what the deletion button is for.

             <p>
              They are very obviously not interested in taking the rules seriously and are pushing the envelope to a place where Comey's breakfast is now PG because Comey is PG.
             </p>
             <p>
              This user has about 1 hour to remove this submission and learn the rules before I pull the trigger.
