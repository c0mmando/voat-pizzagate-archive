            There is no NBC news report that says
" Hillary Clinton 'Covered Up' Elite Pedophile Ring At State Department"
           </p>
           <p>
            This is flat out fake and you can see how hard the page you link to tries to keep that information from you.  These allegations were about the Diplomatic Security Service and none ever reached the office of the Secretary of State.  The Allegations came out in 2013 and the were investigated and dismissed in 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            The allegations were investigated by the office of the Inspector General.  You can read their report here.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://oig.state.gov/system/files/esp-15-01.pdf">
             https://oig.state.gov/system/files/esp-15-01.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            They basically recommend a stronger and formal "firewall" policy in cases like these.   They do not say a pedophilia scandal was covered up by anyone let alone Hillary Clinton.  Also the accusation was mainly about one guy. Not a ring.   The OIG report doesn't even mention anything about minors or being underage because the original accusation about prostitutes in general was false.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was never much of anything to this "pedophilia scandal." The Diplomatic Service looked into this and determined the allegations to be false two years before the allegation became public.  The ambassador used to routinely walk through a local park on his way to his office and the allegations was he was seen in the park talking to drug dealers or prostitutes. He often did this without any security, because the security situation in Belgium at the time was OK and the State Department allowed this.  This became an allegation he was routinely ditching his security detail to solicit prostitutes and do drugs.  Another version was he would take this security detail to the park solicit prostitutes or he would reward them with underage prostitutes.  This was in 2011.  The allegation only became public in 2013 because someone who was not involved in the investigation stole a bunch of files and in this case was claiming the raw allegation was true and removed due to interference.   It was removed because it was false.
           </p>
           <p>
            When this hit the news the Belgian papers pointed out there were no arrests in that park for illegal activity for 4 years, the Belgian security services said they actually routinely surveilled him and never saw anything out of the ordinary. The ambassador said he talked to hundreds of people in that park and never knowingly talked with a criminal. The Belgian press rallied to his side because he was very popular in Belgium.   In the end the State Department apologized to the ambassador.

             It's true the cases involving the little guys wouldn't have risen to the level of the secretary of state.

             Howard Gutman was one of the biggest donors, and fundraisers, for the Democratic party.
            </p>
            <p>
             He donated $86k personally and he raised over $700k just for the 2008 campaign &amp; inauguration alone.
            </p>
            <p>
             His ambassadorship was a reward from the DNC higher-ups.

            <p>
             <strong>
              When the pedophilia allegations surfaced about a guy that high profile, and that important to the NC's campaign coffers, it is certain that the info went straight to the Secretary of State's inbox

              There's zero reason this would get reach the Secretary's office.  It never would have gotten out of the Security team because  the charges were false and they determined this in 2 days.  Precisely for this reason, it wouldn't get widespread.  You would be ruining someone's reputation on false charges.   The IG report basically said the charges of interference were mainly due to office gossip, where the people NOT involved in the particular investigation made the charges.

               While this whole cognitive dissonance thing, or whatever it is the RS poster has got going on, is pathetic, it's often interesting to analyze just where subtle, key misrepresentations are used to paint a misleading picture.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here we go:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                the charges were false and they determined this in 2 days.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               It's a subtle assertion, and it would make everything sound hunky-dory.
              </p>
              <p>
               But it's a misrepresentation because here's what actually happened:
              </p>
              <p>
               "
               <em>
                after only two days of preliminary inquiry, the agent was directed to stop any further investigation into the matter, because of a decision by senior Department officials to treat the matter as a “management issue
               </em>
               .”
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-20/watergate-style-break-covered-shocking-wave-clinton-state-department-scandals">
                http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-20/watergate-style-break-covered-shocking-wave-clinton-state-department-scandals
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               So
               <strong>
                the security team did not determine the falsity of the charges in 2 days
               </strong>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's what the IOG's report
               <strong>
                actually
               </strong>
               said:
              </p>
              <p>
               "
               <em>
                before the preliminary inquiry was halted, only one of multiple potential witnesses on the embassy’s security staff had been interviewed. Additionally, DS never interviewed the Ambassador and did not follow its usual investigative protocol of assigning an investigative case number to the matter or opening and keeping investigative case files
               </em>
               ".
              </p>
              <p>
               In other words, the agent had only managed to interview one person before he got yanked out, and someone prevailed upon the security team to not record a case number, and to get rid of the files.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                The security didn't prove squat, either about Howard Gutman's innocence or his guilt. Their investigation got pulled out from under them before the investigator could get much of anything done.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Senior State Department staff intervened, they pulled the investigating agent out of Belgium, and they changed the issue from an investigation to a 'management issue,' where everything could be handled internally at senior levels.
              </p>
              <p>
               See how the sleight-of-hand works, readers?
              </p>
              <p>
               RS's statement was an outright falsehood, but it's easy to miss.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now let's go on to another misrepresentation:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                There's zero reason this would get reach the Secretary's office. It never would have gotten out of the Security team
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Zero Reason?
              </p>
              <p>
               What part of "
               <em>
                We're talking about pedophilia allegations against an Ambassador
               </em>
               " don't you understand?
              </p>
              <p>
               Failing to notify senior State Department managers about something this huge would be a firing offense.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact, the Howard Gutman matter
               <strong>
                did
               </strong>
               get out of the security team and into the highest levels of the Secretary's office. Big time.
              </p>
              <p>
               Senior department officials got involved in pulling the investigator out Belgium and doing the paperwork to convert the investigation into a 'management issue' to be handled by senior managers.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact, it went so high that it was Under Secretary of State for Management, Patrick Kennedy, who initiated the intervention.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Under Secretary of State for Management sits on the President's Management Council, and reports to Counselor to the Secretary of State Cheryl Mills at that time) who reports directly to the Secretary of State (Hillary Clinton at that time.)
              </p>
              <p>
               When Howard Gutman was flown over to Washington to discuss the charges,
               <strong>
                it was Patrick Kennedy and Cheryl Mills who interviewed him personally
               </strong>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                This shit was being handled at the highest levels of the State Department
               </strong>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               And if you actually believe that Cheryl Mills didn't report the Gutman affair in detail to Hillary Clinton, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you . . .
              </p>
              <p>
               So, readers, do you see how the subtle misdirection is used?
              </p>
              <p>
               If interested readers would like to read the report issued by the Inspector General's office, you can get it here:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141017160310/http:/oig.state.gov/documents/organization/233250.pdf">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               In that report you will find no statement that "
               <em>
                the charges of interference were mainly due to office gossip, where the people NOT involved in the particular investigation made the charges
               </em>
               "
              </p>
              <hr/>
              <p>
               And RS, I don't know what your deal is, whether it's personal cognitive dissonance, or you're an activist, or a paid guy, but you're embarrassing yourself and wasting the time of the serious people on here.

                I think you're quite wrong on a lot of things, but you actually go to the IG report for evidence and not the silly link at the top of the thread.  And the IG report backs up my contention

             Nice try moron. DS/DSS has been embroiled in Bacchu Bazi, Ambassador kid diddling, etc. for years. DS/DSS fell under PAtrick Kennedy.  He's part of the problem as well - Deep State.  All of this stuff rolls right up to SoS.
            </p>

             Of course the report wouldn't mention underage or minors.  That's called WHITEWASHING.

             I'll make the assumption that you haven't walked the halls in Foggy Bottom.  State is cleanout trap for the swamp.  The worst of the worst.  That's where the CIA takes their leads.

              Pizzagate is fake.   Start with Podesta's emails.   How do you get to this crazy elaborate theory from there?           You can't.  You have to start making stuff up pretty quickly.  This pedophiles control the world theory has existed in the some form for a long time and the pizzagate fakers knowing tapped into these long-standing paranoias that also connect with One World Government, New World Order and other conspiracism.  That's one part that completely confused me for a while.  This is one step above the British Crown controls the world and they are actually Lizard People.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pedophilia is real, but Pizzagate is fake. Not a single bit of Pizzagate has turned out to be true.  The deputy attorney general of CA having child porn on his computer is not Pizzagate.  It's a personal and private crime.  No one else has to know he sought this stuff out.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's a ton of pedophilia out there.   But the idea it's all connected is false or that it's some form of government currency is crazy.  Have you ever known someone who worked for the government?  Or the military?  Is there some moment they stopped being a regular citizen and became part of some elite conspiracy?
             </p>
             <p>
              When you look into these claims you see  that pizzagate was started by highly political partisans speaking to an audience that already hated Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, indeed they believed the crazy Clinton rountinely murders people silliness from the 1990s.  People who already hated Clinton  and didn't care about the truth of any accusation about her.   So already a super emotional/irrational space and they added pedophilia.   Who doesn't want to protect kids.   Another super emotional subject.  You added these together and people did not look rationally at the claims that were being made and then so many people were buying in they thought the original claims were validated.  They were not.  There's no evidence whatsoever for any code being used in John Podesta's emails.  None.  In fact, when you look at the claims for code, you find they do not exist on the internet before the Podesta emails came out.  Thus, the evidence shows the claimed code list was invented to support pizzagate, not the other way round.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would be willing to discuss this further, if you want to point to an example.

                I've done it many times.  There's no evidence whatsoever that Hillary Clinton or anyone else in Washington DC, had any idea at all about who Laura Silsby and this group of Baptists from Idaho were before they got arrested in Haiti.
               </p>
               <p>
                They were arrested in Haiti and the Consulate was notified.  Consular services for Americans arrested overseas is one of the primary functions of the state Department.  From a previous thread
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 There is no Clinton-Silsby Trafficking Scandal. There is zero evidence anyone in Washington, DC, let alone Secretary Clinton knew who Silsby was prior to Silsby's arrest. There's zero evidence anyone in Washington, DC knew about this group of Baptist would-be-missionaries from Idaho before they go arrested.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This whole "scandal" relies on readers who aren't aware that consular services to Americans abroad is one of the primary functions of the US State Department and consular services include assisting those who are arrested overseas, in fact, it's one of the "highest priorities."

                <p>
                 One of the highest priorities of the Department of State and U.S. embassies and consulates abroad is to provide assistance to U.S. citizens incarcerated abroad. The Department of State is committed to ensuring fair and humane treatment for U.S. citizens imprisoned overseas. We stand ready to assist incarcerated citizens and their families within the limits of our authority in accordance with international law, domestic and foreign law. See that page for what the State Department can do and what they can't do If you look at the Amanda Knox case where the American woman was falsely arrested for murder in Italy, you can see that The State Department was following that case too. In fact, the State Department was criticized for reacting slowly in that case.
If you read the Silsby's emails from the very beginning, you see that information flowed up the chain from the on the ground folks in Haiti to the Secretary's office and the emails clearly show them trying to find out who these folks are and get more information. The first emails refer to them at "10 AMCIT" which is State Department lingo for 10 American citizens.

                The Moloch thing is what?  One jokey reference from a diplomat at the State Department.  The one one where he was joking about a rabbit's foot and superstions?   What others are there.

                    It's a document named nlcrhaitianorphanrescuemission.pdf.  It's a document that a State Department employee downloaded from the website of Silsby's church, according to wikipedia, this was the URL of it.  But it has since been taken down.
                    <a href="http://www.esbctwinfalls.com/clientimages/24453/pdffiles/haiti/nlcrhaitianorphanrescuemission.pdf">

                    </a>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This was the document that Laura Silsby used to recruit people and raise funds for the Haiti "mission."  This is why the other folks were not jailed.  They basically were volunteering for something their church sponsored, not knowing the woman in charge of it was a crackpot.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    From the very beginnings of pizzagate, a false story has been pushed about this document.  Literally the 3rd and 4th sentences of the Reddit Post that started this is completely false
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>
                     Hillary has a LONG history of interest in Ms. Silsby. Wikileak emails dating back till at least 2001 have been found in her archives discussing Laura's NGO.
                    </p>
                   </blockquote>
                   <p>
                    It absolutely false that Hillary has a LONG history of interest in Silsby.
It is absolutely false this document is an email.
It is absolutely false this document dates back to 2001.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Reddit's TheDonald fans couldn't have cared less if this was true, but it's mind boggingly that anyone else believed it.  For one thing WIKILEAKS DOES NOT HAVE EMAILS FROM 2001!
For another thing, the document is about the Haitian Earthquake.  WHICH TOOK PLACE IN 2010!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    How did people miss this?   Hillary's emails are from her time as secretary of state which began in 2009.  And the her clintonemail.com account did not even exist in 2001.  Look at the document, it clearly is talking about January 2010........
                    <em>
                     The Urgent Need: The number of Haitian orphans is estimated to have increased by 300% as a result
                     <strong>
                      of the catastrophic earthquake this past week.
                     </strong>
                    </em>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    One reason that people missed this, is that Wikileaks has this wrong in their system and they have it wrong to this day. (The Millennial_Falcon summary evidence is also an absolute mess on Silsby.)  As the link you posted shows, Wikileaks identifies this as an email "emailid/3776"
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Look at the document.  How can you have an email with no sender and no recipient.  Even if you write a draft, the from is filled out.  And we know the date is completely wrong.  My guess is Jan 1, 2001 is a default
                   </p>

                    It was an attachment to an email and it was downloaded AFTER Silsby's group was arrested.   Again what I state is true

                    <p>
                     There's no evidence whatsoever that Hillary Clinton or anyone else in Washington DC, had any idea at all about who Laura Silsby and this group of Baptists from Idaho were before they got arrested in Haiti.

              Why would you think The Last American Vagabond is journalism at all?
             </p>
             <p>
              And I don't believe in this concept of widespread controlled opposition.  I think most of these conspiracy sites know they don't really have much to go on, so they take the kernel of truth, and elaborate and make stuff up and add fake nonsense until they have some clickbait fake news people will push without asking questions.   Inevitably, the sites make up different fake stuff, or they think some of the fake stuff is just nonsense.  So you wind up with George Webb vs Alex Jones vs the CIA flew the planes vs MOSSAD blew up the building vs there were no planes vs thermite was used vs controlled energy weapons were used, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's not controlled opposition, but competing stories, people get so wrapped up in their own stories and keep building and building on them, that soon enough there's divergent stories and when they look at somebody else story, it doesn't make sense to them or it challenges their version.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you start, like I do, of seeing most of these conspiracist folks as liars, you don't need concept of controlled opposition. The lies just get out of sync.  (For many of them these might merely be intellectual dishonesty (they lie to themselves first) they may sincerely believe in false nonsense, because mental health in a genuine issue in this space, but all humans are prone to this faulty thinking because of how our brains are wired.)

as my posts suggests elsewhere I have  been examining this site after a  run-in several weeks ago;
right on  about the plethora  of competing  stories  that  are designed  to confuse, obfuscate and wear  people  down until they  give  up on what is  true  vs lies

             So as these truths come to light, we’re challenged to look beyond judgement of them, process the anger, the ‘hate,’ the fear or worry that might come and instead get into a place where we can see the experience as something we simply do not want in our reality and more so, can understand how it has served us to grow. Again, this is not about allowing things like this to continue, but to instead end it and change it from a place of love and peace verses a place of anger, resentment and grief, which will only create more of it.

            If I were someone in authority who knew what was going to be coming out, this is exactly the kind of seed I'd be planting in people's minds to prevent millions of 2nd Amendment fans from coming after the corrupt and taking them down personally.
