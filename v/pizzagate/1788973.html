            "The Child Catcher is the supporting antagonist of the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and in the later stage musical adaptation.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The character did not appear in the original Ian Fleming book. The Child Catcher is employed by Baron Bomburst and Baroness Bomburst to snatch and imprison children on the streets of Vulgaria.

            </strong>
           </p>

            The musical was written by author Roald Dahl (actress Patricia Neal's husband prior to her stroke, after which he divorced her) and someone named "Hughes."  (Don't care and too lazy to look it up.)

            There was a thread about the red shoes yesterday too. 
I'd include Mary Poppins and Annie (red shoes or is that just Dorothy?) as part of my childhood programming (mk ultra?) too. Oh, and The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. Made me sob.

             When I read about the "pixie shoes", I thought the same thing. I think that post on the red shoes was important and up voted it, because stuff like that is like the pedo symbols and the email code words--their means of communication as well just throwing it our faces.
            </p>
            <p>
             I accidentally found the thing about the shoes when I was looking further into Savile, after noticing that he looked so much like the child catcher actor in that very creepy movie.
