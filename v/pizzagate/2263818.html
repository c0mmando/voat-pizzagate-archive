            Is there a sinister side to the rabbit. Like Buffy the vampire bunny? Because suddenly this person shows up in my town with a carved fanged rabbit as a masthead to his vehicle. Otherwise fits the hippie look. He wears a live pigeon on his head and is from Sausalito.  So anyway blatant symbolism...like the badge needs to be addressed asap down in S. Cali in every district this can be achieved very simply by organizing local town meeting. So call for town meeting s. Non violent town meeting s. In churches or community centers. Have a petition in every county where there are pedo symbols on the badge bring in person the petition to every local town meeting. It's an overwhelming must do. I will help if I can but...gotsta do this. Looking forward to meme making. I will take a photo next time of that carved rabbit scary as shit and maybe use that.

            The White Rabbit Project ...
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Rabbit_Project">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Rabbit_Project
            </a>
            White Rabbit is the name of a collaborative project including CERN, GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, and other partners from universities and industry to develop a fully deterministic Ethernet-based network for general purpose data transfer and sub-nanosecond accuracy time transfer. Its initial use was as a timing distribution network for control and data acquisition timing of the accelerator sites at CERN as well as in GSI's Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) project. The hardware designs as well as the source code are publicly available.[1] The name of the project is a reference to the White Rabbit appearing in Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

Seth Rich left 'Lou's City Bar' and headed towards the 'WONDERLAND BALLROOM BAR'. We know he never made it there.. Or did he? I checked into the Wonderland bar and found their logo is of a white rabbit. If you go to their Twitter page they have a pic of their 'matches'. READ WHAT IT SAYS UNDERNEATH! Follow the white rabbit!

            I feel the need to comment on this one, as I was literally just deeply considering doing an entire post specifically on THE VALUE and NEED for as you put, a "Team of Memesters". I cannot stress enough how valuable this bit would be.

            After just searching for 5-10 minutes for quality pro-Trump memes, it is literally almost impossible.... We have a SERIOUS opportunity to collaborate and together and create some serious eye-opening Meme's. A picture is worth a thousand words, and with a little direction the potential to lead the masses full circle back to reliable research with a single quality meme is great.

            I am sure it has been said before but first comes to my mind when I hear White Rabbit is the ritual abuse programming and the use of Alice in Wonderland. Yes, I know about Alex Podesta but i just feel it is simply exposing the ritual abuse programming. Many never even knew the term prior to PizzaGate

             I don't know enough about the specifics of MKUltra and other ritual abuse programming. If this is helping to expose those kinds of specifics, more power to it. Hoping it's helping to awaken/free those who have been programmed, and not overwhelmingly triggering for them.

             Mostly just looking to use the momentum started with the #FollowTheWhiteRabbit (and any other trending) hashtag to spread powerful memes that can help people get to the next level in waking up. I'm encouraging everyone here to think of themselves as meme creators that can start driving the narrative, rather than waiting for anyone else to sit in the drivers seat.

            Are we still on as Alex Podesta being the white rabbit or has new information come up that it's something or someone else? 
I've been doing some reading on him and taking notes,  will post something in a couple of days.  Hard to finish with my son in the room.

             I believe white rabbits might mean different things to all of us. But Alice woke up in a field with new insights about how this world is not what it seems, and can't be navigated in obvious ways. We find ourselves living in a Satanically inverted world -- nothing is what it seems -- and we're trying to wake ourselves up from a nightmare.

             The 'answer' isn't Hugh Hefner or Alex Podesta or any one person or organization. The 'answer' is more like following the white rabbit through the crazy world until we've found enough pieces to start waking up, or, as they say in the medical field,

             That's a question I've yet to find a satisfying answer to! Why does the badge have the exact symbol? And wasn't the person who created the badge a pedo according to research ? I don't remember if that was the case but I remember they found the person who designed that badge . This has been swept under the rug it seems .

              The badge with the Boy Lover symbol originated with Sheriff E. W. Biscailuz, who had a badge custom made for him with this symbol.

              "Around 1939, Sheriff Biscailuz developed the Sheriff's Boys Band. This group of juvenile musicians was organized and trained by Colonel Vesey Walker, an experienced and veteran conductor. Under the sponsorship of the Sheriff's Department they appeared in various cities, proudly representing the finest Sheriff's Deptpartment in the entire country"

             Yes to capitalizing on all available momentum. Although I believe insisting that they investigate LA/Hollywood child predators should be our focus. We can straighten up the badge thing when all the kids are safe. JMO.

              My angle was slightly different. Bringing attention to the badge first is easier than getting the police to do their job and investigate these crimes cos most of them are masons. Showing the world the connection the police have to covering up pedophile crimes will prove that the crimes are not being investigated properly which will then bring more attention and hopefully leading to an outcry and spreading knowledge of this corruption mainstream.

                It's mostly about expectations. If someone is protecting you from harm, then you're in no position to tell them how things should be done. Of course police/government can play other roles, for example entrenching the dependence of the citizenry in order to strengthen their own position.

                  I agree that it's broken. Protection in society can be applied in different ways, with different strings attached. It can be as straightforward as a storm warning or as subtle as statement like "You need to (((do something)))". Need implies that a threat of some kind exists, and has a subtext in which the speaker is dominant. Protection implies a relationship of dominance, and this relationship can be beneficial or predatory.

                   While I agree that relationships in general can be beneficial or predatory, I don't agree that protection implies dominance. Like so many other words, dominance has many connotations and meanings. I am protective of my kids -- but I don't forcibly dominate or insist on control.

                   It's been my lived experience that LE was much more benevolently protective in my youth, and that it has become ... or is in the process of becoming ... something quite different in recent years.

                    The dominance I'm speaking of relates to the cases in which the protection is effective. The effective protection of your kids involves threat assessment and taking action should you become aware of the existence of a real threat. You are dominant over your kids in that case because you are taking control of the situation to some degree if and when a threat arises. It doesn't mean that you dominate all areas of their lives, it's much more limited than that.

                    LE is directly related to the dominance paradigm because lawmakers are dominant over those who are bound by their law. Understanding the nature of the LE relationship involves knowing how law works at an ethical level and at a psychological level. Trust is a big part of this relationship, and trust is based on ethics rather than on power.

                     It's getting late for me to think deeply on complex topics :) but it's this quoted bit that I think we, as a society, need to re-evaluate. Public
                     <em>
                      servant
                     </em>
                     implies that law makers and enforcers are required to hold to the best and highest interest of those they serve. This has long not been the case, and it's been steadily worsening, while their capacity for physical and legal dominance grows all out of bounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Real trust can only grow
                     <em>

                     </em>
                     relationship, with known peoples. Ethics are a frail fall-back position once the relational terrain grows too large to handle interpersonally (i.e. beyond tribe).

                      The other side of this idea relates to how a servant should be paid by a group. The benefit obtained by by individual members will vary, as will the contribution made by each member. When the contribution isn't aligned with the benefit the arrangement is unfair, and in this situation if coercion is applied to obtain payment then the arrangement is unjust.

                      The standard approach to this problem is to institute the idea of sovereignty, where the sovereign has the right to make laws. This idea fails when then only real quality of the notional sovereign is independence. Historically sovereignty was an expression of virtue and power.

                       Agreed. I'd add that all coercion is counterproductive to a healthy society. The fundamentals of coercion, in their first gesture, wipe out true sovereignty. Power over others is introduced, then supported by increasingly vast legal frameworks -- all in the interest of that power accruing to an ever-diminishing few.

                       Every manner of weakening those the few would overpower is implemented and improved upon over generations: mal-education, mal-health care, disruption of the family, 'war' between the sexes, financial theft (through taxes and usury), fake political parties, increasing propagation of fear and outrage -- all done to isolate and weaken individuals intellectually, relationally, physically, materially.

                        enough
                       </em>
                       interpersonal interaction to establish personal knowledge of mutual strength and virtue -- only then can there be true trust.

                        In normal circumstances I'd agree that coercion is inconsistent with true sovereignty. Coercion has value as part of a strategy for survival, for example if parents were to force their children to get into a swimming pool when they knew that a forest file would burn their house down and they couldn't escape.

                        Blackstone (a renown 18th century jurist) described it as wisdom, goodness, and power. Power over others is meaningful when you face an adversary.

                         Everything we're doing right now as a 'society' is fiction built on meaningless words: democracy, republic, government, etc.

                        "In commerce, truth is sovereign" is a maxim of commercial law. Free market commerce respects truth as part of the process of making representations about the value of goods, services, and information. I agree that meaningless language is central to the problems faced by society today.

             First, thank you for your contribution of time, energy, and enthusiasm that you're clearly putting into this endeavor, I very much appreciate seeing positive and beneficial action taking place all around.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think that my passion lies in helping steer the message, above and beyond creating the product and delivering it, which is of course one of the most important tasks, and requires those on the front lines of the info-sphere, surely. I'm more a behind the scenes kinda guy.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will say that I have a short treatise on best practices and I'm looking for a forum to post it to. I will unload a bit of it here, for the sake of immediacy, and apologize if this might derail this thread. Please let me know and I will delete this post and find a better place for it. Thanks again for allowing me this platform to say this, regardless.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, again, sorry for the unabridged brain dump here. I didn't expect it to run so long, but it's still just one main thought, albeit with important clarifications, so I hope you choose to read through it, at your convenience, please. I will post the rest as a response to this comment and hope I can squeeze it out in less than 10,000 characters, as I've already apparently exceeded that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks again if you are taking the time to read the following. It's okay and understandable if not, as this is a lot to try and digest, in one sitting.

             <p>
              The punch line of my thought currently is this:
             </p>
             <p>
              The great work being done is now even more time-sensitive, especially in regard to preparing minds (friends and family first) to prepare themselves mentally and physically (for a short storm, if it comes to that, but a huge paradigm shift, inevitably).
             </p>
             <p>
              Without mental preparation, if and when communication with the outside world goes out temporarily, their minds and energy will quickly deteriorate from the trauma of their own panic and inability to understand what is taking place. 100% helplessness through fear of the unknown, they will become non-participants at best, and similar to a drowning victim unintentionally drowning his/her rescuers, at worst.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, a power outage (and/or martial law) may be necessary and not able to be avoided, the longer until then the better, as operations surely will be in a later clean-up stage as it progresses. But those conditions are forced upon the current operations (hand forced by the baddies), then it may take a little longer to apply the necessary contingencies to get back up and running. Again, again, martial law and a power-outage may be necessary as a part of the "good guy's" plan, and we cant and won't know that, but we can watch for it (to include watching for a run on resources, regardless of what appears to precipitate that).
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's the punchline of the punchline. I think there needs to be memes designed for the "messengers", as well as those for the un-awakened masses. This may be for a completely different "army" of memesters, so I am not trying to suggest that this is our responsibility here to accomplish, per se. I'd just like to put it on the table for you all, personally, but not as a specific call to action that you may or may not want to take on. I totally respect that, either way.
             </p>
             <p>
              And here's the message for the messengers to consider that can also be passed with or without the red-pilling them, as needed:
             </p>
             <p>
              "You can watching the news and start seeing the narrative that I'm asking you to believe me as true (that good guys are taking down bad guys. And, the good and bad guys, in regard to the current goings-on, aren't necessarily sided the way the media has you believing. Or, I  can show you how the sausage is made, especially if you are inclined, or need convincing. It's your choice. What is unfolding does not require both and one will lend to the other."
             </p>
             <p>
              Either way, the message and the purpose of the message is to prepare. Themselves first (take in the information, make a plan) and their loved ones (doing what you can to maintain status quo AND encourage actions to prepare for an emergency, as the narrative supports it).
             </p>
             <p>
              Whichever will get them moving forward to preparing themselves and their loved ones - which is to say, preparing a plan for an emergency (power outage and scarcity of resources) and acting on that
              <em>
               now
              </em>
              , is the message that they need to pass on.
             </p>
             <p>
              Something like: 
"Believe me (with the support of all of the things that has already gone down in the mainstream), when I explain that the mainstream narrative is the opposite of what you are seeing, and start looking for what I'm offering as real so you can be empowered to see it escalate yourself, and prepare accordingly, as the narrative plays out in the mainstream, as it already has started to. Or, let me show you how the sausage is made to convince you that this is what that info represents". You'll have to work your way backwards from the mainstream narrative, with minimal crimes-against-humanity, at first, to build a bridge, of course.
             </p>
             <p>
              For people choosing to stay in the mainstream, have them focus on the Mueller investigation to see if we can shift their paradigm of thinking through that unfolding. Direct C-Span viewing or implore them to entertain opposition media, threaten them that you will be forced to show them how the sausage is made, otherwise :)
             </p>
             <p>
              For me, I'm recommending to friends that they don't share (I'll try a different analogy here) what's behind the curtain with their family at this point, unless it will be clearly well-received. Again, I'm talking dear friends and family whose world view isn't prepared for this, that's on you to decide. I feel that most need to be offered a good version of misinformation (as the posters identified as Q is trying to show validation for) and do what it takes to prepare them for a temporary power outage, free from the fear. This should be a priority at this stage of the game, in my opinion. I will reiterate this later, but, to be sure, I'm not asking you to stop doing the work that you are doing currently. Without all of you here, the rest of the "messengers" will not have the depth of knowledge needed for campfire story-time. It may be that our role here
              <em>
               is
              </em>
              to continue to dive deeper to understand the narrative.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just realize the purpose has shifted with operations now in place, surely. Which is to say, we used to share it to wake people up so they can unite and take down the baddies as a grass-roots campaign. Now, the paradigm that we are operating within is, in my opinion, that we are sharing it to prepare their minds, the taking down of the baddies is already happening, and we can be the C3PO to their Ewoks and be the story tellers of the battles that the "rebellion" have been and are are currently conducting against the evil empire (but keeping it PG, as needed).
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, they (future messengers and family guardians)
              <em>
               must
              </em>
              pay attention to the mainstream news, so they can observe its escalation, as that's what will call them to action, with regard to preparing their minds and creating and implementing an emergency action plan (store rations, take out some cash, acquire a modest amount of the cheapest ammo that you can trust will go bang, etc).
             </p>
             <p>
              A good way to get them to act is to use all of the EMP/power-grid hacking shut down scenario, choose the reason or the boogyman that resonates with you, but it must immediately resonate with them, especially. Or if you are in a region that is being onslaught with natural disaster fear-porn, use it. It seems to be what it is there for, if we can see a silver lining in that. (California fires and earthquakes, Yellowstone erupting, hurricanes (albeit going out of season, you get the point). Especially, as the mainstream narratives that are unfolding include impending then potential for national emergencies (
              <em>
               real
              </em>
              government shutdown, etc,), use it! The media uses it as fear porn, we can use it to direct that energy towards preparing.
             </p>
             <p>
              If and when there is a loss of power, any one with even an inkling of awareness of how the sausage is made (terrible analogy, considering, I apologize, I should have acknowledged that earlier), but also how good actions are being taken to dismantle the factory, then, in the time of no communication with the outside world (to include us here, to say the least), they and we must all act to share that, campfire story-style, and immediately upon the power outage (in my opinion) and we have to be able to back that up, confidently, with offline content. Or a drawing board. But only as necessary. You get the idea.
             </p>
             <p>
              It will help de-escalate the fear and promote a little confidence that
              <em>
               their
              </em>
              job is to stay empowered and trust the unknown for now. And to listen to what you have to share with them. This is your true opportunity to wake them up, at that time. Regardless, It will greatly help keep the peace, in my opinion. If you have a greater understanding of the world, even outside of the crimes-against-humanity, you will have your platform to share that with them also, I really believe.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, as most of us here trust what is unfolding (if not, read up and understand the purpose of Q, if you haven't yet entertained it, I would at least ask), we should have confidence in our actions, and prepare for the equivalent of, say, a nice two-week family camping trip, stay-cation style, but roughing it, nevertheless. Extend that idea to a month if you can afford to.
             </p>
             <p>
              I trust that it is the immediacy of either power loss or martial law, or both, that we should make sure that our loved ones are prepared for, without having to cause a paradigm shift in them, to get them there. The shift will come on it's own, and our job is to help them process that change the best we can, but in due time. And remember, just like me, as awake as I thought I was, I'm having to take a bizarro world flip flop at what I choose to currently trust and believe in now.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, for me, everything's different: martial law is good, NSA and Military (intel or otherwise) are good, FEMA camps (where are 4000+ criminals be kept otherwise?), Blackwater (academi) and other merc are on the side of "good" (who's fighting the fight?). And I won't even get into the spiritual side of it. That doesn't make them our future saviors, just the players in the current fight that we are on the same side of, if we had to choose.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't ask that you or your friends and family must make the bizarro world flip, yourself. Matter of fact, we still have to trust that, after the storm, our infrastructure will remain intact especially with a balance of power (checks and balances), before we can feel that we can get back to a new normal, and we can't engage with until that time comes, I feel.

               Also, as a standard liability statement, please take in what resonates with you and discard what doesn't. I know that I'm speaking to a diverse crowd, even if we're aligned on some of the bigger moving parts. I am not trying to shift your world view or influence that, I am saying what I feel I need to, to promote the idea that there is a need to help others prepare, in mind, body, and spirit.

                 Now, for me, everything's different: martial law is good, NSA and Military (intel or otherwise) are good, FEMA camps (where are 4000+ criminals be kept otherwise?), Blackwater (academi) and other merc are on the side of "good" (who's fighting the fight?). And I won't even get into the spiritual side of it. That doesn't make them our future saviors, just the players in the current fight that we are on the same side of, if we had to choose.

                You might not be done flipping there, my friend. When we first start the flip, it's really disorienting, and so we want to grab onto some thing or someone that can help us stabilize. It's a very dangerous time for each person, because we're taught to stabilize on
                <em>
                 externals
                </em>
                . But ultimately, being fully awake is fully trusting your internal source. Getting to that trust is the challenge. The quickest way is to put the full faith and trust of your being in God. But don't worry, nobody on this planet takes the quickest path, I sure didn't -- lol.
               </p>
               <p>
                But you do want to trust your fundamental principles (sometimes you have to go find them, we misplace them all the time ;) as a first step. So, just because someone might be telling you that martial law, MIC, camps and Academi are now the goodies and/or necessary steps -- you're gonna want to run that by your own bullshit meter, your principles and what you generally know to be true.
               </p>
               <p>
                You are obviously very caring and conscientious. These are immensely valuable qualities, and you need to protect them by firing up your bullshit meter and trusting yourself -- then building a small pod of trustworthy people around you. O, and you'll want a really good strong 1st/2nd/4th amendment person in your pod ;)

                <p>
                 Thank you for the words of wisdom, I do value that you took the time to share it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To be sure, and to offer how I function, I have not been told by anyone what to accept as reality nor choose to believe things merely upon hearing or reading it. With that said, I will entertain almost anything, but then process it with rigor for the purpose of and with the goal of proceeding with sound discernment on the matter. All I have are my internal bullshit meters and intuition, based on my thoughts, experiences and base of working and validated knowledge that is continually updated and has guided me in my successes thus far.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't find value, generally speaking, in sharing second-hand opinions of others as my own, as the thought of it would be insulting to all parties involved. And, I am mindful of what are my thoughts and what are thoughts of others, that I have consumed. I offer opinions that are my own, as I am confident that I am ready to back them with sound premises or at least the preponderance of data points that my speculations derive from. And that's why I put it on the record. I do not shy from my assertions and am ready to account for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sorry for sounding harsh, as that is not my intention, I just want to be clear that I stand behind my words, and I do trust my fundamental principles to guide me. I do appreciate your desire to help others understand the best practices that have resonated with you, for your situation, from your world view and experiences, and I appreciate that you felt that you saw opportunity to help better me and acted on it. I can not and will not take offense to that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would ask that you be mindful if and when you are basing your premises from a judgement of others' acts and perceived motivators, as it may be purposeful to ask questions before offering unsolicited advice, in my experience, and as I'm sure you'd agree. And I don't take offense to what I feel I saw as that occurring either, as I find myself offering unsolicited advice daily, and would be hypocritical or a liar to pretend differently. I also can see that you mean well and are doing it out of compassion and care, yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                 All I am saying is that it may help to be mindful of all of that, for best results, and that I, for one, would appreciate that. I hope that my words are well-received, and that you trust that I do appreciate where you are coming from. I also hope that you allow me to participate as I am, and let my words and acts speak for themselves as I hope to participate with humility, Feel free to  ask my why I feel the way I do, or even push back on something that doesn't resonate with you, if you feel compelled to.
                </p>
                <p>
                 However, and I mean this with kindness, I am not here soliciting support, with regard to my personal growth and approach (unless it is to correct any offenses I may have inadvertently subjected others to). I have avenues for that are more familiar with my idiosyncrasies and sensibilities, if you will.

                    I was just thinking about our exchange, and how I fell into one of the language traps I try to stay conscious of: The illusion that we might know something about another person based on mere words on a limited topic. A great deal of our current difficulties seem to arise from people making snap assumptions (as I did) based on exceedingly limited information. As though by looking at a photograph of a person, one could discern the challenges and passions of their life. Again, thank you for your kindness and civility -- and my apologies for any distress I may have caused.

             And I appreciate your support, I could surely use it.
