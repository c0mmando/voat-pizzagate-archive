<p>It’s pretty easy to make the connection by reading a few reliable sources found in a Google search.</p>
<p>First look up Huma Abedin’s family here: <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=huma%20abedin%20family">https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=huma%20abedin%20family</a></p>
<p>You’ll see that the names of her mother and brother are Saleha Mahmood and Hassan Abedin.</p>
<p>Now check who is on the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs by going to their website here: <a href="http://www.imma.org.uk/editorialboard.htm">http://www.imma.org.uk/editorialboard.htm</a></p>
<p>You’ll see that Huma Abedin’s mother is the editor and her brother is an associate editor.</p>
<p>Now check the Contact Us section of the website here: <a href="http://www.imma.org.uk/contactus.htm">http://www.imma.org.uk/contactus.htm</a></p>
<p>You’ll see an address:</p>
<p>46 Goodge Street, London W1T 4LU, U.K.</p>
<p>Now go to a different website for the Muslim World League here: <a href="http://www.mwllo.org.uk/contact/">http://www.mwllo.org.uk/contact/</a></p>
<p>Scroll down on the Contact Us page and check the address:</p>
<p>46 Goodge Street, London, W1T 4LU, United Kingdom</p>
<p>The address for the Muslim World League matches the one on the Muslim Minority Affairs. (These aren\'t just separate suites in the same building either. They are literally the exact same address, word for word.)</p>
<p>Now check who served as Secretary-General of the Muslim World League by going here: <a href="http://www.globalmbwatch.com/abdullah-omar-naseef/">http://www.globalmbwatch.com/abdullah-omar-naseef/</a></p>
<p>You’ll see that it’s a man named Abdullah Omar Naseef.</p>
<p>Now check who Abdullah Omar Naseef is by going here: <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=abdullah_omar_naseef_1">http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=abdullah_omar_naseef_1</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll see that he founded something called the Rabita Trust, which is a organization fronting as a charity, confirmed by the U.S. State Department to actually be funding terrorism.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin’s family\'s business is therefore funded by a man who is also funding a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>BONUS:</p>
<p>There are actually THREE businesses that share the address at 46 Goodge Street. The third is a pizza place named Icco.</p>
<p>You can go to their website here: <a href="http://icco.co.uk/contact-us/">http://icco.co.uk/contact-us/</a></p>
<p>Look on the left side and you\'ll see:</p>
<p>ICCO PIZZA
46 Goodge Street
London
W1T 4LU
020 7580 9688</p>
<p>Let\'s not forget that Huma Abedin was one of the recipients of the &quot;Pizza.jpg&quot; email found here: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037</a></p>
<p>As a reminder for those who haven\'t seen this, the subject is &quot;Pizza.jpg&quot;, the email says &quot;As John said, it doesn\'t get any better than this&quot; and there is an attachment. If you open the attachment, you\'ll see two Asian women eating pizza, one of them sharing the same slice with a little girl. The two women in the photo are Laura Ling and Euna Lee who were arrested in North Korea while reporting on sex trafficking, rescued quickly by Bill Clinton. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_imprisonment_of_American_journalists_by_North_Korea">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_imprisonment_of_American_journalists_by_North_Korea</a></p>
<p>As far as I know, this is the only email in all of Wikileaks that clearly links the term &quot;pizza&quot; with both &quot;children&quot; and &quot;sex trafficking&quot;, all in one photo.</p>
<p>The response to the photo of two women sharing a slice of pizza with a little girl is &quot;Nice.&quot;</p>

            - a pasta and pizza place - if you look at that image, you'll notice that the words 'pasta' and 'pizza' have been blurred, especially 'pizza' - i just found that to be a bit odd and i wonder who's doing the blurring - was is it at the request of zizzi, or is google blurring these words on their own?

            i also found the placement of some vans in that area to be almost strategic in nature - as though they might have been parked there to intentionally block certain views, but my confidence in that assessment is extremely low - just thought i'd mention it

           <p>
            Listen from 4:20
Worth watching the whole interview, it's really damning. This was, I think, the last interview that Assange gave before going missing.

             The problem isn't the photo that seems like a completely innocent photo. The problem is the innuendo from the author of the email, and the fact the author said this innuendo came from John Podesta, and seems to think that it was such a good cheesy private joke that it was worth making an email about it with multiple people in copy. This makes no sense unless there is some sort of implicit semantic connection between pizza and something else that the photo appears to be showing or representing symbolically. Now if you apply the FBI code for pedophilia and interpret the photo from this perspective, the innuendo suddenly makes a lot of sense, and is pretty damning.

              No.  That is completely confirmation bias.  I read zero innuendo in the email.

              What is better that people who were imprisoned in North Korea to be back in America, free, and enjoying a good meal with their family.  Can you imagine a better feeling?

            I think she's good. Her and her sister Lisa Ling are really close. Lisa Ling had her own show Our America and would travel and cover things from other countries and lifestyles. She's good. I think her sister Laura, does the same thing.

             Hasn't Lisa Ling done some shows about sex trafficking also.  I think she did an episode about it on her CNN show and possibly other times.  Lisa Ling is awesome in my book.

            2026717233 cps in DC, call asap, need meme, demand taped, restrained child found, welfare check, patents found, other kids HE took pics HE posted on public web. If false, then simple, where are the kids, parents, full psych, medical well-being. Call cps in ny, Huma endanger child repeat as Weiner  sext text and jack off, video proof. Media and others fail mandate report a taped child or Weiners kid. Epstein is connected fact, as is that weird video with red ski mask. Harrasing concerned witnesses of these abuse photos is a felony. Look at cps cases that bombard good fans, but ignore a taped child and humans toddler!! Use child development, psych, mixed msgs, dissociate, unsafe boundary development, mixed msgs creates crime victims not know safe boundaries or can split mind to schizo. Got to call cps as the kid pica ARE the EVIDENCE, as are kids walked out comet today, told to run, got in a uber. If story false then DIH, each posted kid HAS to be found by cps and welfare checked fully. That's the law..use it!! Every call might save a life, finally!! Also, any hired with schools and camps that do that creepy stuff, is illegal to hire and endanger students, mislead they are reputable. Federal grants and FAFSA also have strict hiring policies. So call FAFSA, school grants, schools, colleges. We have strategy to use. This is standard tools to.use in child abuse. Thx.

              Well, if you care about the children, read it again and call cps. Let me break it down, cps is CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. 20126727233 DONT know a word or phrase, look it up. MANDATED CHILD ABUSE REPORTING LAWS. CHILD PSYCHOLOGU - healthy boundaries vs taping/ restrain a child, mixed msgs. You care about the ENDANGERED children in the pics, such as one taped, or being a cock?

             As a reminder for those who haven't seen this, the subject is "Pizza.jpg", the email says "As John said, it doesn't get any better than this" and there is an attachment. If you open the attachment, you'll see two Asian women eating pizza, one of them sharing the same slice with a little girl. The two women in the photo are Laura Ling and Euna Lee who were arrested in North Korea while reporting on sex trafficking, rescued quickly by Bill Clinton.

             Oh but it does; the picture is of people investigating trafficking, with a child, eating pizza, and came to light because it was transmitted as email attachment to John Podesta, whose brother collects art by and about exploited children, and who is connected to cpp, the family friendly pizza joint formerly with cannibalism themed paintings in the walls, owned by alefantis, the same delightful character who by virtue of his restaurants (!?) and directorship of a few minor art galleries, is "powerful" and "connected" to Washington's "elite" (Joined at the dirty underbelly at least).

            I think there is nothing suspicious about two American caught by North Korea. Trafficking operations in North Korea is very dangerous and cost inefficient,  it will be much easy just lure these North Koreans already flee into China.

             The two Americans were working on a story of North Korean defectors fleeing into China. An aspect of that larger story is that women who defect are particularly vulnerable and are often picked up by Chinese traffickers, because if they go to the authorities they will be sent back to North Korea and to prison.

            I used to work around that area in London the pizza place looks pretty innocent to me just seems to have picked an unfortunate location... I wouldn't believe a connection unless there was a link with the ownership. So far this posts link to pizza is speculation.

             Forget the pizza place. The fact that Abdullah Omar Nassef, the founder of Rabita Trust, (which is an organization fronting as a charity, confirmed by the U.S. State Department to actually be funding terrorism) was secretary of the Muslim World League of which Huma's brother, Hassan Abedin and her mother Saleha Mahmood were editor assistant and editor in chief, just shows how both of them or interconnected. And let's not forget the most compelling piece of evidence of them all: the fact that both companies share the same exact address. In other words, they are intertwined, one and the same, only they share different names.

              Not in London many buildings have buisness on the ground floor that are unrelated to the ones above. I used to work under vogue offices for example and it was a sushi place totally unrelated. The rest of the post is accurate though huma's family is linked to that organisation it has been previously established n u can find YouTube vids on it. ... I'm not saying it isn't possible but so far I don't see the evidence as strong enough to say that pizza place is corrupt.

               Agreed.....that part of London has massive old buildings that will often have a shop at the bottom and several floors above that may contain different businesses
              </p>
              <p>
               That said, Fitzrovia is a very strange place....kind of a separate village right in the middle of London, with a very "bohemian" vibe

               why yes, having the same address doesn't ness. mean fuck all.  and your claim that they're "in the same suite" is entirely unsubstantiated as both their contact infos don't say anything about suites that i see.  please provide some proof that claim.

                  Lmao "shivers" makes me remember why we are doing all this because despite all the technology they have and the info the gather they still can't use it in a court of law so they need to gather info the old school way... Enter citizen investigators. Also feeling a bit hand tide as still haven't reached 100 comments so I can down vote the shills. We should be moving much faster!

            I'm telling y'all, those little pizza slice symbols and hotdog symbols are all the same weird looking symbols on all the shady pizza joints.  This one has it in the title ICCO.  Dr Pong had the nasty drippy hotdogs on their London menu.  We've seen the drippy bests pizza slice too and there's one on goat hill and pizza underground too

              My wife and her side of the family are the only ones who don't think I'm in over my head in conspiracy theories. The rest of my family and friends refuse to investigate it at all. Pushing as much as I can on Facebook though, I'm done giving a shit if people think I'm crazy. For the sake of truth and justice, I'm willing to lose the trust of as many friends and family as is necessary. Not sure why I decided to post this, maybe just feeling alone in all this with no real-life friends on my side.
             </p>

              edit: Thanks for the support, you guys are awesome. My only true friends as far as I'm concerned.

               Dead on. My wife is upset at how it has consumed me, and I understand that she feels that way. On the other hand, I've pointed out to her that what the government does in general, has never been a concern of hers, but that's not how I feel. We've grown up our entire lives being told that there are rules to follow, laws to abide by, people that we can trust, then, to have it all ripped away from you brings on a feeling of emptiness. It's incredibly depressing. The feeling of being alone from a government standpoint and then to be told by friends and family that you're spending too much time on this is just hard to handle. It makes me want to just scream and break down in tears out of frustration.

               Yeah, seriously, don't give up. I started posting about these pedos before the news even broke about it. One of my friends commented on a post of mine and said, "Wow, conspiracy game is going strong today", and my sis texted me one day after seeing my posts and said, "Umm... with all those posts, you are starting to come off as crazy...". I told her I didn't care if people thought I was crazy or if I lost friends over this. It is real and it has been going on too long because no one wants to talk about it, and its not fucking right. So oh well. I've lost friends, but I have gained a lot through all this also. I really don't care.

               I have stopped talking to friends and family about it because of the push back. But I still manage to bring it up occasionally. The fake news narrative has worked well unfortunately. However truth is like water, it can't be held back forever.

               Everyone here for the most part is the same. It's hard to come to this conclusion without doing countless hours of research, and then it's still hard. Also, most people don't have the time, or dedication, or critical thought process to allow this train of though to happen to begin with. It's a blessing and a curse. Stay strong, stay safe, you are not alone.

               That's how I feel. It sucks when you can't share news when something is discovered because your loved ones are not open to hearing it or not interested

              I haven't talked to my 4 best friends about it because 3 of them just had babies so I didn't want to bring it up while going to see the babies.  The 4th one has been out of town for work.  I did "lecture" them in a group text after Trump won because they group texted how will we go on blah blah blah.  They know I'm conservative so they said we hope this doesn't make you mad.  So I lit into them about how ridiculous and irresponsible the left was acting after he won.

              I have chatted with local people on a local political blog - most of them are conservative and I'd say that 60 percent believe it but that only 20 percent are bound and determined to do something about it.  The majority have the attitude "child rape by the elites has been going on for centuries"

               well if child rape has been going on for centuries, we have the internet now so they cant hide it, and we're going to put a stop to it.
Now that's what I call a 'progressive agenda'

               Freud backtracked on his original theories when it would result in accusing many prominent men of incest:

                My parents knew about the body count - my mom listened to rush Limbaugh on the kitchen radio while Clinton was in office.  It drove me nuts growing up.

               <p>
                I can never eat a homemade tuna salad sandwich without heating rush's voice bellowing in my head. Lol.   His show came on around lunch time, and in the summer we'd eat tuna salad to keep our calories low.
