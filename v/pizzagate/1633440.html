<p>We\'re all concerned about Pete\'s Zagayt, and all signs point to progress.  
</p>
<p>Based on his Tweets, we know <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/255294883680632833?lang=en">how Trump feels about child molesters and the like</a>. </p>
<p>We also know <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/266276897305026560?lang=en">he\'s in the know on the Weiner case</a>. </p>
<p>We know Steve Bannon was basically in charge of Breitbart after Andrew passed, and since <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbreitbart/status/33636278100561920?lang=en">Breitbart clearly knew about PeaszahGait</a>, we can assume Bannon does and chats with the president about it.  
</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/09/presidential-executive-order-enforcing-federal-law-respect-transnational">an executive order was passed</a> to eliminate human, drug, arms, and wildlife cartels and to prosecute all those involved and profiting off of them to the full extent of the law.  
</p>
<p>So it seems coming indictments are likely.  FBIAnon suggests high profile arrests are incoming, as does journalist David Seaman, and our beloved crazy person, Alex Jones.  
</p>
<p>Alex also says that behind closed doors, the outer rings of the larger abduction and sex trafficking rings are being shut down, and that some of this has been released to the media.  
</p>
<p>I\'ll start with the [51 arrested </p>

            My favorite comment from the shill:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Of the 474 arrested, 200 were John's."
           </p>
           <p>
            OK, great, who/what were the other 274? lol.

            I hope I don't regret asking this. But why are there always more people arrested than saved? During the super bowl, 92 people were being handled by 750?

            Hi,  this is confirmation bias.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of these operations run every year.  You just weren't paying attention last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            474 arrested and 55 saved--28 of which are children--in a Los Angeles sex ring bust. 
The California bust is the third or fourth year they have run Operation Reclaim and Rebuild which is timed to the end of Human Trafficking month, something that was declared in like 2013.  And it wasn't a sex ring, it was many, many different groups arrested.  Almost 200 of the arrestees were Johns.
           </p>
           <p>
            750 arrested and 92 rescued in Super Bowl Sunday interstate rescue. This one factors in Illinois and Texas, so it's another net 464 arrested on top of those. February 5th, 2017.
That factors in many of those other busts too.  Well over a dozen states take part in this operation that has been going on for over a decade.  This year's operation was the 13th and it started before Trump was president.
           </p>
           <p>
            2017 marked the 13th year of operation for the National Johns Suppression Initiative (NJSI) instituting a national sting which ran from Jan. 18 to Feb. 5
            <a href="http://cw39.com/2017/02/08/more-names-released-in-super-bowl-prostitution-bust-totaling-178-arrests/">
             http://cw39.com/2017/02/08/more-names-released-in-super-bowl-prostitution-bust-totaling-178-arrests/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The nationwide sweep produced the most arrests since operations began 13 years ago
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see this press release to see how many states were involved in a previous operation from August 2016.

             it is not confirmation bias if the OP simply says "this many have been arrested since Trump took office".   They are not saying anything but the fact of the number arrested after a certain date.

              He's a shill, dear.  Constant negativity and demoralization.  Pitching media matters rebuttals all day.

              I thought troll for a minute, but he's basically an antipg bot.  The new thing is weird hypocritical logical jargon.  It's really strange.  Straw man, confirmation bias, scotsman fallacy.  In a few days it will be tragedy of the commons and Plato's cave.  It's an odd strategy.  Like they actively hired logic autists to write the scripts.
