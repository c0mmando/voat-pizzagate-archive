            Note that this is an Aug 2015 article, which I don't care because I was just digging into info about Sen. Bob Menendez, Dr. Salomon Melgen, Casa de Campo, Terry Macauliffe...(I could go on up the chain but I'm in the thick of it :)  Can't believe the timing of you posting this.

            Let's see if the can make it stick this time. In the scheme of things, knowing what we do about the children, this seems not as important but I am sick of this on both sides of the aisle, mainly because this one involves minors.

             The connections are there in the business dealings that Menendez helped Melgen with and with the activity as a 'power broker' that Melgen served for Menendez.  This along with the Dominican Republic ties...Casa de Campo topic... a lot of connections to be made, some eventually lead to Chinese money, CGI, Clinton...ongoing case of Ng Lap Seng...
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't have the links handy as it's late, but can put them in later.  I just pasted some info onto a ongoing timeline (new however to add these characters to it)...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              1993 Robert ["Bob"] Menendez had recently been sworn in as New Jersey's first Hispanic congressman and was running for re-election when he met eye doctor Salomon Melgen at a Florida Fundraiser
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, their relationship is the subject of a federal corruption case. Menendez and Melgen, both 61, were indicted Wednesday on conspiracy, bribery, and fraud charges. Prosecutors allege that Menendez used his political influence to help Melgen's business dealings after accepting lavish gifts and large campaign donations from the doctor.
             </p>
             <p>
              One business dealing Menendez assisted Melgen with involved port security for the Dominican Republic.
             </p>
             <p>
              1998 – Dr. Salomon Melgen makes a seed venture investment in Seisint, a Boca Raton Florida database company founded by admitted Caribbean cocaine smuggler Hank Asher, who claims to have voluntarily left the business to “go straight” and become a legitimate entrepreneur. Melgen’s lawyer will later claim that the profits off this investment formed the basis of his substantial wealth.
             </p>
             <p>
              2010, Dr. Melgen moved to buy the ownership interest in ICSSI, a company based in the Caribbean that had been awarded a contract to provide extensive screening of cargo from ports in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican government was refusing to honor that contract, after Miguel Cocco, then the Dominican customs director, had long said the deal was an exorbitant giveaway to the company.
             </p>
             <p>
              2011 Two years ago [in 2011], Dr. Melgen, despite an apparent lack of experience in border security issues, bought an ownership interest in a company that had a long-dormant contract with the Dominican Republic to provide port security. Mr. Menendez, who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that holds sway over the Dominican Republic, subsequently urged officials in the State and Commerce Departments to intervene so the contract would be enforced, at an estimated value of $500 million.
             </p>
             <p>
              2011  Dr. Melgen founded a Latino-oriented news Web site, Voxxi, which has also emphasized the need for the port security deal and glowingly depicted Mr. Menendez as a giant among Latinos.
             </p>
             <p>
              2013  team of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Dr. Melgen’s offices in West Palm Beach, removing 30 boxes of documents and other material, and the senator now finds himself defending his relationship with a major political benefactor just as he is on the verge of reaching the most prestigious post of his career — the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

             The donations by Wang, 61, were made through his U.S. companies, according to CNN. He owns the China Rilin Construction Group, which holds a majority stake in the Dadong Port Group, a Chinese port near North Korea, according to Forbes magazine.

              Recall how that both recently WWP and ANSWER (both Soros funded and seen protesting in Charlottesville) are both supporters of North Korea.  There's some crazy stuff happening that links Global child trafficking, the attempts to push for overthrowing our government or at a minimum, spark violence from the fomenting hysteria going on (conveniently masks ALL the ongoing investigations), if Deep State gets it way, a war will break out, or a terrorist attack to blame on trump supporters...
             </p>
             <p>
              Recall (for whoever may know of it) Operation PATCON...led to Ruby Ridge, WACO...contributed at a minimum, the motive behind OK City Bombing, the entire process which definitely took people's minds off the Franklin Sex scandal!  Robert Mueller worked for Dick Thornburg in 1989.
             </p>
             <p>

              Interesting side note about Thornburgh...
Robert Mueller worked for him 1989
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               After serving as a partner at the Boston law firm of Hill and Barlow, Mueller returned to government service. In 1989, he served in the United States Department of Justice as an assistant to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
