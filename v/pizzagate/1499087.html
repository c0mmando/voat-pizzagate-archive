            Well, this is just the tip of the iceberg but I wanted to show you that Aleister Crowley, a known occultist, has literally written VOLUMES on the Kaballah and its importance to the various "mystery religions" of the world.

            Now, I can't link that directly to Pizzagate without giving you a metric ton of historical info, which is not suited for this thread, but it is coming.

            Nambla is owned by the Boy's Town Guy's who just happen to be 100% Hebrew.
           </p>
           <p>
            Study the recent deleted subs, that mention boy's town and warren-buffet and how that group created NAMBLA to normalize pedophilia, why do you think billionaires live to be 100? Its because they consume children's blood

            I'm a very modern Jew who has no appreciation for the ultra orthodox or the Talmud or whatever but this shit is so fucking obviously made to drag down real leads it's sad. And we know for a fact we're getting flooded with bots and CTR shills to make us out to be fringe nuts. And it's bullshit like this that forces the mods to waste their time, floods this sub and buries new leads, and turns off new members. As someone that loves offensive jokes about my own heritage and doesn't get offended by antisemitism, FUCK YOU for this concerted effort to distract us from outing goddamn pedophiles.

            It's not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It's not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It's no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I'm making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.

            The Finders Cult

           <p>
            Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here's some information I've compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.

            I've identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who's behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the first Satanic band called Coven.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            They're also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.

            Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.

           <p>
            Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."

            So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
           </p>
           <p>
            " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."

           </p>
           <p>
            Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.

            Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.

           </p>
           <p>
            She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.

            Let's take a look at their lyrics now. What they're describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don't forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.

            Judaism is Satanism. It's not a coincidence that all the primary elites busted in paedophile rings are Jews. Epstein has a sacrificial alter on his private paedophile Island.

            <p>
             The Kabbalah red string protects them from the "evil eye"...so it protects them from themselves and their evilness?
            </p>
            <p>
             Thats why they were interested in Madeleine Mccann because of her "evil eye" deformity and why Alefantis was pimping the young children with the same eye anomaly.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wearing the bracelet might remind them "not to stare at children or eye them"...like Joe Biden does all the time so as to be found out to be a predator or look at them like they are gonna eat them.

             It's not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It's not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It's no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I'm making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.
            </p>

             Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.

             Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here's some information I've compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.

             I've identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who's behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's the first Satanic band called Coven.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">

            </p>
            <p>
             They're also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.

             Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.

             Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."

             So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
            </p>
            <p>
             " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."

            </p>
            <p>
             Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.

             Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.

             Let's take a look at their lyrics now. What they're describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don't forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.

             I suppose that's why Occultists like Crowley, Blavatski, Manly P Hall and Elphias Levi reference kaballah heavily in their works then? Forget about the jews for a minute and look at the Kaballah on its own merits (which is a separate thing from judaism entirely). It absolutely CAN be proven that Kaballah and Satanism are related...in a similar way that Christianity and Satanism are related.

               So, if I take the time to write out a well sourced and referenced expose proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that Satanism and Pizzagate are in fact related. Would that change your mind or would you simply delete it without giving it an iota of thought..because...rules.
