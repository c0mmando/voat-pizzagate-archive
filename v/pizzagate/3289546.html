<p>How much of what you see here has been shaped by him?  Does <em>any</em> legitimate user really agree with him, or does he just groom new users into being his cheerleaders when he and his alts do their dirty work?

It\'s usually either that, or thinking all the mods are awful except one.  Never really seems to commit one way or the other.  Always has to pretend to be on the side of one of the mods, like this <a href="https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/2773684/14339426?=2">cringey</a> shit where he tries to brown-nose kevdude.</p>

No, ES did NOT respond to that on the correct username at all, even after the fact.

<p>This is why you have a MASSIVE asshole as an [O] mod.  THIS is why I\'m not nice to you.  THIS is why I don\'t do daily mod duties here.  THIS is why your mods want me where I am.  THIS is the avalanche I created just by picking a fight with your loudest blowhard member that almost none of you called out.  THIS IS WHAT I DO.  And to all of you that <em>even look at my goddamned mods sideways without a VERY good reason</em>:</p>

<h1 id="md-edit">EDIT</h1>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/twistedmac11">@twistedmac11</a> got flustered and lied about never supporting anyone trying to destroy the subverse, prompting <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2608242/13143338?=20#13142050">dig this one up</a>.</p>
<h1 id="md-edit-2">EDIT 2</h1>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> made the comment below about ESOTERIC\'s bullshit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/TE9Hz">Here</a>, <a href="https://voat.co/u/EsotericShade">@EsotericShade</a> claims he\'s so ignorant of technology (a &quot;retard&quot;) he had to make all these alts because passwords are too hard to remember.</p>
<p>But eight months ago, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11925786">here he is having a conversation about how to use VPNs to game the voting system</a>. Doesn\'t sound too tech ignorant here, now does he? </p>
<p>Incidentally, that thread shows him using multiple alts to try to take over a rule discussion, voting multiple times via different accounts and even bitching when Crensch missed votes that weren\'t made as top level comments that would be seen in his notifications. Lots of brigading, too. Here are <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11926463">three of them talking to each other</a>, pushing the idea the mod team is run by intelligence operatives. </p>
<p>There are multiple comments by him in that thread as ES, rarepeeks, twistedmac11, dragonkiller and others concern trolling the idea that the rule discussion is some kind of trap created by Crensch to get people\'s names on a hit list -- he simultaneously votes multiple times and tries to scare other people away from letting their voice be heard. It\'s rather appalling how glaring it is in this thread, actually.</p>

            claims he's so ignorant of technology (a "retard") he had to make all these alts because passwords are too hard to remember.
           </p>
           <p>
            But eight months ago,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11925786">
             here he is having a conversation about how to use VPNs to game the voting system
            </a>
            . Doesn't sound too tech ignorant here, now does he?
           </p>
           <p>
            Incidentally, that thread shows him using multiple alts to try to take over a rule discussion, voting multiple times via different accounts and even bitching when Crensch missed votes that weren't made as top level comments that would be seen in his notifications. Lots of brigading, too. Here are
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11926463">
             three of them talking to each other
            </a>
            , pushing the idea the mod team is run by intelligence operatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are multiple comments by him in that thread as ES, rarepeeks, twistedmac11, dragonkiller and others concern trolling the idea that the rule discussion is some kind of trap created by Crensch to get people's names on a hit list -- he simultaneously votes multiple times and tries to scare other people away from letting their voice be heard. It's rather appalling how glaring it is in this thread, actually.

            It seems clear to me that there is a movement by a small group of people to target those who participate a lot in these topics, but do not believe in Q. I like the Q movement, I just know that Pamphlet Anon is on video showing that he was using Q's tripcode.
           </p>
           <p>
            For that reason, I consider Q people as a good source of researchers, but they are being led to "prove" things outside of the scope of the standard rules of evidence.

            Getting people emotional produces results but it also compromises rational thought. The Pizzagate movement needs rational thinkers who are willing to report leads to law enforcement in enough volume to force them to take a look.

             Ding! Ding! Ding! I think that video has been around at least a year maybe. I showed it to the Voat Q Headquarters Management in many threads and talked about it a lot. All I got was
             <em>
              crickets
             </em>
             ... They know that the Qanon phenom is a bunch of fake bullshit. That leads me to believe they are either

             And lets not forget srayzie's merch sites. srayzieq.me and srayzieq.us
srayzieq.me finally went down not too long ago and I don't think I ever took a screen shot of it. But, here is here new site srayzieq.us

             Either way they are grifters without a care for accurate information. I am proud to have raised the alarm bell about this lot of grifters and disinfo peddlers. I am also glad zyklon b took careful aim, and knocked some of them out of the game, at least for a while....I am sure they are not really gone.

               I see you got your own flair. Consider it a badge of honor. He flairs people he can't "destroy" in a conversation because his behavior is so damn horrible he ain't got a leg to stand on. I've never seen him "destroy" anybody anyway, in spite of his many bold claims.

              He works for upvotes.club and that is the entity that paid srayzie for GA. She miraculously paid off debts that had been sitting for years, while she, herself, sat on her ass for years and continues to do so. Nothing terrifies these people more than the idea of GA or PG becoming a system sub and, of course, they hate doxx, because it might expose who they really are and who they really work for.

              Since this thread is clearly a dishonest presentation to give everyone the illusion that crensch is actually capable of finding a shill, it is a fairly clear telegraph that crensch is, himself, a shill.

            Pizzagate Whatever 2019 (july 4)
           </p>
           <p>
            A soul has qualities of life-after-death, 
consciousness, comprehension and compassion; having memory is optional.
           </p>
           <p>
            Child-Trafficking and Deepstate have become mainstream-news
issues. Abusers are being publicly convicted in real courts.
The public should be aware of what the root problem is:
  SRA (abuse by a culture of abused, typically involving organized
  cover-up).
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the real grand info war: over the issue of SRA: wether you 
are for or against human-abuse and cover-up. One could even lump the people who don't care about 
abuse in with the perps. And, the people who are ignorant of SRA are lumped in with 
the people who want SRA exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            SRA is an acronym for Satanic Ritual Abuse. SRA has the typical characteristics of organized, horriffic, sexual, covered-up, family-child-abuse, intimidating 
and often hard to talk about.  The crimes of the deepstate, including
child-trafficking and the assignation of JFK, are a direct result of SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hampstead UK cover-up case involves SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The torture based mind control treatments including MKULTRA, and study, are
a direct result of SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            See SRA Survivor Testimony for more
info: The following are some SRA Survivors:
           </p>
           <p>
            Laura Eisenhower, 
Jay Parker,
Vicky Ash,
Michael Whalen, 
Holly Austin Smith, 
Marilyn Van Derbur, 
Richard Kerr, 
Becki Percy, 
Katy Groves, 
Peaceful Warrior, 
Cathy O'Brien
           </p>
           <p>
            SRA is a disease, and demands abuse, like alcoholism demands alcohol.
We, the People, demand SRA to be exposed and 
unsuccessful at fear and intimidation. No longer does it look scarey;
SRA looks foolish and illegal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Governments of the world are reforming as 
problems are exposed and confronted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trust in instutitutions, including the President of The USA,
will be determed by wether they have the ability to 
openly acknownledge SRA and MKULTRA as serious current real life problems, 
that are the roots of the child-trafficking problems and the 
popular-media/information-corruption problems. 
(ie: do they appear to be covering-up? 
like focusing attention on other lesser problems and never addressing SRA?)
           </p>
           <p>
            The roots of SRA, while theories are known, 
are not important as the cover-up of SRA: which identifies an agent or agency as
being complicit in SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next to be addressed:
- corrupt cops
- corrupt courts
- 'SRA-gang'-related harrassment,
descrimination, or 'individual targeting'
-SRA-related 'population-control'/ 'mass-mind-control' schemes 
- CPS corruption
- soros-division
- 'new world order' / 'world enslavement' schemes
- slave camps
- deepstate
- human/sex
- mkultra-torture
- child-sacrifice
           </p>
           <p>
            SRA is illegal.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you need to report SRA to the public, please protect your personnal info as best as you can. I don't want to bait people into doxing themselves. I just want to encourage an SRA-aware enviroment. Use your best judgement and self-leadership.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example: Buy a device 'from the street' or, at least, with cash; tape-over the camera(s); use a fake-name, use a pre-paid phone service or public wifi; use encryption and vpns; never input your personnal info.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until further notice, I do not recommend reporting SRA to any official authority, cop, or court: because the corruption % is still ??%.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you need help finding a missing child: I recommend you hire a professional remote viewer(s) and report finding(s) to the public.

             Once This worlds  institutions of power i.e Presidents,Government officials, Military Brass, and Law Enforcement plus medical and science industries are all free of the cults influence then we'll see change.
            </p>
            <p>
             o wait that's what the Q movement is promising?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well as OP stated if these people in power positions do not explain the Cults history, world influence and the many crimes they have commited based off their ancient SECRET cults teachings then there will be no true FULL DISCLOSURE and the CULT will just find a new way to decieve.....enter Q.

            A soul has qualities of life-after-death, 
consciousness, comprehension and compassion; having memory is optional.
           </p>
           <p>
            Child-Trafficking and Deepstate have become mainstream-news
issues. Abusers are being publicly convicted in real courts.
The public should be aware of what the root problem is:
  SRA (abuse by a culture of abused, typically involving organized
  cover-up).
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the real grand info war: over the issue of SRA: wether you 
are for or against human-abuse and cover-up. One could even lump the people who don't care about 
abuse in with the perps. And, the people who are ignorant of SRA are lumped in with 
the people who want SRA exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            SRA is an acronym for Satanic Ritual Abuse. SRA has the typical characteristics of organized, horriffic, sexual, covered-up, family-child-abuse, intimidating 
and often hard to talk about.  The crimes of the deepstate, including
child-trafficking and the assignation of JFK, are a direct result of SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hampstead UK cover-up case involves SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The torture based mind control treatments including MKULTRA, and study, are
a direct result of SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            See SRA Survivor Testimony for more
info: The following are some SRA survivors:

Vicky Ash,
Michael Whalen,

Cathy O'Brien
           </p>
           <p>
            SRA is a disease, and demands abuse, like alcoholics demand alcohol.
We, the People, demand SRA to be exposed and 
unsuccessful at fear and intimidation. No longer does it look scarey;
SRA looks foolish and illegal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Governments of the world are reforming as 
problems are exposed and confronted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trust in instutitutions, including the President of The USA,
will be determed by wether they have the ability to 
openly acknownledge SRA and MKULTRA as serious current real life problems, 
that are the roots of the child-trafficking problems and the 
popular-media/information-corruption problems. 
(ie: do they appear to be covering-up? 
like focusing attention on other lesser problems and never addressing SRA?)
           </p>
           <p>
            The roots of SRA, while theories are known, 
are not important as the cover-up of SRA: which identifies an agent or agency as
being complicit in SRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next to be addressed:
- corrupt cops
- corrupt courts
- 'SRA-gang'-related harrassment,
descrimination, or 'individual targeting'
-SRA-related 'population-control'/ 'mass-mind-control' schemes
           </p>
           <p>
            SRA is illegal.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you need to report SRA to the public, please protect your personnal info as best as you can. I don't want to bait people into doxing themselves. I just want to encourage an SRA-aware enviroment. Use your best judgement and self-leadership.

              I'm gonna start pinging you to shit-disturbers like this whose first comment in 17 days is to bolster the fake and gayest part of OPs narrative (that I'm ES).

             <p>
              Clearly they hoped to get me to ragequit in time for the Qtard influx.  Has ANY user ever gotten a special tag when you @ him like ES? 
Also note the irony of a SAVANT boasting that he "finds" my alts that all differed by 2 letters.

               your alts here so everyone knows what you own up to and then we can see how many you are still hopelessly trying to defend. For example are you still claiming not to be DeathTooMasons? How about equineluvr? What about Zyklon-b? Perhaps you'd like to own up to being ImJewish6000000? I hope this proves my point; you keep many alts with names that keep you anonymous and use them multiple times on the same posts to attempt to skew consensus.

                 You and I will definitely have a problem if you continue to take donkey's side and downvote who he tells you to. I said nothing egregious yet he still pings you to make a power move and get me downvoted. You work in the same building as him by any chance? If you're saying he pings you vile shit that you don't agree with it sure seems odd that you didn't downvote him. It also seems amiss that you would get pissed off at
                 <em>
                  me
                 </em>
                 for bringing
                 <em>
                  you
                 </em>
                 into this when you were pinged by your co-worker and then brigaded me.

                <p>
                 Also I fucking hate getting pinged for shit I'm not even slightly a part of and if I were Crensch I'd do one of two things:

                <p>
                 2) Call you a faggot

                   I don't give a fuck if I get downvote brigaded; CCP means absolutely nothing. What
                   <em>
                    does
                   </em>
                   matter is what it then tells me about
                   <strong>
                    you
                   </strong>
                   . You claimed that he pings you in shit that you disagree with as a way of distancing yourself from his brigading and reputation that comes with it:

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   However this argument is totally void if you then take his side despite him making no real point by the end of his comment and being dumb enough to confirm that he
                   <em>
                    is
                   </em>
                   in fact WalnutSauceGoat. He also stopped responding when I asked him to name all his alts that didn't follow the donkey formula. He hasn't made any point other than that brief ad hominem against me, so tell me; what exactly are you upvoting him for and what did I say that warranted a downvote? Oh that's right, you're just another co-worker.

                   "I'm not downvoting whoever Donkey tells me to, this was just a coincidence that I upvoted him despite providing no substance and you not getting anything wrong." You realise
                   <strong>
                    you
                   </strong>
                   would have to disprove it anyway? You so realise that very basic concept that when I accuse you of something that only you can see... you are the one that has to disprove it. I don't have to prove shit. In this case you proved yourself a liar to help me out in this case, yet somehow you're dumb enough to prove that you did it after you admitted to it.

                   He can't until after you've pinged him, fag-shit. Since he hasn't responded I can guarantee he doesn't give a fuck; one of the responses I told you he'd give you.

I just said some colloquial bullshit I always say in normal conversation irl but it didn't fit the persona of the wise old man that he had built for me based upon how often I've outsmarted him.

                         As conversation went by it turns out you disregard many proven facts. It turns out you don't think ES is  donkey despite the evidence. It turns out you don't pay attention to Q despite the connections to Trump. It turns out you're using the same dumbfuck catchphrases as GothamGirl (self-admitted Donkey's wife) such as "floppy titties."

                            No, I think you're the same person. This solves the "behind his back" problem.

                            I have not changed the meaning behind any of my points, so at this point, based your accusation, I can only conclude that you never read any of my comments properly and have no clue whether or not I altered the overall message? You did just admit to not reading the context of the discussion you were involved in which probably explains why you're losing so badly. If I were you, I'd give up my unconditional allegiance to Donkey as a result of this embarrassment - he gave up a long time ago because he knows how this has turned out ever time prior .

                            I have not edited the meaning of a single one of my coments or made any new points. It must have been nice once you saw that "edited" text to maybe finally come up with an excuse for losing so badly though. That's okay.

                            medal, however it was such a tiny change I don't think you could. Nice scapegoat though, right?

                              Editing is only problem if I'm going back and changing the meaning of everything I said and making it look like you weren't answering the points I made when in actual fact you adressed them appropriately. If I fix a spelling error immediately after I post a coment there is no problem. You have no excuse for losing this argument despite how hard you may try.

                                You have already asked me to ban you. Then somehow you don't want to be banned. Then somehow the guy going after the pedophiles is himself a pedophile, just because you said so.

                                 Stopped pinging you and left it to your mods and think- to figure out, since she former mod.

                                  Seriously, if I can for a moment... I thought you PG people were a bit of a joke, and at first many were. But it was interesting. And then the whole thing merged into researching the global/elite and some really well thought out points were made, and solid information presented. Then... QQ! Here comes the QQ Train! And now instead of thinking for and making connections for themselves, people line up at the feeding trough and fill themselves up with someone else’s bread.

                                   If your interested 8chan keeps a database of all arrests of child trafficking, porn etc.  It Is pretty shocking how many have been arrested.  Kids are like little captives today compared to pre rise of trafficking in US.  I really hope they can make America safe for our kids again but there are so many traffickers.  If you have never seen the database heres a link.

                                   An Ohio Mayor today plead guilty to 8 county of rape and several counts of other lesser but similar charges. The youngest child he raped was 4 years old.  He blamed the children for having initiated their own rapes.   Over the past month there have been a lot of arrests for Child porn.  Yesterday, charges were filed on a celebrity in Norway who was one of 10 individual involved in a huge Child porn and pedo ring.  They were selling CP and they had so many image s of children being molested that after 4 years of investigation they have only viewed 20% of the images.

                                     He got life in prison with possible parole in 10 years.  We'll see if he survives that long.  Did you also see the minister earlier this week who began sleeping with a 14 year old girl and passing her around to his friends fellow pastors.  He and his family are outraged because he got 36 years.  They act like all he did was sleep with a prostitute or something.  He was a psuedo parent to the girl (not sure how.)  Not much time to read /do voat past few days. These people really are nuts.

                                   Too busy archiving to check him out. Too stupid to tell difference, evidently. Hope mods check. It's funny how the people pulling the biggest shenanigans are the ones who scream the loudest about alts and downvoting. I upvote you when your not such a faggot, and downvote you when you piss me off. It's not rocket science.

              I honestly have no idea who this “donkey” is (they used to call me an ES alt, so this is a new twist) but I made my points in the previous thread that was on here for months. When it reappeared with the same “manipluator” thing (which I was sure the OP had been hanging his head in shame over for months) I realized that he’s actually not “quite there”, youknow?  We’re supposed to fight elite/satanic abuse of children and instead we get these idiotic distractions. It’s just sad.

               You loved talking about the Walnut Sauce reference as ES, donkey. Be more subtle and you job will become easier. I know you want to make another dumb joke about how most Savants are retarded without knowing both meanings of the word. Go on, be as predictable as you always are.

             The farm was a Muslim terrorist training camp,  and Luzzato was bringing kids there. Besta pizza was owned by muslims, and Steven Paddock was connected to this.
            </p>
            <p>
             The house where the realtor talks about the handkerchief, was owned by the Awan family, more muslims. Awan also followed elsagate type channels, on youtube.
            </p>
            <p>
             When it comes to pizzagate the muslims pretty much have gotten a free pass.

             pizzagate researchers abandoned/questioned the Q narrative months ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many shills desperately gatekeeped via pro Q posts detracting from genuine independent research
            </p>
            <p>
             this led to researchers abandoning the platform and serious momentum being lost in the investigation, and probably infighting within the shills and shills vs researchers

              There is a lot more to Q than pizzagate.....don't think it is appropriate to continually put a movement down when there are plenty of people who believe in it. Alienates which is exactly what the perpetrators do. So, then one has to wonder....esp. since the phenomenon started with the trump administration. ........which has seen more rapists and pedophiles outed than any time in our history as a country.And I am to the left of liberal ......another group which so many put down here and everywhere....playing into their hands. If we united,it would be game over for the fascists which control US.

              The idea to use the letter Q may have came from the movie Hackers.  Where the bad guy literally says “New World Order”. Just watched it the other day and noticed the big Q. Stretch? Idk

              I’ve never bought into that easy info shit. Plus “it’s coming”... but never does.

              If this is true that Q is a larp designed only to distract formt he Pizzagate narrative answer me this:  Why then did Q post on pedophiles and child trafficking multiple times?
             </p>
             <p>
              If Q is not working with Trump can you explain how this could happen:

               R you smoking crack or just ignorant of the Q community you claim to know enough to judge!  Lemmings don't dedicate multiple subs and chans to the collecton of the news and research revealing deeper truths about our government and society.  Its like you have never been on any Q subif you think the Q crowd is isolated from the real events in the world,  Did you know that yesterday a Portland city office had a bomb scare?  That Austin has passed a law making it legal to camp anywhere within the city limits? That Putin has exited the INF treaty with the US. That today is Julian Assange's birthday.  That a volcano is under threat of eruption since yesterday in Hawaii.  That yesterday there was a Russia sub fire, an Earthquake of 4.0 in Alaska.  Gold has spiked to an all time high and the market gained 500 points yesterday.  Lee Iococa died yesterday at 94.   That Google is not blocking anti-vaxxer, anti Cancer and anti-GMO webstes.  How many did you know?  Which one of us is cut off from real events?

We have learned their comms, we have educated ourselves on a variety of government failures, policies, procedures, and the people who are working to take away our democracy. Learned an entirely new history of the 20th century.  We have considered and anticipated work That is more than 80 percent of people walking around in the US today.

                    Ignorant. As in generationally. As in a whole lot of American parents fucking lied to their kids. And that generation after them had to learn the truth and decide how to raise their own kids. And so on. So here we are - with a broken family unit, statistically, struggling to wake up.

                     You appear to be trying to  throw a lot of words out there without much relation to the point you made.  This means you realize your wrong and cant rebut the point directly.  Its a rehash of things already knwn well by the Q community.

                    <p>
                     R you sure your not burned out by previous leakers/movements to have the energy to pursue one more.  So you want this experience to be the same as the ewxperience you and others had in the 90's.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The difference is this time q is not a leaker.  He is a spokeperson for the war against the DS and he is posting both at the express direction of the President of the United States and the Military commanders who are part of the war on the DS.  This has NEVER happened B4.  If you go to 8chan and look at the Q proofs that show you where Q posted and then Trump tweeted something similar exactly a set number of minutes later.  This happened around a hundred times.  In ever smaller minutes apart until they are second apart.

                    <p>
                     You have my sympathy.  You have been disappointed by failed attempts in the past to remove the powers behind the governments who control the world in reality.  But there has never been anything like this.  Tell me when Saudi Arabia has turned on the DS.  Tell me when a president has signed an exec order freezing their assets.  Tell me when a president has come out and named them and said they would be locked up.  Tell me when a president has stood in front of the press with a large group of generals and said this is the calm before the storm and then the spokesman comes forward talking of taking out the DS and he posts by that same name.

                     You want us to be wrong because you were wrong in the past and decided not to follow Q because you wrongly assumed he was like the others.  He is not. YOur resistance now is about your ego getting bruised if we are right and you failed to figure that out.

                         I am confused.  R you saying you wont read a 5 minute link?  I'm not asking anything about your experience.  You have called Q readers stupid lemmings.  I am asking you to read a 5 minute link and explain to me how you can explain that in any other way than that Q is working for Trump and posting in co-ordination with him.

                          What you are observing is both of us realizing we have different ideology. Some will try to change your mind. I, on the other hand, am very familiar with being amiable with people of different ideology.

                           I do not know how many times Trump has posted using words that q just posted minutes before.  I know it is greater than 30 and less than 100 times.  Is there any explanation other than they are coordinating.  The gap between Q's posts and Trumps tweets became less and less until they were posting almost simultaniously.  But Q people are just stupid lemmings who are gullible.

                            You're putting words in my mouth at this point, and I've been around the block enough to know there isn't much point in having a conversation if you cannot separate individual situations and dialogue from broad blanket statements of the community.

                                 You have no argument to support your suppositions.  We play at different levels.  I'm not interested in your repeated effort to save face by attacking me rather than using any kind of logic to address your original points that Q readers are stupid ignorant, lemmings who are isolated and unaware of events in the real world or your rejection of Q in the face of repeated tweets that mirror Q postings within minutes of Q posting.  If you can not [resent any reasonable argument then I'm done here.  Id rather sleep!

                               If you are confident in your opinions and beliefs there is no need to resort to name calling.  If you have no winning argument to support our beliefs then you try to distract with insults,name calling and such.  I suggest you consider why you believe what you believe if you cant win an argument with a fucking stupid lemming.  I think were done here unless you have some real argument to present.

                           Amiable???? you called me a stupid lemming, a fucking Qew.  You judged us as if you were the Lord of the land and all wise.  But you can not give me any plausible explanation for this link.  I have used no swear words and only spoken to you with logic and addressed your believe that because leakers failed to fulfill your dreams that Q isnt real.  I have not called you any names.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           You seem to have some problems seeing both me and yourself accurately. Let me clear that up.  I have not experienced you as amiable.

            and pushing the Tranny agenda with LGBTQ and Pride  Merch + endorsing Pride Month?
           </p>
           <p>
            While I'm happy that you're no longer accusing me of being part of this crew, I still disagree with the perpetual stickying of it. Can't you put it in the description or just leave the tags on in his usernames? That way it doesn't push research further down the page?

               there’s a few more. I’m too lazy to list them all. Just go through my posts and other peoples posts. Their is evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Claims about lacking evidence is a sign of lacking due diligence.

               Putt could prove it by running an IP check against Alts. But then some people use VPN. So his inorganic voting algorithm isn’t perfect.

                I believe we can find some common ground on this matter. I've no want to read your posts, nor am I obligated to provide evidence to support your claims.
               </p>
               <p>
                We are both too lazy to look it up. Since we can both agree that we are too lazy to cite sources, how about some first hand testimony instead?
               </p>
               <p>
                If you're too lazy to provide factual support for your assertions, then why are you making any assertions
                <em>
                 ab initio
                </em>
                ?

                 Type 4's only objective is to put you on the defensive. Forcing you to defend yourself through insinuation, summoning, subversion, manipulation, and outright lying makes you give further information for which to use to put you on the defensive.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Since their objective is never to come to an agreement or consensus with you, but instead to keep you constantly feeding them something for which they can continue to engage you on - the easiest way to deal with a Type 4 is to ignore it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's a "don't feed the animals" type methodology. Type 4's are harmless if you don't let them put you on a defensive cycle. They're only trying to keep the circle going, and you control when it ends.

                   He is a sneaky lying snake is what he is. If you say something he doesn't like he will immediately demand "evidence" and then turn around and spout a bunch of bilge about you without providing that precious "evidence" he will always demand from you.

                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   When he wants to censor your free speech he will accuse you of shit like "demoralizing others" and denying them their free speech. So, your opinion is denying others a right to speak according to him.

                   He will lie like a mother fucker too. zyklon is not a credible source according to him, unless that, whatever zyklon is saying goes in his favor, and then it becomes "evidence."

                 You started off good and agreeable but then you want me to be not lazy. Dude!

                 I provide 2 alts. Several others have been provided by several other people. I made a post in SBBH calling for people to list her alts and we have about 6-8 active ones at the moment. New ones pop up almost daily.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Shitting up boards is to provide light on certain topics. That is what this type of site all about. It’s only when people don’t like the topics the bitch and moan and call them shit. I do the same so I’m not point fingers but stating a fact.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My goal? To dig up some juicy agendas. When you pound on somebody for days they eventually start slipping up and provide truths. It’s human nature. I have also figured out that lots of people act like liberals by just making blanket statements but that’s off topic and I have called you one since you haven’t done that in this thread.

                 My spider sense gets triggered at times and I got into active attack mode. This SrayzieGate is very complex. So many levels of intrigue and subterfuge that it’s way deeper than I first imagined. Because I’m a prolific shit poster and troll at times (on purpose) that people started wondering what set me off. (I do post lots of serious content besides shitting up subs as you claimed. ) after people realized that

                 </a>
                 aren’t attacking me (I don’t know why yet, I just say they are  chicken) people became brave enough to speak up. It’s like a #metoo movement. I challenged Virge to buy me out - after that he has been ghosting me. Oh I do comment left and right against him. He like the others just talk shit about me with out pinging me. I ping them and I end up with minus imaginary points. Lol. I don’t even ping my buddies on this site. Yeah, I’m friends with some of them who are massive trolls. I do this on my own and people seem to subscribe to my channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I’m not intending to white knight or fight some one else’s battles. If their problems match my agenda I will use their claims as battle gear. I don’t find it cool that Crensch brigades women - I guess that’s white knighting but it’s more to me a very fucked up beta thing to do. I don’t like that Crensch power mods GA. I proved it with one post. I called him out on it and the Moloch banned me for talking about “people” or whatever he called it. I used to respect Crensch because he could in a way say he was wrong. He never would outright admit it but his words came close enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So yeah, I go around grinding my ax. However I like dropping it on people who have a brigade team. It’s a challenge to take on several strong opponents, it makes me sharper and stronger. While the Crensch bro-game attacks in packs on those who don’t have an imaginary point build up like me. Those who are easy prey. Those who will back down because it’s too bothersome. They then claim victory. Me? I become a bigger ass. I don’t back down and just keep plugging away at them until the ghost me. Lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nobody wins though in reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I offered Virge the chance to buy me out. Lock stock and barrel. He gets my accounts and special permission for putt to pull all my data. He just needs to sign an NDA protecting my real life identity and those who may be exposed in PM. I will even meet him in person at his lawyer office who he has on retainer. I will walk away from Voat forever as my part of the bargain. The data that I will give away, is free to be used as Virge seems fit. He thinks I have multiple alts and I brogade people and all kinds of other conspiracies. He will prove himself something which I won’t care anymore about. I just want his shekels! People think I’m a Jew, so I’ll let Virge pay me and I’ll be that greedy Jew.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, I hope this wall of text provides some insight and information about me. I like transparency (Virge doesn’t he deletes posts and comments that show him in a bad light, and he records everything in an excel spreadsheet — he’s probably working on something else too).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Low energy? Bingo! I am not even trying.
