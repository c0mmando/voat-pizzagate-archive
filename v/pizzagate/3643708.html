<p>Stories in the NY Times and NY Post about millions being transferred from Epstein\'s estate to <strong>Southern Country International Bank</strong>, a US Virgin Islands entity created in 2014. Some people and entities in the article are worth looking deeper into.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/jeffrey-epstein-estate-bank.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/jeffrey-epstein-estate-bank.html</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the years after Jeffrey Epstein registered as a sex offender, he closed his money management firm and started a business to develop algorithms and mine DNA and financial databases.</p>
<p>Then he set up a bank.</p>
<p>In a banking license application reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Epstein described himself as one of the investing world’s “pioneers” and said he wanted to pursue the “dynamic discipline of international banking.”</p>
<p>Officials in the Virgin Islands, the United States territory where Mr. Epstein set up most of his businesses, approved a license for him in 2014 to run one of the territory’s first international banking entities, a specialized bank that can do business only with offshore clients. The approval was unusual, given Mr. Epstein’s status as a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>The bank, <strong>Southern Country International</strong>, renewed its license for each of the next five years, but it’s unclear whether it conducted any business or had any customers. Mr. Epstein, who died while in federal custody last summer following his arrest on sex trafficking charges, does not appear to have done any marketing for the bank or hired much staff.</p>
<p>The bank was created under a territorial law that lacked many of the oversight requirements banks are usually subject to, and its regulatory file is largely empty. A lawyer for Mr. Epstein told officials in the Virgin Islands in 2018 that Southern Country had not commenced operations. And regulators in the territory said they did not exercise oversight of the bank because it did not appear to be doing any business.</p>
<p>And yet, after Mr. Epstein’s death, his estate transferred more than $12 million to Southern Country, according to court documents.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, at a court hearing in the Virgin Islands on motions involving Mr. Epstein’s estate, a magistrate judge, <strong>Carolyn Hermon-Purcell</strong>, questioned the estate’s lawyers about the transfers to Southern Country, saying the disclosure was not satisfactory. The judge said she did not know why Southern Country would be receiving checks from the estate. “There’s no explanation for it,” she said.</p>
<p>A lawyer for the estate responded that some of the payment had been made in error, but the judge was not satisfied with his response and asked him to follow up with a fuller accounting.</p>
<p>The checks — listed in the estate’s transactions for routine payments such as cable-TV bills and phone service for Mr. Epstein’s many properties — stand out. The list of payments were filed with Judge Hermon-Purcell, who is overseeing his $635 million estate, including the possible establishment of a compensation fund for his victims.</p>
<p>That Mr. Epstein was able to get a banking license in the first place is unusual.</p>
<p>His 2008 conviction in Florida on a charge of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl required him to register as a sex offender. Most bank operators doing business in the United States are required to undergo rigorous background checks, and most banking institutions are subject to oversight by the arm of the Treasury that investigates suspicious financial transactions. Neither was required by the Virgin Islands when Mr. Epstein submitted the application in 2013.</p>
<p>The territory had passed its international banking entity law a year earlier, in hopes of enticing investment from overseas. It modeled its law on that of Puerto Rico, where international banking entities have existed for three decades.</p>
<p>Such organizations are attractive to offshore investors because the banks are able to offer more favorable tax treatment than the investors’ own countries can. In return, the territories expect residents to manage the banks, even though they cannot use the banks’ services.</p>
<p>These specialized banks have drawn scrutiny because of their potential for abuse, including money laundering. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York describes international bank entities in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico as “high-risk” institutions. Last year, it temporarily suspended applications for them to obtain financial services from the Fed until it can issue stricter rules for them.</p>
<p>Mr. Epstein was carefully evasive in answering a question on the application that was meant to reveal information about an applicant’s criminal record. His response mentioned his guilty plea to state charges in Florida, but it played down other elements of the case.</p>
<p>“For a relatively brief period, in what has otherwise been a productive and accomplished life,” the application said, Mr. Epstein “did face some legal difficulties relating to matters alleged to have taken place seven years ago.” The application noted that a federal investigation had been “discontinued.”</p>
<p>But that answer was misleading, said <strong>Richard Scott Carnell</strong>, a former assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department. The application did not reflect that Mr. Epstein’s plea deal included an agreement with federal prosecutors, who promised not to bring their own charges. The agreement acknowledged that federal authorities had compiled a long list of other possible underage victims.</p>
<p>“Bank regulators expect applicants to be candid,” said Mr. Carnell, now an associate professor at Fordham Law School. “You’d never suspect there was a nonprosecution agreement. As a bank regulator, I’d be outraged to learn that an applicant had misled me in that way.”</p>
<p>In his application, Mr. Epstein listed as references <strong>James E. Staley</strong>, the chief executive of Barclays who had cultivated a relationship with Mr. Epstein while at JPMorgan Chase. Another reference was <strong>Andrew Farkas</strong>, a New York real estate tycoon and co-owner of a marina and office complex on St. Thomas with Mr. Epstein. Spokesmen for both men said they had been unaware they were listed as references, along with JPMorgan and <strong>FirstBank</strong>, a Puerto Rico-based lender with branches in the Virgin Islands that long held some of Mr. Epstein’s accounts.</p>
<p>The application was submitted by <strong>Erika A. Kellerhals</strong>, a longtime tax lawyer for Mr. Epstein in the Virgin Islands. She did not return requests for comment.</p>
<p>Southern Country had not commenced doing business as of April 2018, according to correspondence between Ms. Kellerhals and the territory’s banking department. Regulators said the bank was a “self-reporting” company and did not require additional regulatory oversight if it was not operational.</p>
<p>But court documents show Southern Country was active for some of last year.</p>
<p>Records filed by the estate on Friday indicate that <strong>Southern Country had $693,157 in assets when Mr. Epstein died on Aug. 10. Then, in mid-December, the estate transferred $15.5 million to Southern Country in two checks. Southern Country sent back $2.6 million, leaving the total it received at $12.9 million.</strong> The documents filed by the estate do not give a reason for the transfers.</p>
<p><strong>It’s also not clear what Southern Country did with that money. Two weeks later, the year-end value of Southern Country’s assets was $499,759, according to the estate’s filings.</strong></p>
<p>The estate has told officials in the Virgin Islands that it does not intend to renew the bank’s license again.</p>
<p>Around the time the territory granted Mr. Epstein his banking license, it also gave a lucrative tax break to <strong>Southern Trust,</strong> a company Mr. Epstein said was developing sophisticated algorithms to mine DNA and financial databases. The tax break came from the territory’s <strong>Economic Development Authority,</strong> which was <strong>approved by the territory’s former governor, John de Jongh Jr., while his wife, Cecile, worked for Mr. Epstein.</strong> Neither Ms. de Jongh nor her husband returned messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>The tax break, granted in 2013, was a boon for Mr. Epstein. <strong>Southern Trust generated about $300 million in profit in six years, and he paid an effective tax rate of about 3.9 percent.</strong> The source of Southern Trust’s revenue is not clear; the bare-bones corporate filings made by the company in the Virgin Islands do not list any clients.</p>
<p>Although the Virgin Islands was long a place where Mr. Epstein got his way, it has lately cast itself as one of his victims.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit last month, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, <strong>Denise N. George</strong>, said Mr. Epstein had sullied the territory’s reputation with his conduct. She sued Mr. Epstein’s estate, seeking to seize his private islands and dissolve what she said were shell companies acting as fronts for his sex-trafficking enterprise.</p>
<p>The suit seeks to intervene in the administration of Mr. Epstein’s will to safeguard assets for dozens of his victims, claiming the coexecutors may have a conflict of interest because they were officers in many of Mr. Epstein’s companies, including Southern Country and Southern Trust. The coexecutors, <strong>Darren Indyke</strong> and <strong>Richard Kahn,</strong> did not return requests for comment</p>
<p>Judge Hermon-Purcell, the magistrate judge overseeing the administration of Mr. Epstein’s will in the Virgin Islands, heard arguments on the attorney general’s request at the hearing on Tuesday. The judge said she would issue a ruling at a later date.</p>

            The suit seeks to intervene in the administration of Mr. Epstein’s will to safeguard assets for dozens of his victims, claiming the coexecutors may have a conflict of interest because they were officers in many of Mr. Epstein’s companies, including Southern Country and Southern Trust. The coexecutors,

            Judge Hermon-Purcell, the magistrate judge overseeing the administration of Mr. Epstein’s will in the Virgin Islands, heard arguments on the attorney general’s request at the hearing on Tuesday. The judge said she would issue a ruling at a later date.

            In regards to Andrew Farkas and relation to Epstein , Jeff had 3500 sf. of warehouse space and 6 marina slips in Farkas American Yacht Harbor in Vessup Bay St.Thomas , very close to Little St James.  Jeffs planes land in St Thomas , clients helicopered to the island and human cargo brought by boat, this Farkas has connections to Wex Leslie (sp?) , Lex Luther as well , he had a custom slip built for his 300 ft yacht. Farkas also owns many many marinas , maybe he's a key smuggling component,  but for sure his St Thomas marina is to  key moving goods to Jeffs island.
           </p>
           <p>
            I read Jeff has/had a helicopter,  can anyone verify that ?

             </strong>
             an associate of Epstein’s who visited him frequently in jail.
            </p>
            <p>
             The day Epstein went to jail in July 2008, Indyke himself was there to visit — he visited his client at least 38 times over the 13-month period, according to jail logs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Indyke has been involved with virtually all of Epstein’s business dealings in the last two decades — his name appears as the treasurer and vice president of Epstein’s three most prominent nonprofits: The
             <strong>
              C.O.U.Q. Foundation,
             </strong>
             <strong>
              Gratitude America Ltd.,
             </strong>
             and the
             <strong>
              J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation,
             </strong>
             also sometimes known as
             <strong>
              Enhanced Education.
             </strong>
             The latter two charitable giving organizations are registered in the U.S. Virgin Islands, while the C.O.U.Q. Foundation, defunct since 2012, was based in New York State.
            </p>
            <p>
             The foundations' giving records show donations to colleges, research foundations, and arts organizations. Other beneficiaries include the
             <strong>
              Clinton Foundation,
             </strong>
             <strong>
              Friends of the Israel Defense Forces,
             </strong>
             and the
             <strong>
              Edge Foundation,
             </strong>
             an educational research organization that recently scrubbed Epstein from its website.
            </p>
            <p>
             Indyke was listed as the treasurer of
             <strong>
              Gratitude America,
             </strong>
             which received a
             <strong>
              $10 million donation
             </strong>
             from an entity tied to private equity billionaire
             <strong>
              Leon Black
             </strong>
             of
             <strong>
              Apollo Management,
             </strong>
             according to a 990 form.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Indyke's signature appears on the work release program agreement as Epstein's employer,
             </strong>
             according to the document reviewed by Yahoo Finance.
            </p>
            <p>
             For his work-release, Epstein worked at
             <strong>
              The Florida Science Foundation,
             </strong>
             his not-for-profit that said it aimed to “to finance scientific research on academic, organizational and individual levels,” according to the organization’s articles of incorporation. Records show that
             <strong>
              Indyke registered The Florida Science Foundation
             </strong>
             in November 2007, just after he signed the non-prosecution agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
             In October 2015, Indyke was also present via phone on behalf of Epstein during the deposition of high-profile lawyer and Harvard law professor
             <strong>
              Alan Dershowitz,
             </strong>
             who had been accused in a civil lawsuit of having sex with an underage girl who was also victimized by Epstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             During Indyke’s 20-plus years with Epstein, he has also been connected with other associates of the now-deceased financier. He’s on documents connected to
             <strong>
              Ghislaine Maxwell,
             </strong>
             Epstein’s former girlfriend, as well as
             <strong>
              Les Wexner,
             </strong>
             the L Brands CEO whose money Epstein managed. Indyke has also been tied to
             <strong>
              Lesley Groff,
             </strong>
             a longtime Epstein assistant, as well as
             <strong>
              Arnold Paul Prosperi
             </strong>
             a disbarred attorney who visited Epstein multiple times in jail.
            </p>
            <p>
             Indyke’s name appears as a trustee on Maxwell’s nonprofit, the
             <strong>
              Max Foundation,
             </strong>
             which made small donations from 2002 to 2010 but has been largely dormant in recent years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Separately, Indyke also helped Maxwell buy a
             <strong>
              7,000-square-foot townhouse at 116 East 65th street
             </strong>
             in 2000, according to New York City property records. The New York Times reports that the townhouse was bought for
             <strong>
              $4.95
             </strong>
             million by an anonymous limited liability company —
             <strong>
              116 East 65th Street, LLC
             </strong>
             — that shared an address with J. Epstein &amp; Co.
            </p>
            <p>
             Indyke also used a 10th-floor unit in a building owned by Epstein as his primary office at
             <strong>
              301 East 66th
             </strong>
             for nearly a decade, a Business Insider report stated, citing court records and attorney registration files. The company,
             <strong>
              DKI PLLC,
             </strong>
             was later listed as the point of contact for Epstein’s private foundation in 2008.
            </p>
            <p>
             Public records show that Indyke’s law practice is called DKI PLLC.
            </p>
            <p>
             Indyke was listed as the
             <strong>
              secretary for The Wexner Foundation
             </strong>
             in a 1998 SEC filing. In 2008,
             <strong>
              Abigail Wexner,
             </strong>
             the billionaire’s wife, also
             <strong>
              gave Indyke power of attorney over 15 Central Park West,
             </strong>
             according to New York real estate records.
            </p>
            <p>
             After Prosperi died in 2016, property records show that Indyke signed off on a warranty deed that transferred ownership of Prosperi’s South End lakefront home to
             <strong>
              Donna Ward
             </strong>
             for $5.6 million.

             . Good to get more eyes on each new information avenue that opened up with this NY Times article and corresponding documents.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's also the Florida State Attorney's office dump of lots of Epstein files from a few days ago that I haven't even glanced at yet and haven't seen mentioned in this sub yet. It's sure to have some more information avenues to explore.
