<h2>Are legitimate businesspeople forced under blackmail/other threat to cooperate with Cabal human trafficking?</h2>
<p>This is a comment by <a href="https://voat.co/user/ronnyCPI">@ronnyCPI</a> within a thread pointing out a potential Epstein<strong>-Hong Kong</strong> connection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A probable modus operandi of Epstein: cozy up to as many wealthy people with connections as possible, invite them aboard the Lolita express pedo-plane for some fun and games and partying, and make a secret video. <strong>Now he\'s in position to negotiate (extort) a deal using their legitimate business credentials to make them offers they can\'t refuse, for drug-trafficking or child trafficking hidden in legitimate shipments of imported merchandise.</strong></p>

            Thank you for this!  I've been updating a timeline I started on the Seth Rich subverse,

            These ties, bring together a bigger picture of the Clinton/China picture, and the ongoing Ng Lap Seng trial, involving Francis Lorenzo for starters. On April 27, 2017 Francis Lorenzo, suspended diplomat from the Dominican Republic pleaded guilty to new charges in a United Nations bribery scheme on Thursday, revealing himself as a key witness at a Chinese billionaire Ng Lap Seng trial next month.

            I've been trying to get some links together...

             "In September 2015, Ng Lap Seng was charged in Manhattan Federal Court lying about why he brought $4.5 mln in cash to the US. He said it was for "art, real estate, and gambling." However, his interpreter later admitted the cash was for "illegal purposes" -- but, those purposes remain secret.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the reports, Ng was visiting a very wealth Chinese businessman on Long Island. This person, I believe, is Qin Fei, who is also believed to be a Chinese intelligence agent:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems this Fei guy is like Ng's handler.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's where it gets interesting. Fei and Ng were caught trying to bribe Former UN General Assembly President John Ashe, of the twin Caribbean Nations of Antigua &amp; Barbuda. These two countries are HOT BEDS for trafficking. The U.S Dept of State calls it a "destination &amp; transit country of men, women, children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor"

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Some may recall that just a day before Ashe was set to testify in the bribery case, he was found dead with a barbell on his neck:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             That's the "indirect link" to trafficking. One of Ng's Chinese hotels, Fortuna, was linked to organized crime and trafficking:

            Thank you for a legit researched post.

            Chinese MFN status and the gutting of US manufacturing base justified by cheap walmart garbage is a JEWISH plot to cause despair and unemployment to depress our birthrates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously any community could outsource or import cheaper labor -- group solidarity, in this case with fellow white laborers, is what stood in the way, so SJW-cover Jews work hard to destroy that
