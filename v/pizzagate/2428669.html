<h1><strong>Seychelles: History of Money Laundering and Shadowy Haven for Dirty Money</strong></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seychelles">Where is Seychelles?</a> Seychelles is a Soveriegn State off the coast of Africa. It is composed of 115 islands and has one of the smallest populations in the African region. Seychelles has a very new country and its government has been mentioned in the media to have endured many political scandals, most notably the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2010/11/bettencourt-201011">Bettencourt Affair</a> with L\'Oreal Heiress Liliane Betterncourt and François-Marie Banier using an island they purchased in Seychelles as a sort of <em>Swiss Bank Account</em> to not pay taxes, and also the many other major <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/offshore/sun-and-shadows-how-island-paradise-became-haven-dirty-money/">shadowy offshore deals and scandals</a> that give the Seychellois islands the title of a &quot;Haven for Dirty Money&quot;</p>
<h1><strong>Gaetanne Sharon Antat</strong></h1>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaetanne.antat">Gaetanne Antat</a> is the registered owner of the sites we have discovered advertising little girls, but also there are <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/20841">financial and special interest companies</a> where she is/was holding the title of director/officer.  
</p>
<p>These companies have also changed hands with another Seychelles citizen, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tFwbYPx.jpg">Molly Rita Roselie</a> and are companies filed in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LWAt6wo.png">London addresses</a>, no doubt, to run offshore business transactions and/or launder money through Seychelles.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/9qQLm1T.png">Molly Rita Roselie</a></p>
<h1><strong>They Are Selling Child Porn &amp; Child Prostitution Services Online</strong></h1>
<p>This is a massive operation that includes, but is not limited to, London, Russia, Africa and USA, and its base of operations is out of Seychelles. Some Key points I want to address are how these sites operate using keywords, modeling agencies, and Facebook to advertise and purchase young girls, what politicians and powerful players may be involved, and also what the people of Seychelles know about this ring.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here are some of the <strong>Code Words for advertising little girls</strong> mentioned in one of the site stats, Some of these we know, but others like <em>Tyflas</em>, <em>Papaka</em>, <em>Pinderloy</em> and <em>FreshPetals</em> are ones I have never seen before, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6ONRCy6.jpg">seen here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also notice the use of the words <em>Model/Young Models</em> in the titles of some of these companies like <a href="https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/galamodel.com">Gala Model</a> and <a href="http://young-models.info.websiteoutlook.com/">Young Models</a> both run by Gaetanne Antat.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://nationalassembly.sc/index.php/2016/10/17/anse-etoile-hon-ahmed-afif/">Honorable Ahmed Afif</a>, Elected Member of the <a href="">National Assembly of Seychelles</a> and disgraced former <a href="http://sirop-cdu-alliance-snm.blogspot.com/2015/07/ahmed-afif-former-principal-secretary.html">Principal Secretary of the Seychelles Ministry of Finance, Trade, and Investment</a>, is friends with Gaetanne on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ahmed.afif.334">Facebook</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is highly concerning is a particular &quot;like&quot; of a picture of Gaetanne\'s young daughter in a bathing suit, and also other images of the little girl as if posing like a model. This is alarming given the fact the both Gaetanne and Ahmed both have a criminal history of illegal activity and also that Gaetanne is running child porn websites.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There is also something concerning I found on a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Dz1hxPs.png">comment thread</a>between two or three anonymous Seychellois concerning some shameful thing that Gaetanne had done and that the father of her child may be her former lawyer. <a href="http://starseychelles.blogspot.com/2010/09/eden-island-on-publicity-juggling-act.html?m=1">Source</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems the racket and business fronts have been going on for some time, there is an <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,22288294">article posted in 2002</a> talking about Gaetanne Antat running ponzi schemes, offshore money laundering operations, and also using businesses and websites as fronts for child sexual exploitation websites and services.</p>

            wanted to make sure you saw this post. I'm sure you will let us all know it's totally fake since women are magnificent, angelic beings who would never ever ever sexually abuse a child! They are just too perfect and incapable of such horrific crimes right?

            I know we have to expose these sicko's but those websites on the pastebin are full blown child porn...I'm not talking about pictures of just nude kids I'm talking full rape and sexual abuse. I made the mistake of going to one when looking into it on darkknight111's post. Please DO NOT go to any of those links and listen to Honeybee_'s warning.

            Hi there Honeybee_, think- is concerned folks may click through to CP. I know you've got a prominent warning at the top of your post, but I am going to switch the flair to to "Potential Security Risk" in case some of these sites are LEO honeypots and people don't have proper security procedures in place. Mods are a bit on edge given CP was posted directly a few days ago. We are awaiting confirmation from

             None of the links provided in this post go to any of the sites and the sites that are listed are currently offline. I did not attach the paste bin with all of the sites owned by Gaetanne, if people want to find that they can go look elsewhere. I purposely did not include it so that people wouldn't go clicking through

              I did confirm with our O's that it IS okay to provide links like the pastebin one, so long as the link is broken so people have to deliberately fix it to follow it, and a prominent, all caps warning accompanies the link. I will make a sticky about the formal policy, and link to it in the sidebar.
