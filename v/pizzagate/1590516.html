<p>Regarding the Obama $65k email, if you say you\'re flying in pizza and hot dogs, it means you\'re flying in male and female (or male \'top and bottom\') hookers/sex slaves/sluts/\'boy toys,\' which makes sense given what we know goes on at Bohemian Grove (gay prostitutes and porn stars being present), \'bunga bunga parties\' etc. The \'same waitresses\' response also makes sense (same prostitutes/slaves)</p>
<p>As for the other food code terms, cheese = young child let\'s say up to age 10 or 12 (\'extra cheese\' = extra young). Pasta = adolescent/preteen. Dominos = BDSM sex. Walnuts = [genitals of] young girl. Cheese and pasta make sense in terms of age groups, since pedophiles appear to have strict age preferences, while others run the gamut. This makes more sense when Sandler asks if he will have a better time at S&amp;M sex with very young victims or with preteens/teenagers, not boys or girls.</p>
<p>A \'pasta lover\' would be someone like Epstein, who targets girls let\'s say from ages 11-17. A \'cheese lover\' would be a full-on Alefantis-type pedophile who may target victims from 0-6, or in other cases 0-10/0-12 or the oft mentioned 7 to 12 range (when pedophiles are interviewed they often say they prefer this range), hence the \'almost 7\' description in the Luzzatto \'heated pool entertainment\' email.</p>',

            I can tell you from years and years of browsing 4chan. Cheese Pizza has been a code word for Child Pornography or CP for quite some time. No reference to male or female, just child Pornography in general. I would also like to agree with the anon who is pointing out the triangle shape of the pizza and female genetilia. It's well established a triangle pointing down is feminine and a triangle point up is masculine.

            Trying to base that Pizza is girl because of the pelvic triangle, hotdogs for boys, self explanatory.

           <p>
            Cheese and pasta I don't get but have speculation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cheese is plain, no toppings = Prepubescent
           </p>
           <p>
            Walnuts: Boy with nuts
           </p>
           <p>
            Pasta = young boy with just a noodle and no nuts
           </p>

             The meaning of girl makes absolutely no sense in light of the CPP-associated social media imagery and emails. Your meaning for cheese is equivalent to child/pre-preteen (i.e. no signs of puberty). FYI the testes (are supposed to) descend at birth. Walnut is known pedo-slang for young girls genitals. The meanings have to be found to be consistent with the available evidence, just associating with it pelvic triangle does not do that.

             I think it is vital given that the name Pizzagate is a reference to the coded language and the use of coded language is the origin of the entire scandal. While most to all of us here are convinced that Podesta, CPP, etc. are involved in child sex abuse, it's not a good start in convincing others who have not yet been exposed to the information when we can't even get the code right.

             I knew et al wasn't perfect, just wanted to say 'and other sources of information not necessarily similar to documentaries' Etc has colloquially come to mean more 'and so forth' and wasn't entirely appropriate either. Et al does not have to refer to people.

             Get the hell out of here with your BS. Maps on pizza-related handkerchief? Dominos on cheese? We all know it's code, you're fooling no one. No actually, I do do better, because all of the instagram and social media evidence, as well as the emails, are consistent with my proposed translations. I welcome any alternative explanations that also can be argued to be consistent with the evidence.

              <br/>
              The video at the end refers to dark and light colored nuts. 
It's a disturbing video. The after party like Paul Bonacci mentioned.
Video on rewatch also says Pizza is older girl and cheesepizza is young girl.

             That could be, with regards to hot dog and pasta, though it's not consistent with Sandler's dominos email, which is only one of two emails involving use of cheese and pasta. The other is Sandler's 'tempting assortment' email. This is consistent with it meaning age, since the pasta box was said to be larger than the cheese box. Cheese pizza is child pornography (cheese=child pizza= sexual activity [less-than-consensual, general sexual activity]), and also is child by my theory, so I think we should operate off the assumption of child unless it means otherwise. It's also consistent with 'Haitian special extra cheese' (extra young Haitian children). Sauce in my opinion is just a descriptor of the sex in terms of body fluids and not really a key codeword. It could also specifically mean blood given the possibility of Satanic ritual abuse and the 'dog bowl' art in Tony Podesta's collection.

            My theory is that the triangle shape of the pizza slice is a reference to the triangle shape of the girl's "area". A cheese pizza has nothing on it like a pre-pubesent girl has no hair. The hotdog reference to a boy is obvious. Just my theory.

             Yes but there are a lot of problems with that.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not really consistent with any of the following:
1) McCauley Culkin music video/Olson twins video
2) 'mmmm pizza' gay fellatio imagery
3) 'pizza ejaculate' cartoon (though admittedly that's not really consistent with mine, unless it is framing the ejaculation as the result of pizza i.e. sex/orifice penetration)
4) image of pizza covering a naked man's genitals
5) '69' image of a couple on a slice of pizza
6) images of heterosexual fellatio where pizza is the penis (again, this could frame it from male perspective where oral sex is pizza)
7) Also not quite consistent with pizza-related handkerchief (while mine is)
            </p>
            <p>
             A multitude of references to non-child sex make it clear that pizza does not only refer to sex with young girls. If it means an orifice, the relation could just be a warm, wet surface (kind of like 'apple pie' as euphemism for penetration of female), that also happens to be something 'everybody likes' and a common word that would stand out to 'code talkers' but not be easily targeted in email scans, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree that hot dog is related to males but that is also consistent with my theory. And I haven't seen any evidence that it relates only to (young) boys.

             Cheese pizza as meaning for CP is also consistent with my meaning: cheese=young/child pizza=less-than-consensual sexual activity. Looking at it in terms of toppings doesn't quite add up since there are no references to other toppings, and since a large share of CP involves boys and preteens/adolescents who may have pubic hair.
