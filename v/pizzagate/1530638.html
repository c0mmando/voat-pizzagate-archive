<p>This video is long but very educational. It is a survivor\'s story out of Australia. Her experience appears to be very much what we believe is happening in the US. The survivor, Fiona, who is the center of the story, takes the interviewer to the specific locations she had experience with and gives details.

A girl. Has anyone seen this movie? Is it possibly filled with as many red flags as just its title and brief description?</p>',

            What worries me the most about Fiona Barnett's story is her family background. Where were her parents when all this was supposed to have been happening? Are we supposed to believe that she lived the whole time with her grandmother without her mother knowing what was going on? Did she not tell anyone (e.g., her own parents) about the terrible things she says she had seen with her own eyes? Did she not try to run away? In the same circumstances, I certainly would have done so. I find it hard to resist the suspicion that she is confabulating. (Which is not to suggest that I don't think such terrible things can happen. I think they do. I just find it hard to believe they would happen at Bathurst City Hall! And can you really hypnotise children so that they will just stand there and allow their heads to be lopped off one after the other?)

             Something this big is hard for most people to believe. You are far from alone. Unfortunately, this video is the real deal. To address just one of your concerns: mind control. It is evil. You say you would have done differently. No one is immune to the mind control techniques these people use. And if you listen to enough of the legitimate testimonies, they explain very accurately why people don't do what others might expect in the way of resisting or running. Hypnosis: one under hypnosis will very willingly allow you to do whatever you want with them. Video's all over you tube on that one as well as many of us here have seen it. Keep questioning every detail. It is how we find the truth :)

            I just finished watching this... there are not enough horrible descriptive words to describe this shit.     She went through hell and still survived, my God!.
            <br/>
            I wonder why they never did kill her and I wonder how she got out/away.  I hope there is a part 2.     It's hard to fathom so many ppl are willing to engage in these activities.  It just blows my mind.
            <br/>
            And I knew Kidman was involved but did not realize Nicole was, I wonder what the extent of her involvement was.
            <br/>
            Everyone should see this video.  This brings to light so much of exactly what is happening today all over the world.
            <br/>
            You may already know that they drink the blood of a frightened victim because the Adrenalin that is released into the victims blood is like a drug to the person consuming it.

            Below is an occult ritual calendar (link) , same dates I believe but more descriptive.
            <br/>
            Look at both of them if you have time.  If you've watched the video then your mind is already blown.  These calendars are more than likely what she witnessed and went through. That poor girl. This calendar states: 
"NOTE: Those who are bringing in Satan's one-world Global Government know that much bloodshed is needed to bring about the necessary "spiritual vibrations" (cooperation of devils) to bring in the New Order. This bloodshed is accomplished by way of ritual killings; planned terrorist events, planned disasters and wars; catastrophes caused by weather modification (ie. Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy); abortion; suicide; euthanasia; killings in foster care, and every conceivable way of causing death -- especially on a large scale."

            I saw toward the end how Nicole Kidman herself watched Fiona be abused and she laughed at her. Was 'never kind' to her. As in she saw a lot and has never come forward. Nicole married Tom Cruise. Famous for his position in scientology. A 'religion' with its foundation, where? In satanism.

             I remember when this came out on Australian media - Fiona named some people that are really high up in Australian politics and media.
            </p>
            <p>
             The politician that has sex with dead boys was our former Prime Minister!
            </p>
            <p>
             Bruce Spence is a well known actor in Australia... how on earth are these people still walking free astounds me. The amount of authorities, high commissions and official written testimonies this poor women has had to endure to try and plead her case, and nothing has come of it!
             <br/>
             Shameful and disgusting.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Nicole Kidman has always creeped me out. Especially now that her face has stopped moving!)

              I remember when I first saw Nicole Kidman. It was in 'Dead Calm'. She did this totally amazing job in a creepy gory role. Now it makes sense. It was nothing to her.

            Just finished watching this....probably one of the most compelling and important videos I've seen detailing satanic cults, pedophilia and ritual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            I implore serious Pizzagate investagors to watch and share this widely.
