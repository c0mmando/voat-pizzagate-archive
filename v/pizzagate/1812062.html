This show is absolutely sick and filled with lots of references to child trafficking, child abuse, and there are even videos with pizza sex related code and a the videos are edited in a heavy breathing/mk ultra type of way IMO. I will include lots of examples because these guys seem to enjoy the topic and have produced lots of content and I strongly urge you to check out each video as they are very short and without a doubt show the normalization of pedophilia in the media today through comedy and show just how sick our media is at allowing this to be aired on TV and on Cartoon Network of all places.</p>
<p>The tim and eric show has different skits. A series of Skits they have is called &quot;Steve Manahans Child Clown Outlet.&quot; This whole series essentially talks about how this guy rents out kid clowns to adults for their enjoyment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh3K2J99YHo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh3K2J99YHo</a>  - This episode is only 38 seconds. Watch it entirely. Commercial Ad renting his clown children. He say his &quot;clowns&quot; (kids) are soft to the touch&quot; and &quot;You have a discreet adult party you need clown catering for? Use our clowns!!!&quot; while showing a pic of a man and woman about to have sex is in the background.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFmEqeofSWw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFmEqeofSWw</a> - This episode is only 1 min and is about Steve going to jail for touching one of his &quot;Clowns&quot;. So he is having a going out of business sale and is offering his clowns. He mentions he hates his father for forcing him into this business. Disturbing video! Ferrell hits clown kids over the head with his cane and says he may even have to bury one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAU_Ez84l4c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAU_Ez84l4c</a> - Will Ferrell stars as Steve\'s Dad who runs the original child clown business. 1:21 long and Ferrell says &quot;My son broke the Golden rule...Never touch the clowns....Let the clowns TOUCH YOU&quot; Sick!!!</p>

This video gives off so many pedophilic vibes that its sickening. Its a video of a dreaming of a boy. He meets a boy and say &quot;Oh hey Beautiful boy&quot; and sings &quot;Its just a wonderful dream, of meeting a boy, the finest boy i\'ve ever seen.&quot; Boys dad invites pierre over and boy is on dads lap while pierre surfing the internet and the room has hot dog wallpaper. Talks about dad giving him meat and says &quot;There are some sites for children and some sites for adults. We\'re watching the sites for adults right now.&quot; After hand feeding the young boy a sausage he says &quot;This is the best dream i\'ve ever had about a boy&quot;. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6a8dAGO1Uo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6a8dAGO1Uo</a> - 3:32 long and stars john C Reilly. &quot;Browns Day Care&quot; Reilly visits a filthy day care where there are young little boys and midget men in their underwear.  Adult man says they change each others diapers and an adult has reilly literally change his diaper. Very sickening stuff going on at this daycare. Not sure how this is even comedy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl1J9bUNZhc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl1J9bUNZhc</a>  - 1:10 long, Eric and Tim Teach you to &quot;Be a Baby&quot;.

<a href="http://www.adultswim.com/videos/tim-erics-bedtime-stories/angel-boy/">http://www.adultswim.com/videos/tim-erics-bedtime-stories/angel-boy/</a>  This is a longer episode. 11 minutes. Its about a man who becomes obsessed with a gay highschool boy\'s voice who sold him a dvd at his doorstep. He and the boy almost kiss at one point. The next day he meets him after school and in a sexual kinda tone was asking him to give him a song right there. Sounded very sexual innuendoish and creepy. He even leans his carseat back as if he were to be getting a BJ. The school/creepy part starts at about 2:50 mark
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p96vPBBjlPs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p96vPBBjlPs</a>  - 48 second kid song about incest, talking about how he thinks his sister is cute and kisses her even though mom says no.

He asks if they can hang pictures of pizzas and says the men will be dressed as fisherman and refers to pizza and pictures of pizzas a few times.</p>
<p>Eric Wareheim is one half of the show. His instagram is filled with lots of pizza and sex related content. <a href="http://archive.is/jHvkI">http://archive.is/jHvkI</a>   - He certainly loves his hookers young, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BD8MWiLOsfP/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BD8MWiLOsfP/</a>  - Eric is a DJ and had some shows with DJ DouggPound. Their act is called &quot;The DutchBoys DJ Experience&quot; In this 43 sec clip of the ending of one of his songs, the track says &quot;It\'s a Dutch Boys Booty Blast. Watch out children.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0-YUplVccE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0-YUplVccE</a></p>
<p>Eric is friends with Brian Dwyer aka <a href="https://voat.co/user/reallybjdwyer">@reallybjdwyer</a> who owns a pizza shop called Pizza Brain. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cAMWNSl.png">https://i.imgur.com/cAMWNSl.png</a> Here is his instagram where he loves to be naked with his son. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reallybjdwyer/">https://www.instagram.com/reallybjdwyer/</a> Oddly, an article was written about him about how giving his son weed, helped save his infant son. <a href="https://billypenn.com/2016/04/20/ex-pizza-brain-owner-help-me-show-the-world-how-weed-saved-my-infant-son/">https://billypenn.com/2016/04/20/ex-pizza-brain-owner-help-me-show-the-world-how-weed-saved-my-infant-son/</a> and here is the instagram to his pizza museum/restaurant, which is filled with lots of satanic/pedo symbolism <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mypizzabrain/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/mypizzabrain/?hl=en</a></p>
<p>Eric and Tim had a portrait done by Jill Greenberg. <a href="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/magazine/wp-content/images/17-11/ff_tim_eric_f.jpg">https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/magazine/wp-content/images/17-11/ff_tim_eric_f.jpg</a> If you don\'t recognize the artist\'s style, she is the one who was given crap for her 2006 Photos of children who seem to be crying in torture. It just so happens those same children from 2006 match the exact look of the Sandy Hook students who passed away. <a href="https://hunternewsandmedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-10-at-5-43-28-pm.png?w=620">https://hunternewsandmedia.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-10-at-5-43-28-pm.png?w=620</a> Here is a thread that was done about her. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/75vQerS.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/75vQerS.jpg</a>
I know I\'m going on a tangent here, and I may still write another post about this Jill Greenberg, but look at this pic I found on her instagram of kids at some party in a wooded area with a naked man posing right in front of them. <a href="http://archive.is/KpkXK">http://archive.is/KpkXK</a> I remember seeing that naked guy on the tree somewhere and after some digging I was able to find the exact man on another pic. <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/29/article-0-1B0D1648000005DC-229_634x489.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/29/article-0-1B0D1648000005DC-229_634x489.jpg</a>  Why do they allow kids at these satanic sexual type parties? Very disturbing.</p>
<p>One thing is certainly clear, the normalizing of pedophilia in the media can no longer be denied with crap like Tim and Eric being allowed. The media and the arts are becoming a conduit for these sick people to portray their fantasies. Lets just hope that to these guys, it goes nothing further than just comedy on screen. But as much as we continue to see hollywood and celebrities being involved in the trafficking of sex and sex with children, it wouldn\'t surpise me at all if this stuff goes beyond the screen.</p>',

           Oddly, an article was written about him about how giving his son weed, helped save his infant son.

           and here is the instagram to his pizza museum/restaurant, which is filled with lots of satanic/pedo symbolism

           Eric and Tim had a portrait done by Jill Greenberg.

           If you don't recognize the artist's style, she is the one who was given crap for her 2006 Photos of children who seem to be crying in torture. It just so happens those same children from 2006 match the exact look of the Sandy Hook students who passed away.

           Here is a thread that was done about her.

           I know I'm going on a tangent here, and I may still write another post about this Jill Greenberg, but look at this pic I found on her instagram of kids at some party in a wooded area with a naked man posing right in front of them.

           I remember seeing that naked guy on the tree somewhere and after some digging I was able to find the exact man on another pic.
           <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/29/article-0-1B0D1648000005DC-229_634x489.jpg">

           Why do they allow kids at these satanic sexual type parties? Very disturbing.
          </p>
          <p>
           One thing is certainly clear, the normalizing of pedophilia in the media can no longer be denied with crap like Tim and Eric being allowed. The media and the arts are becoming a conduit for these sick people to portray their fantasies. Lets just hope that to these guys, it goes nothing further than just comedy on screen. But as much as we continue to see hollywood and celebrities being involved in the trafficking of sex and sex with children, it wouldn't surpise me at all if this stuff goes beyond the screen.

           <p>
            I appreciate the very well stated post. For one, my intent was not political in the least bit. What you will mostly find here are concerned citizens who are worried about what has been discovered over the last few months with respect to #pizzagate/#pedogate. There has been some solid research done regarding pedogate. The lack of interest or action from local law enforcement regarding some of the findings, has caused concerned parents to result in using these boards to help each other uncover lots of information. It's been amazing to see some of the stuff uncovered and the effort of ordinary citizens, taking time to help each other, for the benefit of trying to help save children. While I never figured you guys were pedophiles, your material just stood out, given what has been uncovered recently with pizzagate. Dance instruction videos asking kids to get sexy, a grown man dreaming of watching adult sites with a young boy and feeding him a sausage, looking for "pizza" from a mancierge, renting children out for entertainment....can you see how that could kinda be concerning to a parent? But like you said, no laws broken, and most certainly no links to sex trafficking...so I have nothing but respect for you and your creative talent. I will even admit, I love the way some of ya'lls videos are edited.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do want to be clear though, the intent of my post was not to prove you are involved in sex trafficking or that you are a pedophile, rather, it was simply an observation made that helps support what many here see as a normalization of pedophilia through the media. I'd be happy take my post down if you'd like and if you think it is in any way damaging. Either way, I appreciate your honest and sincere post and I have a much higher level of respect for you actually taking time from your day to respond.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wish you guys continued success!

            i thiink you misunderstood me.  I'm saying OP did excellent work by tediously compiling all of this degenerate garbage and turning us on to it.  If you see one clip you think "awh they were just trying to shock us" but when you see just how much pedo shit T&amp;E has pushed, their nature becomes less ambiguous.

            Hey Tim,
My wife and I are looking forward to seeing you and Eric on tour this summer.   We are long time fans and hope you play Maralago.

            Unfortunately child abuse and trafficking is a horrible reality and MSN is not reporting on it.
            <br/>
            The amount of arrests this year alone are staggering.  Voat Pizzagate is a valuable tool in sharing and cataloging this information.
           </p>

            I wrote a song about the issue.  As a musician you may appreciate the chord progression.

            I'm sorry that some folks don't understand the artistic genius of your comedy.    You are true originals and trailblazers in the industry.
            <br/>
            I realize your art is harmless and hilarious and I think your statement to Vote perfectly made that point.  Thank you for sharing and if you were able to spread awareness to this issue it will be greatly appreciated.

            This is nothing but humor, a character of an actual pedophile being portrayed.. This shit is completely going off the rails, and turning into a twisted witch hunt, and also, this type of finger pointing, and demanding of censorship is what's truly sick here.

            Sam Hyde (who was blacklisted after Adult Swim ganged up on him, ended up airing only 6 episodes of his show Million Dollar Extreme..  For pissing them off with stuff like this:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgNDA_Z2H0U">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgNDA_Z2H0U
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Tim Heidecker of Tim and Eric, and Hyde also got into an argument about whether or not he helped take his show out:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/AOaFkndI9R4?t=57m51s">
             https://youtu.be/AOaFkndI9R4?t=57m51s
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Hyde has also come out talking about #pizzagate multiple times, like in part of this recent video:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/DAOM4rvivxE?t=4m22s">
             https://youtu.be/DAOM4rvivxE?t=4m22s
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Make sure to read the VERY small text at the bottom that appears with the Adult Swim bathroom footage.
           </p>
           <p>
            "this is straight up footage that we recorded in the adult swim bathroom because the walls were covered in sexualized fuckin preteens and toddler girls #pizzagate bathroom couldnt believe it this is real though"
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, last but not least, David Liebe Hart (who was a big part of Tim and Eric) has said that Tim and Eric are devil worshippers:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/r8SYLUx7KG8?t=9m11s">
             https://youtu.be/r8SYLUx7KG8?t=9m11s
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure there's more I forgot to add, hopefully something here is useful.

            This stuff is neither coincidental or harmlessly ironic, it's sick!  It is loaded with reference and relevance to specific child abuse methods and some of the narrative such as the Dad (Ferrel) foisting the business on his son and the death of his other who we can assume he murdered is very twisted.
           </p>
           <p>
            I watched a few to get the gist and this was enough tbh.  I cannot accept that these functioning and quite often intelligent people in the media don't see the depravity in this type of material, it's so brazenly obvious.  This begs the question, are these individuals not only complicit in the trivialising of paedophilia but directly participating in it?

            Worth checking out the band MGMT too.. Eric wareheim produced the music video for their song "The Youth".. weird video, weird lyrics, all suspect..
           </p>
           <p>
            The video for the song "Kids" by them is SUPER suspect too, especially the video showing the making of the music video, "age is just a number" at the end.. this is off topic from tim and eric tho.
           </p>
           <p>
            I admitttedly was a fan of SOME of tim and Eric's skits just because of how /random/ some of it was, but looking back at it, some of it was actually not so random and actually blatantly creepy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also worth mentioning, in the Tim and Eric movie, they literally just take a mans child and claim it as their own

             I laughed at the Brown's daycare skit before... but after seeing the full breadth of what T&amp;E has put out (the other videos I had not seen), plus the connection to pizza brain...  I wouldn't let these fucks near my children.

            Okay I really don't think tim and eric are secretly advertising pedophilia.. Their show has always had lots of weird-ass strange shit because that is what they like doing.. You are seeing the clown kids being mistreated like put in to cages and sprayed with poison and you are imagining them doing this to real children and forgetting it is a show and that it is not real..
           </p>
           <p>
            It is like the SJWs that complained about some japanese mangas having women that are in situations where they are hit or abused.. The japanese artists (many of whom were female them selves) told the SJWs that mangas are not real.. It is fiction..
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe there is a lot of secret pedophile stuff, and I support pizzagate, but some times I am annoyed when confirmation bias causes some pizzagaters to see pedophila every where.. Every once in a while it really is going to be a false alarm.. You don't have to think tim and eric are funny (actually their stuff is kind of lame most of the time IMO), and yeah this would be horrible IF they really did this to actual real children, but this just seems a bit like grasping for straws here..

             I don't know how you came to the idea/conclusion that the intent of this post is to suggest/accuse these assholes of
             <em>
              secretly advertising pedophilia
             </em>
             , or
             <em>
              imagining them doing this to real children.
             </em>
             The OP clearly says:
             <strong>
              <em>
               ONE THING
              </em>
             </strong>
             <em>
              is certainly clear, the
             </em>
             <strong>
              <em>
               normalizing of pedophilia in the media
              </em>
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The OP is 100% CORRECT in that statement.
             </strong>
             These examples of low-brow, childish, shit-entertainment are
             <strong>
              BASED on making mockery of pedophilia
             </strong>
             - using the ever-present
             <strong>
              safety net of
             </strong>
             <strong>
              <em>

              ARROGANTLY
             </strong>
             brushing-off, by
             <strong>
              RIDICULING
             </strong>
             ALL opposition, using ever-ready arguments like -

             </em>
             <strong>

              </em>
             </strong>
             , and get a sense of humor, you uptight assholes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't claim to
             <strong>
              know the intent
             </strong>
             , behind this kind of low-budget, low-brow, joking, but I can easily imagine the gut-punchingly-hurtful
             <strong>
              intimidation
             </strong>
             , and
             <strong>
              discouragement
             </strong>
             , this shit causes to victims of child abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              NO
             </strong>
             references to SEXUALLY ABUSING CHILDREN, or abusing children at all, should ever be made into fodder for JOKES. Adult entertainers KNOW THAT, Yet, they keep producing this shit, on juvenile humor websites, and it's profusely bleeding into mainstream network TV, primetime family entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why they do this, I don't know. The obvious answer is "for the money," but I don't think so. I think it's for the
             <strong>
              status
             </strong>
             of going with "the program."

            I don't know about this. T&amp;E are surrealist, twisted, ludicrous humor designed to be disturbing. Not everything is a thing. You've done well making connections though and I'm not saying there's nothing here. I do know that Tim has turned into a real douche though with his anti Trump shit and general liberal faggotry.

             I came into this thread thinking I would find nonsense bullshit... but honestly this raises questions for me.  It is blatant glorification of pedos through humor.  Even if it is coincidental and they are just going after shock value, it is still messed up.  Add to that the connection to pizza brain and it just gets more creepy.

            Eric Wareheim has dead eyes and is creepy af. That clown skit is so specific, it's got to be based off something real. The greenberg and pizza brain connections are pretty damning
