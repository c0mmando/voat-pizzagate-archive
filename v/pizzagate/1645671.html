Then I realized, I would not be at all surprised if at some point david turned on trump to make us rebel against him. I did not mention any of this previously because it was speculation.

Trump is still the same man holding up to his campaign promises, like him or hate him, he is sticking to his word.

This david seaman is clearly a shill, to make trump seem despicable. I will press on with the hope that justice will be served but it cannot be done overnight. If david seaman is not a shill then he is hardly a loyal person to turn on someone so quickly when they\'ve done nothing but hold their promises.</p>',

            Please tell me where you're getting "paid shill" from what I wrote. Will you do me that favor? If you can't then that makes YOU THE ONLY SHILL in this conversation.

             Yes, I think so.  What confirmed it for me is that someone on another thread said he's pushing Goldmoney which according to wiki:  "
             <em>
              Goldmoney Inc has its headquarters located in Toronto Canada and in Saint Helier Jersey.[6] The company is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and has a market capitalization of $312 million as of February 27, 2016. GoldMoney Inc. investors and backers include Eric Sprott, Albert D. Friedberg, George Soros, Adam Fleming, and Canadian Banks Canaccord Genuity
             </em>
             ."
            </p>
            <p>
             Canaccord I know is linked to Giustra, Bill's buddy.  And there's Soros. That flight from Huff Post was a total scam.

               I was thinking about posting more about him but decided not to.  He's doing a fine job outing himself on his own.  I think most people are starting to take a second look.  That's good because he was trying to incite protests outside of CPP and calling for hangings and other crazy stuff.  He's trying very hard to give Brock's crowd ammunition against us.  But I don't think he's going to be able to do that after all.  Clinton and her squad are running out of time.  That's my feeling.
              </p>

               Edit :  I also think the voat community here is more powerful and influential than it realizes.

            Nothing wrong with being critical of Trump. Being critical of anyone in that position is a smart way to be and when you are dealing with the truth there is no partisanship. Not to mention it would be good for pizzagate to step away from Trump supporters because you know the media is just going to use it against us. Trump is only a man and to think he can face off with the Rothschilds/deep state and win/not get compromised(through threats or bribes) is just naive. I'm actually starting to gain some respect back for Seaman tbh. Mark my words, we make this thing partisan we will all lose.

            "over a month ago by".......Do you know why he put me on his shill list? Someone posted a picture of a google ad with a piece of pizza on it and was wondering if they should go into all the pizza parlors in their immediate area looking for pedophiles.

            I suggested they might be overreacting. Armyseer thought I was too harsh and sarcastic, only a shill would do that. He's probably barely literate and reads at the 8th grade level so he's never read The Crucible by Henry Miller. You know the whole Salem Witch Trial thing. You know about the Salem Witch Trial thing don't you GonnaNeedMorePrisons?

            Please tell me you know about the Salem Witch Trial thing so I don't have to break out my crayons and explain to you if Pizzagate was associated with the Salem Witch Trial thing it would lose the last tiny bit of credibility it has left.

            He is an ATTENTION WHORE.  All of his videos are fluff, just talking points appealing to the emotional nature.  He played nearly everyone and now people are waking up to this nut bag.

             I just read through all his tweets.  He's now calling for people to go protest outside Comet Ping Pong. He's absolutely raging like a lunatic.  I'm beginning to wonder who exactly hired him...I now really have suspicions.  His behaviour is not normal.

            I have thought that Trump could be controlled opposition all along...I don't blame him for questioning that as well. In fact, for a while I was pestering David Seaman on Twitter about his loyalty to Trump, asking if he had fully researched the man and checked himself for bias. I think this is a sign of an objective reasoning in his mind, not shillery.

             Yes, being objective on trump is a thing. But, Trump is enacting policies that he campaigned on. I don't agree with everything he says, but nearly all of it is a positive thing. On the other hand, you have david seaman raising questionable arguments and outlandish information while talking about the realities of pizzagate. Do you understand how shit that makes this entire community look? His shaky loyalty is also noteworthy after only a month of trump in office, a week of jeff sessions and still not all of his nominees confirmed yet.

            Jesus, look at the responses from Seaman's followers. They actually trust Seaman more than Trump. His whole following eerily similar to a cult.

            People like him are always there for smoke and mirrors.  To confuse the issue.  To add seeds of doubt and dissent to a community. (He may even have been a useful but unknowing pawn for all I know.) He was always great at "buzz" but clearly had no real interest in research. He's still going on about the same CPP issues that we spoke about in the first weeks.  No sense or interest at all in how much the research documentation has moved on.  It's Divide and Conquer 101 as far as I'm concerned.  Back to my digging. Eyes on the prize.

            we, those who investigated and posted every little detail we could find, were a useful tool for LEA.

           <p>
            there are things that they cannot do without warrants, but when citizens shake the tree and the nuts fall out and the squirrels go running -  LEA can watch and take notes.
           </p>
           <p>
            we shook the tree hard, and now they're picking up the nuts.  they aren't going to tell us what they're doing, or how they used
            <em>
             any
            </em>
            of what we found, they aren't going to legitimize any single theory or lead...this makes us feel like our "work" was for naught - but i'm convinced that it was not, and all the little shill-shitstorms we encountered were (and still are) an indication that we found useful bits.

            Seaman is a manifestation of that frustration, and it's ok.
           </p>
           <p>
            if you think there's still info to dig out (and there is) then find it and post it.  don't worry about commenters, don't worry about nay-sayers.  find it and post it.

            dig until you don't want to dig any more, for the kids, for yourselves.

             Absolutely agree.  And the other thing this investigation has done is greatly increased our understanding of the system.  So, whenever an arrest happens, or a statement is made by a politician or police officer, one can quickly assess whether there is more to a story and know where to go to get the real connections that lie beneath the surface.  We don't have to wait 5 or 10 years anymore to get a grasp on a situation.  We can now very quickly call out our public figures.  And they know it.  Remember a war consists of a series of battles.  Not every battle needs to be won in order to win the war.

            The Sandusky arrest may be bigger than we know.  Penn State was protected.  And Seaman seems earnest and genuine, just misguided at times.  He is under a lot of stress.  I'll wait to see if I hear him doubt a Trump.  No one really knows what is going on yet with a Trump but he is better than Clinton and Kaine.  We can't forget.

             My guess is that Seaman was hired for his ability to make a lot of "noise".  He may even be genuinely confused himself, the poor lad.  This fight we are in is complex.  Don't listen to the noisiest.  Just get on with research or communicating new evidence, or whatever your personal bag is.  We will win this fight.

            That's what I'm starting to think as well. It's tough to say. I still trust David though for now. He's done some great stuff, he held the light up, he was the voice in the wilderness when a lot of people were silent.

            But here's the inconvenient truth, when the Clinton Foundation gang rape of Haiti goes viral they won't be able to buy off 100,000,000 extremely irate and pissed of Americans who, sigh.........., think screwing over poor destitute black people is wrong.

            It's not only wrong, it's really really reallllllly fucking wrong.

            It's too late for this thing to stop, too many people are looking at this now. They can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.
