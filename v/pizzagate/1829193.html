            How are you sure they are not linked? I see they don't list Dyncorp or Gen Grazioplene, but seems a big coincidence if they are not linked in some way.

            also, I find it funny that with Micheal Obama's shitty school lunch program the last 8 years there are still obese children... guess her program was a pile of bull shit.
