            George's latest video, with a very direct queston to Steve Pieczenik, was posted here... but was then removed. George is really pushing the envelope. I pray for his safety.

            "changed his name from Michael Joseph Ryan to Stephen Rogata".......You only see this if a kid is ashamed of one or both parents. And you don't have to look far for an example you've all heard of. Bill de Blasio is one example. His real name is Bill Wilhelm. He changed it to his mother's maiden name de Blasio because his father was an abusive alcoholic that had abandoned his family. Bill de Blasio changing his name is totally understandable if you ask me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll leave it at that. But I'll say after the extremely disturbing events uncovered so far in this sordid shit show I'd believe just about anything at this point.

He works at a plant nursery, she said.
