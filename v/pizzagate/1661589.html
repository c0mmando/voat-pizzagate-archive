             Ginsburg wrote on p. 102 of Sex Bias in the U.S. Code:
*
Eliminate the phrase ‘carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of 16 years’ and substitute a federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense . . . . A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, . . . [and] the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.*

              This is a load of shit.    This tortured argument came up about a decade ago and it soon found to be false.
             </p>
             <p>
              The paper Ginsburg wrote was SOLELY concerned about writing laws with gender neutral langauage. She was not writing about age of consent laws whatsoever and was not advocating about age of consent laws one way or the other.   That section she was quoting a bill that was up for vote in the Congress.  She did not write that language in the bill.
             </p>

              That part of the bill she was quoting WAS NOT about making it legal for an adult to have sex with a 12 year old.  It was about not turning 15 year old kids into criminals.  It was basically saying statutory rape charges would not apply to you if you were under 16 UNLESS, it was with someone less than 12 years old.  This is sometimes called a Romeo and Juliet law.            And to be clear the only thing Ginsburg was concerned with was the gender.  You could read the original law as only applying to females, that boys could not be raped.

              Yeah just a coincidence most of the pizzagate perpetrators are Jews. A slur would have been kike or heeb. I'm just calling it how it is.

            I had a really strange feeling during the confirmation, hard to explain but something just didn't sit right.  Same with the DHS Sec with Bush Jr.  It was not what they said so much as body language that creeped me!

            Kagan lied to the Senate when she was vetted, since she CLEARLY supported Obamacare (disclosed it in an email). Kagan's subsequent ruling on Obamacare, when she clearly should have recused herself, was, and still IS, grounds for immediate impeachment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I knew something was up when she was allowed to skate when this was all so obvious. This may be what was behind it all. But I am starting to think there are probably enough GOP senators bound to the Secrecy to keep either of these (rejecting her nomination or impeachment) from happening. We are probably at the tip of the iceberg with this whole thing.

            These appointees and those who appointed them need to be exposed HUGELY as the traitors that they are. Is there no one in a position of authority who can build a case? This is beyond sad, and sadder still that nothing is done about it. Great contribution though-  illustrates yet again the rot at the top.

             Well Reagan picking GHW Bush was not a brainy choice either. Head of the CIA and Cheney was no angel either.  Bush chose Clarence Thomas who  should have been charged with sexual abuse against Anita Hill.  That trial was a farce.  None of them have really made great choices for this country or us as of late.  They all have only padded their bank accounts and their fellow elites and supplied children for their perverted sexual life style.

              I've looked into Clarence Thomas and I'm very certain that he was railroaded.

              I do agree that Bush 41 and Cheney are pure evil as well.  Hard to tell if Bush 43 is just a useful idiot controlled by Cheney, or if he is in on the NWO agenda.  I lean toward the latter.

               Cathy O'Brien said the grandfather Prescott Bush sodomized GHWBush until he died.  All about the power he had over his son.  The are all as evil and sick as hell.  I believe GW Bush is MK Ultra, that is the explanation of the dazed look on his face while reading to those kids during 911,  All Pres. since Kennedy are involved in this sick plan and take over.

             Elena Kagan, supposedly a Harvard law professor, who never tried a case or set foot in a courtroom, gets to be life long justice of the highest ruling court in the land. Okay.
            </p>
            <p>
             The name Kagan, short for Kaganovich, should give anyone pause.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think of Kaganovich, Stalin's Jewish brother in law and the one responsible for the Ukrainian genocide (Holodomor) 30 million+ , including children.
            </p>
            <p>
             During that real holocaust that you don't learn about in school, children were literally sacrificed to a statue of Moloch and burned alive.
            </p>
            <p>
             See the Swedish film, In the Shadow of Hermes, (English subs)--- a real eye opener:

             this might give you an idea of the kind of country they want.
            </p>
            <p>
             Victoria Nuland (real name Nudelman), facilitator of the coup in Ukraine under Obama, is married to Robert Kagan who is head of the "War College". Tell me again, what is a War College exactly? Robert Kagan is one of the neocons CFR guys who planned 9/11, though "he prefers to call himself a 'liberal interventionist'"--(form his Wikipedia entry:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kagan
            </p>
            <p>
             Ginsburg, Kagan, Sotomayor(crypto), Breyer, Roberts(through his mother) all belong to a group which comprises less than 2% of the American population--nice to know how Americans are represented in that branch of govt. If Obama's pick, Merrick Garland, who is a federal judge, had got in, it would have been a  record for sure.

              Nice!!! But can the US masses ever awake to the truth? 
PS Gentile supreme court justices are selected by the same criteria they used for selecting Dennis Hasterd. Justice Scalia is rumored to have been involved with pedophilia! (Mysterious death yet again. - Dead men don't talk)

               To answer your question: it will be more difficult now due to heavy internet censorship, and Amazon's book burning, together with the fact that people can graduate high school with zero knowledge of real history, physics, or an ability to think for themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               The "hunting ranch" where Scalia was found with a pillow over his head is a spooky, private club. God knows what goes on there. A lawyer, not a coroner or physician, announced by phone without any physical observation, that Scalia had died of natural causes. No autopsy.

2) Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution
3)Wall Street and FDR

                    Awesome, read them except 'Blood Passover.' 
Question is, how to read pill the masses. Even my girlfriend doesn't want hear about it. Here in Australia it was a national mourning day when Hillary lost - Sydney is more pro Hillary than NY. I tried to explain the fallacy of the left-right paradigm - they look at me wide eyed as if I was telling them about UFO. If you mention Pizzagate it is dismissed as a right wing conspiracy pushed by Trump supporters. To quote Trump himself Sad! 
On the bright side - Dr Phill episode seems to have red pilled huge number of women - when a celebrity tells you it's real than it must be real. 
So my hat off to Phill.

                     I am glad to hear from someone who is in the know. If you read Blood Passover, which was written not only by an Israeli history professor, but he is the son of the former chief Rabbi of Rome, you will see where pizzagate and cannibalism tie in. Once you learn real history, it all makes sense though it is terrible.

                     Yes, the celebrity culture may have backfired on them with the airing of the Dr. Phil show on human trafficking, but then look at the Oprah show with that woman(victim) explaining all these horrors--and then nothing happened--even though there are still clips on YouTube:

                     Maybe the distraction of WWIII will finally get people's attention.

                     I wish I knew how to red pill people, but when I have succeeded, I can tell you it was done slowly and by not telling them what i think, just showing facts backed up by good documentation.

                      Peekay rocks! One thing that devil (allegory) is afraid of is mockery - and Peekay seems to have hit the nerve. Whenever new false flag attack breaks - I check with Peekay. His coverage of the Lauderdale Airport hoax was priceless. I have to check with the laresrt Stockholm hoax - I can't keep up.

                       One of best things about Peekay is that he is the honest, regular guy. He is aware of the big picture, but is humble in his approach, with his fantastic humor, which makes him more dangerous to TPTB.

                       He was picked up by the cops illegally and tormented and had his family threatened too, when he exposed the Melbourne donut hoax.

                       Glad to hear it, George. Peekay has certainly found his niche and is amazingly courageous. I first learned about him through his incomparable work on the Boston Hoaxathon.

                       Remember, Voltaire did a lot of damage to the Roman Catholic Church mafia with humor. That's one reason why Catherine the Great corresponded with him. In the Orthodox Christian East, they always knew the Roman Catholic Church was a creation of international bankers who wanted to destroy the Byzantine Empire and re-write real history.

                         The Latin (Roman Catholic) Church which dominates the west was created by one of the first known international banking cartels in 1054, when it broke completely away from the original (and still here) Orthodox Christian Church. This was so the Templars (all of them crypto Jews) could launch the crusades, including the one against the Orthodox Christian Church. There have been 150 Jewish popes, Loyola-- founder of the Jesuits was a Jew, as was Torquemada (the Inquisition), and Savonarola(wealth confiscation and "bonfire of the vanities).

                        <p>
                         the Latin church is so new, it is younger than the Russian Orthodox Church which had it's millennial celebration in 1988.

                         The Catholics were still castrating boys (ostensibly to sing soprano in their choirs) until recently--there is even a recording a famous castrato. Pope Innocent VIII had his Jewish doctors drain the blood from three gentile ten year old boys for him to drink as a "cure". It didn't work. His  last words were "I'm surrounded by flames" .

                         And remember: the Medici were the Rothschilds of their day. The so called "renaissance" was really just the result of the plunder of Constantinople of it's treasures in 1453. The Vatican Library did not exist until 1457 and it still has almost all of the loot. The polish Jew Pope returned a couple of token relics to the Patriarch of Constantinople.

                         Freemasonry is an entirely Jewish invention so that they could have a base of operations all over the world to foment revolution and mayhem and have a shabbos goy army work for them (the lower level degrees). Of course they have their own all Jewish branch--B'nai B'rith (the Mossad and JDL of the Freemasons.

                          And the blood sacrifice myths were discovered to be true - Saint Simon of Trento - a two year old boy, butchered by rabi discovered by authorities. My grandma told about the rumors of christian children's blood sacrifice to Moloch. Now I know what she meant. No wonder the Media Is covering up for them. I have a book by Roger Peyrfitte 'The Jews' that exposes all the truth, how entire pope history is jewish. And how Nazi party in Getmany was in fact a AshkeNazi - pro Israel Zionst party who were at war with followers of Torah - Orthodox jews who don't believe in a state of Israel. Very few know that Israel wanted to build a statue to its most famous founding member - Adolph Hitler - Illegitimate son of the Rotchild (book - Hitler was a Secret Agent). Further more, Nazi party (zionist) was a homosexual order. Founder of Hitler's Youth was a serial pedophile who molested 100's of boys. And here is the clincher - all those maniacs who funded the Nazi party are funding Globalization and all the Nazi deranged maniacs were funneled into USA via Operation Paperclip (Mainstream Discovery Channel) and were put in charge of CIA (Reinhat Ghelen), NASA (Von Braun - military arm!) , MK Ultra - Joseph Mengele (Did work in Argentina - secretly)... etc... Of course Alister Crowley's Thelema permiates everywhere. And add all the cesspool of quasi satanic orders that run every single major institutions - it brings us to that Pizza Parlor!!!! So according to MSM and CNN, Pizzagate was about Hillary trafficking children from a basement of a pizza parlor! Fallacy!
BTW - Trump and Clinton are friends, election was nothing but WWE spectacke. Donald Trump's name shows up in Jeffrey Epstein's black book. (It's a light weight under age girls stuff - not murdering toddlers!!!! Mr Ping Pong manages those maniacs! But it's enough dirt to keep Donald walking on eggshells) You think the Shadow Government would pick a 'clean' guy?. Trump had aquired Resorts International in the 80's a Hotel Casino that was a money laundering front run by the Rotchilds and managed by Mossad/CIA asset Bill Crosby. All documented - Spotlight Article 1978. Americans better shine light on Trump and call him out on everything since he is not about draining swamps. But arresting low level pedophiles (3000 &amp; counting) is a start. We have to keep raising public awareness - remember, Hillary chose Trump to run against her but Wikileaks Pizzagate revelations was a too huge a risk for the incomming president (Hillary) to have as a burden - and Deep State switched their choice and gave it to Trump - that is why Hillary was devastated. (Remember that MSM 2013 piece about Hillary covering up for Pedophiles?) The risk was too great to have a pedo enabler as president in case the news broke out. But again, Trump does bidding for his Zionist masters - he is might be lesser of the two evils but not by much - look at him do 180 on Syria - boosting stock prices of Locheed Martin and Ratheyon! Exposing that giant pedophile ring is the only way to dismantle the order and bring sanity to the western world. As it stands, serial pedophiles literally run the world. Long road agead. Guys like you and I who have the knowledge have the moral obligation to inform those who do not possess knowledge.

                                I got the info about 2016 elections. Apparently Bill Clinton phoned Trump on behalf of Hillary asking if he would run against Hillary as a controlled opposition. (All documented) What ensued was nothing short of WWE - until the Pizzagate emails and Weiner's laptop - Danger of president elect (Hillary) being tied to child trafficking was too real and the deep state did a swerve (WWE term) and gave it to Trump ( he was way ahead of Hillary) that was why Hillary was devastated. But remember, If Donald doesn't expose the pedo elites he will be cornered to go down the Bush, Obama path - more wars, more banker bail outs, more police state. Making way for greater Israel.

            I honestly believe that any Justice since Kennedy is likely to have some blackmailable offense on their record.  And since being gay or having affairs wont be bad enough anymore........molesting kids and sacrificing them to Moloch has taken that place.
