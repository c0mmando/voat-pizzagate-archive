<h1>Voat is being maliciously attacked (CHECK FOR UPDATES)</h1>
<h2>Edit 4:</h2>
<p>As many of you know already Voat is still being attacked, but in many different ways. We now believe this is related to Voat not taking down material without a court order.</p>
<h2>Edit 3:</h2>
<p>We are still being sent high amounts of traffic. For the time being let\'s just be happy we have remained online throughout this assault. Sorry about the thumbnails (text only Voat is so 1990s).</p>

<p><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/457c545a9d/48574.PNG">DDOS Inflow</a></p>
<h2>Edit 2:</h2>
<p>This attack is relentless and dynamic. They have found holes in our system and hit us where we never expected. This has forced us to reconfigure our network and site behavior to prevent repeat attacks.</p>
<p>Voat has been put into &quot;lockdown&quot; mode so things like thumbnail generation are disabled.</p>
<h2>Edit:</h2>
<p>These guys are actually fairly creative. We might have a worthy opponent here. Buckle up Voat.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of the reasons yesterday\'s attempt at rolling forward the port code failed was that Voat was being sent DDOS style requests in very large numbers. <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/2164700">See yesterdays announcement about this topic.</a></p>
<p>Voat is at a stage now that the code can somewhat deal with this without capitulating. Usually these attacks only last 10-12 hours, but this current run has been longer in duration than normal so we are now informing the community that we are actually being maliciously targeted. </p>
<p>Below are some interesting graphs showing some stat data:</p>

<p>I\'ll provide more info when we have it, but PG.</p>
<p>Until then, enjoy having your bits closely inspected. Please don\'t be shy about it either, just go with it. This includes the ladies as well... ;)</p>

            OK, happened to me before here. Tonight it was weird. I clicked on the white supremacy thing and then it would not let me back here. So, in conclusion, everything on voat can and will be used against you in court? This is a planned attack. I do not go to other sites on voat. Hard to call me a white supremacist, because I am 1'rst Nation. I think these attacks are targeted on individuals. I am all over the place, and my speciality is making certain people extremely mad. Rez Dogs done strayed from the REZ,,yall.

             Yog, glad you are here, man. I've watched Putt and those helping him keep Voat afloat for months and I honestly do not think Voat is collaborating with corruption. The whole point of the port was to make it cheap enough to run that Voat would never have to rely on angel investors but could subsist on donations. I trust

             and crew.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frankly, given the persistant, multi-faceted nature of the ongoing attack (almost a month now!), it's amazing the site functions at all. They've had to disable multiple features to prevent them from being exploited. The lagging and log outs are necessary at the moment.

             Whenever Brock runs out of money, I guess. :-)

             Did you see that the new tax plan cuts Federal deductions for state and local taxes? What that means in practical terms is that lib states like California will be forced to lower taxes, because folks won't be able to afford to live there anymore, they'll be taxed at such a high rate between all the different governments taking a cut. Once the free $ inflow is choked to a trickle, we should see a lot less of this kind of BS.

            The biggest threat to Voat are the pedo-mods like Vindicator and MF and the likes of "abortionburger" before. It's an inside job.

             That and every other evil things in the works that the sick fuck can think of. Can you imagine if we had some billionaire with endless amounts of money that actually worked to fight the globalists and do good for the country? They would probably be killed off quick.

            I assume they are using bot armies. Honestly, theres' only about a dozen players that can do this. Most of em are 3 letter agencies.

            Attack against free speech in America? Yeah, thats a treason cookie. And while they might not get caught in this lifetime, Justice is a constant in this universe. Karma will condemn these people to their own hell.

             Yes.  I agree, but in the meantime they are creating a Hell for us.  What about calling this  idiots out on blogs, twitter, you name it.  Spread the word that we are being attacked and that even if people don't get our cause, it is still an attack on our free speech.
