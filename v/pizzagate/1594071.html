If there are any leads which can be traced back to the LGBT-movement they should be followed up, no question about that. Posts and threads which attack a certain group, like gays in this example, and call them out for &quot;encouraging degeneracy&quot; and &quot;increasing negative energy&quot; will only provide more fuel to the enemies of the investigation. It makes the issue a partisan one while in fact it is about exposing illegal practices and saving childrens lives (at least that\'s what I thought).
Same goes with the jews: One can discuss certain rituals or groups involved in Judaism who have ties to the CF or are connected to this investigation in any other ways. Addressing &quot;the jews&quot; as the source of all evil on the other hand is again providing fuel for the enemies of this investigation and making it a partisan one.</p>
<p>I am not saying that certain leads should be ignored. I just think this investigation should be based on facts and connections and people or groups should be discussed here based on their involvement with Pizzagate only.

            Yes!! No hate please. We are trying to reach out together and reach as many ppl possible for the greater good. The trafficking/pedophilia epidemic crosses party lines, gender lines, religious lines, sexuality lines and pretty much any line I can think of. Please don't push ppl away from this cause even if you have some differences in opinions.

            Until the LGBT community takes a stand against the chicken hawking that is so prevalent and pervasive within their own ranks, they'll all have to be looked at in askance.

             What do you mean by "they"? Gay people in general or the LGBT community? 
Exactly this is a problem I feel. It could very well be that there are people in the LGBT community being okay with pedophilia. But to condemn homosexual people as such is a different story altogether. Similarly just because there are girl-loving men doesn't mean, all heterosexual men have to be looked at in askance.

              They celebrate chicken hawking. I mean, when you have the top gays like Elton John having boys dressed up like boy scouts doing a sexual bump and grind at his birthday party and NO ONE objects, then that community as a whole has a problem.
