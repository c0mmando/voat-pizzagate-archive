<p>We should be very skeptical and cautious related to the truth in Syria. The LSM, which is normally pacifist in their tendencies, NEVER pushed Obama to war with Syria despite his &quot;red line&quot; and MULTIPLE chemical attacks on civilians while he was in office. Now the LSM and those we suspect as being complicit in PedoGate (certain Dems and Republicans like McCain, Graham) are absolutely pushing for Trump to take action and go to war with Syria. They are claiming inaction would mean weakness and implies collusion with his Russian allies. They have no concern that this could escalate into WWIII. They don\'t seem to recall that Obama touted that he had managed to rid Syria of its chemical weapons without dropping a bomb: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria%27s_chemical_weapons">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria%27s_chemical_weapons</a>. NOTE: The Wikipedia page on this topic was edited on 2/26/17 (footnote #20) to potentially pin the chlorine attack on Syria while maintaining the story line that Obama had successfully removed chemicals from Syria. Chlorine is easily obtained by terrorists...not needing a state sponsor, unlike more esoteric chemicals such as ricin or sarin gas.</p>
<p><strong>Big Picture:</strong> This looks like a massive false flag (start with framing Syria for killing civilians with chemicals to initiate a war that escalates to include Russia) as a means to take effort/focus away from what we are finding, and get back on track with the globalist NWO agenda. After all, we need a crisis to move things forward and divert attention away from #PizzaGate/#PedoGate.</p>',

            No, they are pushing for war with Syria because our finnancial system is coming down and they need to control resource rich middle eastern countries.. I have been following this for years. The reason we attack Middle Eastern countries is because we are so deep in debt, that people are dumping the US dollar. They combat this in two ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            One, they invade every oil producing country that refuses to only take the US dollar in exchange for oil. If they can secure this agreement, every country must first trade their currency for US dollars, then buy oil. This keeps the dollar in demand and keeps it from being dumped. Syria refuses this arangement so the US has continually fabircated charges against Asad, and saying in the name if humanity, they must replace him.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second way they prop up the doomed petro dollar is by illegally supressing precious metals on the COMEX and London Metals exchange by having the banks trade phony gold contracts back and forth and call it a "lease". They don't even have the gold they say they are leasing in the contract, but as it is a lease, they just credit it with being a lease with no delivery. This drops the price. The reason they do this is because when gold and silver go up, the dollar drops. So they supress metals with paper contracts representing metals they don't even have, certainly not in the amount they dump. This is know fraud but the banks control the wall street regulators like the Banks control the alphabet agencies. This reason the CIA set up a revolt in Libya and ousted Gaddafi is because not only did he refuse to take only the US dollar in exchange for oil, he wanted gold for oil. A double whammy. They demonized him and ousted him with record speed and the Clinton Foundation was involved in his ouster.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their is another reason. It looks like the finnancial system is failing and has been dying for years. They have covered this up by printing money and buying stocks to create an illusion that the market is healthy because people have all this money and are investing hand over fist. It is a lie. World central banks are printing and buying our stocks by the 100's of billions.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also lie about the economy, lie about the unemployment rate, hide that we have a housing and auto bubble, and speak softly about the bankruptcies that are starting to steadily pop up.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they can fabricate a major world war, they can escape blame that they have caused the contries demise by piling up debt and spending like there are no consequences. They can blame inflation, food and fuel shortages on a war that took it's toll. The truth is, war or not, we cannot and are not willing to pay off a cent of our debt, and the intrest payments we pay are eating up the majority of our budget. We are trapped and violence is always are answer. So we resort to murder and lies, and most of you had no idea this is going and and was being predicted by the truth community as something that will likely begin in 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            No, PG is not likely the reason for this war they are going to start.

             Can't look now, but thank you for sharing. I think he did the strikes to eliminate some of the noise around Russia and is actually working the back-rooms with Russia to try to take down ISIS in Syria. Part of this may have been to send the message to Assad to let us set up safe zones in Syria to stem the refugees. This is what I think is the case, but it is hopeful.

              You are behind. We are arming and funding ISIS. They work for us. They are the so called "moderate rebels" attacking Asad. There is no civil war. We have created a conclict and unleashed the terroist on Syria. They are our proxy army and now we have US troops there as well. Russia and Syria destroys them, we fund and arm them.

            Excellent  post-Syria  is  indeed a  distraction  from  the  ELITE  PEDOPHILE RING investigation, Trump has shown  his  true  colors (what's  the  color for fraud, murder, lying and  cowardice???)
which  is why  we  need  to  ramp  it up; I suggest  we start pushing for  everyone  to get  informed and pass  out  pamphlets  on  the  street to  other  citizens-if the  bastards in the  WH won't do their damned duty by GOD we will do  it  ourselves

             Hold out some hope as Trump may be doing a head fake to the media. I see three possibilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              He did not recognize this for what it was (false flag). I find this highly unlikely given all that has come out already, plus he had insiders saying the same (e.g., Flynn).
             </li>
             <li>
              He did the strikes to eliminate some of the noise around Russia and is actually working the back-rooms with Russia to try to take down ISIS in Syria. Part of this may have been to send the message to Assad to let us set up safe zones in Syria to stem the refugees. This is what I think is the case, but it is hopeful.
             </li>
             <li>
              He is part of the cabal, option #2...either by design or somehow co-opted. I actually do not believe this and would be hugely disappointed.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Time will tell, but we should get indicators soon on which option is correct.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope I am right, but if wrong, we will not stop our work and pressure.

             I would be frustrated too. I saw your post, which is a good find. Look at the reason, and it is likely the need to link to pizzagate. They get anal about it, and I think they are trying to do their best, but it can be confusing and inconsistent. You could repost and link to my post, saying that it is further evidence of the false flag meant to distract away from the effort to bring down the pedo ring. Good luck, and thank you for sharing.

            I really do hope I am wrong here, I really do hope that Trump is a good guy. But it’s all becoming much clearer, the elites have been losing control of the general population for quite some time now, too many people around the world are waking up. They needed to do something that would stop this from happening, they know if too many wake up it’s over for them. The best way for them to do this was to give the people already awake a new leader, someone they think is on their side, the best thing to do would be to bring in someone that appears on the outside to be different, to be against the controlling elite’s, to wage war on the media, to get the awake and the conspiracy theorist back in line and back to sleep. The clever part is, the elites have kept this top secret, nobody knows about their cunning plan, even most of their own guys have been kept completely in the dark, the media have not been told the truth, the media and most in government truly believe trump is going to take them down. The people in control needed to throw enough of their own people under the bus to make it all seem genuine. They are clearing out all the dead wood, Trump is their new inside man. Trump is being controlled by the elite’s, they are ready to promote trump as the saviour of the world. The media will be told when the time is right what is going on and they will rally around Trump, promoting him and making him to be the new king of the people. Gradually with the media behind him and America becoming a better place, everyone will be swayed and admit they were wrong about Trump. America really is becoming great again. The elite’s will have regained control of the population and will now be able to finish off what they started. The new world order will be finally born. A world of complete evil owned and controlled by handful of elite families, this time the people allowing it all to happen. By the time the masses work out the true plan, it will be all too late.

             You may be right, but I hope you're wrong. There's strong support that Trump is on the right side of this, but you and I are both operating with many assumptions and filters. Clarity should come soon as the Syria situation will reveal a lot in coming days.

             Yep...many motives, all bad. When LSM is universally calling for war, that is what I call a "tip off." I still think Trump gets it, with last night's bombings being a head fake. If we see him cooperating with Russia to rid the chemicals, which he knows came from the opposition in a frame up, this will be good confirmation.

            That Assad deployed chemical weapons is laughable, he'd stand to gain nothing, could have repressed some rebels in a town using traditional force, and would have lined himself up to be the next gyy hung in a kangaroo court like Saddam. This has the CIA's fingerprints all over it. no evidence to support that it was Assad, just the insistence of the CIA shills and MSM plants. Then, bam, actual missile strikes by trump today!? Suffice to say I'm not holding my breath for this guy to bust any high ranking pedophiles anymore. He's Hilary in a toupee.

            possibly that is a bonus. The Qatar/Turky pipeline is still a major goal, and Nehunetu is frothing at the mouth to quietly annex the Golan heights.

           <p>
            and plus all the taxpayer money going to buying bullets and bombs are a bonus also.....there are many, many reasons. and yes what you suggest is very likely one

            From another voyager who just died mysteriously: "Master LL Quant Dual is the name of a UBS client which shared the same postal address as LMR’s office but had a different and unusual name. I discovered trade contracts in the name of Master LL Quant Dual, counterparty UBS bank, in the scans folder of the shared drive, signed by Shane Cullinane. Therefore the claim that Shane Cullinane was not familiar with this entity is clearly a deliberate false statement. I strongly suspect that these contracts are not legitimate trades but may be US dollar payments disguised as trades in exotic currency derivatives, specifically “Non Deliverable Forward” contracts. The existence of all the trading in these instruments was kept secret from me during my time at the firm and these contracts contributed to our profits whilst not being factored into the risk and positions. I know this absolutely for certain as I wrote the bespoke system (referred to elsewhere in the proceedings as Risk Ninja) that calculated all of these. For these trades to exist in secret from me was a strong indication that they were not legitimate. When I investigated the contractual terms and how the market operated in great detail, I became quite convinced that these signed scans were evidence of money laundering on a large scale. There were dozens of these trade contracts in the scans folder with the contracts signed by Shane Cullinane; some on behalf of Master LL Quant Dual and others on behalf of LMR. 160. I was asked to represent a list of the currencies associated with these trades as US dollar in our bespoke system formerly known as Risk Ninja. The system calculated P&amp;L, positions and risk at a position level and across trading books. I can say with total certainty that the currency positions created by the trades in Non Deliverable Forward contributed to the profits, but were not accounted for in positions (they showed up as USD cash) or in the risk, where they were also treated as USD cash. At the time I was told that the repeated appearance of obscure currency positions, for example in Korean Won, was due to a bug in the upstream Sophis system and that actually these should be shown as being US dollars. I do not mean that a currency conversion took place at a conversion rate between the two currencies; I mean that a position of 1 million KRW from the upstream system would be treated as 1 million USD by Risk Ninja. To users of the system they would never see these positions except as USD cash. This was the case for all the currencies that were being traded in these contracts, but the existence of this trading was kept entirely secret from me. I do not believe that the trades that I have seen would make sense in the strategies that they were being booked in, and it is impossible that any legitimate trading should have been kept secret from me given that my bespoke system needed to model all our positions in all instrument types."

            Yep, this is a false flag for sure. They need this war with Russia more than anything else right now. Trump is not stupid that's for sure, he knows what's going on here. This could tell us the truth about Trump now, we can but wait and see.

            Yes!...i have have always thought that the closer pedo/pizza gate gets to nailing the top dogs involved they would use some kind of war to detract from it.  Think about it, if the real power players involved get brought down, as FBI Anon said entire Western governments would collapse.  War is a convenient distraction that would achieve multiple ends: put to rest Pedo gate, further consolidate global power, strangle the middle class from an ensuing market collapse.  The false flag is very likely the case, and Trump has to see past this to avoid war.

            They have wanted war in Syria for a while now.  They want the pipeline to interfere with the Russian gas industry, as well as other things.  The pedo thing is just a distraction to them, but we need to keep pushing the issue.

             Yes to no more war, but I would disagree that the pedo thing is a distraction. The pedo thing is the key thread that could unravel the sweater that is their evil method to control. Without the "pedo thing," they would be unable to put together these massive false flag operations with a complicit media. It is the GLUE that binds them together and keeps those who are pushing the agenda on the reservation.

              Maybe I did not word that correctly.  I meant it is a distraction to THEM, not US.  They are used to it, and are used to using war to cull the herd and acquire more wealth.
             </p>
             <p>
              I take the pedo thing very seriously, and I hope it is their downfall.  I am willing to fight this fight, and lose it all.  If there ever was a reason for a just war, then this is it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Both my Grandparents fought in WW2, and I have relatives that fought and died in WW1.  Neither one of those wars were just.  I doubt they ever realized they were being used by the bankers and corporations.  It is sad to think about...

               Well we know our mission, and it is good. I am hoping the airstrikes tonight were either targeted at ISIS (with a head fake to the media) or were a message to Assad to allow us to set up safe zones. I think Trump is too smart to have bought the big lie. If I am wrong on this, I will feel a bit duped by my hope in Trump, but it won't change my directive which is squarely stated in this domain.

            Keep in mind that what likely happened was Russia did an air-strike and hit a depot of chemical weapons, likely owned by those "moderate rebels" that McCain and the deep state are so keen on funding. The same rebels McCain went to Syria a month ago to meet with to tell them not to worry about Trump because they'll get their money from Saudi directly now that the CIA and Pentagon have to report to a new president. So the chemical weapons either belonged to A) the "moderate rebels" which include tiny destroyed groups like Free Syria Army but mostly includes slightly more moderate versions of ISIS. B) ISIS affiliated warehouse, although the attack was not in ISIS territory. and C) the weapons were Assad's. What the media is failing to mention is that this was not a chemical weapon attack, this was a conventional weapon attack that hit a chemical weapon storage depot. At least that is what it seems like from my understanding.
           </p>
           <p>
            My theory (and what I've seen others mention on 4chan) is that part of this is to distract from the Susan Rice proof of Obama having anyone in the Trump team or being vetted for being a possible cabinet member (like Nunes and Sessions) were also spied on and also were part of this "unmasking" so their names were visible and the reports were circulated much more than if the names had not been unmasked. Usually raw intelligence has certain specific names of people or things redacted, and in this case they un-redacted all the Trump team people, also known as unmasking. Anyway so yea this timing of this gas attack may have to do with deep state and obama spying on trump as well as other deep state things like the multi billion dollar markets for drugs, children, and organ trade.

             Yes...war covers for exposure that LSM continues to hide about treasonous espionage by Obama admin...weaponizing intelligence against political enemies and caught red-handed...while also distracting from the exposure of pedogate...all while moving us toward the crisis needed for the next stage of NWO initiatives. It all comes together and makes sense if you step back and look at what we now know and who is pushing for this war (the same people exposed in the illegal spying and pedogate).

            The bigger picture of PG is the tactic of destabilizing a region and then exploit the resources including human and organ trafficking of refugees. I think that originally it was primarily CIA work but has spread to State Department and rest of Gov. in recent decades as proved by the podesta emails and other research here. The real money is in what is procured from these international takedowns and the funneling of  taxpayer $/USAID via foreign govs back to the NGO agencies such as CGI, CHAI, McCain's child-ring etc. and Defense and Pharma Industries.

            ---------- My comment to his video as soon as he mentioned COVENTRY ENGLAND:  ------- I remembered on a George Webb youtube, mentioning a man working for SOHR in Coventry UK and I am SURE- it is the same man working WITH/FOR  the Clintons under the cover of his FAKE Humanitarian Group.  He was mentioned in George Webb video to do with Gas attacks in Syria years back = check G.Webb (8min 10 seconds):

            I don't think the Syrian war is a distraction from Pizzagate.  I think IT IS Pizzagate.   As long as there are Syrian refugees, there is an unlimited supply of refugees (children)  for the taking.

             That's a thought. Short-term, these crisis produce the supply of kids that they exploit and worse. Longer term: They are pushing things to a central NWO where they need not create a crisis if they have the sheeple under their total control.

            You have a fair point, but there is a difference today. The discover of PedoGate (the bigger issue) is very threatening to them. The elite cannot allow this to be exposed more broadly as it would take down the cabal BEHIND their plans. Their plans, in place before the discovery, are unchanged, but they have an urgency to create crisis to move things forward and take attention away from this topic and the treasonous espionage that has been uncovered that the LSM continues to not report. This is lighting a fire for them to do something as it will be too late if pedogate explodes in the public eye.

            If I did not have deep knowledge of pedogate and its tentacles, I would never make these connections and would have dismissed this all as far-reaching conspiracy. Once you reach the critical mass of knowledge about these matters, it helps to explain so many things (vitriolic opposition to Trump, massive conflicts in policy objectives pushed by people who claim to be conservatives, alignment of the left with those who are compromised in the clamor for war). Pedogate is the control mechanism to push those governing in the direction desired by the elite (globalist control of power, resources/oil, and money). Anyone who is thus compromised cannot step out of line and will do anything to prevent revelation of the truth.

            I've never seen this movie, but your analysis here is very good. We are closing in on them, so they need to create a major crisis. Syria looks to be it now, but if Trump does what I expect (focus on "safe zones for refugees"), this will not achieve their goals. Something big will happen soon, so be prepared.

            Child sacrifice is the heart of the global order.
The hotter this issue becomes the more rumors of war we will hear.

           <p>
            Edit: these people feel they are sacrificing to a blood thirsty god.  They must do their rituals or they feel as if they lose power.  The end to pizzagate is the end of the NWO. Alex Jones have never apologized or backtracked this much in 20 years. Not on 9/11 , Bill Clinton rapist, Dick Cheney.... but pizzagate he debunks.  I don't think people realize how close we are to blowing this wide open.

              People don't understand this. Almost every year somewhere a bombing or "police action" happens around spring equinox. That's not even counting the school shootings and terror attacks.  Molech must be fed!

             Not only child sacrifice, but the sex is key among the geriatric elite's desire for eternal youth and energy.  It's their life blood.  Aside from that is massive money for those who are in it only for the  profit.

               yeah, because it's so twisted and psycho they get to play that as their defense/offense card.
               <br/>
               It sure explains why these judges and politicians are not going to scare the public with an investigation and expose it.  They'd redact and scrub data first, and have had lots of time to work on that now.

            I don't know if I can explain this very well, but I think was reason the Syrian crisis was created because of the great potential for human trafficking the refugees provided.
            <br/>

            </a>
            After the Haitians caught on to the Clintons scam for stealing children, the elite created the Syrian crisis with the result being some more refugees to  catch in their snare.  I think that is why Trump made a big deal about helping the refugees by building camps over in that area, so families could be kept together and prevent their kids from being stolen.  He could not say that directly, so he made it about National Security.  I also think it possible that the reason he focused on the gassing of little children, particularly babies, at the presser yesterday  was to emphasize his concern for what has been going on regarding stealing children.  This was the same day he met with the King of Jordan.  Jordan is aware of all the refugees and human trafficking and he agrees strongly with Trump about Trumps plan to help the refugees go back home.

              Type on Google search PNAC/Neocons and it will give plethora of links. It's pretty much open conspiracy. Dick Cheney actually called for a new Pearl Harbour as did Zbignew Brzeniski - whose daughter Mika is on CNN pannel (Operation Mockingbird) - media is infiltrated completely.

               HD - Great find - youtube 220 - George Bush Jr at first National Security meeting wanted Saddam taken out.  Second meeting plan for past Saddam Iraq.  In campaign candidate Bush would prevent nation building campaigns all around the world.

              <p>
               So we have a candidate doing exactly the opposite of what he promised in the campaign, when elected.  Here we go again?

                  Here's an old song to better clarify how the phrase was used ... maybe it's not used so much anymore.

            Syria was on the cards back in 2000, it was part of the PNAC. There was a plan drawn up by Neocon think tanks, how to invade 7 countries within next 10 years, with an aid from a New Pearl Harbour (9-11, what a coincidence!) So far their plan have materialized. Only Syria and Iran left. Expect a big false flag within the next 2 years to justify invasion of Iran. If no wars happen in the next 4 to 8 years I will sat I was wrong and Trump is for real!

             The CIA plan to overthrow Assad dates back to 1983. George Webb talked about this today and showed the plan.

            ALL wars are planned years in advance.  The contemporary "hit list" has been out there for years (see Webster Griffin Tarpley, ZBig, et al), and Syria is on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Syria is one of the last few countries -- ALL located in the Middle East, BTW -- that are not yet completely under the yoke.  They will continue to be attacked until they are brouight under heel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't forget too that there is a Greater Israel plan at work.  They will do whatever necessary to usher that in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, correlation does not equal causation. Logic 101.

            Definitely a distraction but not from pizza/pedo gate. The elite have been abusing children FOREVER. It wont ever stop. It will never be legitimized. Even if it was mainstream media's lead story for a month they will just dismiss the idea and carry on. It is awesome that people are so aware of it now but we can't stop it. The elites affliction for children gets a little attention every decade and then goes away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now with the internet it seems like awareness is greater with more longevity but I don't think it will ever reach critical mass resulting in exposure, prosecution, or ending the trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fake Syrian gas attack is a distraction but not from pizzagate.

             Pedogate in all its horrific forms has been alive for a very long time. Victor Hugo wrote a chilling novel titled 'The Laughing Man' - In it, he details the perverted elites predilection toward macabre, how these depraved elite inbred royals funded corrupt child traffickers and sadistic surgeons who kidnapped children and surgically deformed them in fiendishly inventive ways for the 'entertainment' of the Royals. It is all real and documented - these surgeons went by the name o 
'Conprachickos.' Remember folks, these horrors did not end, they simple went undeground (in a literal and figurative sense). Keep fighting &amp; exposing!

            Yes False Flag. Intentionally done with gas provided by HRC &amp; Morell of CIA.  Trying to force Trump into war with Russia to strike Assad.  The Syrian civilians want to go home. McCain just made a secret trip to Syria behind Trumps back. The chemical attacks in the past were proven in War Crimes court as coming from the "Rebels" who are actually terrorists that we or other countries like Saudi Arabia support and give weapons to.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was intentional right as King of Jordan was here and pedogate is exploding. Also as the story has now turned to expose the Obama administration spying on Trump.

            They've been pushing for a war in Syria which will likely spill into a war with Russia, ever since the destabilization of Iraq was complete.  It's pretty obvious.

             They need Syria for a pipeline. There is huge evidence that this was always the plan, and Trump got in the way, so they need to get him to move.

              What is it with this pipeline?  The cost of shipping it by sea is negligible - surely - in relation to piping it across Syria.  My understanding is that the main reason has been that Syria was facilitating the supply of rockets to Hamas by the Iranians.  Israel didn't like it.

              You are spot on!  Exactly what my deduction came too.  I linked it to the George Webb video regarding Syria and pipeline: WATCHED THIS TODAY: ..... 1st Point) Gas Attack - Source Lift the Veil:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhmN_HnkR5I&amp;t=1sYouTube">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhmN_HnkR5I&amp;t=1sYouTube
              </a>
              ---------- My comment to his video as soon as he mentioned COVENTRY ENGLAND: ------- I remembered on a George Webb youtube, mentioning a man working for SOHR in Coventry UK and I am SURE- it is the same man working WITH/FOR the Clintons under the cover of his FAKE Humanitarian Group. He was mentioned in George Webb video to do with Gas attacks in Syria years back = check G.Webb (8min 10 seconds):
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44zXm1EdVmwYouTube">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44zXm1EdVmwYouTube
              </a>
              2nd Point) How come this man, with the camera, carrying the child is not wearing any protective clothes to protect him from the deadly gas?

            I agree on the fact that they were pushing for a conflict with Russia in the lead up to the election...toward their NWO agenda. However, they saw from Trump's positions that they could not make this happen easily. Therefore, they hatched this plan:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             [Falsely] Paint Trump as a stooge of Putin. If they could get this to stick (and they literally tried to frame him with a server, see:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1712219">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1712219)
             </a>
             ), maybe he could be ousted/impeached. If not, it backs Trump into a corner where he will feel compelled to action if they hand him a smoking gun showing atrocities against civilians.
            </li>
            <li>
             Plant the false flag with a staged ISIS attack on civilians using chlorine, blaming Assad. Make sure to update the wikipedia page to show this link and have the media beat the drum for war as it has been proven that Assad is behind the attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
             Now we are back on track with the crisis needed for movement toward the NWO, and Trump cannot have resources to continue going after #PedoGate, which itself ties into the NWO agenda via its compromise ops to control politicians in this push.

             excellent find. I hope President Trump is wise enough to see through it.  I think his comments were for the MSM and that he and King of Jordan knew exactly what is going on, come on Putin, join in with them and defeat these neocon nwo elitist pigs!

             With Susan Rice revelations they needed a diversion - this is Watergate all over again. It's Watergate + Pedogate converging. This is when we'll see what Trump is made of! He has to prove to the world that he is not just another stooge!

            Yep 100% False Flag operation! They abducted 250 civillians 1 week before.. This is the Sarin Gas given by Hillary Clinton. George Webb talks about this often. They want Trump to go to War with Russia and Iran. Why would Russia or Assad need to use this? They DONT get anything possitive from using such horrible chemical attack. CNN is almost begging Trump to go take action against Assad..

             If you also look at the "white helmets" helping the "victims" they have little to no safer gear on besides a pesky little air filter mask NO gloves at all and normal clothes, I'd hardly think
They would survive or be unaffected with what little gear they have on.

             Ron Paul came out and said outright that this attack made absolutely no sense. False Flag 101, even the most brainwashed liberals cannot buy this one. London attacks and Alexis Jones stunt were big enough pizzagate distructions - to no avail, pizzagate is alive and kicking pedo gate doors down. Hope Trump drains the swamp quickly before it's too late. Paul Ryan has to go, CIA top brass has to go - deep state runs the pedo gate, given their capabilities (Vault 7 leak) they know everything about MrPing Pong and Skippy and Killary and Obamas Hotdogs deliveres via Dupont tunnels!!!! Donald has to surround himself with White Hat agents and act!

               These powers that should not be and their goons need to be overthrown and put in mental institutions. People have to wake up to the fact that there is no rule of law and that patients are running the asylum. Time to come out of the trance.

             I never heard about 250 being abducted. Omg. Do you have a link? If this is the case, it looks like Trump is falling for it ☹️ The images of those kids has made him see everything differently.

              I like to think trump has the good sense to have his people keeping an eye on voat,  so I wouldn't be too worried about him falling for anything - assuming they weren't smart enough to come up with the false flag idea on their own.  My concern is if he's really on board. I guess time will tell.

             Yes. The attack makes absolutely NO SENSE. The same lying media that provided Obama cover when it did look like Assad stepped over the red line with earlier atatcks, and I still am not sure what to think of those, is now trumpeting was as the ONLY option. These people are always fighting against the hawks and needless wars and now see this as an immediate necessity, despite silence during earlier such attacks in Syria under Obama's watch and similar such attrocities under Obama and Clinton (Sudanese, Assyrians, Kenyans, South Africans, Rwandans, Bosnians). They have NEVER pushed for war like they are right now. They immediately knew Assad was behind the attacks, yet I have not seen strong evidence of this, and there is actually good evidence that has emerged that this could be a frame up of the Syrian government.

            No, it's not because of pedo/pizzagate. It's because of energy, power and money. Which again ties in to pedo/pizzagate, but...

             The connections are there...we can think of them from different perspectives, but nothing you say is out of line with the idea that #pedogate is real, and the elite need to try to get things back on track for their NWO agenda, driven by power/control and money, with #pedogate as a means to this end. The exposure and destruction of pedogate would bring down their entire plan.

             EDIT: I am not saying this is BECAUSE of pizzagate. I am trying to indicate that the uncovering of pizzagate is extremely threatening to them as pedogate is tied into the globalist agenda.
