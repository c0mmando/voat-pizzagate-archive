            You could twist it up really tight and snap it at the freshman in the locker room.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can soak it in cold water and put it on the back of your neck on hot days.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can tie it tight around your arm, to make it easier to find a vein when you're jonsing for your fix of heroin.
           </p>
           <p>
            For when you sneeze.
           </p>
           <p>
            To protect your shirt against pizza grease.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can soak it gasoline and use it to start a fire if the cops are coming.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can tie it around your forehead when you're in your snipers nest, so sweat doesn't get in your eyes when you're on a Hillary Clinton ordered kill mission.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can think a million reasons to use a handkerchief.  It doesn't matter.  Imagination is not evidence.

             "a Hillary Clinton ordered kill mission"..........Epic. Yes AreWeSure there are a lot of things a handkerchief could be used for. Here are some more examples of when a handkerchief is used:
            </p>
            <p>
             If you lived in Ghouta Syria you could wet it and cover your nose and mouth in an effort to avoid inhaling Qaddafi's Sarin Gas that Killery had shipped to rebels there in an effort to create a False Flag attack and precipitate NATO joining the conflict to bring down Assad.
            </p>
            <p>
             You could use it on Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express to cover your mouth while you cough so you don't get the other DC power brokers sick before your "vacation" on Pedo-Island even begins.
            </p>
            <p>
             What the f*** AreWeSure. You posted your usual drivel because you manufactured evidence related to the infamous Sandler email:
             <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">
              https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             You assume Susan Sandler had talked on the telephone with the Realtor and found out that handkerchief was "pizza related". Of course there is ZERO EVIDENCE Susan Sandler did that. And that means Susan Sandler added in "pizza related" herself which is reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeealy strange.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that doesn't matter to you. You'll ignore evidence when it doesn't suit you and you'll make up evidence when you need it. You're a joke. The OP says "could also be for"......as in it's a possible explanation given the evidence we have that suggests Susan Sandler added the "pizza related" herself without any evidence of ever being told that by the Realtor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Get it AreWeSure?

              Also the Sarin used at Ghouta, Syria only matches the recipe used by the Syrian Army.  They used a very specific chemical that was not known to be used in any other WMD program.  When they gave up the chemical weapons Syria declared thousands of pounds of this chemical as part of the WMDs.  And the UN found this chemical in the ghouta soil samples.   This Sarin  was not Libyan in Nature.

              If it was the rebels who used it (and it wasn't), they would have gotten their hands on it within Syria.

               "only matches the recipe used by the Syrian Army".......Only Syria is allowed to use that recipe? This isn't like the formula for Coca-Cola AreWeSure. It's merely a ratio of prescuror chemicals that could easily be mimicked say IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK IT WAS ASSAD. Which may not even be the case here as the chemical weapons lab at Porton Down says the Sarin couldn't have come from Assad. Basically the whole thing is one giant cluster fuck and you can't eliminate anyone as a suspect on the chemical testing alone.

              <p>
               There are mountains of evidence pointing to use of Sarin by BOTH sides. Even the New York Times says the Syrian rebels have used chemical weapons 52 TIMES(may have included Sarin, definitely mustard gas and other nasty shit for sure).
              </p>
              <p>
               Who should we believe regarding Ghouta? You appear to side with the some in the UN, the American CIA, Mike Morrell and other stalwart geniuses who told us Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons. Remember that one AreWeSure? I'm gonna disagree with you and go with the other group at the UN and Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh who accuses the Rebels, not Assad, of the Sarin attack at Ghouta.

              <p>
               "Obama’s change of mind had its origins at Porton Down, the defence laboratory in Wiltshire. British intelligence had obtained a sample of the sarin used in the 21 August attack and analysis demonstrated that the gas used didn’t match the batches known to exist in the Syrian army’s chemical weapons arsenal."

                And it is a unique chemical I'm speaking of.  Unknown to any other wmd program.  The missiles used to deliver only were seen and used by the Syrian army, who kept inspectors away from the site for days while repeatedly shelling it.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              This is complete nonsense.  It's a speculative answer to the question: *How could she know it's pizza related? * Answer:  A few easy, reasonable ways.
              <br/>
              Her email is day later, she easily could have called the real estate agent.   Or the agent could have called her saying I left you an email.  Or she could have emailed further with the real estate agent, but forwarded an earlier email.  Personally I think the whole theory around this email is ludicrous.   If she thought it was evidence of some great crime, she probably would have retrieved it as soon as possible. Before talking to Podesta.

             <p>
              If that is an example of "manufacturing evidence," then you are doing so her when you reach this conclusion.

             <p>
              Yes, the OP says that but so what?  Anything he mentions is of zero evidentiary value because it's just an exercise in imagination.  How many items do you have in your household that could be used in a criminal way? I just found this on google.

               "she easily could have called the real estate agent."........Pure Gold. You never disappoint AreWeSure. Yes she could have easily done a lot of things but absent any EVIDENCE we have to consider the possibility she didn't. Right? You're not that big of an idiot are you AreWeSure? Sometimes I'm not sure about you.
              </p>
              <p>
               When you investigate things you can't eliminate entire branches of inquiry based on assumptions like you just made. You don't get to say: "You know what? Susan Sandler is too rich and well educated to have done anything wrong. So we're just going to not "go there". We'll just assume the Realtor gave her that extra bit about it being 'pizza related'........Ok everybody? Rich white people don't commit crimes. Agreed? Great. Now moving on......".
              </p>
              <p>
               That's what you just did AreWeSure. We're not saying Susan's innocent or guilty. We're just saying you CAN'T ABSOLVE HER yet. Make sense? I sure hope it does. Because if you do think if someone's rich and white enough they're above suspicion well that would makes you an ass-hole.

                 This is how hard it was for the Realtor to have added "pizza-related" to the original email, see text inside square brackets. These are called square brackets "[", "]". This is a left one "[" and here's a right square bracket "]":

                 "I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black [and pizza-related])  that was left on the kitchen island."

                 I don't know what shit hole country you live in but here in America you don't absolve people just because they're white and rich when they squeeze 2 well known Pedophile code words into one sentence where they really don't seem to fit.

                <p>
                 Justice is blind. Rich people don't get automatic absolution. Automatic absolution reminds us of another sordid example involving the Catholic church when Automatic Absolution was handed out all too easily for years......

                  You talk of justice, but have no evidence for your initial charge that they are using code words.    It's a tremendous leaping to a conclusion.

                  You don't use handkerchief flagging with people you  know.   It's designed for strangers.   And there is "pedophilia" flag, that is fake.

                   AreWeSure handkerchief may have more than one meaning right? It can mean a flag to people you don't know. It can also mean a clothe(aforementioned handkerchief)  a Pedophile places under the child they are raping to catch the blood, semen and other sundry bodily fluids these sick fucks like to collect as mementos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You knew this right AreWeSure? Oh wait, I thought you knew the word "buck" had more than one meaning too, including a "buck" being a child a Pedophile likes to rape on a camping trip. And I gave you a link to a video that said as much. But you never looked at it..................odd............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

             I agree, there is no evidence linking Podesta to pedophilia, just a lot a question marks around the strange code-sounding emails, and his association with spirit cooking and his brother's art. His association with Clintons, and their links to DynCorp, Epstein. Until he responds to all points there will always be question marks around him. So I mention these points in case they prove useful in the future when/if more information comes to light. The top down suppression of news on pizzagate is also very suspicious, something that can only come from high positions of power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alefantis has many more question marks than Podesta.

               There's also his lifelong friendship to Dennis Hastert going back to Nose Japan. And his remorse at Hastert going to jail for raping children. If some friend of mine raped a child I wouldn't feel "weird" or "sad". I'd feel extremely pissed off and angry and call the guy a "fucking scum bag" that got what he deserved.

            This stuff is gut wrenching.  The stuff I have had to read is beyond comprehension.  They are disgusting vermin.  So what do they give each other for Christmas and B-day presents?  Handkerchiefs? Would not be surprised.  What a stocking stuffer.  You make a good point.  What a versatile item this has turned out for pedos.
