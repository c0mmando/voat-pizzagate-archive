            I'm Catholic. My family left the Roman "place" with (what they call) vile hedonism of vatican 2. I wasn't born yet (actually my parents probably weren't old yet, much less Married, but that's how "secret Catholics", or sedevacantists, meet I guess: families went to "house Mass" led by priest the way it was 500 years ago; we're hunted now but listing of Holy Catholic groups with old priest on traditio. Most phone numbers are for members' homes and you call to see where/if there's Mass that week. Since Bergoglio, things have been worse as for "hunting us down". I'm not kidding.)
           </p>
           <h2>
            St Sebastian's Angels BBS-then-website
           </h2>
           <p>
            Anyway in late 90s I asked my parents why we had to go like 4 hrs to different places for Church when we have lovely Cathedral our friends went to. They eventually showed me some of the original
            <strong>
             St. Sebastian's Angels website
            </strong>
            (not all the pictures; I didn't really know about sex back then, and the priest had given sanction against showing children, but said parents should warn kids to stay FAR AWAY from Novus Ordo places/priests). SSA had been a BBS board moved to stupid insecure server before I was born, then by the time BXVI was picked (probably to "find and get rid of" all trad Cats; it's been HORRIBLE; we didn't fall for it, but SSPX and FSSP and others did. Many are sanctioned from existing now,
            <em>
             or dead.
            </em>
            ) Anyway, parents wouldn't let me see the pictures, just (then-living) priests dressed up like girls and stuff, and they showed text about "black Masses".
           </p>
           <h2>
            W's first years as POTUS, 9/11 happens, and site goes down? OOPS!
           </h2>
           <p>
            A few years later I looked it up again (in college I guess), and yes there were INNUMERABLE pages of explicit CP. Kids tied to ...Holy things, being fondled, priests jesting that GOD could do nothing and other evil heresies. Some kids were hogtied (KIDS! TORTURED! Dehumanized!) in crappy bathrooms, faces obscured by poses or priests' privates, but clearly very young, and at least partially naked, and I won't say more about that or I'd probably attack random evil buildings. But let me tell you: those evil priests didn't think they'd ever get busted, and gave their names and addresses and NOChurch (Novus Ordo "church") addresses so they could get potential boyfriends to come visit and "molest together" or something. Many weren't Americans, only about half, but it was all in English. I was so disturbed, I showed old professor I trusted instinctively though he was New Age guy (boomer, smoked a lot of
            <em>
             something
            </em>
            ... probably not as old as I'd thought, but he had white hair). He and some friends helped me, and [things happened], but not good things (like, I'm afraid all we did was help get site taken down! NOT what we'd envisioned! Another reason

             nothing about the FBI being dirty surprises me.

           <h2>
            Fake archive of site by "fellow priest" who warns all religions of pedophilia.
           </h2>
           <p>
            When this PG stuff dropped in 2016, I went to look for St. Sebastian's Angels site or news of it, and some priest saved only 6 pages and a few pics, but everything else he wiped. Pg 6/6 has some of the original (but redacted for identity) "remarks". Which had been very detailed and DIFFERENT than I recalled, so I'm not sure this is a good guy. Just warning you. (Also, "archivist priest" shows mostly clean pics only of the DEAD; he "covers up" face pics of living priests. I was so glad to read him get HATE for that because it's no different than what anti-Popes have done with pedo priests since Vat2: cover up pedo priests! He says in response, "we have to be humble and forgive".
            <strong>
             Well HELL no we don't, especially if you're hiding the truth!
            </strong>
            And certainly not with still-living PEDOS and ...those of us who SAW the site, you couldn't forget the images. The letters and pictures of their meetups... if Epstein wasn't involved, knowing what we know now, I'd call BS.

            (Warning: this stuff was a real POISON PILL — they JOKED about their gay sermons and how much people could take without complaining, and dumb parents. They frequently said stuff like, they peed in [what Catholics drink]... I remember wanting a friend in Northeast to drive me over a few states so I could LITERALLY KILL one of these pedopriests. I kid you not: POISON PILL. You WILL want vengeance, especially if you're Catholic or Orthodox and know what "Black Mass" is, and it hurts your soul to see some of this stuff.)

            If I find it again in onion link, I'll come right here and share link with incredible warnings that it could damage your soul. (Anyone who wants to try, you'd need Tor and Tails but personally, I DO want archive of original site — HTTrack folder shouldn't get anyone in trouble unless you're a priest. It's
            <strong>
             "actual history."
            </strong>
            I was careful who I showed site to in college, and struggled very hard with not wanting to cut down every priest I saw except those of the Faith (vow against Modernism which was in effect 1900-1966; now RealPriests take vow but it is forbidden in Roman place; priests now do it on their own, and attest to it with witnesses. Home groups looking for priest have huge vetting process).
           </p>
           <h2>
            Now here is LYING "Catholic Culture" article about that site:
           </h2>
           <p>
            https:// www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=20666 (space added so you have to copy/paste, to protect voat).
            <strong>
             It's all lies.
            </strong>
            The South African PedoBishop SERIOUSLY DOWNPLAYED the content, and the LYING article allowed him to. —Btw I didn't "hack" the site. I mean, (1) it was completely insecure oldHTML, and mostly (2) it was a KNOWN THING! RealCatholic priests who refused "Roman FakeChurch" spread info about it to members to show them why to avoid RCC. I studied math and got into algorithms, but I'm a girl; and I wanted site UP for stupid "law enforcement" to use it to hunt down these demons with SWAT teams! Yes they took some pictures down, but the content wasn't Pro-Gay as article states; it was SATANIC. They wore Satanic crap, threatened the anti-Pope many Roman "trads" love, BXVI, expressed desire to rape Christian men and seminarians... plus what they did to kids in poses? SAME AS HITLARY AND HUSSEIN'S "spirit cooking" crap minus "aliens" and "Molex". That's why I knew PG was real the MOMENT I read about it in freakin WL in 2016.) Oh, and age of site is a lie: they used stupid oldTech (not Usenet but BBS and later,
            <em>
             I think
            </em>
            , AOL?) to "share" their sick pics, then some of them migrated ALL of that old stuff to non-secure website in earlier 90s.
            <strong>
             #ThanksFBI
            </strong>
            who covered it all up. And where was NSA? Seriously
            <strong>
             what is purpose of NSA if not to HELP KIDS on OPEN website?!
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Bet this guy was in there. There were WAY more than 55 members, too. (That article has triggered me, sorry.) But if anyone wants the site, open Tor/learn to use it, or get someone who already knows how to navigate safely in Deep State web, make sure VPN is on (and personally I sandbox in Linux when I'm really looking for something and not just checking mail), and look for copy of SSA. When I tried a little, I found dummy clickbait sites with evil names and no content really. But maybe one day, we find it.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             But again, SSA is real-deal Satanic.
            </strong>
            And scary. Really makes Molesta's stuff (which has been mostly suggestive, the early stuff with the art) look tame; or the same but just knowing how old it REALLY is, yeah Marxists could have been involved including Hillary and Hussein since they were alive in the 70s. I'd like a copy just to remind myself what we're up against.
            <strong>
             Warning for other religions: apparently many other church brands and religions have been compromised too
            </strong>
            (including atheism!). So be really careful in judgements on
            <em>
             people
            </em>
            in whatever church (or no church), or "temple", or "mosque".
            <strong>
             Even teachers' unions in some places.
            </strong>
            This Satanism has been building, and yes Jesuits helped spread it, but we're fighting PRINCIPALITIES, not each other. Being "innocent lambs" but seeing Satanic rites is shocking and very
            <strong>
             dangerous for the soul.
            </strong>
            But we can't just "do nothing". These people are the most VILE pieces of 💩 and yes, they DO think they run the world. And from what I can tell, since St. Pope Pius X was battling it in 1900 (120 years ago), it's probably been brewing since around French Revolution time. Maybe before, but it sure picked up steam since 1940s or WW2.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry for book. I think this is something we can find. Just as a Catholic not aligned with Rome, it's very hard for me to do.

            This   priest  had  ecstasy, other  drugs, probably for  drugging  his  victims,  talked  about going down the  Satanic road, wanted to  kill children-I  don't believe in  torture but I would  make an exception  for this case-imagine how  many  other Satanic priests are walking  around among your  children, behind closed doors....

             right when kids are the most vulnerable and insecure  is when often their parents are the busy with jobs etc. and the least likely to be at home to help. So many working 2 jobs etc.  Plus, I'm sure kids who have a parent in jail get singled out for "attention" from the wrong adults.

               If they weren't roleplaying, they need to be put down.  If they are roleplaying, why would they be entrusted with anything of value?  They should be in therapy until someone can say they've recovered, or never will, or whatever.

               Absolutely child abuse, at best, to expose children to these people..  it might make one complicit in something punishable by death penalty, at worst.

                I agree with you.  One thing I notice is that these people are never caught discussing normal relationships, as in with women.  It makes me think that they are put off by it.
               </p>
               <p>
                But, yeah, I would not object to putting them down.  We, the normal people, are kind and compassionate, so we do  not have to have to do it, but we will since we have to protect our children and families.

She said Faucher encouraged someone he was chatting with to rape and kill a boy, and he expressed an interest in raping and killing children. She said he talked about “his favorite age of a boy being 14.” He also discussed poisoning a neighbor’s dog, she said.

              Now I pretty much feel the opposite, haha. Although I’m sure some of this shit has been going on since the 50s
