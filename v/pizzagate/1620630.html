            I'll be brief, as maybe this needs a different forum. I am Mandela effected. What brought it home for me...or redpilled me was the change in anatomy and geography. I will not go into all that, but this is a community that talks about 'normies' and redpilling and if it ain't on MSM it ain't real kinda thinking. Come on. As far as I am concerned, I reconciled with where I am at, for whatever reason. ME is not more important than children's welfare and well being. That is first and foremost to be guarded. This work is more important than anything, as far as I am concerned. I am a tad disappointed, however. Maybe that is why I can empathize so much with the kids. It is tough to know the reality of what is happening to you and have no one. I am sure I am not alone in these sentiments as the good work that goes on here demonstrates, but have a heart people. This is quite real to me and others. I am 54 years old. I am too old to lie and too old to be silent.

            He never really covered pizzagate, just gave prominence to work that he also correctly credited to Wikileaks, and reddit and voat subs. Paid the price tho which is more than can be said by many here. I found him when I started looking into kuru-gate (back then we thought it was Parkinson's).
He said as much that he was going to move away from pizzagate. When you don't have CIA handlers as editors, why not shift to cover the Mandela effect? What's he supposed to do? Report on the urgency of taking out a home loan before you get priced out?
As far as I'm concerned, I never thought Mandela died in the nineties. I kind of think it was barenstain, but I didn't even know how to read when I used to like them so wtf cares? It's a fun topic with the potential for a sinister mass behavioral experiment.  Didn't we all just learn that Facebook snowjobs it's own user's feeds?
Nothing-burger.

            STOP RANTING ABOUT DAVID SEAMAN AND ALEX JONES. Please. Do you all not see what the establishment is trying to do with this, divide and conquer. Make us fight among one another and distract us, etc, etc... don't let them win at this. We need David Seaman on this, he reports to the mainstream on Pizzagate and has brought a lot of awareness on it, do not knock him for that. Same for Alex jones, love him or hate him. We need all the people we can get on our side, not fight among each other and not watch their channel or promote it for stupid reasons. Come on you guys. It's the establishment doing this. Don't fall for it. Please.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of you are mad because you think David didn't do research and took credit-come on, you could make a YouTube channel yourself and talk about it but you chose not to so don't bash him for standing up and doing something about it. And if you're in this for "credit" leave now because that's NOT what this is about. You're not going to get a golden award for research-do it because you want justice for children being abused, nothing else. WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!!

            Okay, now I'm curious about what Seaman did to affect these folk so mightily that they've brought out the pitchforks.
           </p>
           <p>
            I like having reputable journalists speaking out. It's Seaman that was going to go on The Daily Show. He's not the face of pizzagate and is not some kind of leader. He's a reporter who's taken some hits. And pitting two people together is ridiculous. It's like saying there's only one good poster here ... and they're the face of Voat. No! No one poster is. Instead, they're are a lot of outstanding ones, but you don't compare them until you whittle it down to one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have no idea what's going on with the HRC &amp; CO. vs. Seaman, but I applaud him for pissing them off. Must have been good whatever he said.

              Hey, you're entitled to your opinion. He did have his PayPal pulled ... twice ... and his videos. They've been going after him pretty hard. Personally, I don't see anything wrong with a reporter covering a story and earning money. Follow who you like. Lots of different personalities getting involved.

            First of all this shouldn't even be posted here. Secondly, David Seaman has been a huge proponent for Pizzagate. (He clearly stated a while back when pizzagate was being "shadowed", banned and scrubbed he merely suggested we use Pedgate to continue our momentum becasue he and many others feared "pizzagate" would completely blocked or scrubbed).
           </p>
           <p>
            He has been very clear, on several occasions, that he is a reporter and will be covering many topics but when he stumbled upon Pizzagate he was compelled to help out and be a voice. He clearly stated he is NOT a researcher for Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            David is currently interviewing for a job. He makes these videos using his own money while looking for a job. I would guess he is covering multiple topics to showcase his work and try and gain a sponsor or a new gig as a reporter.

            (fitting name for sure) doesn't want to continue following David then "Please child" DON'T follow him and there is NO need to post this crap and take our focus off the real cause AND call him a "Shill".  (Obvious-ly Child-ish) behavior or as I see it maybe change your name to "AttentionWhore".

            It's so obvious that he has convinced some suit in Washington that he's got an audience on the internet and can lead them off the cliff to implode pizzagate.  Such a dweeb.  He makes me laugh.  For anyone watching from afar....This is not going away and we're coming  for you.

            I thought it was a bit strange at the beginning when he asked people to stop using "pizzagate" and start using "pedogate" and he rarely mentions James Alefantis, which is fine. But I wonder if he's been told to zip it and change pizza to pedo to take heat off cpp

            What? This is not that crazy at all. The strange thing is that i see no correlation on what happened on his twitter, and what he says on his videos. Maybe his twitter was hijacked?

            He's gone of the rails.  Time to disassociate with him and Alex Jones and anyone else who tries to divert our investigation and drive it off a cliff.  Keep an eye on Titus Frost and Marty Leeds as well in these regards.  Both delved into Flat Earth topic recently.

            Here is my relevant post (IMO) from the other thread regarding David and The Mandela Effect:
"it sounds like he is exploring the Mandela effect. I have a theory on this...my girlfriend is all about the Mandela effect and also claims to have feelings of deja vu occasionally....she also has post-concussion syndrome from a serious car accident several years ago. I looked around on PubMed and found articles linking the feeling of deja vu to impaired memory, prior head trauma and anxiety...so there is my theory on the Mandela Effect...and Seaman has anxiety I think? "

            Hes a motherfucker, mandella effect is a SOROS CREATION, its not actually a thing, they want us to believe google over pur own collective consciousness, are memories are real dont fall for this bullshit, same thing they do with these kids. They made up "false memory syndrome" so pedos never get prosecuted. No idea where hes trying to go with this but the mandella effect is fake bullshit to try and rewrite our collective memories.

             Agree. Don't know if it was a Soros creation or not, but you've explained why this is dangerous. I watched the video and was expecting him to say PizzaGate was a Mandella event. You have it exactly right, the powerful elites have been brainwashing abused kids with false memories along with real abuse so that no one is prosecuted.

              Yeah I have no idea why he's delving into this and what he plans to do in the future, I've never watched Seaman but this weirded me out seeing him talk about it. I actually found out the Mandella effect was fake after being red-pilled with the pizzagate stuff a few months ago, I'll say it's more of a Tavistock creation, they harbor the technology that allows them to create this false "mandella effect". They want the entire public to have false memory syndrome so they're the sole arbiter's in determining what's real and what's not. It's literally an attempt to highjack our collective consciousness and hand them the keys.

               It seems like half the news is "fake news" anymore. You have to capture or archive an article to make sure it doesn't get changed on you. Media is constantly changing articles without telling us.

                They want the ability to read/write reality in real-time, it's been planned for decades. Archive is pretty cucked too tons of stuff going missing on there. The open internet is literally designed to imprison us in a WEB of thoughts we never escape from. We're always looking for truth on the web but it's really just a disinformation sparse matrix. We're never actually meant to see lies beneath the surface of "reality".

            I don't know why people are knocking David Seaman over this. The "Mandela Effect" is easily explained by the media innocuously publishing what later turns out to be a legitimate mistake. The media gets lots of stuff wrong, they incorrectly announce an actors death when they're very much alive. Maybe some paper did that with Mandela in the 1980s and some people saw the story and never saw the correction. Or in the case of the Bernstein vs Barenstein Bears someone probably wrote an article on the Bernstein Bears and then had to correct it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point being when the media does that large groups of people get the story wrong through no fault of their own. It's just part of being human. No conspiracy, it's just fascinating the stuff that gets mistaken.

             I think that people just didn't realize the bears names were being said or spelled incorrectly... this one did get me btw.. there are other explainable answers for the other ones... I don't see a problem with talking about it, but I think there's always a logical explanation for it, for instance some maps show New Zealand in a different spot? Risk map?

            I think this constant shill-calling of everybody over anything is pretty annoying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seaman is certainly no researcher and is sloppy, lazy and not very exact when it comes to facts (many reporters are like that).
           </p>
           <p>
            But AFAIK a "shill" is defined as somebody who intentionally misleads.
           </p>
           <p>
            A typical example would be Jack White who (successfully) derailed JFK researchers into looking into fuzzy images while there was tons of excellent other evidence available (autopsy, witness statements, etc.), he also discredited the whole community by pushing the "moon hoax".
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't see how Seaman is doing any thing like that.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             He generally puts the focus where it hurts (Pegasus museum, etc) even though he tends to get details wrong (image metadata)
            </li>
            <li>
             He does not push crazy nonsense like the "moon hoax", on the contrary, he explained how such disinfo campaigns work by using the "flat earth" as an example
            </li>
            <li>
             He was on pizzagate pretty much from the beginning
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            So yeah, he has his problems, but I fail to see how he is a shill.

             I would like to see one person on the planet who knows the truth.  No one does, no even the degenerates at the top.  They don't even know about every little thing.  Yeah, DS has problems, but don't we all, and I too, fail to see how he is a shill.  It wastes time dissing him.  We love to point the finger if it doesn't suit our agenda and always have three fingers pointing back.  Disinfo is everywhere.

            Alex Jones is praised, Joe Schmo says it and he's a dirty shill.

           <p>
            I'm not a huge fan of Seaman (LOL) but just because he talks about some topics that aren't exactly mainstream doesn't make him a shill.

             where you at? You delete anything that has to do with an actual discussion of pizzagate, but you let an opinion of a fresh account that has NOTHING TO DO WITH PIZZAGATE WHATSOEVER post something and it stays up for 14+ hours?
            </p>
            <p>
             VOAT is losing it's free speech and becoming another reddit. Censoring valid information and topics related to

              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             but leave shit like this perfectly alone with no problem. You're not slick, the veterans here have caught on to your game and other mods.
            </p>
            <p>
             You enforce rules for some, but not all. Hypocritical cuck.

             I ask you guys that read this to start calling out injustice by mods. We came to voat to talk pizzagate and avoid completely off subject topics like this.

             There is most definitely occultism involved with pizzagate. That's the truth.. then come the half-truths mixed in.. a little bit of poison in a sweet drink is still poisonous.. this is how shills work.

            Seaman became an overnight sensation after he allegedly was banned/fired from HuffPo for writing an article about how sick HRC was
            <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/08/29/huffpo-terminates-contributor-deletes-articles-after-he-questions-hillarys-health/">

            </a>
            After that, he made a video saying he was fearing for his life and that's how he became a sensation.

             Huh? Flat earth is easy to debunk, but who has debunked the Mandela effect? There are too many people with too many examples. Sure you can debunk a random false example, but this does not debunk the idea as a whole.

              Isn't it funny that people who have been dismissed summarily for believing in PizzaGate are so quick to summarily dismiss Mandela effect? Seriously...smh. Ps Mandela effect is very real. Some of the small shit is easily debunked (or seems dubious) but other things are not. Check the KJV Bible Isaiah 11:6 where the lion no longer lays down with the lamb. It now says the WOLF lays down with the lamb. Tons of biblical things, including the fact that there are now UNICORNS in the Bible. Seriously.

              Why do people say things haven't been debunked without looking into first. 
The movie quotes all make sense with context. The brand names are people mistaking fictional knock offs with the real ones. Then everyone has these personal memories they swear are true but memory fades over time, it doesn't get better. It's dumb. Where are the massive changes like effects to world conflicts or inventors or things that matter. Movie quotes and brand names??

            I only learned of David Seamans once I found out about Pizzagate. Was he acting strange like this before Pizzagate came out? Did he go on rants telling people off on Twitter all day and piss everyone off like yesterday? Did he constantly bring up money?

            Just wondering if anyone saw the Podesta emails that talked about alien life forms and zero point technology. There is freaky, proven stuff afoot. I'm not sure talking about it makes someone a shill. I see no one making fun of Alex Jones for any of the crazy shit he does, yet he, not David, is emerging as the face of pizzagate. He's one of the biggest channels in media. Where's the scrutiny?
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't watch his video because I'm not interested in it. But I disagree with the premise here that seems based on the belief that David has some supreme ability to hurt the cause by his affiliation with pizzagate. It's Alex you should be worried about. Fuck.

             Or it could be taking people's money and then saying he's not talking about pizzagate anymore that caused his reputation to be a little burned. You think pizzagategear could get away with that shit? He gave full refunds and people here still don't trust him.

             Dude he tweeted about how the secret illuminati are all after adrenochrome when in reality you can "get the same effect from trichromes which is x100 stronger." Trichromes are a
             <em>
              structure
             </em>
             found on the surface of cannabis that contains THC and other cannabinoids. That is some fucking retarded ass stoner shit, for real. Seaman and Jones are both nuts, and too many people are willing to blindly look the other way because they're willing to look at pizzagate shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I guess I'm not surprised he's still seeing support since half the posters here are convinced that it's SATANIC ILLUMINATI TALMUDIC JEWS FROM THE FOURTH DIMENSION instead of regular old creepy incredibly wealthy elites simply taking part in perverse pleasures because they can and are too powerful to be stopped. I think too many are simply unwilling to believe that people can be evil without some outside force involved, people can't just be rich and powerful and corrupted by that power, people can't just make unfathomable amounts of money by monopolizing slave/organ/sex trade- they have to have wacked out mystical voodoo ritual involved that "good" people could never partake in.

               Saturnian cult. Most people don't know that they literally have been part of satanic ceremony. Are you married with a ring on your finger? Saturn. Oh you were married on Saturday or graduate in a black robe on Saturday? Saturn. We are ritually giving them power and don't even know it.

             Actually, Alex Jones's name has been dragged through the mud here, as well. Despite the fact that he covered the AntiFa meeting at Comet Ping Pong, and believes (similar to the conclusion we reached months ago) that the MSM wants us to focus our efforts on that place, and ignore the bigger picture (although saying that there's nothing interesting there is going a bit far).
            </p>

             I think the most logical possibility is that all this stuff about aliens is meant to make any whistleblowers or investigators look crazy. That, and some of the elites genuinely believe it. Either way, talking about aliens does not garner support in the eyes of the public, and gets us no closer to freeing children from sex slavery.

            I told you guys he was bullshit 3 months ago. My first red flag was his gold selling. Then the fact that all videos dance around exposing anything new. He's just in it for the clicks.

              How do we know that James doesn't know Ryan? Where did Ryan come from? Why did James only talk to him in all this? We can't be so sure that was all totally real. I really doubt JA will prosecuted for anything. This is just a little accidental exposure, on a large criminal network that rules the world, basically. The 30,000' view, (CIA term) is that this same operation of a pizza place, selling "all ages" prostitutes, and pornography that you can only get from this group, is all over the world. That's why they use symbols, because symbols transcend language barriers. If you go to another country, and you are in the know of this group, you find one of the symbols in the city your at, and boom, you have access to the porn, and prostitutes you like, anywhere. Which I'm sure is not cheap, which is why they are fiercely protected. Another thing to note is, start paying close attention to porn stars. We all watch porn, and a lot of it is made by this group. Notice the tattoos. A lot of porn stars have butterfly tatoos, and leopard, or cat tattoos. Sex kitten mk programming, and monarch mk programming symbols. Not to mention the satanic tattoos, but those could just be trendy. I don't know, just speculating.

                JA working with Ryan: Doesn't make any sense to me. How does JA benefit from all that attention that Pegasus is getting? Also if Pegasus is a red herring it is a very lousy one (a good red herring would generate new stuff to waste resources)
               </li>
              </ul>

               Also that would assume that JA made all that construction months in advance which is not plausible.

                I also fail to see how Ryan or Seaman are preventing the "big picture" to be seen. The whole essence of pizzagate are powerful people in pedophilia.

             I have lost respect for David's approach too. Even when he was bringing publicity to the cause, I found his approach to be too reactionary. Definitely not the hallmark of a professional journalist. Many pro's with DS's approach, but also many negatives. I think he is trying to get a head start on things coming to light now. I don't like the way he operates.

              He  is a  classic  example  of  how media groups are  assimilated
Huffington Post---fired?/left---becomes alt reporter---starts off with some good general reporting of PIZZAGATE (nothing new,  others work,  but ok), starts promoting himself, bringing in $$$---everything then has been Seaman and his personal drama, unseating  who  SHOULD  be  center  stage-child victims of pedophilia--

               Totally agree. Granted, a person does need to make a living - and I get that.

              <p>
               But, these rants that he goes on, he just loses me. I cringe a little bit inside, and I simply could not link to his videos for fear of being lumped in with the guy. Granted too - it's an emotional affair, but I don't think DS represented himself as well as he could have. The guy makes it too much about himself.

            Futile zionist attempt at muddying the waters. Puppets abound. Somebody should make a compilation piece on his changing stories (trying to appeal to the 'fringe') and the timeline relative to when relevant info is posted. Sort of like a Sandy Hoax Allstars, but only with Seaman's b.s. and the Benny Hill theme song.
