            <p>
             Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales gave a fiery speech against corruption at the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, a week after a judge barred his son and brother from leaving the country due to a pending fraud investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The president's landslide victory was attributed to popular discontent with Guatemala's political class and compounded by a U.N.-backed investigation into a multi-million dollar customs racket that reached deep into the previous administration.

            Please notice this news article by publinews. There is a statement from a mother. That says she has a seventeen year old daughter that was raped by an
            <strong>
             “American man”
            </strong>
            in that foster home. She has received death threats. There are reports about child prostitution in that place.

            Good work and your connection not only make sense but feel right.  Is staffing of a ship classified?  Wonder if we could find any ex-Spearhead sailors with stories?  Lots of folks in the USN with be OUTRAGED if Navy used by these f**ks...

             In what way does this connection make sense?  A US military boat is near a country.  Way inland, there's a fire?  How are these things connected?  Pure conjecture about a helicopter.

              Do you know if it has been implicated in some of the other "refugee rescues"?  It is a "humanitarian" ship....

              You are kidding me right? Investigated by CIA?  They do child trafficking themselves you do know that right!  I don't think navy intiliegence will take us seriously.    I would suggest dig more evidence then regroup to find someone to go to.   I suggest Judicial watch maybe

               Re-read my post. I may not have said it well, but I'm saying it would have been a CIA op and the perpetrators wouldn't be listed on any sort of ship log.

            Show me the bodies.
           </p>
           <p>
            This shelter was ripe with abuse, many high ranking names may be involved in the abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there are bodies you just got rid of all the evidence, IE the building, records, torture chamber, DNA,blood, covers up real cause of death/bruises/rape, and the witnesses of the abuse being the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            But knowing these people they probably torched the building as a way to close it down and destroy all the evidence of who was involved and what they were doing. They then took the children from the shelter to the shop offshore by helicopter. Also don't think of the kids as people, but weight. Little girls don't weigh alot you could throw a bunch into a helicopter unconscious, and not need multiple trips.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then once in the ship they can either be organ harvested (see george Webb video) or experimented on, or sold as a slave. What's great about these girls is by saying they died in the fire these girls are basically ghosts, and it also makes them expendable.
