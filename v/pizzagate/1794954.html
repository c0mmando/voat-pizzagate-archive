<h1>Northwood Golf Course:</h1>
<p>In 1960 the Northwood Development Corporation began selling lots.  Roads and homes were built, removing some 300 yards from Northwood Golf Course.  For example, the No. 1 tee box was originally located some seventy yards further back (no restaurant at the time) while No. 2 was a daunting 440-yard par four.  Other local <strong>MacKenzie</strong> course are the Meadow Club (Fairfax), Claremont Country Club (Oakland), Sharps Park (Pacifica), and Green Hills Country Club (Millbrae).  According to the Forestville Historical Society, he also created the Russian River Golf &amp; Country Club (also known as the Cosmo Golf Course and the **Hacienda Golf &amp; Country Club), which at one time was located northwest of the Hacienda Bridge on McPeak Road near the old <strong>Skippy’s restaurant</strong>.  Today, the <strong>Schaap</strong> and <strong>Bale</strong> families have restored the course to much of its original magnificence, prompting Golf Magazine to rank Northwood at #3 nationally including both public and private nine hole courses.  <strong>Our own little gem</strong>.  Hoorah for us!</p>

            Built by the Shriners architects Huehl and Schmidt in 1912, the Medinah Temple is a colorful Islamic-looking building replete with pointed domes and an example of Moorish Revival architecture. It is located on the Near North Side of Chicago, Illinois at 600 N. Wabash Avenue, extending from Ohio Street to Ontario Street.

           <p>
            Shriners International, also commonly known as The Shriners, is a society established in 1870 and is headquartered in Tampa, Florida, USA. It is an appendant body to Freemasonry. The organization was previously known as Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (A.A.O.N.M.S.)
           </p>
           <p>
            There are approximately 350,000 members from 195 temples (chapters) in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Mexico, the Republic of Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Europe, and Australia. The organization is best known for the Shriners Hospitals for Children that it administers, and the red fezzes that members wear.
