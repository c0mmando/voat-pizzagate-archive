<p>Fabian Society (emblem FabianSocietyLogo.jpg / Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing)
<a href="http://www.fabians.org.uk/">http://www.fabians.org.uk/</a>
Founded in 1884 by Beatrice and Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells as a group promoting non-Marxist evolutionary socialism.</p>
<p>“In 1900 the Fabian Society joined with the trade unions to found the Labour party, and has remained affiliated to it ever since.”</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw 1856 – 1950</p>
<p>Here’s George Bernard Shaw suggesting people should prove the worthiness of their existence, or be euthanised with a “painless gas”</p>
<hr />
<p>Bill Hicks was familiar with George Bernard Shaw, enough to make a joke about him on the UK tv program “The Word”</p>
<p>4:35 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA4S-TRjGVo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA4S-TRjGVo</a>
“You guys produce George Bernard Shaw … And we produce 90210”</p>
<p>Is George Bernard Shaw well known to The Words demographic? Interesting choice people to name.</p>
<p>The Fabian Society was founded on 4 January 1884 in London as an offshoot of a society founded a year earlier called The Fellowship of the New Life.[4]
Fellowship members included poets Edward Carpenter and John Davidson, sexologist Havelock Ellis* and the future Fabian secretary Edward R. Pease.</p>
<p>Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 – 8 July 1939)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havelock_Ellis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havelock_Ellis</a></p>
<p>“The 1897 English translation of Ellis’ book Sexual Inversion, co-authored with John Addington Symonds and originally published in German in 1896, was the first English medical textbook on homosexuality. It describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys.
Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, as he did not characterise it as a disease, immoral, or a crime.</p>
<p>⚈The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age taboos as well as gender taboos.</p>
<p>⚈ Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of so-called “inter-generational relationships” which most people today would categorize as child abuse.”</p>
<p>“He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism”</p>
<p>(here a Tavistock child psychologist sitting amongst the narcissus (daffodils) with a doll, with his head on it in reference, I would imagine to “parental narcissism” <a href="http://www.andywiener.com/life_story_work_07.html">http://www.andywiener.com/life_story_work_07.html)</a>)</p>
<p>So deep I can hear the echo.</p>
<p>“Paul Robinson’s The Modernization of Sex surveys the work of three pioneering sex researchers: Havelock Ellis, Alfred Kinsey, and William Masters.”</p>
<p>Paul Robinson is the Richard W. Lyman Professor in the Humanities at Stanford University.</p>',

           Founded in 1884 by Beatrice and Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells as a group promoting non-Marxist evolutionary socialism.
          </p>
          <p>
           “In 1900 the Fabian Society joined with the trade unions to found the Labour party, and has remained affiliated to it ever since.”

           Bill Hicks was familiar with George Bernard Shaw, enough to make a joke about him on the UK tv program “The Word”

           The Fabian Society was founded on 4 January 1884 in London as an offshoot of a society founded a year earlier called The Fellowship of the New Life.[4]
Fellowship members included poets Edward Carpenter and John Davidson, sexologist Havelock Ellis* and the future Fabian secretary Edward R. Pease.
          </p>
          <p>
           Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 – 8 July 1939)

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           “The 1897 English translation of Ellis’ book Sexual Inversion, co-authored with John Addington Symonds and originally published in German in 1896, was the first English medical textbook on homosexuality. It describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys.
Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, as he did not characterise it as a disease, immoral, or a crime.
          </p>
          <p>
           ⚈The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age taboos as well as gender taboos.
          </p>
          <p>
           ⚈ Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of so-called “inter-generational relationships” which most people today would categorize as child abuse.”
          </p>
          <p>
           “He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism”
          </p>

             In my opinion Hampstead was a combo of an abuse case with a VERY high level psyop.  It went all the way to the top.

            I posted this a couple of days ago on another Hampstead thread:
           </p>
           <p>
            I just found a very odd piece of information on Ella's first husband Will Draper.  He is a banker that was responsible for bringing Ella to the UK and for introducing her to Ricky Dearman after they divorced. Well,  his full name is James William Draper and so I did a search under that name.
            <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=61402871&amp;privcapId=24373022">
             http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=61402871&amp;privcapId=24373022
            </a>
            .  So he is always working for big investment banks.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then I find that he was at one point also a director of a smaller outfit called :
            <strong>
             47 HOLLYCROFT AVENUE MANAGEMENT LTD
            </strong>

           </p>
           <p>
            Hampstead Children researchers will be familiar with this address because Ricky Dearman used to live at a similar address BUT in Hampstead.

            Going back to Draper's company where he was a director from 2000 to 2008, I had a look on Google maps.  And right next to it, is a

              Thanks.  I'm actually doing some data gathering on MKUltra, from the UK perspective as I picked up on a lead recently from that discovery I made a couple of days ago re: Will Draper and 47 Hollyfcroft Avenue Management Ltd and the related Hampstead address.
