            I can only speak to the screenshot you mentioned because I noticed also that the mail sample ballots for Hillary people were in an envelope with her picture on it and arrived a couple of weeks before mine.  I am in San Diego County, CA and I saw that they had been left on top of the mailboxes because the people they were addressed to do not live here.

           </p>
           <p>
            The precinct supervisor for my voting precinct mentioned to me that there were an unusual amount of provisionals handed out and a lot of unregistered people were voting. I have a whole group dedicated to the subject of Election Fraud and the comment in that screenshot about duplicate precincts makes perfect sense.  My ballot stub, which I still have, had the words " Extract 50" printed on it.  I took that to mean that my ballot was in the group where 50% would be taken out and shredded and replaced with Clinton only ballots.  Makes sense.

             Holy crap. Thanks for weighing in. All of the election fraud across the country was kept here

            Agreed, maybe its a strange interview too because they know something is up and are just saying shit like 'we will never know' all the while hiring a private detective to dig into this.

            Here maybe another reason they are uncomfortable in the interview.  G.Webb Offutt Air Force Base is going to connect Seth Rich's parents to the old finders case in Omaha and to Mena Airport:

            Yes. Allegedly there was a lot of chaos and unusual activity in the hospital right when his death was confirmed (5:57 am), people who had business being there were restricted access to him. He was alive and breathing when the cops found him in the streets.

            I just watched the video and while their behaviors do seem a bit odd, I have to say that it felt authentic to me. I don't think his brother was laughing. To me it looks like he was there with his family in a show of support, and that he was trying to display a friendly smile since he was on camera. He's just trying not to cry while on tv.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I looked for while watching was the brothers reactions to hearing what his parents were saying about how he died. He was blinking quite a bit, expected if holding back tears. When the mom says he had bruising on his knuckles and that he put up a struggle, the brother looks down as if he's picturing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            To be honest it looks like the brother was having a harder time during the interview than the parents. His parents do remind me of some foster parents I know. It could be that Seth and/or his brother were adopted.

            The brother isn't laughing and whoever said that may not remember or know what it's like to lose something like that. He's trying not to cry so his chuckle attempts are him trying to hold back a sob. The father's face is red you can tell he's shed plenty a tear already. The interview does definitely seem like they were given a script to read and were not allowed to stray from it. Something is definitely fishy here though, I bet the DNC family "spokesperson" made them read their scripts.

            About pandas :
"Another boy, Beacham, whom I have mentioned already, was similarly overwhelmed with shame by the accusation that he ‘had black rings round his eyes’.
‘Have you looked in the glass lately, Beacham?’ said Flip. ‘Aren't you ashamed to go about with a face like that? Do you think everyone doesn't know what it means when a boy has black rings round his eyes?’
Once again the load of guilt and fear seemed to settle down upon me. Had I got black rings round my eyes? A couple of years later I realized that these were supposed to be a symptom by which masturbators could be detected. But already, without knowing this, I accepted the black rings as a sure sign of depravity, some kind of depravity. And many times, even before I grasped the supposed meaning, I have gazed anxiously into the glass, looking for the first hint of that dreaded stigma, the confession which the secret sinner writes upon his own face." Orwell, Such, such were the joys...

            Just to offer a different opinion, there are many things we don't know about the production of the interview. We don't know how many takes they did. How much the family were prompted with their responses. The panda bear prop may have been suggested by someone on the production team.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is always going to be some form of "set-up" in an interview. Just saying.

            Yeah, this is most definitely a fully scripted video. We got dad mouthing what mom is about to say at 0:40. Also, starting at 1:30, Dad is trying to talk about what his son was working on, and he actually has no clue and sticks to platitudes. Then at 1:45, desperate for words, he glances sideways in a very focused manner; its not that his gaze is accidentally shifting, no,
            <em>
             he very decidedly looks at something that he knows is there, at the distance he expects it to be at
            </em>
            . And then, all of a sudden, he is able to tell in much greater detail what his son was actually working on.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, off-camera there are some big sheets with keywords, phrases ("bullets and people don't match"), talking points etc. that they need to stick to. It's almost too obvious. Maybe that's why brother is smirking so hard; imagine what he is looking at.

            We're told that Rich wasn't in pain, but confused, when picked up by the paramedics. “They [paramedics] were very surprised he didn’t make it,” Aaron Rich said emergency responders told him. “He was very aware, very talkative. ...”

            People grieve in a myriad of ways.  What's right for one person doesn't work for someone else.  Sometimes we judge someone for appearing too stoic, when in reality they're just not a 'public griever'.  The fact that they have a camera on them would also change their 'natural' reaction.
           </p>
           <p>
            In saying that, I have lost a child and two days after I was not like these parents, at all.  A grieving parent DOES NOT talk about the need to smile and live life to the fullest while we're on earth. Fuck that shit.  Usually a mother who's lost a child has dark circles under the eyes from crying non-stop; she's angry; she's emotional. And the crying goes on for months and months and months.   In fact, if anyone gives me that spiel now I feel like punching them in the face.  I don't understand their reaction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, as a parent you'd be thinking, 'I will find out what happened to my child", especially if there was a struggle.  You'd think one of the parents would say, 'We want the killer of our child found, and we'll be pressing the authorities until they find him" not "we may never find the killer".
           </p>

            THe little brother may be laughing because of nerves?? I don't know--just a thought.  Sometimes people laugh when they are ill at ease.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only explanation I can dream up is that they've been told to stay silent, and they're scared, or they've been paid to stay silent.   I'm thinking of Marine la Pen--not a peep since she lost the election, even with all the credible evidence that the French election was rigged in Macron's favour.  imho, she's been paid off to stay silent on the rigging.

            It would explain why a loving family would behave this way, but protected by whom? He pissed off pretty much the entire establishment by leaking those Podesta files. There was zero systemic resistance to Hillary at that time.

            Sure, but for some reason it has floated around and has been taken pretty seriously. It is plausible, and can be fact checked if we had any real investigators around.

Aaron recently married a lawyer.http://www.jewishomaha.org/jewish-press/2015/01/zwerdlingerrich:"Her fiancé received his BS in Computer Science with minor in Electrical Engineering from Colorado School of Mines. He is a Senior Software Engineer at Northrop Grumman." If he's autistic, he's a highly functioning autistic. His father recently was the president of the Beth El synagogue in Omaha (

            Based on other recent comments from OP I was thinking you might be shilling but I don't know what to say anymore - I have lost patience for these conspiracy theories about pizzagate researchers. It's fair to say there are many many shills. Please people, Seth Rich died because he leaked to Wikileaks. It's simple. There's no duping delight on his face. Have you ever lost someone? There is a crazy range of emotions you go through. He looks like he is trying to hold back tears. His eyes are glassy from the tears welling up. He's in shock. I wish it hadn't come to this where we have to read this stuff. So sad.

             My eyes usually &lt;always&gt; get really red when i'm about to cry, even if i'm able to hold back the tears, the redness gives me away. I've never seen anyone retain white eyes if they were truly about to cry.

            At the very least, his eyes would be red, at least around the rim!. That's the big giveaway for me. You might be able to hold back tears, but  you have no control over the bloodshot eyes that come with them.

            You have to look at all their instsgram posts to fully believe that they really post pics of pandas with strange comments that make NO sense unless you know that they are pedos so read their posts with that in mind. It all then becomes very clear and the comments of their friends make sense as well.

            I haven't watched yet so I'm just commenting on that very last part in OP.  Once a cop drove me to get gas when I ran out in interstate. I tried to give him a 20 for doing so because he was on his way home to his wife and kids after an all night shift.  he refused the money and said it would be illegal to accept money from me.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I'm guessing you can't raise money for D.C. Police?  Families can pay private investigators but not the police

            So okay I watched it again. Are there any photos of his parents out there from past investigations. Anything that might distinguish These people from his real parents? It's either A: They believe that Seth is still alive and are going along with the narrative that he is dead to protect him thinking that he is in some kind of secret protection, or B: These people are indeed actors and this is flipping Sandy Hook style fakery going on.

             Their behaviour is explained perfectly by the idea that he is actually still alive. The parents could be actors, but that son of theirs is screwing the whole thing up, because he can't act for shit.

            Sometimes the Truth is painful to realize. Respect comes from the Latin combination: 're', meaning again, and 'spect' / 'spectare', to look at. In order to understand the Truth we must look again (and again), until we fully understand it. Pedofiles are violent people, and their practices look nothing like romantic love, despite Disney's best efforts to indoctrinate the Cult(ure).

            That is really creepy. The dad looks weird. I didn't like how he seemed to quiet his wife by tapping on her and then he started talking. The brother looks to me like he's trying to look like he's crying or holding back tears. Why even have the brother awkwardly sit there if he's not even going to talk. Thank you for sharing!

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              @ sterf derb: WTF? Watch this video many times. Something stinks. The first few seconds in, the brother is cracking up and trying not to laugh. He does this throughout the whole video. 30 seconds in, the dad says the police called him and stated that Seth was alive when they arrived and MAYBE stable when Seth got to the hospital. No, no, no, no, no. A cop would not say he was MAYBE stable. You are either stable or, you are not. 40 seconds in, the mom starts to talk and just as the camera is panning left towards mom,
              <strong>
               dad is actually mouthing her lines. He knows what she is about to say. One minute 3 seconds in, the mother says something off script? The dad subtly moves his right arm and taps her on the back and then he quickly takes over her conversation
              </strong>
              . WALLS COVERED WITH DISNEY AND MOM, HOLDING A GD PANDA! C'mon people.﻿

            Omg I thought I was the only one who thought something was off. I'm sorry but I'm having a hard time accepting those are Seth's parents. My intuition tells me not accept them as authentic. Something is truly fucked with this entire thing. Nothing is adding up.

            Agreed that people can express multiple emotions rapidly after deaths, and some people exhibit opposite reactions to situations as part of their particular personality (i.e.: the brother). i also find his demeanor odd. There is no doubt a laugh happening as the clip starts- its immediately stifled. and after multiple views see no signs of sorrow, only the 'holding back' and strange eye movements but no wetness at all in eye rim- yes, i looked very closely. nothing however can be proven from 'odd behavior'.
more concerning- whoever wrote the bottom part about the girlfriend... this doc is second hand and very weak... it blatantly states SHE "figured it out" by looking for a friend and thinks seth 'must have' also found out. that is nothing more than a guess. the father mentions the polling interest which seems suspect at first- but if mr. rich did in fact develop the dnc polling app, this would make sense as to what the father is referring to... if it was something more sinister, why would he have just SAID it out loud!?? esp when they appear to be rehearsed and the dad cutting off the mom earlier, but then he spills the beans? i find their 'we may never know' the most troubling... and other ways of speech ( yes very much like SH). in this scenario and in viewing this interview,  pizzagate findings make the picture make more sense... the family is being hush hush, diverting fact that ?flash drive was stolen by repeating no robbery...he could be under protection or is dead and secret investigation occurring----- 
f/u interview with the brother would give another chance to see his personality on display and look for signs of sorrow/etc.

        <div class="usertext-body may-blank-within" id="commentContent-9152821">
         <div class="md">

           <p>
            "The robbers didn't take anything, they must have been scared off..."
           </p>
           <p>
            Ummm... not even a milla second to grab the wallet (that they probably wanted bc "robbers").
           </p>
           <p>
            So they randomly chose to rob the guy
            <em>
             but first scuffled with him
            </em>
            instead of just pointing the gun to his head demanding his possessions? They chose to physically assault him,
            <em>
             then still not robbing him
            </em>
            they shot him
            <em>
             in the back twice
            </em>
            meaning he was no longer a threat bc he wasn't even facing them, they couldn't grab his wallet &amp; run? Nope. Shot him then ran.
           </p>
           <p>
            So..... just a thought....not sure if anyone brought this up before but
            <em>
             what IF the first responding Officer was the killer
            </em>
            (maybe w help from another officer). What if he got called by DNC to
            <em>
             do the job
            </em>
            . He has ties to Podesta &amp; HRC. How well does he know the restaurant owner...did restaurant owner give cop heads up he was leaving or were cops possibly following him?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth hung up w his gf, when it's 4am and you see
            <em>
             unknown
            </em>
            people approaching u, do u hang up w gf?  If it's 4am, u see cop approaching u (or maybe waving u over) or someone u know, you would probably hang up w her bc you know you're gonna be talking &amp; don't want to be rude by keeping her on phone.
           </p>
           <p>
            This can also tie in to when private investigator called the police. The police,
            <em>
             rather than calling the family or calling investigator back
            </em>
            , the police called
            <em>
             the guy at DNC that
            </em>
            <em>
             wasn't
            </em>
            getting along with Seth.
            <em>
             3 days later
            </em>
            police called investigator back
            <em>
             only after DNC guy
            </em>
            asked the family who the (investigator) guy was.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone (4chan/voaters) ruled this out yet?

            It goes without saying that of course Seth Rich was murdered by some powerful high ups in the DNC.  It's a whole other thing entirely to assume that these folks are in on it.

            They honestly remind me of my family.  Southern, friendly, always willing to lend a happy but just as happy minding their own business.  The brother honestly looks mentally challenged, but even still, the roller coaster these people were going through at the time is outrageous.

            People deal with trauma differently. Its not uncommon for people to smile when speaking/hearing traumatic info. It's a coping mechanism. A form of denial which is the first stage of grief.

            Having been in the position of someone dying unexpectedly (my soul mate of 12 years), I know that ones emotions can be all over the place. You laugh, you cry, you laugh, you cry, you don't know where you are during those first hours, days and weeks. It seems strange to outsiders but that's how I found it is. Not only with this death, but others very close to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I find it hard to believe that parents, and a brother, could be non-caring about their son / sibling being murdered. I believe they were in shock. Add to that the TV cameras and interviewers,,,, just my op, idk

             Horrible observation... if everyone handles stress differently and MOST people are inconsolable after a loved one has died...
            </p>
            <p>
             Then why the fuck are these 3 people all acting IDENTICALLY ?  Which happens to be IDENTICAL to every Sandy Hook parent.

             You know, these fucking stupid comments about 'everybody reacts differently' are so fucking stupid and shill like, especially when you come off as condescending.  Did you even think we have not lost a loved one, you idiot ?

              Appreciate your experiences, I do not wish to get into a word match. I shared my observation, and agree that it may not be yours. Personally, I was not 'inconsolable'; I was in denial as many people who have experienced the death of a loved one are, even months after. Your reaction I appreciate, however it's not the same for others.

                   The first stage of grief is DENIAL.  These people are way too accepting of his death this soon after it.  Why do people get bereavement days when an immediate family member dies?  Too give them time to breakdown emotionally.  Not so they can do fake ass interviews with news crews spewing nonsense.  They should be in a state of SHOCK at this point.  What comes next?  ANGER.  Then bargaining, depression and THEN acceptance.  No way this family went through all the stages in a matter of days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Have you considered this is CIA programming to how they WANT people to start acting after the death of a loved one?  Honestly, their behavior and reaction to his death makes no damn sense.

                   You're talking out your ass and so is everyone else who starts with 'people grieve differently', but as I clearly pointed out about the SH parents &gt;&gt; the all grieved IDENTICALLY / not a tear in the group.. just like this fucked up family ... father &gt;&gt; ' unfortunately, bullets and bodies don't go well together '  yeah.. real fucking insightful and not creepy at all.

            I thought about that too, but it was the DC cops who came to the hospital (ostensibly, in this case, to remove him, alive) - but we know the DC cops are crooked af and work alongside the DNC. If they did take Seth out of that hospital, it was probably to torture him, not protect him.

             Yeah, it seems like about 90% of Voaters are calling BS. I hadn't seen the youtube comments before posting this, but if you look at them, you'll see the same thing - everyone can see there is something awry.

            I think the family may be a little strange with their Disney characters and the Panda bears, but that doesn't mean they are connected in any way to pedos. The whole thing about the pedo movement is to use symbols and characters that most people don't connect to anything bad and that a pedophile understands that the business or person is connected to pedophilia. It how they operate in plain site.
           </p>

            I also think the brother is trying not to cry. Strange interview though. 
I think this family is just very naive.

            Seth was killed because he emailed Wikileaks.about DNC crimes. He didn't tell his family what he was doing because they believed the DNC propaganda and he didn't want to fight with them. Plus they are a little strange.

            Yeah, I thought the parents was denying that Seth was with Wikileaks? Yet their strange behavior on video, doesn't go along with them hiring Wheeler to investigate. Meaning, hiring Wheeler seems like what normal grieving parents who want the truth would do. Not the ones in that video.
All of this is to freaking confusing!

             Confusing - that's how we know we're being lied to. Now the question becomes, who is lying, what are the lies, and who is behind it?

              Rich like Oswald, Ruby, Holmes, Roof ect are all the type that these Evil freaks look for to take the fall.
A few days after starting work for the DNC Rich is sending this info to Wikileaks? No way! Someone inside the "know" allowed Rich into those files. Rich was the "Patsy"

            Two things, he's either stoned, or he's like my brother and always smiles and laughs when he's most uncomfortable.  My mom used to beat his ass with a yard stick and he would laugh the whole time even though it hurt.  He never really grew out of that either.

             People react in all kinds of ways when they're in pain.  On the surface, with one viewing, I can't judge his reaction one way or another. Certain families have dynamics, where emotional pain is unacceptable to show.  Maybe the family leans more to becoming stoic in their grief?

              I agree, he was smiling for sure but it didn't look like a happy smile.  They had to have a million different things going through their heads trying to figure out what the hell is happening.  A nervous smile probably caught Podesta's attention more than anything.

            Well to be fair, and play devil's advocate here I had a similar reaction when my bother passed. People deal with stress and grief in different ways. I would go from crying to laughing in seconds.

             With all due respect, that's a brother not a child.  I'd be sad if my brother died, but my child?  I'd be ruined.  Absolutely ruined for a while.

              Isn't this dude about 34? 
Why is he sat on the floor like that as if he is a little boy?
Reading the yt comments I see that people are actually talking about him after if he's 7 and not a grown ass man.

            He may be a touch autistic and super nervous around cameras during a foggy awful time.  I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt.

             For sure. I was able to write this off for the past 9 months, but after reading the comments here and at the youtube video, realize this is actually a VERY weird interview - there is something not right, even if you ignore the brother altogether.

            This video was uploaded on July 13th - the day of their child's funeral. I hate to judge, but I'm a parent and there are not enough drugs available that would allow me to act so calmly right after my child was murdered. The mom says "we may never know what happened" WTF - had they even buried him yet when this interview was shot. There is something so wrong with this... Plus, the first time I saw this, I thought the brother was younger but nope - he's 34 years old!

             Maybe Seth is alive and they are being paid on the side to keep quiet?  Maybe why the brother is laughing??  Like pedogate, this just gets weirder and weirder.

                 That's interesting. Tim Allen's show on ABC made fun of Hillary a lot from what I've seen (which is only this compilation:

            WTF? It's like break out the champagne time and celebrate! That brother's behavior is strange ... yeah, this family. The mom and dad are nutty lib/deniers and possibly in on it? And the brother ... maybe it's his reaction to the father talking? If the father is lying ... or there's background ... he could be reacting to that I suppose.

             I just read the comments at the youtube video - check out this one with regards to acting:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              WTF? Watch this video many times. Something stinks. The first few seconds in, the brother is cracking up and trying not to laugh. He does this throughout the whole video. 30 seconds in, the dad says the police called him and stated that Seth was alive when they arrived and MAYBE stable when Seth got to the hospital. No, no, no, no, no. A cop would not say he was MAYBE stable. You are either stable or, you are not. 40 seconds in, the mom starts to talk and just as the camera is panning left towards mom, dad is actually mouthing her lines. He knows what she is about to say. One minute 3 seconds in, the mother says something off script? The dad subtly moves his right arm and taps her on the back and then he quickly takes over her conversation. WALLS COVERED WITH DISNEY AND MOM, HOLDING A GD PANDA! C'mon people.﻿

               I seriously had no idea what i'd uncovered here - i simply thought it was weird. I have shared this on twitter a few times and there was no response, so i let it go all these months. So glad i posted this to hear all of the responses - and the ones on the youtube video are great too. The people are friggin WOKE.

             I though the exact same thing - i think he's actually reacting to his dad, it's making him uncomfortable. There is something being covered up here, and the dad and mom are doing a good job, but the brother is giving it away.

              I got the sense that he is deliberately giving it away.  As if he's listening to his parents and their words but really he is t feeling it because he knows different.  Did Seth rich actually die?  Because everything in that clip tells me he didn't.  This is the day of their son's funeral?  Sorry but there would be more grief to see.  They're not even fighting any back.  Someone's cooking kippers. The DNC stepping in to handle PR is off too, imo.

               I have to agree with you on every point. It wasn't until today, after reading all the comments here and on the original youtube video, that i am questioning everything about this - and you've summed it up nicely. These people act like Seth is alive, and they are lying in order to keep him alive. They seem very happy. Not only
               <em>
                not grieving
               </em>
               , but actually happy, elated even.

                And saying what they have to say to keep him that way.  Doing everything that the DNC PR man says to do.  I think the brother's semi smirking is actually him TRYING to give away the truth whilst also trying not to look that obvious.

            This video creeps me out. Your son gets murdered in the streets, and a mere two and a half days later, his parents are completely at ease, stoically contemplating the pitfalls of fate, fully accepting the fact that, yeah, you never know what's gonna happen people, so live life to the fullest y'all, and laugh! No flustered faces, no blood-shot eyes, no black pouches under their eyes, no raw emotion, no despair, nothing. They are playing a role, and they know it. Little brother is not overcome with sadness, he's smirking. Even mom can barely contain her laughter a little past the 2 minute mark.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you ever been near parents right after their son died an untimely death? I have, and it doesn't look like this. Not by a long shot.

             The affect of every Rich family in that video is really "off," especially given how soon after the murder this was filmed.  The first thing I thought of was, "WERE THEY PAID OFF?"  Surely y'all noticed how docile and complacent Bernie Sanders got in July last year (at the Democratic National Convention).  Despite being blatantly ripped off in the most egegious of ways (voter fraud setups like Seth Rich uncovered, Donna Brazile giving Clinton the questions, the collusion with the media, the SuperDelegates that disregarded the will of the voters, etc.) Bernie sure was willing to roll over and play "dead" as a candidate.  Then, miraculously, he bought his third home, a $600,000 gem on a lake (
             <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/bernie-sanders-summer-house">
              http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/bernie-sanders-summer-house)
             </a>
             ).
            </p>
            <p>
             To me, the Rich Family looks like the cats that swallowed a canary.  Or perhaps they just pocketed millions and millions from the Clinton Crime Family Foundation.  If anyone lives near these weird people, I'd be curious to know if they upgrade their house, buy new cars, or do anything noticeably different in the next year or three. . . .

              Well, I'm currently entertaining another theory. We got lots of Disney, we got a panda, we got a boy named "Seth" (which, if you remember Podesta's habit of drawing fish and numbers on his hands, is a very significant name), and it all starts to point in the direction of pizzagate-related antics. What if Seth Rich was much more than just a DNC-employee? What if he was an actual victim of pedophaelic grooming? What if he was "used" by Podesta's gang until he outgrew his sexual attractiveness, and then was offered to work for them instead? What if the discovery of the DNC's voter fraud, and/or any other information he came across working as a techie for the DNC, caused his programming to "break"? What if he decided to "take revenge" by seeking to expose the secret dealings of the people he worked for?
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe all of this is really far-fetched, but I just cannot get over this video. I simply refuse to believe "normal" human beings would act this way a mere two days after their child was
              <em>
               killed
              </em>
              . If his family is indeed a kind of "Luzzatto"-family, acting as a perverted supplier of breathing underage sex-toys for the wealthy in exchange for some petty cash and minor privileges, this would explain their complete lack of empathy or emotion at the murder of their son, as they never had an empathic bond with him to begin with. The level of complacent acceptence they display can only be explained if Seth has been "dead" (as in: emotionally unavailable) to them for a much longer period of time. Their behavior in this video, and also the statements they released a couple of days ago, come across as fully scripted, as if someone needed to tell them how "normal" people are supposed to behave. It's part movie clichés, part subtle legal strategizing.

               .  Excellent insight.  It would explain a lot.  Given the Rich family's proximity to Omaha, Nebraska, you are absolutely right.  They could be in this way deeper than one would suspect.  I am doubtful that the DNC would give computer access to just any ole body, i.e., to a random applicant off the streets.  You're probably right, that Seth Rich was known among them for longer.  All I know is that the parents and brother come across as extremely abnormal.  Heck, I've lost loved ones years ago and still cry, sometimes, when I see the make and model of the cars they used to drive, or pass by someone who looks like them.  I would have been a wreck trying to film the video in the same time frame that this family did.  Any normal, grieving person would never be so flat.  Something stinks.  I just hope and pray President Trump and his stormtroopers (and anyone else who can shed light on the truth) will do their things and bust it open.  I pray for this country every day.

             It is not the Seth Rich story in and of itself that is so disturbing if it had been a botched robbery. The entire Russia hacked the election story including top intel agencies &amp; the FBI signed of on this fact pattern. They would have known that was completely false including the silencing of D.C. Cops &amp; agents &amp; MSM agencies and completely lying with malice afore thought that it was bogus all while concealing murder. Seth also would have had to have been unmasked by NSA so his identity was known. The missing time could indicate he was interrogated especially now that the bar owner of Lou's Bar Joe Capone was in the Whitehouse in a private room 4 days before murder at the same time as felon and political fixer Bob Creamer was ( who was caught on camera this summer paying squads of trained rioters to attend Trumps rallies and incite violence.)He had visited the Whitehouse and

             many times personally while he is caught on camera openly stating they DNC pay trained agitators to attack Trump supporters and Law Enforcement. This even ended in some shooting deaths and many injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lawsuits have been filed and they link directly to the whitehouse &amp; the Clinton's.

              Of course it wasn't a robbery.  Apart from the obvious inconsistencies with the official story I'm wondering if more is going on than we have considered.  Now I learn that the guy used to dress as a panda.  His family is odd..I'm smelling MKUltra here perhaps.  The whole set up of the interview with the mother holding a toy panda and all the Disney characters on the wall. It's like watching a Sandy Hook family interview all over again.  I used to be a Trump supporter but now I'm beginning to think that his administration is all part of the charade.  Lots of weird stuff and I think that we still don't understand the depths to which we are being played and manipulated.

               Agree about the lack of understanding in some sense but remain a Trump supporter for a very basic reason. We know TBTB hate him and are not only corrupt but evil at their core. If he was one of them and we were played by everyone (him being the figurehead) as the COG continues on controlling the world, starting false flags, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               He is more than a figure head. He is personally taking on the deepstate. That is why you see the chaos thrown at him.
              </p>
              <p>
               All out war by Deep state. They actually want WW111. Think about that. They want the death of millions if not billions in a nuclear war why they will go hide in underground bases that most of us have no access to and will possibly end millions of life's. You have to have an evil heart to want this.Obama wanted it when he was going to strike Syria over Assad chemical weapons. He chose not to not out of courage. He was paralyzed because portondown had identify the chemical gas came from the US rebels (actually ISIS) brought over from Libya when it collapsed thanks to HRC.
              </p>
              <p>
               The only chemical weapons in Syria now were provided by through proxies like Turkey as were rebels who were actually trained militants (ICIS)
              </p>
              <p>
               They were brought from Benghazi. Hilary knew this when Obama struck Libya. There was an Iranian in charge of the WMD program to keep these chemical agents or WND out of terrorist hands. He left in 2012 stating mission accomplished. No true
              </p>
              <p>
               The Benghazi event had a lot to do with these facts. Chemical weapons loose in the hands of terrorists groups Obama/Hilary approved but actually off shoots of alqaeda &amp; al busts and others. Additional stinger middles were brought in Syria through Qautar I believe and then transferred to Afganistan/Pakistan &amp; Syria.

            It reminds me of one of the fathers at Sandy Hook laughing as he walked out to the microphones to make a statement to the press. That was one of the 100 or so tells that points to Sand Hook being a complete hoax.

             Absolutely SH was a hoax. and we should check to see whether the Rich family ends up with a new mansion soon, not that the shooting was a hoax (though it sounds like the gun shots were not what killed him). You're wrong that we don't agree on anything, and you've  known me for 3 months, never having anything bad to say until I questioned George Webb. Just keep it real.

              And was it ever. The Attorney General of the State of Connecticut is going to have a lot of explaining to do later this year me thinks. There are a lot of rich people living in Connecticut and that's good because the state's budget will be bled dry for a couple of years. The good people of Connecticut will be paying for that mistake for a long time.

                "totally unexpected."
               </p>
               <p>
                I've been having a long talk with God these past few days. I don't know if you're religious. I'm certainly not trying to be a Bible thumper and please tell me if I am. But for some reason I started out 6 months ago thinking that I could help out God dispense Vengeance and Divine Justice. But that's not my job. God said "Vengeance Is Mine" and I need to keep remembering that. The more I remember the better I feel.
               </p>
               <p>
                I put down everything I'm feeling right now here in case you're interested. Don't feel bad if you skip it:
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1867519">
                 https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1867519
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                It helped me get my head on straight. I think Voat possibly shutting down is God telling us all that He's "got it from here". I put my faith in God. He hasn't let me down yet.

                 Not unexpected from you, per se, just that this never happens to me, especially on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Secondly, Butthole Surfers! I used to love them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Third, I am all about God and Jesus. I died after falling 100 feet straight down whilst on a vision quest, believe it or not. I was given the choice to come back into this body, or into a fetus. I decided to come back  as an adult because i would better be able to serve God, and not have to get through all the schooling and bullshit first. I came back to tell everyone that God is real, that is my only reason for existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can relate to everything you wrote. I also have the strength to look into this gruesome stuff only because of Jesus. and I also know that the pedos are going to get their asses handed to them - we are seeing the beginnings of that, but like you noted, it isn't up to us, and we don't have the power to enact justice anyway! We have satanists in every position of power in this country, and in the Western world, it would appear. Only God can handle this.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is why i too wouldn't be sad to see Voat close down. PG is totally infiltrated with bullshit "leads" and fake youtube investigators. We are trusting people who work for the very groups we're trying to expose, and fighting each other for the right to continue doing so. We are out of our league. This is in God's Hands, thank God.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Where our power lies is in getting our own houses in order. I have to work on being harmless, in thought, word and deed. And from there i'm just trying to get a better meditation practice going, and get healthy. Investigating pedos has done very little to advance my own state of health, except for the catharsis that has come with meeting other victims of pedophilia, and being able to talk about it freely for the first time ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My heart is huge for you, for this beautiful post you wrote, and for your sheer determination to make things right.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You're not alone in finding, or becoming closer to, God as a direct result of pizzagate. This is why i've seen PG as a great thing spiritually, and funny that it is the opposite of what Hillary and the satanists would have wanted. Have you ever heard "God turns all things to good"? When you see that happen, it really solidifies one's faith, and one's belief in miracles.
                </p>
                <p>
                 God is real. And the pedo's days running this planet are numbered.

                    I just finished adding a footnote to that post in case you're interested:
                    <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1867519/9155098">
                     https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1867519/9155098
                    </a>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It gives some info about Charles Colson and my connection to him. As you and I know there are people in this story who are about to get a lot closer to God. And hopefully that's not literally closer because suicide is a sin. The closer to God we're talking about is the fact there are no atheists in a fox-hole and the perps stopped going to church a long time ago. They'll be in need of salvation in short order because they've got the biggest artillery barrage in American History aimed right at their heads.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Chuck Colson's story could be that ray of light after they get their lights blown out. He was the first man down the last time this happened. People need to know his story right about now. And I'd bet there are a few new Chuck Colsons that will be birthed in the coming months and years.

             Have you looked into Sandy Hook more lately?  We went back and forth on this a while back and at that time you weren't sold one way or another about a Sandy Hook "Hoax"....

              "Have you looked into Sandy Hook"
             </p>
             <p>
              Yep and thanks to you I finally found the truth. Right after I said that to you I did some digging and found Wolfgang Halbig's numerous talks on the subject. Sand Hook was a 100% hoax. All those kids are still alive even the "shooter" and his mother. I guess that was the one consolation that came out of it. My heart had been torn in two when it happened and I carried that with me for at least a year. Just thinking of those kids getting killed like that was brutal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now the other shoe's about to drop and I just pray none of the parents or anyone else decides they can't live with what they did. That would be a tragedy as well. When the truth comes out I hope it's accompanied with a healthy dose of religion because many of the people who took the money are going to regret they ever did. And not from the likes of me or you but from their own conscience.

            I been watching known liars body language, ex George Bush,Jr., Hillary Clinton, etc. Everyone should remember these people are probably Liberal Democrats, and probably from a city, which would account for some of their body language. These people are frightened and/or tense, they don't want to really be there. The brother is not laughing, he is distressed. Also, they are choosing their words careful, I think the old guy gave hint, that his dead son mentioned polling places, and how he wanted people's vote to count for them. There are people who are trained in this field, I have listened to some of them and have learned stuff, but in no way am I super good at it. I would ask a expert,

             You are mostly correct.

             These people are terrified,and know exactly why Seth was snuffed.
            </p>
            <p>
             but they are dealing with very ugly perpetrators.
            </p>
            <p>
             what makes this story "special"is that seth and his family are Jewish,so just snuffing and silencing all of them is tricky.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at the donors on the go fund me page,many Jewish names.

             Andrew Breitbart and Aaron Swartz were Jews as well.

            The most remarkable part is there is no interview with these people. The girlfriend on Facebook admits that he was "killed" because he discovered the discrepancy in the voter roles. This is also highly unusual that an on screen interview would be given to a family for a botched robbery. Those happen frequently in cities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea that this seems so forced and the brother producing "tells" everywhere is disturbing. Obvious set up.

              Fine... But look at the mothers body language and listen to her words.  She is SHook level of emotional detachment ( so are the father and brother, btw ) but she needs his panda, as if he was a tiny child who played with it?  No way.  This family bothers me, big time.  I've watched the interview 5 times and it gets worse, each time. Father ( flatlining ): ' He died... unfortunately bullets and bodies don't mix. '   WTF !!

              I heard he called his girlfriend 'Panda' and that is therefore why there is confusion with his girlfriend's name because he so often referred to her as Panda.

                 Yep. Imagine a panda at every "party" - this is just weird. Unless the parties are of a certain type, and if so, they are loving telling us about this on MSM. Flaunting it in our faces.

              Still, its  kinda weird. But the  Rich family seems to have an idiosyncratic fashion flair as per the rest of the pics. But don't get me wrong, I wish them only kindness, closure and peace. I hope the killer is caught and punished.

            These people are in shock.  They've lost their loved one.  Emotions can be flattened, or inappropriate.- 
(Ironic there's a panda bear in the video.). Grieving family poor people.

            This tape says a lot.  He told his girlfriend he was home.  Then he went out again?   They say the police have his phone, wallet...everything, nothing was taken.  What about laptop?

             I tend to agree.  Some people go into shock and can be emotionally flat.  It could be part of the denial phase, but considering this was the day of the funeral, denial seems unlikely.  I try not to judge another persons grief process, especially when it's broadcast for the world to see.  People can get weird in front of a camera.
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said, the brother is doing all he can to not bust out laughing.  WTF is that?!?  It's like he's retarded.  Seriously, retarded kids often don't know how to act so they can act inappropriately.  But I don't think he is.
            </p>
            <p>
             And second, the mom.  I'm a mother, and if something like that happened to my son, I would be destroyed.  I wouldn't be able to talk about him getting shot in the back and dying and act as though I'm describing how Walmart was out of dog food.  Very strange.  Not even the slightest hint of grief, at all.  No choking back tears, no facial expressions, nothing.

             This isn't normal, no matter which way you cut it.

              It seems to me that if the boy is autistic or somehow mentally handicapped, they wouldn't have put him on camera. There was no reason to have him there anyway.

             I agree and I had to watch it 3 times going back to his face always and it looks to me at the beginning that he is trying to hold back tears almost ready to cry.  He did not speak because he could not. He loved his brother and he was overcome with emotions.  About the Panda, I noticed this way back when and I found that his father said he had a love for them because of his love for animals. Notice also all of the pictures in the background are from Walt Disney.  This could be from when the boys were younger and went to the movies.  Remember no one knew then w hat we know now.  Edit: It was so very painful to watch his brother.

               I just could not see the smiling bit, it was so obvious to me that he was almost choking back tears.  I wonder if he will consent to giving that interview to GW.  I will be shocked if they allow him.  If you know who I mean.

                  If the brother is allowed to make a statement through George Webb, we will really have to question whether Webb is an agent of the State ( which some have already been doing ).

                   I thought of that as well.  If he does not then we can be sure they are controlling the brother but I thought for sure if they did something is up.  I don't follow any of the Pizza gate YT idols for I have had many of my idols taken down.  I check once in a while when someone posts like today, but this may be a test he cannot pass?  We shall see.

                    On my recent submission about Webb releasing people's social security numbers, there were so many examples from other Voaters of why they no longer trust Webb that I now think we've long passed the testing stage. It's actually laughable how much evidence we have against him that people insist on ignoring.

                     I know and there are some really smart people that I really trust on here that quote him and write abut him.  I have my reservations. I won't say I positively that I  know, because I don't have solid proof, but yes, I have serious questions about his being sincere.

                      Yeah, it's a quandary. The thing is, I have received some information that if true, means people who trust and then perhaps make contact with Webb, could be in actual danger. This is why i've put a lot of energy into trying to warn people. This is why it bothers me that he has good people with good reputations fighting tooth and nail for him.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It seems we don't emphasize being careful, and not too trusting of "ex" government operatives around here. We are in dangerous waters, dealing with a most group of thugs (CIA/Clinton).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It seems wise to be much less trusting, yet i see exactly the opposite with regard to Webb. Scares me.

                         There may be something really strange going on, but until we research this we should not go off on them.  It could turn on us.  The other side could vilify us for turning on a hero.  This could be their plan. I don't trust them.Not one bit.  Did you read my comment?

                          I don't see anyone going off on them - I have a feeling our group knows not to do that, but there may be agent provocateurs who may start something, much like the anti-Jew comments on every single post. Great for discrediting our entire community, but does nothing to further our cause/investigation.

                       Wow.  I know of someone that is really hooked on him and now I am worried about him big time.  I have always wondered why some of these so called "Exes" are allowed to do and say things they do. How do they get away with it.  A lot of people have been taken out for a lot less.  I think they might be trying to waste our time with some more "Fake News".

                        Exactly. Not only are they diverting our investigation far from DC, but they are gathering info on just who among us knows what - that puts us in danger, and allows any info we have to be covered up, or otherwise managed, by the deep state/powers that be/CIA.

                          Yes, and i don't mean to keep you here, but one more thing - this has been going on for a long time. Our PG investigation has been thwarted since the Alefantis threats/ Pegasus investigation. That's when I noticed we went entirely off the rails and haven't come back on since. The break up offered a perfect opportunity for infiltrators "I'll take it from here". And we were so exhausted and ill equipped, many of us decided to hand over the reigns. It was planned this way.

                           By infiltrators I think you mean the YT Stars?  I think you are right about that.  When we got too close for comfort at Pegasus, they had to divert us and  fast.  All of a sudden I noticed too that there was much interest in other places like YT.  I think they brain stormed to come up with hot stories that would keep us busy for days.  I wonder if that Awan stuff is for real. Who does all of his investigating.  Does he have a team?  Yeah, I am worried especially about what you said that we may be in danger.  I am worried for my friends. Also when ever he gives us a new clue people probably pile on to research that and that is their plan.

                            FWIW, i have heard whispers that Webb is working for Epstein. I feel comfortable letting this float out here unsubstantiated because if true, extra caution on our part is in order. We gain much more by exerting effort into being discriminating than into blind trust - we loose nothing by being cautious.

                            The Awan stuff may be for real, it may be that the govt has no problem with throwing thees guys under the bus to get us off the trail of the bigger players, and Webb seems happy to help with this endeavor.

                             Bingo.  Throw them under the bus.  They are more  than happy to sacrifice it is in their DNA.  So they throw us bones for us to gnaw at, just enough to keep us interested. and keep us off the real trail.  Yes they had to do something after Ryan, right?  That probably scared JA to death.  They can't have their  GQ hottie hurt one little hair on his head.  Yes we must try to slowly warn people.  Maybe to cut down their viewing of these YT Idols and get back to real business.

                              He also visited the mother of one of the victims from the Franklin Scandal in Iowa, for no reason besides a photo op to gain legitimacy. It was just sad. His only comment was that she suggested watching the documentary about her son. It looks like he has removed that photo from Twitter, in fact it looks like he removed everything except for the past 2 weeks' worth and stuff from 2012.

                 Yes, and it was his only sibling.  He and his brother were very close.I can imagine how he felt and the family when he moved to DC. I think if he would have tried to speak he would break down sobbing. We do not know about the parents either.  They may already have been told what to say in some fashion.

                To me, he seems to be grimacing, holding back tears.  We don't know much about the family. Or his girlfriend.  Funny, how when tragedies like this happen, the media is in everyone's business.  But not this.

             The panda placement seems to be entirely purposeful, doesn't it? It's not like there are any other stuffed animal as lying around. And it has such prominance  in the shot. Just weird.

              Connections to PG?  Was he groomed?  Perhaps while at Creighton U. He met certain people with bad intentions, he didn't know what he was getting into.  Not blaming the parents.

                What do I think?  About him being groomed?  Anything is possible, but about the Panda that is starting a lot of this talk and I now have been reminded by

                that he kept one in his office, which then reminded me that his Mother had been sent that very Panda by someone at his work.  A very kind touch.  She is holding it because it was his.  I am not discounting that he could have been groomed, but I am not going to pile on this family.  Not unless there is verifiable proof that something is very very wrong. So far this is pure conjecture.

              Pandas were the absolute main attraction for decades and is the FONZ logo, so it's understandable, them living within a mile of the zoo to be fans. There are only 12 pandas in the US.

              Ya and all the framed disney pics behind weird me out too. Could be something or could be nothing. Like sending a message, or maybe we are just reading into it all too much? Can't quite get my bearings on this interview.

               I guess none of of the imagery would bother me, if it wasn't coupled with the fact that all 3 of them act very unlike people who've just buried their son, murdered under suspicious circumstances, likely by the most powerful gang in the nation - the DNC.

                Agree. I just hate to think that on top of the fact that he probably was killed for trying to bring out the truth that also his family is somehow disturbed and twisted as well. It just keeps getting more and more awful and takes me a second to digest each new potentially horrifying aspect.

              Sleep deprived (abused) children exhibit dark circles around their eyes. Hence, the panda lover meme created by pedofiles.

                Evil does exactly that. They sink energy--that is, they take goodness and light from the Universe. They are selfish and disconnected--they, in fact, live in a severely limited sphere of consciousness--believing two fundamental untruths: 1) they believe they are separate from the rest of the universe; and 2) they don't understand Karma. The Truth is, we are all One, and there are Natural Laws that Unite Us. For example, a basic law of physics is action-reaction--this extends, in Natural Law, to say that if you hurt another being, you are, in fact, hurting yourself.
               </p>
               <p>
                But evil is a trick--it's a disconnection from unity--and those who are lost (i.e., don't know their Rights), falsely believe it is ok to hurt another. Lately, this has been described as social Darwinism (survival of the fittest)--which is a central tenet of Satanism. Essentially, they believe hurting others is to their advantage.
               </p>
               <p>
                I could go on, but I hope you get the idea. Evil is a form of separation, but it is false/untrue/wrong/misled, etc.. Killing our egos is the hardest thing to do. Even those who seek Truth have a hard time getting over this hurdle. Evil is like cancer, wherein the only cure is Truth and Light. So, it is our job to keep shedding light on the darkness--we must do this with the generative principle of Care. That's what the 'G' in the freemason symbol stands for.
               </p>
               <p>
                In freemasonry--forget about the broken, dark, lodge system, by the way--in True Freemasonry, in order to get to the higher levels, one must be able to understand and answer the following question: How do you know that you are suffering? Answer: Because another is suffering. So, we must do The Great Work--shedding Light and Truth--to free this planet of its bondage.
               </p>
               <p>
                Know your Rights: A Right is an action, that when taken, does not cause harm to another sentient being.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pedophiles cause harm to others--effectively through theft of the innocence and self-dominion of another person. That is the definition of evil. So it is no surprise that evil steals, causes harm, ruins all things Good. They are one in the same. We have much work to do, but it starts with the Generative Principle of Care. A fair amount of that work is being done in this forum.

                It's actually more horrible than that. Head trauma causes black circles around the eyes. If you notice anyone with excessive bags under their eyes they were probably beaten severely and possibly regularly over a long period of time.

                 That symptom can be caused by many other things. An excessive drinking habit (even if it only started in adulthood) being a big one. Drug use (again, even if it doesn't start in childhood). A wide variety of serious-but-survivable illnesses in childhood. And even then abuse is far from the only reason children may suffer and survive serious head trauma. It can be a corroborating sign, sure, but don't go assuming anyone with big bags under their eyes or black circles has been abused as a child.

              There is a panda theme for pedo's, like with pizza, that triggers researchers. Could very well be a stretch as Seth was known to love pandas, which is actually quite normal. Fuzzy wittle sweet eat your face off bears.

            Amazing find. Yes his pursed lips look like an attempt not to smile, he was actually smiling when the camera started rolling. I can't decide if he's trying to not cry or not to smile, he's definitely holding himself back

             He acts weird for sure, but I think i think he's trying not to cry, PLUS feeling nervous/awkward in front of the camera as many people do.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's an interviewer standing next to the camera, and they tell you to look at the interviewer, not into the camera itself. It's hard to do (you can see Aaron's gaze keeps shifting) and many people end up looking awkward.
