<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  July 27, 2017</h2>
<p>Rebuttal Statement to Imran Awan’s Lawyers</p>
<p>As one of the online communities of citizens who have researched pedophilia rings for many months, we resent the implication that Mr. Imran Awan’s arrest is in any way a result of an alleged “alt-right-wing media” conspiracy or “anti-Muslim bigotry.”    For the record, we are not affiliated with any particular political party or media outlet; neither are we so dull-minded as to believe pedophiles are limited to any one ethnic, religious, socioeconomic, or political group.  
</p>
<p>Indeed, the Pizzagate/Pedogate scandal first ignited “in the heart of our democracy” as an outcry for law enforcement investigation in the fall of 2016, when WikiLeaks released a batch of over 50,000 DNC emails, wherein some content revealed suspicious correspondences that appeared to be using FBI –publicized code that pedophiles use to communicate. A simple internet search would quickly reveal to discerning individuals why any decent human being would become alarmed.  However, law enforcement officials’ reluctance to investigate –particularly that of the Washington DC Police --coupled with the lack of journalistic investigation on the part of the mainstream media, (who have occasionally lapsed into allegedly “debunking” and/or mocking our concerns), led many of us to research further.</p>
<p>Since that time, and because we are justifiably NOT confident in the integrity of the U.S. Justice system, countless hours of online research have ensued, leading to many nefarious associations that strongly implicate some public officials and/or servants may be, or may have been -- either through their own volition or through blackmailing schemes -- engaged in pedophilia, child pornography, human trafficking, organ harvesting, money laundering, and/or cover-up activities of international and epic proportion.   A comprehensive search of the preceding terms, would reveal substantial evidence to support our supposedly “outlandish” claims, along with MANY examples of previous scandals similar to those we suggest.  
</p>
<p>Frankly, given the plethora of evidence that suggest such shady dealings in the U.S. government, Mr. Awan appears as but one minor character in an A-list pandemonium cast.  To suggest that he has in some way been targeted by pizzagate researchers not only minimizes the nature of our plight, but insults the intelligence of the American public.</p>
<p>When we have prevailed in our fight for the unbiased investigation into the aforementioned activities, we too, look forward to examining the very “ugly political and media dynamics that have driven this controversy from the beginning.” Yet as we now live in an Orwellian-like society wherein Thought Police are guised as Mainstream Media “journalists” --who no longer are free to investigate that which runs contrary to their employers’ and advertisers’ interests-- we are not confident that our plight for children, their innocence, and a return to basic human decency will be fought by our politicians or public servants.  We will thus continue our efforts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Citizens Against Child Abuse</p>',

            Thank you.  I'd really appreciate if someone could Tweet that to @ Cernovich @ Alex Jones, etc and any other media that might be inclined to run with it.  Am not inclined to debate who is a shill and who is not and since I don't have Twitter and cannot provide a screen shot here any sharing via social networks is just overall appreciated.

            That's a great letter!  I just caution that it appears as though the attorney is steering the conversation towards Pizzagate in order to turn this into an Edgar Allan Welch type scenario.  We all know what's real, but just don't run off the rails. Stick with the facts because all of our comments are being monitored and this needs to be taken seriously.  This attorney has to send people away from what the Awan's were really up to &amp; I don't think that Imran Awan would really maintain a Youtube channel with CP tendencies when they are running 22 businesses, own 12 homes, &amp; run the BIGGEST spy ring in history in Congress as well as keeping the continuity of their father's crimes from Iran Contra &amp; Mena airport.  I could be wrong but I think the whole Youtube channel was a plant.  It would be in Arabic, with Muslim children, #ElsaGate is such a red flag, &amp; it would have been found in February when they were busted.  Looks like CrowdStrike to me.

             I agree, coreyfish.  We live in interesting times indeed.  I just thought so long as his lawyer was going to mention pizzagate we may as well present our side of the story.

              I agree with you 100%. I've been following this since Jeffery Epstein got out of "jail" &amp; I've watched how the news turned child trafficking into fake news.  It's a squirrel...look over here, not there. The MSM is so desperate to make us think that human trafficking &amp; child sex trafficking is so far fetched that this attorney will exploit #PizzaGate.  All that I'm trying to put out there is that we need to not get "squirreled" &amp; keep on message.  PizzaGate is going to get smeared in the MSM again &amp; we need to not act crazy about it.  Proof, facts, not smearing will get us farther in the fight then will being passionate (although I am too).  The attorney brought up PizzaGate for that reason, to provoke us.  Try not to fall into it otherwise it will end up like Comet Ping Pong &amp; "The Crazy Shooter."  Then the message is lost.  This is what the attorney, the Awans, the Dems, &amp; especially DWS wants.

            Hey Mammy!
           </p>
           <p>
            Before I screenshot this for a jpg to share on Twitter, could you edit the text that says:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             an alleged “alt-right-wing media” conspiracy
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            to read:  an alleged "ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media" conspiracy?
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the direct quote of the language the defense attorney used. Gotta dot our i's. :-)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, this part needs tweaking as well:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             when WikiLeaks released a batch of over 50,000 DNC emails, wherein some content revealed suspicious correspondences that appeared to be using FBI –publicized code that pedophiles use to communicate
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It was the Podesta emails as well as some references in the Stratfor Global Intelligence Files, not the DNC emails that seemed to contain pedo code (Podesta's pizza-related handkerchief) if I recall correctly. (Pizzagoats, pipe up if you recall any pedo code in the DNC emails!)
           </p>
           <p>
            You could edit your letter to be slightly less definitive on the point and it would be accurate, such as "when Wikileaks released a batch of 50,000 DNC and Podesta emails..."
           </p>

               LOL  Freudian slip?  I was thinking let's get this done FAST. lol   Fixed, anyway.   And yes, thank you, that's my favorite phrase in the whole darn letter, too.  Pandemonium=many devils, but I bet you already knew that.  ; )

            Good letter - upvoat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just an observation - the lawyers took the bizarre steop of mentioning "pizzagate" as a sort of code to elite criminals with pull who they want to get favors from for their client.  Who knows how much incriminating material Awan has on DNC operators and other government elites through pedo blackmail and trafficking schemes?   The lawyers are signaling - get my client sprung, wave a wand and give him some high level help OR ELSE.

              But it Got DELETED by Millennial Falcon two days in a row.  Says I broke Rule 1 and Rule 2.  For the love of God I just want that letter circulated and I really DON'T want credit for it.

             Never mind.  Seems to be still up despite notification I received.
