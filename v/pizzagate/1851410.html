<p>There was &quot;NO ACTIVE BOAT SEARCH !!!!&quot; This is whats creepy. Since she had been here she was actually going between bolinas and sausalito doing farm work out in Bolinas so alot of people knew her. Called her Lee. According to people I know in Sausalito, cops have been less than help ful. They could have used tracking stuff from sattelites.
 The boat she was last seen leaving is a drug boat, a multi million dollar boat owned by -how can i say what this guy is legally?. In my experience I know this person to have raped boys and drug them all thru my childhood. I dont know why hes not in jail maybe cause hes rich. I would call him a   pedophile drug lord from bolinas because thats my experience, if god forbid i had to testify to this, i would be able to name boys from my childhood that were raped by this guy...so...his billion dollar boat is called The Andora, that\'s where the missing girl,  was last seen leaving, I\'ve never been on the boat, its energetically just like the guys house, full of bad vibes people who are overdosing and dying or killing themselves by hanging etfuckingcetera!. It\'s pulled in toward the harbor and situated next to another multi-million doller boat rumored to be connected to drug and sex trafficking called the Taj Mahal. People say there is a cop in sausalito, facilitating illegal business out in Richardson bay drugs prostitution etc..And the girl , Its very very suspect she go missing so close to the harbor. 100-200 feet, while the two boats the Taj and the Andora sit next to each other, the most criminal boats in the harbor, right by where she went gone. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/amp/Woman-missing-after-kayaking-along-Sausalito-11060323.php">https://www.google.com/amp/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/amp/Woman-missing-after-kayaking-along-Sausalito-11060323.php</a></p>',

             The Andora is berthed next to the Taj and the girl Ashley was last seen leaving the Andora. Nasty not nice. Seemingly not her style either. Wrong fucking crowd.

             The words are mine I just get so sick of common place degeneracy, seeing it everyday, because Bolinas is so small, you grow up with each other. It hurts me to see. Ralph's house is a place on the cliff falling apart, and the people that go there think they found a nice man, till they find they lost their minds up there, and he's been fucking all the boys since we were little now we are all old.  Some of the boys didn't make it, or just can't be found, like Josh Pruis. So the Andora is the boat. People from Sausalito come thru Bolinas back and forth doing meth runs. The cops get pissed when they get calls to Bolinas, I can't imagine how they are on the bay. Cops tell me to stay away and be chill. Pretty mellow if you don't try try to inject yourself. I've gone to Ralph's to try to to shut it down,Ie. Save a friend. It's pretty stupid. The first time I went to r
"Rescue" a friend I tried to turn over a table and be all scary but the table wouldn't move it was bolted. Then i tried to pick something up and throw it. But everything on the table was too heavy! I shoved and shoved and finally knocked a heavy tool down. One of the main junkies standing there with his butane incendiary devices about to smoke meth was like, "can u get that person outta here?" To my friend. The other ti.e I went up there to shut it down was looking to rescue the same friend, got there and it was all mellow people playing guitar and smoking weed, they thought I was crazy. Last i went there was a different friend had his bike stolen, i said get in my truck, we went to Ralph's and there was his bike stolen by ralph's latest sausalito bay refugee -there are at least 3 new guys to Bolinas from Sausalito via Ralph's, all junkies. Yeah so I see this shit in bolinas then hear about the girl. Im like wtf? She was on Ralph's boat! Red Fucking flag
