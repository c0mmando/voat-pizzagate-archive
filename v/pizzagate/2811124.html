            I think things on their agenda. How else are they going to re-organise their supply of victims when the world is watching and are there basements/tunnels under this place of meeting?

              The Pink Palace.  I remember reading that Cdl. Bernadine was one of the worst.  This is not just about what we have discovered lately.  That Seminary and their sick gay parties there go back decades and decades.  God only knows what else goes on there.

            I am scared to death with what may happen there.  Aside from the fact that it is known as a Gay Haven called the Pink Palace, the thought of some Bohemian Grove SRA taking place is highly possible.  When Francis made his first trip to the US where did he decide to go?  To St Martin's Chapel at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary. That Seminary is where our own
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/StcharlesSeminary">
             @StcharlesSeminary
            </a>
            was raped in the Under Tunnels and where they committed SRA on her and many others for decades.  So Frances picks this place to visit. So now what do you think might
 take place at this "Pink Palace"?

            "To be men of prayer who act with integrity and transparency in their decisions, so as to be good shepherds who would never harm their people," he said. "As the church moves forward to seek healing and establish new policies of accountability, it will be necessary to forge better ties between bishops, priests and the laity."

            Three New Auxiliary Bishops for Chicago Are All Graduates Of The Same "Pink Palace" Class of 1994
           </p>
           <p>
            They all appear to be firmly aligned with the "social justice" wing of the Catholic priesthood, especially and unsurprisingly as it relates to Central America and Hispanic issues in general.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, most notably, all graduated from St. Mary of the Lake (known simply as "Mundelein") in the same year, 1994.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, this was at the height of the period where Mundelein was regarded as one of the most prominent "gay" seminaries in the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was nicknamed "The Pink Palace."

            Yesterday, Cardinal Cupich ordained three new auxiliary bishops for Chicago - Mark Bartosic, Robert Casey and Ronald Hicks.

           </p>
           <p>
            In Goodbye, Good Men, journalist Michael Rose uses numerous eyewitness accounts to paint a picture of the heavily charged homosexual atmosphere at Mundelein during the 1990's. Here is part of the testimony of then-seminarian Joseph Kellenyi:
           </p>
           <pre><code> "One hall in the seminary dorm," related Kellenyi," is nicknamed the 'Catwalk.' known as the residence of the more fashionable gays." "Catwalk," he explained, was a reference to the runways of fashion models, but also reflected the campy, feline-like personalities of those who lived in this area of the seminary. One member of the formation faculty in particular, he said, was known to take seminarians to high-profile gay events such as a popular gay production in Chicago's Lincoln Park. 

 According to Kellenyi and several other seminarians who attended Mundelein during the 1990's, one of the big events at the seminary was whenever a seminarian would "come out" as being a homosexually oriented person. The openly gay seminarians-to-be would do so by telling one or two of his closest friends, and, sure enough, the word of another "orientation proclamation," they said, would travel quickly throughout the halls of the seminary, especially to the formation faculty members. Oddly enough, attested Kellenyi, once a seminarian "came out," he would be wined and dined - literally - by certain faculty priests. "In my opinion," he said, "it's highly inappropriate to wine and dine any favorite students, orientation aside." But the special status given to openly gay seminarians, he said, is beyond the pale. 

 The gay subculture, said former Mundelein seminarians, was the dominant culture at Mundelein (p. 60).

            I have not visited this blog for awhile.  This article is Chuck Full of info of info that went on at this Fairy Fantasy for Priests.  Read about Fr. Paul Kalchick's story about Fr. Daniel McCornick that was finally sen to serve time, but he was saved by the bell may times before.  Can you just imagine what will be going on at the Pink Palace Seminary with Jorge and Blase?

            At this point, Francis should step back - voluntarily. And he should take all bishops and cardinals with him. Leave the Church to the people who really believe in JC.

             What?  And miss all that sick fun at Mundelein Seminary?  Aka  as the "Pink Palace".   I agree a step down is required.  But I don't think he would comply that easily.  It seems he can pull the wool over plenty of the flock's eyes.  At least the right ones that still keep him in power.  I can't believe the Faithful have not marched yet.  The one Boston is coming soon and Maybe there will be a protest crowd when he shows up in Chicago.

             ?  I notice he has not commented for 31 days.  This is highly unusual.  I am worried and have pinged him many times, without results.

              Just wondering what the penalty for willfully perpetuating a false narrative is going to be. I assume life in prison for pedophile helpers, maybe the death penalty would be more appropriate, I'm just not sure. Years of solitary confinement is a certainty. Pedophile enablers are worse than the pedophiles themselves. David Brock can phone call once a week to the people he previously employed in prison, can talk about how big of a faggot he is. Did Megyn Kelly get fired today? Maybe it's due to her love of James Alefantis (child torture expert).

               Its called aiding and abetting.  But considering the crime, well the sentence should be pretty tough.  Yes, lifetime in prison, no parole. Ever.   I don't have any feelings for these people. They made their bed, as it goes.  You know the saying, you do the crime, you do the time.  That's the law.  The law of the country and of man.
