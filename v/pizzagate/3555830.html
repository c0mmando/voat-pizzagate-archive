            Another important part is that he is confirming yet again, that the world basically runs on child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether he is telling the truth (he said he lies a lot), it seems he is doing some reflecting on his life, with much regret.  I don't think many of the degenerates do this...ever.  If they did, the world would be a much different place.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also confirms that it seems no one really cares if people in high places are corrupt.  So with that, the rampant child trafficking will continue until hundreds of thousands if not millions of people actually understand this.  When they do, there will be nothing but hell to pay.

            Child trafficking is most likely the biggest trading commodity in the world through all kinds of organizations.  Maybe the mafia runs it all?

            I watched the clips some time ago, and to me, it looks like a B movie actor having a rehearsal. Sorry.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not that it isn't true what he says - it just seems to be scripted, and the story that he was about to talk to the FBI the next day, and then just vanished, is just odd.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry, not buying that this is legit until I'll see some more information about this guy and the production team behind the YT clips.

             OK, I just found the clip you are probably referring to.
             <a href="https://youtu.be/SIGmyI4cUJk">
              https://youtu.be/SIGmyI4cUJk
             </a>
             Yep, it's 'out of context' if you've seen the full version, as I have, before seeing this clip. I can see how you would come to the determination you have if only viewing clips. I watched the full version this morning having never heard of him before. I heard his entire story, and all of it matches his face, voice, movements, and all that he says. It all checks out having heard the entire thing. But yes, this clip could EASILY be seen as bullshit. But as I watched the doc, I kept noticing how there is no way someone who didn't commit these things, and live the life he claims to have lived, coudl possibly look like he does. Those aren't actors eyes. Thosee are the eyes of someone who had murdered human beings, who never knew love from a parent, who only knew violence and lies. This is real, imo.

             Martin, who died in 1996, says that at the height of the Second Vatican Council in Rome, there was a ceremony to enthrone Lucifer in the Vatican (and the Chair of Peter). The church in question, Saint Paul’s chapel within the Vatican walls, hosted a very different rite of Mass on January 29, 1963, just one week after the election of Pope Paul VI. (Years later, according to Fr. Martin, Pope Paul VI would write a note to his successor, John Paul II, and tell him of this ceremony.) Paul VI is also famous for his statement, "The smoke of Satan has entered the sanctuary."
            </p>
            <p>
             For decades, this statement has been the source of much confusion and controversy, but when paired with Fr. Martin’s testimony, it fits like the lost part of a puzzle.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ceremony, Fr. Martin is on record as saying, was a Black Mass, or the Traditional Latin Mass said in reverse, complete with an animal sacrifice and a drugged young girl who may or may not have been the victim of ceremonial sexual rituals. The ceremony was not the Novus Ordo Mass because, in Fr. Martin’s words, "even the Satanists know that this Mass is not valid." Martin writes that the Black Mass was attended by high ranking prelates in the Church, important layman, business leaders and politicians. At least one Cardinal was in attendance. A concurrent "Enthronement of Satan" Black Mass was also held in South Carolina on that date.

             Fr. Malachi Martin's accusations
            </p>
            <p>
             In The Fatima Crusader article, Malachi Martin, a scholar, Vatican insider, and best-selling author, said, “Anybody who is acquainted with the state of affairs in the Vatican in the last 35 years is well aware that the prince of darkness has had and still has his surrogates in the court of St. Peter in Rome.”
            </p>
            <p>
             From 1958 until 1964, Jesuit priest Malachi Martin served in Rome where he was a close associate of, and carried out many sensitive missions for the renowned Jesuit Cardinal Augustin Bea and the pope. Released afterwards from his vows of poverty and obedience at his own request (but still a priest), he ultimately moved to New York and became a best-selling writer of fiction and non-fiction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Martin had first made reference to a diabolic rite held in Rome in his 1990 non-fiction best-seller about geopolitics and the Vatican, The Keys of This Blood, in which he wrote:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Most frighteningly for [Pope] John Paul [II], he had come up against the irremovable presence of a malign strength in his own Vatican and in certain bishops’ chanceries. It was what knowledgeable Churchmen called the ‘superforce.’ Rumors, always difficult to verify, tied its installation to the beginning of Pope Paul VI’s reign in 1963. Indeed Paul had alluded somberly to ‘the smoke of Satan which has entered the Sanctuary’. . . an oblique reference to an enthronement ceremony by Satanists in the Vatican. Besides, the incidence of Satanic pedophilia—rites and practices— was already documented among certain bishops and priests as widely dispersed as Turin, in Italy, and South Carolina, in the United States. The cultic acts of Satanic pedophilia are considered by professionals to be the culmination of the Fallen Archangel’s rites." (p. 632)
            </p>
            <p>
             These allegations have largely gone unnoticed, possibly because he was so crafty in his descriptions that he might even have been referring to the coronation of Pope Paul VI. But he revealed much more about this alleged ritual in one of his last works, Windswept House: A Vatican Novel (1996). In this story, he vividly described a ceremony called “The Enthronement of the Fallen Archangel Lucifer” supposedly held in St. Paul’s Chapel in the Vatican, but linked with concurrent satanic rites here in the U.S., on June 29, 1963, barely a week after the election of Paul VI. In the novel, before he dies, a pope leaves a secret account of the situation on his desk for the next occupant of the throne of Peter, a thinly-disguised John Paul II.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to The New American, Martin confirmed that the ceremony did indeed occur as he had described. “Oh yes, it is true; very much so,” the magazine reported he said. “But the only way I could put that down into print is in novelistic form.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Martin's accusation of a satanic ritual at the Vatican was also confirmed by John Loeffler, host of the Steel on Steel radio show.  Mr. Loeffler personally asked Fr. Malachi Martin (who had been a regular guest on his show) about the reported dedication to satan within the Vatican:
            </p>
            <p>
             "You know Malachi confirmed—the first part of his book, Windswept House—he confirmed the dedication of the Vatican to satan in a secret ceremony that occurred unknown even to the Pope at that time, that he managed to pick up. And I did ask him, 'Was this true? Did it happen?' And he [Fr. Martin] said, 'yes, it did.'" - John Loeffler (July 29, 2000 radio show)
            </p>
            <p>
             Fr. Malachi Martin said more members of the clergy are becoming aware of the situation. An archbishop several years ago also accused high members of the hierarchy in Rome of practicing satanism. The Italian newspaper Il Tempo and other major daily papers reported this stunning news (Italian newspaper articles).
