<p>A man by the name of <a href="https://twitter.com/waderobsonallys">Michael Parziale</a>, contacted me on Twitter urging me to help spread the word about a memorial called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/waderobsonsupporters">Project Arc Angelo</a>, you can also hear his interview on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FImajT7fu-E&amp;feature=youtu.be">Opperman Report</a>. This memorial is being set up for a young boy who was murdered in a snuff film featured on Facebook. The video, which was reported for a whole year by Michael and others, was only just recently taken down. The video is EXTREMELY graphic and illegal if downloaded. It depicts a boy being decapitated by foreign men and it was featured on a demented pedosadist\'s Facebook page. I have reported to ic3.gov and Interpol.</p>
<p>The Facebook profile is of a man who calls himself, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100018951363967">Richard Dickeson</a>, he posts violent gore, child exploitation, and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2279892">harasses #pedogate and #pizzagate researchers</a> on Voat and Facebook. For some reason this sick individual, regardless of how many times we report him/her, the page remains up... he even has a link to a suspect <a href="http://archive.is/1VNSh">image of a pizza</a> that may have metadata or pictures within pictures. The page has been archived but I will not be providing the archived version that has the snuff video.</p>

            I don't think like that. I was mainly stating that they probably had sex because I heard that both of them are in CIA families and she was part of a compromise op. I don't know if she was raped or by him, but at some point she was probably exploited at the very least. I also don't believe people who wait that long but there is a small chance that they might be telling the truth. Most people don't believe her particular allegations, simply because they are uncorroborated and there are too many political issues at place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as there are all kinds of reasons why someone might lie there are all kinds of reasons why victims stay silent. This is especially true for people who are brainwashed or exploited over a long period of time or who are told to stay silent or they'll suffer worse retaliation. In my case I actually didn't want to report it at first and I only did so later on knowing that nobody would believe me but feeling like I had to stand up to my rapist. I have a friend who was able to get her rapist in prison years later.
           </p>

            I am saying that even if you had sex with the person it's very easy to claim it was actually consensual, so a rape kit isn't going to be conclusive. Rape cases are always he said she said and without a confession or some type of video footage, witnesses, etc. every case in my mind is going to be without the type of proof necessary under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.
           </p>
           <p>
            Children get more credibility than adults who are raped because they're underage and can't consent. But adult women do get violently assaulted all the time and they are almost never believed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I never said guilty until proven innocent. I have a background in criminal defense work and I tend to think prosecutors are overzealous and tend towards lying.

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/kevdude">
             @kevdude
            </a>
            , of course I do not think that there are never any false accusations. MeToo at least in my mind was about women being afraid to speak out being given courage from other survivors to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            The exact reason why most people do not report is because they know nobody will believe them. Even if you report the same day you're not believed. Out of every 1000 rape reports only 6 people see a day in prison or jail.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Christine Blasey Ford incident was a huge slap in the face to rape victims and although I have no doubt in my mind that Kavanaugh and she probably did sleep together at some point I have no reason to want to believe her. She was allegedly used in compromise by her CIA dad but for all I know that might be disinformation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just don't go around loosely mocking rape victims and making fun of them so if I overreacted to his comment then I apologize but it is a sensitive topic for me and it brings back some traumatic memories and feelings of being abused, stalked, lied about and harassed, as well as subjected to false reports, legal coercion and humiliation for the past 7 years by my ex, as well as being humiliated and coerced for a long time while we were married.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would greatly appreciate it if people didn't come on here and accuse me of lying about being raped just because I reply to someone you do not like.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not talking about just this one comment. The mods have been attacking me since Jenny Moore died and I sympathized with her. But it all started when I replied to ES and Eric didn't like it.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's ok, I'm trying to focus on what matters and to me that is trying my best to be a contributing member of society which includes speaking out if I know something.

              Actually many of the shills may be pedo's and were molested. Who knows. I mean, you probably want pedos to do damage control for pedos on a site that attempts to shine light on the Systematic kidnap, rape torture murder of children by our government, agencies, and entire state apparatus.

               Every single one of you low-quality shill fucks that is only here to subvert this place tries to make some kind of snarky comment to make yourself seem human.  It doesn't work, and you just look stupid - every time.

                   Her OpSec is not my responsibility, and you just changed what you were referencing on the opinion-fact subject.  Seriously, EYJP, do you see how he argues?  This is the guy you're defending.

                  , I have more screenshots than what you see in the Honeybee video. I linked some of them on other posts. I have some on my laptop under a file with his name on it. I also showed them to my parents, cops, and my husband and printed them out. I didn't provide links to every single screenshot but I do have them. The reason is because I didn't watch his snuff film and don't intend to but I do have the FB screenshots of what he tried to send me, that I didn't click on.

Or you can just go to the links that gamepwn provided and honeybee provided and look through my steemit blog. Some of them are on there. I have to go get my stuff done and take care of my kids now.

                 Esoteric is KNOWN to be nothing but a lying shitstirrer that pretends to be your friend as long as you agree with him.  He holds his approval hostage based on your actions.

                <p>
                 Try it - try disagreeing with Esoteric on something and see how he acts.

                 Everyone associated with him is suspect, IMO; if you're just a victim, then it's on you to make better choices moving forward.

                  If you look through the screenshots in my comment above it has a screenshot of her tagging my username on Voat. There is also a screenshot of her on her video showing a link to my Steemit blog, the same one I link to on here at the top of my profile. I'll send you the other screenshots when I find them. My computer is kind of disorganized. I didn't put up a Richard Dickeson only post because I don't like looking at his page as it is kind of traumatizing for me to look at. But I'll do it soon. Have a good night.

               I don't know. I also don't care. I have a real life too. I will mostly be on the river all this week drowning crickets on a fish hook. There ain't a whole lot he can do to ruin my day. I don't take this internet shit personally. If he wants to ban me for speaking my opinion i'm cool with that too. I honestly don't give a fuck a fuck. This is the place I currently try to expose pedophiles. If he bans me for having an opinion I will just move somewhere else or maybe start a blog.

               I have been doing this shit for almost 23 years. This forum is a blip on the radar compared to what I have been through in real with fighting these damn pedo monsters. I have a pretty intense real life history with this crazy shit, crazier than most would believe. I'm not worried about it.

               There is another movie with open pedophilia and it's a Disney film. I can't remember the name of it but my husband did a video for a class project and he has it somewhere. It stars Jennifer Garner. I'll have to look it up.

                   I try not to watch most of what comes out from Hollywood these days. For years I missed some of these major films that my husband actually saw because he was really into movies as a kid before we met. My ex never "allowed" me to go to movies that he didn't also want to see because he only wanted to see them if they were given 5 stars on some movie review website he saw. I should have ditched him in the beginning when he offered me a date at Taco Bell.

                    Exactly ! This poor poor generation ! But looking back at videos I use to watch with my kids and thought they were so innocent and today we’re finding out there was always subliminal messaging in Disney movies .  This just infuriates me . There always has to be a murder in even the most seemingly innocent Disney movies . Smh

              Do you still have those FBI criminal complaint forms? We really need to get evidence to the FBI so they can make some arrest.

             <p>
              Why are you worried about "Cheese Pizza" being used before the Podesta email leak?  It was in use on 4chan since 2004.  We know this.  We also know something else  "Cheese Pizza" was never used a single time by anyone in John Podesta's emails. Zero use of "cheese pizza."  In fact, no code was used Podesta's emails.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know  that there was a fake code list posted by an anonymous internet user.  However the list is a complete fraud BECAUSE THAT LIST is the one for which there's no evidence before the Podesta leak.

              We know that Cheese Pizza comes from the term CP widely used on places like 4chan for Child Pornography.  In fact, it was so widely used POST CP was a meme

               Post CP is an acronym in which CP can have a variety of meanings. Initially used as an acronym for 4chan posters to indirectly mention or request a child pornography thread, in later years the acronym became commonly associated with the posting of other subjects with the same first letters (C &amp; P, most notably "Cheese Pizza") to parody prohibited request threads or to troll those who hope to find child pornography.

              Cheese Pizza not only has nothing to do with Podesta it doesn't even match the fake podesta code list.
             </h1>
             <p>
              Cheese Pizza is a 4chan joke for CP aka Child Porn.  Cheese Pizza is never mentioned by Podesta in his emails or anyone else in his emails.  Search wikileaks.  It appears zero times.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now let's look at the fake code list.   This is completely a HOAX list of words that was created AFTER the PODESTA leak.  Software to analyze datasets for commonly used words are really easy to use.  Can you tell what this word cloud is about?

             </p>
             <p>
              Here's the fake code list.
              <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2016/12/07/pizzagate/daaa6b3b2a4ae2f0d1d1a18456d77ed4436b8ca0/images/4chan-terms.png">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              According this HOAX, pizza is girl and cheese is little girl.  So cheese pizza is Little Girl Girl which makes no sense.  This is to be expected because this is completely fake list of code that has nothing to do with Podesta.  You still see people claim that this list came from the FBI.  It Didn't.  Or that it came from Wikileaks.  It didn't.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's a hoax.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's pretty funny to think John Podesta would use 4chan memes, but people really got invested in this to the point where Honeybee is still confusing this two years later.

                  Absolutely not code.  Food maps, particularly of Italy are pretty common graphics.  You can find them with regional wines or regional pastas and you can certainly find them with pizza.

                  This is pretty clearly is Tony asking if John has time for a quick bite.   Getting pizza over a fancier dinner means you know you can get in an out quickly, because pizza cooks fast.    It actually make far less sense if you are thinking about it in terms of child abuse.

                  This simply means playing dominoes with a belly full of cheese or pasta.   It's like saying on coffee or on drugs.  The context of the email makes this clear, Podesta used to give out pasta as Christmas gifts and changed to giving out cheese.

                  This was gossip from a guy in Texas who had no inside information about the Obama White House.  In fact, he hated Obama and was repeating a fake right wing story about a real pizza party Obama had.  The expense was not supposed be the Pizza and hot dogs itself....and hot dogs were not even involved....but the cost to taxpayers to fly them in.  It was a fake story about Obama wasting money.  From a prevous comment.

A guy who worked in Texas with no first hand knowledge of the White House and certainly not an Obama insider, he hated Obama. AND he just repeating a fake story that was going around on the right wing blogs and talk shows. After Obama had the pizza chef of a St Louis Pizzeria come to the White House to make pizza, right wing blogs started saying he wasted a bunch of taxpayer money just to eat pizza. (Actually the pizza chef bought the ingredients himself.)

                   Even if you are right, that doesn't mean that they're "obviously" about food. You would have to know about Italian food maps, and suss out the weird language as no one says, "I did X on pasta/cheese." You do things "on" drugs or possibly people, not food. "I watched that movie on acid," "I was high on pot," etc.

                    I never said obviously and you are turning this whole thing around.   Great claims require great evidence.  The burden of proof is on the people making this wild claim.  Since they are making such a great claim, their arguments should be viewed with the highest skeptcism and they never came close to meeting this burden. The ones claiming its code is used had any real evidence at all for that claim.

                    And Let's remember they were not conducting an investigation in good faith.  They were perpetrating a deliberate fraud with the intent of making their political enemies look guilty.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    However, if you were conducting an investigation in good faith, you don't have to know about Italian food maps or suss out weird language to know that just because you are confused by what strangers are talking about you can't simply make a a giant leap of speculation and assume their guilty.  That's not good faith, that's not intellectually honest.  That's determining someone is guilty before you look at the evidence, that's manufacturing the proof of guilt by manipulating evidence.

                    I don't think it's obvious or expect most Americans to know about pasta with walnut sauce, but it's a real Italian dish and I know that because I looked into and this is why my explanations to you are CORRECT. Yes, there linens with maps and pizza do exist and in fact are common. You can't simply assume pasta with walnut sauce is code simply because it sounds strange to you. That's not a good investigation. Your suspicion is not evidence  You can't manufacture evidence from your own ignorance.   The entire evidence that pasta with walnut sauce is code is it sounds weird to most people because they never heard of it.  However, if someone spent 15 seconds investigating the claim about walnut sauce you would know it's not.  You can get all these recipes and many more within 15 seconds via a google search.

                    If you spent a little more time investigating you find it's from Ligurian in Northern Italy, same place pesto (basil and pinenuts) sauce is from AND where Podesta's family is from.

                    Spend a lot more time investigating and you would find John Podesta is a serious foodie (as an Italian it never struck me as odd to be spending so much time talking about food, especially pizza) and a gourmet cook and you can find his walnut sauce recipe online

                    Just a starting point for a good faith investigation, it's just highly unlikely for any code to be used in private emails between friends.  It's also pretty improbable for outsiders to exactly crack that code. It would be odd for a small group of people who are knew each other to use a pre-existing code known to others. A honest investigation involves humility and being aware of what you know for a fact and what you don't.

                     True enough.  The real evidence is Tony's child porn "art." Nobody normal collects such things, no matter how much you write in defence, same as someone decorating their den with Holocaust photos or photos of crime victims.

                       People into Beyonce don't share my tastes, but I don't call them anything.  It's child porn. I have dealt with paedos in the past who appealed to "art" as justification for hentai of eight year olds and tentacles, or compared CP to Renaissance cherubs.

                       I like Aubrey Beardsley.  Beardsley was accused of being a homosexual because he hung out with people like Oscar Wilde. I'm not homosexual, but I know that it carries that connotation and don't whinge about "muh art" if people remark on my Beardsley bric a brac.

               Teenage drama. I'm getting burned out on it. I miss the days when the good researchers were here at the sub.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fall is here and winter is coming. I have other shit to do anyway. I need to winterize the motorhome. I need to plant Rye grass in the yard on the side of my house. This is Rye grass planting season but i'm gonna wait one week when the cool snap rolls in. I need to put another heater in the houseboat because i'm not gonna winterize it, i'm gonna stay in it some more until shit freezes over.
              </p>
              <p>
               I just put siding on a house. I have one more house to put siding on. I have plenty of shit to do. This sub was sort of an escape from my real life but now I think I should escape from this sub because the gubmint here is into controlling mindthink.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm bored as hell. I might get a Mavic Pro drone and fly it around and look for wild pigs. I dunno....

              has been victimized. He is the victim of a downvote. I can tell that you are honest about your horrible experience and that your feelings are genuinely hurt. You are a brave man for speaking out. I will examine any and all evidence put forward and I will do so meticulous.
             </p>
             <p>
              First, thank you for allowing me to make my statement. I wrote it myself, no one has seen a draft, or it. This is my statement.

              has publicly accused me of an unprovoked downvoate on his comment above. I deny this allegation categorically and unequivocally. I am innocent.

             <p>
              I demand an bipartisan investigation to clear my good Swedish name. I will not let my reputation be drag thru the mud because of some baseless allegations. I am being MeToo'd

              is also a victim of a downvote that I am being blamed for. This aggression against me will not stand. I am innocent.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe you both when you say you've been victimized and I think both of you are brave for speaking out, even though you may appear weak and pathetic in the eyes of others. As a community I honestly believe we will overcome this serial assault and that we together can prevent this from ever happening again. WWG1WGA

               There are a group of posters who make the same allegations as esoteric and continuously whine that people follow them areoind and downvoat every comment they make. I'm beginning to think all these people are either the same person or a group working together.

               Just another mod having adversarial relationships with the members, trolling them and downvoating them instead of being impartial moderators. My stalkers delete my threads and send me pm's saying "Deal with it!". Pedo pedo pedo mods roam our halls.

               You know what is more pathetic than this? The day that you first accused me of being a shill for responding to him. Also, the time that you called me a cunt, oh wait, that was like 100 times. I read through your other comments and see how nice you are to other people. It seems that you can't handle it when other people talk to people you don't like. That's kind of controlling.

                There are some things I wouldn't have the guts to mock and MeToo is one of them. Especially on a post about the man sending me retaliatory child snuff films. I think Erik forgot why he came to this board in the first place.

                 about the Q thing but i'm not hostile about it. When he and I spar about it we don't even down vote each other. We may even joke about it later. But Eric, he is a toxic and doesn't belong here.

                  Vindy is worst mod in this sub. Deletes and labels any threads exposing Trump, promotes Q, deletes threads about the Canadian holocaust of children.

                           In order for you to make that happen you need to send some goons to the river where I will be fishing and have them "accidentally boat accident me" because other than that you can't ruin my week. I don't take this internet shit as seriously as you do, obviously............

                           Tell it to my my houseboat, bassboat, big screen TV/ with wifi, and these damn ducks that shit all over the back deck on my houseboat. I need to stop feeding them Cheerios because now they sit on the back deck of the boat and wait for Cheerios, while they shit. Now THAT sort of pisses me off, but you don't piss me off. My life is wayyyyy too good to let you get under my skin.

                  You never know who you're really talking to on the internet. Voat is the only place I've ever hung out on for long periods of time where everyone except me is using anonymous alts. I have a bad memory for usernames and passwords and too many things going on with all my children so I always end up re-identifying myself to my friends on here when I lose my account.

               Yep. I tried reporting him months ago and nothing happened. Every time I make a report to the FBI or try to report to the police, nothing happens. I did try to file a report in person at my house and the officer saw Richard Dickeson's photos on my computer on the FB profile and he actually started to cringe and said to report it to the FBI. But surprise surprise, the FBI does not care. Whoever that person is, there was other stuff on his profile in the past that's gone now. He had linked directly to my steemit blog or voat post in the past. I'm positive he's CIA and I'll never get any action on him. If only we lived in a country that didn't encourage this stuff secretly behind closed doors instead of harassing the people that report it.
