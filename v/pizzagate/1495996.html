            It's the same reason Colbert was cleared of suspicion in my mind after he flipped out on his show over pizzagate. Colbert is still a massive douchebag, but the wikileaks email mentioning him came up on the conspiracy theory reddit forums, some people implied suspecting him of being a pedophile, and the very next thing we know he flipping the hell out on his show about how he is not involved and it's all bullshit and people on reddit need to grow the fuck up etc. Irrational, overly-emotional reaction to a handful of people in a corner of Reddit that usually has about 1,000 active users when there are over 300 million people in the U.S. alone. Even though he tried to act cocky, it was clear that he had a panic reaction which means that he likely does not feel protected and above the law or public opinion. I did think it was pretty stupid for people to automatically assume he was a pedo, corrupt and in bed with the establishment, yes, but no evidence of being a pedo, but his reaction did at least speak to his humanity. There wasn't the cold, calculating, smug aloofness and duper's delight thing going on seen in powerful psychopaths. Like Podesta.

             This is an extremely odd overall reaction that seriously needs evaluation from psychological experts
