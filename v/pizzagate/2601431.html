            Hollywood sucks!! Have you all figured this out yet? They don't care about my children or your children, they care about their own bullshit lives and wouldn't cross a street to piss on you, they won't help ANYONE! I know, I worked there in that industry for over 20 years! The charities they have, they are posers! With PR people wanting us to believe they care. THEY DON'T!!!!!

             The teachers told me that computers and satellite communication system were installed and maintained by Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the MIT Media Lab. “Nick was a frequent visitor and one of the orphanage sponsors who arranged the weekend pajama parties in the city whenever foreign VIPs arrived,” a teacher told me. “Since he gave us the computer equipment, our staff was in no position to say no. The average age of the abused orphans was 10 years old.”
