<p>CLERMONT COUNTY, Ohio (FOX19) - The second of two men charged in a child sex abuse case police called the worst they’d ever seen was sentenced Friday.</p>
<p>Joseph Suder, 36, was arrested in January on child rape and child porn charges.</p>
<p>Suder pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual acts involving children, down from 51, on January 29.</p>
<p>He was sentenced to 60 years in prison.</p>
<p>The other man involved in the case, William Bustillos, 25, pleaded guilty to two counts of rape in Clermont County Court on March 30. He is now serving a 20-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the charges against Suder stem from instances of sexual abuse at the Oakwood Apartments in Milford.</p>
<p>Suder reportedly supplied a child to Bustillos to sexually assault at an apartment in Lockland.</p>
<p>Lockland police say they found pornographic images, including child bestiality, on phones belonging to Bustillos and Suder during rape investigations in Clermont and Hamilton counties.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen bad before but this was the absolute worst I’ve ever seen. I hardly slept last night because of it,” Lockland Police Sgt. Chris Lind said at the time of Bustillos’s arrest.</p>
<p>“His apartment was basically set up as a sex room. His bedroom included a bed with nets to mount cameras to record sex acts and a little satanic ritual set up with cameras satanic totems. He had dildos in the showers and these pictures of these kids in the shower with the dildos.&quot;</p>
<p>Reports indicate there are multiple victims.</p>
<p>The relative of one victim told FOX19 NOW Suder had been selling pictures of the children and that police have photo albums full of pictures, some depicting children they have not yet identified.</p>

            Hello New here I am searching for anyone else who was a victim or even acquaintance of Jeffrey Epstein at Interlochen Music Camp in Michigan. Anytime, but particularly early 90s or late 80s. My name is Joy, I auditioned for Interlochen Music Camp in Jr high, as a dancer and singer. After reading all the Epstein news stories, I am trying to make sense of the abuse I went through and who all was involved. I don't think I should name names but I remember my 5 fellows and we were all from Oakland County Michigan, same as Sarah Ruth Ashcraft, who said she was abused by Tom Hanks. I know I am not alone in this. We auditioned ensemble for voice, piano, cello, violin or viola and maybe more. And we were recorded. I am looking so hard to find those other Jr high or other students I auditioned with, question, as I sure some or all of you remember what happened. Please contact me so we can put this puzzle together and even press charges. Please contact me even if you do not want to press charges. I hope you have healed and I want to be in this together for justice. I hope to connect with the others from ensemble and audition. Thanks from California

             Moderators, is this worth flaring? Sometimes I don’t know if commentators are journalists or law enforcement (or Skippy, LOL) digging for dirt... or genuine victims. You guys have a better idea than me.

            There is no cure for pedos, capital punishment is the only solution. Several years ago I honestly did not realize the extensive network or the almost unbelievable number of these perverts, we HAVE to get them off of our planet!

              Electric eels are but one species of eel.

            GOD BLESS THESE MEN. THEY ARE INNOCENT !! THEY HAVE RIGHTS. THEY WERE ONLY SHOWING LOVE TO A CHILD. PERFECTLY LEGAL IN MY RELIGION!!!!! THEY WILL WIN THE APPEAL AND I WILL HELP THEM AND FUND THEM. FUCK YOU ALL FAGGOTS
           </p>

            I just stuck my finger in some mayonnaise then I shoved it up my 3 year old stepson's asshole. I told him not to tell. I am going to use this with my COCK in his FARTHOLE tomorrow. Wish me luck!!
           </p>
           <p>
            I CAN SAY THAT FUCKING A LITTLE GIRL IS HEAVEN. I FUCK ONES AS YOUNG AS 4. YOU CAN'T GET IT ALL THE WAY IN BUT IT STILL FEELS NICE. BUST AGE IS 12-14 AND I LOVE FUCK TEENS BECAUSE THEIR CUNTS CAN SWALLOW IT ALL!!!! MY PROFILE PIC IS ONE OF THE GIRLS IN MY BIBLE STUDY. SHE LISTENS AND SPREADS HER LEGS "FAR AND WIDE'!!! A GOOD GIRL. UNLIKE THE WHITE REGARD OR ALL NIGGERS, SHE OBEYS!
           </p>
           <p>
            I am loving the fact I am fucking my stepdaughter's TIGHT 14 year old PUSSY as my WIFE is a ESSENTIAL NURSE. SHE IS SO TIGHT and man you should see her buck those HIPS. I am coming all over her tits that are almost C cups that need no bra. She climbed on me the first time as I am on the phone with "Mommy" asking her to pick up Taco-Bell. I made Sharon CUM while on the phone with her MOM. How hot is this. GOD I hope more people (esp NIGGERS) die of this virus so I can keep FUCKING AND SUCKING!!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            What makes me smile is when I put some mayo on my finger and shove it in the rectum of a child. Love french kissing little girls and feeling their tiny tongues on my cock as I blow a WAD in their little mouths! Then we get CANDY!! Jesus is LORD he is OUR LAMB!
           </p>
           <p>
            I love fucking little girls. something about forcing an over sized penis in a tiny slit makes me hard. i feel little girls want it. around 9 they start shoving hot dogs and crayons in their honey holes so that tells me they want cock. using lube does help but god i love when it is in and blow a load all over their faces and tongues. god bless little girls.

            I know of what they are talking about since a local group was arrested for selling the same stuff (via IRC ...) like 10 years ago . Our media were more descriptive and trust me you don't want to know. It is interesting to learn if the group that created those videos/photos are taken out and the material is only recycled or if they are still active . Ohio police has to conduct Interpol .
