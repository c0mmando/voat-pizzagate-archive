Here is the direct link:  <a href="https://careers-uscsalvationarmy.icims.com/jobs/2964/anti-human-trafficking--case-manager/job">https://careers-uscsalvationarmy.icims.com/jobs/2964/anti-human-trafficking--case-manager/job</a></p>
<p>I think this could be valuable to PG researchers in many ways.  First, the site lists agencies/organizations that Salvation Army partners with in their anti-trafficking work.  They list ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING INITIATIVE (AHTI) and JOINT ANTI TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE (JATT) and others.  It could be valuable to research these and see what clues they give us-- is Salvation Army on our side?  Or are they aligned with nefarious powers?   Does the job description contain tasks that seem to really help victims/survivors?  Or the opposite?  Why just this one job listing in the entire country?  The location of it is on the border of Michigan, Ohio, and Canada, so I can see that there are extra risk-factors for trafficking and likely high rates of trafficking in that location.  
</p>
<p>I see that the prospective Anti-Human Trafficking Case Manager is to work closely with the State Police-- does that lead us to think that Salvation Army\'s help toward human trafficking victims could be compromised in any way?  Especially since we have read stories here about victims stating the police were involved in their abuse.</p>
<p>I also thought this would be an interesting take on PG research.  We are usually looking into alleged abusers and alleged abuse, but this is taking a look at a major organization that claims to be working hard to FIGHT human trafficking.  Perhaps they are legit; if so, maybe we can learn from the information on trafficking that they have on their websites.  I wonder what their track record is in terms of helping survivors/victims.  
</p>
<p>Our research has given us reason to believe that many so-called helpers are often compromised, as in: Wolves in Sheep\'s Clothing.  I hope that is not the case with Salvation Army.</p>',
