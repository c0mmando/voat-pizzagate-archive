<p>DONALD JAMES HAMRICK  - Possible CIA connection </p>
<p>Frontiers of Science Fellowship (F.O.S.F.) was founded by Donald James Hamrick (born December 13, 1935), in 1967. The fellowship was initially located at Redwood Drive, in San Rafael. Hamrick obtained a resort property, in 1967. As the property had been vandalized, much restoration was required. The resort was converted into a commune named Harbinger (Harbinger Community), for a core group of between 120 and 140 people. Harbinger became the new home for Frontiers of Science Fellowship, from 1967 to 1969. The Harbinger facility was located on 1,085 acres, in Lake County, California, about 100 miles north of the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>Harbinger University
Introduction to Harbinger University
(written by Donald James Hamrick, 1968)</p>
<p>Chemistry
Chemistry classes were taught by Dr. Alan Schein, Ph.D.
Hamrick had told particular participants that if they didn\'t stop using drugs he would leave the facility. Schein persevered as long as he could, but he finally left Harbinger Community. High students in his classes was a serious issue for him. The loss of Schein was a real set-back for Hamrick, personally, and for the community.</p>
<p>Class Series I: Physiology of the Higher Bodies
These classes were taught by Don Hamrick. All sessions were audio recorded.</p>
<p>Class Series II: The Skills of the New Man
These classes were taught by Don Hamrick. All sessions were audio recorded.</p>
<p>Audio Recordings and Transcriptions
Introduction to the Lecture Series
(originally written by a Harbingerite, 1968; revised and updated by ECOhealth, 2010)</p>
<p>Lecture Circuit
Don Hamrick, as a pilot, flew a Cessna Twin C1J from one destination to another, 23 - 24 times per month, for a sold year and a half, from 1967 to 1969. He was usually accompanied by Owen Jones, one of the three directors, for Frontiers of Science Fellowship. Owen was also a physicist and pilot.
Hamrick presented one to two hour lectures, and sometimes entire conferences, extended over a few days. Lectures were received by audiences at university and college campuses, in conference hotels and sometimes in people\'s homes.</p>
<p>A number of scientists were on board. More particularly, Alan Schein, a chemist and chemistry teacher, and Don Hamrick, invested much time and effort together, developing cost-effective metallurgical means to extract platinum from tailings.</p>
<p>With his physics background, Hamrick had previously been responsible for the research and development, and the patent filing, of a number of highly sophisticated medical, musical (sound, switching), and machining apparatus and methodologies. Owned by scientific companies and laboratories, none of the patents were filed by him personally.
Life Style Research
In 1968, Psychology Today Magazine sent out journalist, Tim Thompson, to spend a number of days living at Harbinger Community and participating in F.O.S.F. activities. Thompson wrote an article about the &quot;life style research&quot; that was being conducted at the facility. The article was published in Careers Today Magazine.
Clothing was optional at the facility. There was one large clothes closet for everyone living on site.</p>
<p>Harbingerites welcomed people from outside of the commune (community) to enjoy exercise and the therapeutic effects of the various springs and pools on site. Water therapy was taught to therapists and was provided to F.O.S.F. participants and to visitors, during the Harbinger era. The Watsu technique for water massage therapy was later developed and coined, at the Harbin Hot Springs community and therapeutic facility, in 1980.
A number of people who learned different modalities of massage went on to become licensed practitioners after the Harbinger era.</p>
<p>Meditation, ZaZen, Mindfulness,
Hypnosis and The Power of Intent
Don Hamrick had unique styles of meditation and hypnosis, incorporating the best approaches from various guides that he had studied and also what he gained through his near-death experience. He shared this in Group Actions (described below), as well as in individual and group sessions.</p>
<p>Arthur Ford had taught him how to get out of the back of his eyes. He had studied meditation and ZaZen with Zen monks from Riotakeshe, Japan. He had also worked with a number of psychologists and mediums to understand states of consciousness: Dr. Enid Smith, Ph.D. (see ref), a psychic Josephine, in the early 1960\'s, Drs. Wayne Guthrie and Bella Karish, Ph.D., of the Fellowship for Universal Guidance (see ref). Dr. He also studied the works of North American Indians, shamans of various cultures, Hawaiian Huna and the prayer, meditation and chanting of Tibetan Buddhists.
He also employed techniques of meditation, mindfulness, hypnosis and intent which he had gathered from reading the writings of Carlos Castaneda, Jane Roberts, Dr. John C. Lilly, M.D., Stanislav Grof, Dr. Walter Panke, M.D., Dr. Dennis Kelsey, Ph.D., and the efforts of Milton Erickson, Richard Bandler and John Grinder.</p>

           Lecture Circuit
Don Hamrick, as a pilot, flew a Cessna Twin C1J from one destination to another, 23 - 24 times per month, for a sold year and a half, from 1967 to 1969. He was usually accompanied by Owen Jones, one of the three directors, for Frontiers of Science Fellowship. Owen was also a physicist and pilot.
Hamrick presented one to two hour lectures, and sometimes entire conferences, extended over a few days. Lectures were received by audiences at university and college campuses, in conference hotels and sometimes in people's homes.
          </p>
          <p>
           A number of scientists were on board. More particularly, Alan Schein, a chemist and chemistry teacher, and Don Hamrick, invested much time and effort together, developing cost-effective metallurgical means to extract platinum from tailings.
          </p>
          <p>
           With his physics background, Hamrick had previously been responsible for the research and development, and the patent filing, of a number of highly sophisticated medical, musical (sound, switching), and machining apparatus and methodologies. Owned by scientific companies and laboratories, none of the patents were filed by him personally.
