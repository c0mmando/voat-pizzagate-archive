<hr />
<p>Austyn Crites name comes up a few times in Wikileaks but only as a purchaser and subscriber of specific books, however…these aren’t the Podesta Emails. These are the Global Intelligence Files.</p>
<p>The emails show Stratfor’s web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>
<hr />
<p>A quick Twitter search showed a reporter from the BBC had spoken to Crites. James Cook posted the following Tweet:

<p>In the link below, Crites can be seen with an electrician in Google Street View. Behind them is a painting of Pee Wee, which reads “child care” on an extension of the house with boarded up doors and windows.  If this place is still operational, would you drop your child off here? </p>

<p>Also, notice how street view censors the back part of the alleged child care center. </p>

Jan 8-12 – Steve Ryan, Sparks
Jan 15-18 -Elaine Barzen, Las Vegas
Jan 22-25 – Wilda Austin, Reno &lt;&lt;=============== granny?
