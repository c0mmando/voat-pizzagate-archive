            Is that the dude doused in blood wearing heels in the infamous pic? Looks NOTHING like Alefantis btw imo.

             No, I meant that Charlie Hallowell resembles James Alefantis, with similar restaurants and occultic imagery. (Though there is a lot less of it.)

            I've already come across him in my research, you should also look into the Center for Creative Growth. You will start to see a pattern of galleries and restaurants emerge across the country. They are absolutely everywhere. In America, the code words "Folk Art" or "Visionary Art" or "African American Vernacular Art". In Europe the code is "Art Brut" or "Outsider Art".

            He is directly connected to James Alefantis through the art gallery. Seriously, both are known to Alice Waters and they are connected through her. The galleries are possibly MK Ultra operations to experiment forms of trauma/cover up former abusers, as is the case with some of artists at these galleries making florid art with masonic imagery. I have actually found evidence that these galleries are closely associated with a secret cult who induce mind control and DiD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even weirder is that in some of the galleries, like in London's Outsider Art galleries, some of the resident artists are the children of famous/wealthy families, but it's summarily overlooked that they have severe mental trauma and that they just happen to be the heirs of major corporate estates (

             What is your source for the art gallery claim? I remember seeing this before and l looked into it. Found some strange art, but nothing worthy to post. But I don't sense that you are bullshitting. I remember reading about after parties and silent auctions. Can you elaborate?
