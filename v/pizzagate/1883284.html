            Anyone consider that stuff like this are meant to make us ease off on the pressure?

           <p>
            I hope it's true, but if it's not it would be a damn shame if we gave them an inch right when they were just about to break. They get sloppy when there is too much to cover up. They can only handle so much. I'm sure that if it's real the leakers would appreciate us putting pressure on them from this front too.

           <p>
            Giving them that
            <em>

             Absolutely we should consider that, naturally.  And no way should we let up for a nano second. I feel if they're legit, these anons, we are working together and if we can help them find an opportune moment, or by keeping the pressure ON, lets just do that.

            Does anyone remember the alleged video of Hillary screaming at a black woman? It was supposedly going to be released right before the election so the Democrats would not have time to replace her. This reminds me of the exact same thing. Damn anons!

              /pol/ is not one person. /pol/ is anonymous, anyone can post anything. If you ask, who will respond? When you get multiple contradicting responses, how will you know who to believe?

               I know. We have to take what these anons say and make our own minds up.... or simply file it for later. We don't know, but it could be a piece of the puzzle which we'll realise farther down the road.

                All the anon screencaps have been posted in the SR threads multiple times. Some believe, some don't. Some days it seems like there are more shills there than not, like right now. If you're looking for assurance, and I don't blame you, best to trust what you know from your own research. Developing discernment is key. Don't let the blabbering msm get you down.

            Gullible? Holy fuck. 6 people associated with Wikileaks are killed almost immediately after the DNC emails come out and you're calling US gullible? Words have a hard time describing the insanity you put out.

            This is one of those times I think you're just coming here to gauge the temperature of the rage currently harbored against the mother fuckers who did this.

            Sorry. I've seen you come here too many times and demonstrate so much insane retardation you being for real is impossible.

               Thanks for your awesome research and posts as always. I saw that (((media))) pic yesterday, a fabulous redpill.
              </p>
              <p>
               Although The Daily Mail suckz big-time, its great that the msm are reporting something similar to what's going on. It'll be interesting to see what Kim.Com releases tomorrow. Let's see.
              </p>
              <p>
               As with all msm and alt media, we have to take what we read and make our own minds up. There's no proof that any anons are legit, on the other hand, if one has inside info, what can one do but do this?
