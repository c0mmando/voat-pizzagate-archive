<p>Over 2,000 miles from Comet Ping Pong in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>For days, I was debating on whether or not I should post this. Aside from allegedly seeing Podesta at one of the Pitfire Pizza locations (I’m still not even sure if that was him or just a photoshop job to stir up drama), there wasn’t much evidence procured that shouted that this company has or is tangling with the pedophiliac activities sorrounding Comet Ping Pong in any way shape or form.</p>
<p>Nothing is going to be as blatant as James Alefantis. He really thought he could get away with anything and everything. And for the most part, even though it’s disgusting, still is. Even now, under extreme scrutinization, events are being held at Comet Ping Pong that feature a cowboy in nothing but a pair of underwear with a caption that reads, “All Ages”.</p>
<p>But after seeing something prominently featured that only took two seconds to find (which I’m surprised nobody else pointed out yet), I’m not holding my evidence any longer. I’m posting everything I’ve gathered in just the last two days right here.</p>
<p>I’m mostly going to be examining the 7 PitFire Pizza locations (and a little of SuperBa):</p>
<p>Firstly though, let’s go over PitFire Pizza <a href="http://www.pitfirepizza.com/home">website</a>. The video on that page. Stop at the 2:24 mark.</p>
<p>Yea, they’re playing Ping Pong. Up to that point in the video, it’s been all about the food prep and the cooking. No other recreational sport is in that video. No foosball, pool, etc.</p>
<p>I think you’ve noticed by now, that for some reason, one of their links at the top is called “Kids”.
I don’t think that a page specifically catered toward little children is needed for a pizza shop, but sure, <a href="http://www.pitfirepizza.com/kids">let’s go to that page</a>.</p>
<p>And I quote - “Kids - We Love ‘Em*”. Oh and don’t forget the picture of the girl with her mouth open, eating pasta.  That little baby girl, on the right, looks a lil nervous too, no?</p>
<p>Obviously, we’re seeing all of the little children here, right?</p>
<p>Let’s jump over to <a href="http://www.pitfirepizza.com/locals">the locals page</a>. Every single one of them has a picture with the logo of Pitfire Pizza in it, except one. Costa Mesa - “Big Love Here”. Two big people circling around a small person.</p>
<p>Why couldn’t they just use another pic of the logo instead?</p>
<p>The chairman of PitFire Pizza, Paul Hibler, also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/TESZF_jhN8/">put the same image on his instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s jump over to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lifesuperba/">SuperBa’s instagram</a>. Specifically, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmbVF2sFVy1/">this post</a>. (The little design pops up on every cup of coffee picture they post, but this specific one was just too similar.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s go here - <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3560069/The-symbols-pedophiles-use-signal-sordid-sexual-preferences-social-media.html">What a heart within a heart means, for those who might not know</a>.</p>
<p>Also on Superba’s Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BppINjFlILL/">Little Girl Mural</a>
Also on Pitfire Pizza’s Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/vW7Idxzblv/">Little Girls wearing hats with swirl pedo symbols</a>
Also on Paul Hibler’s Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcsV7JZFBqH/">Letter to Santa with swirl symbol in the name Holly (and read the caption, - we got &quot;beats a kid&quot; and &quot;rubs off&quot; in the same sentence.</a></p>
<p>Remember, all of these places PitFire Pizza and SuperBa are under the same umbrella. American Gonzo Food Corporation. So this is not two separate entities.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now we’re going to get into locations and what we can find out through Google Maps:</p>
<p>PitFire Pizza has 7 locations. Yea, that’s a lot. But we’re going to go through them all.</p>
<p>1, 5211 Lankershim Boulevard:
There is a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/5211+Lankershim+Blvd,+North+Hollywood,+CA+91601/@34.1653045,-118.374948,3a,75y,239.3h,99.68t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sA1SMbuv01d2HFWh5NpPF-Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c295f3d42bffc9:0x264147f41f147d07!8m2!3d34.1652379!4d-118.3750347">Young Actor’s Studio right above them</a> on the second floor.
This is also <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/5211+Lankershim+Blvd,+North+Hollywood,+CA+91601/@34.1649655,-118.3751502,3a,75y,336.75h,85.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1k9S5b2ccAUIg3MaKPhiOw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c295f3d42bffc9:0x264147f41f147d07!8m2!3d34.1652379!4d-118.3750347">the same location</a> featured in the promotional video on the PitFire Pizza website that has the ping pong table out front. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZsPyM4s">Check out the wall mural</a>.
Not that this connects to anything that I’m talking about here, but on Google Maps, there’s a guy by the building, with two children around him - not for nothing but the guy looks like he’s urinating. Bizarre. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/5211+Lankershim+Blvd,+North+Hollywood,+CA+91601/@34.1649658,-118.3753064,3a,26.6y,358.69h,83.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sk-Rz4xgZPHnmwhKMzaTcBQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c295f3d42bffc9:0x264147f41f147d07!8m2!3d34.1652379!4d-118.3750347">There’s even two people looking at him</a>.</p>
<p>2, 2018 Westwood Boulevard:
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0463206,-118.4338576,3a,75y,58.1h,88.51t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssFeYHzuh-T8NcEle4a4eEw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192">Literally right next door</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/2018+Westwood+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90025/@34.0467359,-118.4345635,112m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2bb9bf9baa81f:0x10ad80030f67a003!8m2!3d34.0465712!4d-118.4335836">across the street</a> are two different preschools. The preschool across the street potty trains the children for the parents. This might be common among new age preschools, I don’t know.</p>
<p>3, 12924 Washington Boulevard:
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pitfire+Pizza/@33.9951098,-118.4387484,121m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2ba61e9be72c1:0x8e1d4aec8c3342ca!8m2!3d33.994667!4d-118.438714">Upward Bound House Family Shelter</a> is across the street. It sounds simplistic enough but when you go to the website, children are prominently pictured.</p>
<p>4, 353 East 17th Street:
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@33.6316506,-117.9138737,3a,27.1y,103.06h,84.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stlVO00y8DhMUGgNay54MvA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192">“Big Love Here” sign</a> featured prominently right outside door pointing to the inside of the place. Two bigger people (?) hovering over smaller person (?). I really don’t know what this has to do with pizza and the other foods that they could possibly serve.</p>
<p>5, 401 Manhattan Beach Boulevard:
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@33.8854881,-118.4085641,3a,22.7y,336.25h,87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sPX9G4SJDoRjv8r26uMALcQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192">The “Big Love Here” sign</a> is present at this location as well but the little person is replaced with a fiery “P” letter. (Why you would replace the little person with a “P” symbol, let me think…)</p>
<p>6, 730 S. Arroyo Parkway
Our good ol’ friend, John Podesta himself was allegedly seen at this one.
I’m kind of on the fence if this actually means anything but the garages right behind this location were all white, normally colored for garage doors. Only during the construction of this location, were the colors changed to blue, purple, red, yellow and green. Like I said, whatever that means, I don’t know. But it’s worth noting. The garages opposite these were never painted - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1331235,-118.1466315,3a,75y,70.12h,70.71t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1slsjizb36sabGZPbQ9QXIjA!2e0!5s20141001T000000!7i13312!8i6656">Before</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1331514,-118.1466254,3a,90y,77.86h,69.67t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1stPc9ankLI1XJufq0dAKTiQ!2e0!5s20150801T000000!7i13312!8i6656">After</a>. 
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1330037,-118.1468244,3a,75y,107.37h,82.3t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1srExigO_H_lgkbCrILWiGkg!2e0!5s20150801T000000!7i13312!8i6656">And the garages on the other side</a> (just go through time with the street view).</p>
<p>Here’s where everything went a little sideways. Given all the prior weirdness, this last location surprised me.</p>
<p>7, 966 Westlake Boulevard</p>
<p>At first, I was intrigued because there was actually a foosball table out front, so I said, hey maybe this is really nothing to worry about. Maybe they have numerous activities to do here. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1532327,-118.8258945,3a,42.7y,332.61h,88.57t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sUMJetXq5jXeFBBeCWweayQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">But lo and behold, just a few feet away. Another ping pong table.</a> The brand? Joola.</p>
<p>Let’s go back in time for a sec. The Joola logo in Comet Ping Pong - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pMGh4fR.png">1 </a>, <a href="https://steemitimages.com/p/2gsjgna1uruvUbFpQxVY5xpD9wfXrKM5WA1SsbKUtPgRymH53rVZDzLMvnhZwhXJZ2Yf9PQTTebNiEPk7Nur1yS9murcNFp6ZTLnVaoCEfupd1W69U?format=match&amp;mode=fit">2</a> , <a href="https://img1.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/95842/p-comet-ping-pong-01-comet-ping-pong-pizza-washington-dc_54_990x660_201405311850.jpg">3</a></p>
<p>I’ll leave you with this. 
Am I nitpicking? I can admit I am. 
Did I expect to find ping pong tables on Google Maps associated with Pitfire Pizza? No. 
Joola brand? Nope.</p>
<p>Two pizza related places. That have ping pong for some reason. Same brand. 
With all the rest of the evidence, I would have to say something is afoot here.</p>',

Not that this connects to anything that I’m talking about here, but on Google Maps, there’s a guy by the building, with two children around him - not for nothing but the guy looks like he’s urinating. Bizarre.

Our good ol’ friend, John Podesta himself was allegedly seen at this one.
I’m kind of on the fence if this actually means anything but the garages right behind this location were all white, normally colored for garage doors. Only during the construction of this location, were the colors changed to blue, purple, red, yellow and green. Like I said, whatever that means, I don’t know. But it’s worth noting. The garages opposite these were never painted -

Am I nitpicking? I can admit I am. 
Did I expect to find ping pong tables on Google Maps associated with Pitfire Pizza? No. 
Joola brand? Nope.

           Two pizza related places. That have ping pong for some reason. Same brand. 
With all the rest of the evidence, I would have to say something is afoot here.

            Hello dicedtomatoes55-2 ! I think you are a bit over the top sometimes, but on the other hand, you are not wrong at all... This Pizza shoppe is suspicius as hell! The Website looks like an "Art" Projekt that has nothing to do with a normal Restaurant that sells Food... 
Instead it looks like the "Pizza" ist the LEAST interesting thing there! Where have i seen this before? 
And if you go on the "Kids" site you see not only Pics with Kids, you can also click on the red "Balloon" only to see some Graffity "Art" from a Brit(isch) or jew(isch) "ARTIST" who loves to draw Penises.... And thats the only function of this site as far as i know....
Maybe the owner should have a word with the webdesigner about the purpose of this site !!! At least this is what normal people would do.
But as you expected we are not dealing with normal people! We are dealing with a "CULT" and the MEMBERS are very well connected, and they have their own symbols (as we know) but also their own language (that we dont understand-YET)
So, we can see theres something fishy going on, because of the symbol, but we dont know what !
            <br/>
            You might be wrong with the guy who is "urinating" , because to me it looks like he is standing around with hands in Pocket, could happen to you and me, and the kids seem to be his ones ....How do you know when this shitty Google Maps Car is scanning Your neighborhood ? 
But maybe weve overseen the obvious by searching for symbols ?

            look like it merits further investigation.

            I notice the Google street view is blurring out the lap/legs of the guy on the bench in the mural on the wall. Why?

            Also, I looked at the "Kids -- We Love 'em" page and saw

             this
            </a>
            ...side by side you've got a poster that looks like a boy playing with himself that says "Please Keep the Park Clean", next to man fondling the ear of child wearing headphones, above a post of Little Red Riding Hood (a story about a "Big, Bad Wolf" that "eats" a little girl wearing a naughty red outfit) that reads "Once Upon a Time" with the Pitfire logo.

            on this one . The little girls wearing the chefs hats , decorated those hats themselves because they are obviously at a kids pizza cooking party ( which I’ve had myself for my own kids ) and the latte’s with the hearts are something baristas do at upscale coffee stores . I didn’t see a video you mentioned or a place in their website that had a kids section ??

               I thought I'd heard that Maurice Sendack was abused as a kid. I don't think that is true. But...
              </p>
              <p>
               When I poked around, I found
               <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-22/edition-10/eye-fiction-where-wild-things-are">
                this interesting article which mentions his work touching on "cannibalistic rage" and how viral it has been internationally
               </a>
               .
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Author Maurice Sendak once said: ‘I only have one subject. The question I am obsessed with is How do children survive?’ (Marcus, 2002, pp.170–171).
               </p>
               <p>
                According to the writer Francis Spufford, Where the Wild Things Are is ‘one of the very few picture books to make an entirely deliberate, and beautiful, use of the psychoanalytic story of anger’ (Spufford, 2003, p.60). For me, this book and Maurice Sendak’s other works are fascinating studies of intense emotions – disappointment, fury, even cannibalistic rage – and their transformation through creative activity.
               </p>

              <p>
               And one of his lesser known works is
               <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30618/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-maurice-sendak">

               </a>
               :
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                "It was his later book,
                <em>
                 In the Night Kitchen
                </em>
                , that landed on the American Library Association’s frequently challenged and banned books list. It features a little boy named Mickey, who is nude throughout most of the story."
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/books/maurice-sendak-childrens-author-dies-at-83.html">
                According to his NYT obit
               </a>
               , child trafficking was a huge influence on his work:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Mr. Sendak was reared, he said afterward, in a world of looming terrors: the Depression; World War II; the Holocaust, in which many of his European relatives perished; the seemingly infinite vulnerability of children to danger. He experienced the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby in 1932 as a personal torment: if that fair-haired, blue-eyed princeling could not be kept safe, what certain peril lay in store for him, little Murray Sendak, in his humble apartment in Bensonhurst?
               </p>
               <p>
                An image from the Lindbergh crime scene — a ladder leaning against the side of a house — would find its way into “Outside Over There,” in which a baby is carried off by goblins.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               And his male partner was a child psychiatrist:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Mr. Sendak’s companion of a half-century, Eugene Glynn, a psychiatrist who specialized in the treatment of young people, died in 2007.
               </p>

             Given Nomochomo's comments though, I decided to dig a little further on the other owner of PitFire Pizza. He also has a daughter(s) and this is something he posted on Instagram November of last year.
             <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcAZZavBpvh/">
              This is one of her drawings titled, Daisy's World.

            <p>
             As far as I can tell, we have a tree with a girl in it. The place on the right of the tree, I can't tell what that is. But then it seems we go underground (basement-esque) and something is sticking out of the wall which scares the bejeezus out of the person closest to it. It is rather phallic shaped.
