             Tell me, what is more sinister than S&amp;M sex with children that often results in the murder, dismembering, and even eating of the children? I've heard the 'black eyes' explanation but haven't seen any evidence for that, while there is evidence that the black-and-white nature of a panda would make it a similar codeword to dominos (which are black and white), black-and-white handkerchief, etc.

            It's not speculative unless there are alternative explanations that can be proposed. Since there are none (if there are please provide), it's a well-founded thesis, not speculation, the latter of which has pejorative connotations.

             There have been alternative explanations for the handkerchief reference, both nefarious and harmless. So yes, it is speculation -- which is fine, but let's call it what it is. Connotations or not, the word has a specific definition, and I think this still qualifies. Again -- there's nothing wrong with something being speculation.

            But, my only question is, what kind of person finds a bloody/semen stained handkerchief (as a realtor) and doesn't drop it straight in a trashcan? Or if it is really bad, bring it to the attention of police?

              Yes. I see Susan, John Podesta's contact used the code words, but reading the email from the realtor she only describes it as black and white. Strange.

             Oh really, even though that's what the name of the scandal is based on? Yes I do get your sarcasm. But I think it's very strange to say the least how much people are focusing on compiling endless amounts of 'hmmm...interesting' tangential information, while having no working theory on what the very code that started all this and is a foundational part of the evidence actually means.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              This dossier on Trump has been going around a while and reporters have been trying to confirm this stuff for months. The "sexual" part is just a small part of this. This dossier was compiled by a real person, with genuine experience and contacts in Russia and it was started before Trump had the nomination. He is ex MI6 and now works for a private firm Does that mean all of his stuff is gold? No, it does not. However, what is being reported tonight is that the Intel Agencies have checked out the source network and now believe there is enough credibility to the charges that some of this info was briefed to the President and President elect.

                The dossier talked about a deal involving Carter Page and 19% of the State oil company Rosneft.   In December 19.5% of Rosneft was sold in the largest privatization in Russia since the 90's.  The buyers were secret.  The half percent could be brokerage commissions.  Also in December  Oleg Erovinkin was found in the trunk of his car

                 Since you didn't provide any link, I searched and found a few articles. First one from businessinsider (
                 <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-trump-russia-igor-sechin-dossier-2017-1">
                  http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-trump-russia-igor-sechin-dossier-2017-1)
                 </a>
                 ) which starts like this (emphasis mine).
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   A dossier with unverified claims
                  </strong>
                  about President Donald Trump's ties to Russia contained allegations that Igor Sechin, the CEO of Russia's state oil company, offered former Trump ally Carter Page and his associates the brokerage of a 19% stake in the company in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions on Russia.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Since the beginning, the problem with this fake dossier is that the claims are unverified. It doesn't matter what all these people say, if they keep saying things without actually showing evidence, they cannot be taken seriously.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then I found this from NYTimes.

                  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Once again accusations without evidence:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Mr. Reid, in a letter to Mr. Comey in August, asserted that Mr. Trump’s campaign “has employed a number of individuals with significant and disturbing ties to the Russia and the Kremlin.” Although Mr. Reid cited no evidence and offered no names explicitly, he clearly referred to one of Mr. Trump’s earlier campaign advisers, Carter Page.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Mr. Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker who founded an investment company in New York, Global Energy Capital, drew attention during the summer for a speech in which he criticized the United States and other Western nations for a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Perhaps I am not looking at the right place? Where is the evidence that this dossier is real?

                  The dossier is real.  As in a real intelligence product created by ex MI6 guy who is known to and has credibility with many Western intelligence agencies including ours.

                    Carter Page met with the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin to discuss a large stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions.   This report was Oct 18.   Significantly this was "confirmed by a close associate of Sechin.

                  The most interesting one right now to me is the one saying Page could benefit from the Rosneft sale.  The sale went through in December.   We still don't know exactly who bought 19.5% of the world's largest oil company.

                   An ex-KGB chief suspected of helping the former MI6 spy Christopher Steele to compile his dossier on Donald Trump may have been murdered by the Kremlin and his death covered up. it has been claimed.

                 <p>
                  Also a month after this death, Russia arrested four people for treason including

                   <p>
                    It has been widely attributed to Christopher Steele, a retired British intelligence officer.
Mr Steele, who runs a London-based intelligence firm, was reportedly hired by anti-Trump Republicans to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia during the battle for the party's presidential nomination. In the general election campaign the research was funded by an anonymous Democratic donor.
                    <strong>
                     But since Mr Steele has been in hiding since the report surfaced on Tuesday, there is no confirmation that he is the author.

                  <p>
                   See, once again, we don't know who decided that "it had been wideley attributed to Christopher Steele". We have to take their word for it because there are no links and no source to back up this claim. They just write stuff without providing any evidence. And then we are led to believe that the supposed author cannot confirm he is the author because he is in hiding. This is oh so convenient don't you think?

                  <p>
                   This smells so fishy, the whole thing. It's completely bogus... there is no substance. Nothing. Just speculation.

                    I think in this case, they don't want to be the ones confirming it to be Christopher Steele.  His name was first published elsewhere.
What I have not seen is any of the others news companies challenge that.   Because many of them had access to this.  Many other places have followed up on this.  That's one way to tell if something is likely to be fake.  Can other reporters develop the story further.  With Steele they definitely have

                    They may not have developed it to your taste though, which gets us to the problem.   Part of your objections seems to be about epistimology -how do we know what we know.    And Part seem to be  because uncertainty is a giant part of the Intelligence world.   In the Intel world, "a high degree of certainty"  is almost the very highest assessment, they will give.

                    Ambiguity is always present in the intel world.  He could be told this things, but were the people he talked to in position to know these things? Did they just hear rumors or do they know?  Were they deliberately feeding him lies? Etc, etc.

                     It's not just a matter of developing the story further, it's a matter of providing evidence. They always do that, they are not able to give us names. It's always "One colleague said", "A respected official declared...". Who are these people? They never tell us but we are always supposed to believe them.

                     Can you imagine if we did the same with pizzagate?? "A well respected man reported that he heard children screaming at comet ping pong. When asked if he was really sure about what he heard. The man responded without hesitation: 'Absolutely, yes'. Also, a witness apparently said that he was 100% sure that 'pizza' was a code word for pedophila."

                     <p>
                      On Thursday night, as the former spy was in hiding, having fled his home in the south-east of England, former colleagues rallied to defend him.
                      <strong>
                       One described him as
                      </strong>
                      “very credible” – a sober, cautious and meticulous professional with a formidable record.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      <strong>
                       The former Foreign Office official
                      </strong>
                      , who has known Steele for 25 years and considers him a friend, said: “The idea his work is fake or a cowboy operation is false – completely untrue. Chris is an experienced and highly regarded professional. He’s not the sort of person who will simply pass on gossip.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      <strong>
                       The official added
                      </strong>
                      : “If he puts something in a report, he believes there’s sufficient credibility in it for it to be worth considering. Chris is a very straight guy. He could not have survived in the job he was in if he had been prone to flights of fancy or doing things in an ill-considered way.”

                     This is why it smells so fishy. Why no one appear on a TV show to blow the whistle? A leftist media who is anti-trump, like CNN for example, would love to give a tribune to Steele and his friends. And he would have the whole establishment on his side to offer physical protection. Hell, he would even get all the protection he needs from George Soros himself. So there is nothing to fear for him. The establishment is not hostile to him at all. Why would he go hiding somewhere in the southeast of england. Doesn't make any sense.

                You do realize that saying the dossier is real is not saying the dossier is proven right?
               </p>
               <p>
                The evidence the dossier is real is that many news orgs came out after it became public and said we received this but could not verify it. They had the dossier months before the posts 4chan posted to as the origin of the dossier.  Mother Jones wrote about before the election, but didn't go into specifics.   After the story became public, the author has been identified, an ex MI 6 agent who now works privately.

When you get caught out you ignore what you don't like as you've done countless times with me. Like with the wife of Herb Sandler and her possibly injecting "pizza-related" into an email where it didn't belong, you don't need any evidence to dismiss that lead. But come any evidence you don't like Katie bar the door.

                    This was wrong for several reasons.  Among them by the time this guy said he gave it Wilson, the dossier had already been circulated to journalists.

                    This dossier on Trump has been going around a while and reporters have been trying to confirm this stuff for months. The "sexual" part is just a small part of this. This dossier was compiled by a real person, with genuine experience and contacts in Russia and it was started before Trump had the nomination. He is ex MI6 and now works for a private firm. Does that mean all of his stuff is gold? No, it does not. However, what is being reported tonight is that the Intel Agencies have checked out the source network and now believe there is enough credibility to the charges that some of this info was briefed to the President and President elect.

                     "Does that mean all of his stuff is gold? No"..........You mean like when I asked you to watch "Clinton Cash"? That's weird you would claim the "where there's smoke there's fire" defense WHEN YOU REFUSED TO EVEN WATCH CLINTON CASH.

                     AreWeSure you're not fooling anyone here. Everyone here knows something's up with you. If you believe where there's smoke there's fire then you'd have watched "Clinton Cash" and seen all 107 George Webb videos. You have done neither. All you do here is shit on any and all evidence pointing to the DNC, PizzaGate, Clinton Foundation, CIA or Dyncorp.

                     We're talking human ORGANS here. We're talking mountains of wretched evidence of the most vile and disgusting corruption in American History and all you can think about is Donald Trump likes Golden Showers. You're pathetic. You are a pathetic little worm.

              's comment with a grain of salt. He doesn't think rich older white people are capable of committing crimes. So that means when wife of Herb Sandler writes to John Podesta that the handkerchief the realtor found in their vacation rental was "pizza-related" we are not to get suspicious given the realtor NEVER SAID in the original email it was "pizza-related". We are to assume older rich white people couldn't possibly be involved in criminal activity. So therefor the wife of Herb Sandler must have talked on the phone with said realtor and been told it was "pizza-related" despite no concrete evidence she actually did
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Talk to the Realtor
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Even if they did talk, there's no evidence the handkerchief was brought up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Basically if you just keep telling yourself rich older white people are not capable of committing crimes everything makes sense and you can stop acting like a deplorable shit lord about everything.

             It's establishing that pedophiles keep garments of their victims as mementos. This was known/suspected by most readers here, but it's helpful to have it supported by a recent story. This potentially being related to a flurry of recent arrests of sex abusers also ties in to PG. If you use deductive reasoning and look at the handkerchief email in light of all the other 'pizza' evidence, specifically the large amount of evidence on social media, there is no other explanation than what I posted. If there is, please provide it yourself instead of saying 'seems speculative.' If something is speculative, then there should be readily available alternative explanations for it other than the speculation. If there are such explanations, please provide them. This is not speculation, it is a thesis supported by deduction and evidence.

               Yes, an alternative explanation to that. Why would Podesta want it otherwise (other than as a memento)?

                 OK, but it's still a memento from S&amp;M sex with children, making this not speculation. Whether the fluids are his or the victim's doesn't really matter. Also, semen likely wouldn't create enough of a stain to qualify as a 'map'/memento of the encounter. There was likely blood on it that was either transferred by penis or came directly from the victim. You're not accounting for the black-and-white pattern mentioned. And if you're claiming it's not from sexual intercourse, are you actually suggesting someone would want a tissue/cloth they masturbated into mailed to them?

                     You haven't given a hypothesis. If it was from innocuous activity, why would it matter if his DNA was on it? And what other small, mailable item would have a sex stain on it other than some kind of piece of fabric? And what are the odds that it would be 'black with white' and of that fact being relevant? You can't say 'maybe it wasn't _______' and label something as speculation without offering a 'it could have just been _______'. Failing to do so would make you, not me, the speculator. I gave a full hypothesis; if you think it's just speculation then you have to offer a full, alternative, similarly likely hypothesis.

                      His DNA could be used to convict him. It could have been code language. But the fact remains that your link was not directly related to PG, it was peripheral story at best.

                       Convict him of what, if not sex with children? What I'm focusing on is your willy-nilly use of the word speculation in a pejorative sense, which smacks of Snopes-esque fake debunking. It relates to Pizzagate just as much as the other stories being posted daily about trafficking and sex abuse arrests, and it relates to the single most important piece of evidence (among the hundreds or thousands that there are) in the entire scandal, which is the Podesta handkerchief email, because Thomas's memento garments and Podesta's handkerchiefs are the exact same thing and there is very strong evidence this is the case, with no alternative explanations having been offered.

                         It's not speculative. What is your standard of proof, other than a confession from Podesta that 'yes, it referred to a memento from S&amp;M child sex abuse.' I've made a well-grounded case for it, and no alternative cases have been made. If it was not well-grounded, alternative theories should be readily available. They aren't. Again, that's a thesis, not speculation.

                           It's not inconclusive. It's conclusive. Meaning a conclusion has been reached, and no alternative conclusions to the inquiry have been put forth. It's not by conjecture either, since there is a wealth of evidence that pedophiles and sex abusers keep mementos from victims, that pizza means what I said it means, and that black-and-white means what I said it means. The meaning of map can be deduced and is entirely consistent with the remainder of the thesis.
