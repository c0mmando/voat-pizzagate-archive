<blockquote>
<p>Finally the answer to the question never asked on University Challenge: “What is Prince Andrew for?” Even the finest moral philosopher would stumble on this one. Now we know: the prince of naff is to keep the US president away from “political conversations” by talking to him about golf. Yes, really: Andrew will accompany Trump on two of the three days of his British trip.</p>
<p>..Still, Andrew will have a lot to chat about with Trump besides golf. They met 20 years ago at Mar-a-Lago through their former friend, Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender accused of abusing dozens of underage girls. In a court statement, Epstein’s former handyman alleged that Andrew used to attend pool parties full of adolescent girls, staying in guest rooms with soap in the shape of genitalia. Classy.</p>
<p>After Epstein got out of prison, Andrew was seen strolling with him in New York, shortly after which Fergie accepted £15,000 from Epstein to clear her debts. This was put down, as everything is, to an error of judgment on the Duchess of York’s part.</p>
<p>Andrew, it was thought, was no longer such a great ambassador as he hung out with Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif and various oligarchs. <strong>Meanwhile, there was much speculation after his “South York” mansion, which had been on the market for five years, was suddenly snapped up for £15m – £3m above the asking price – by an offshore fund in the Virgin Islands.</strong></p>
<p>So there is golf, “deals” and a lot else to discuss. This puke-inducing diplomacy is surely what Andrew was born to do. This is the new “normal”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soo, why was the Guardian referring back to that property deal that happened back in 2008/2009? <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1153465/The-fall-house-York-Why-mansion-sold-Duke-mystery-15m-deal-gone-ruin.html">The fall of the house of York: Why has the mansion sold by Duke in mystery £15m deal gone to ruin?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>..Last night, Channel 4\'s Dispatches programme raised questions over the property deal, which was made by a trust acting on behalf of the prince and overseen by <strong>Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, who is the Queen\'s chief accountant</strong>, and a
representative from Farrers, the Queen\'s lawyers. ..</p>

<p>In October 2015 [Reid] acted to prevent the cancellation and annulment of Hubert Chesshyre\'s honour (Commander of the Royal Victorian Order)[5] f<strong>ollowing a public hearing - the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse</strong>[6]. The justification given was Chesshyre had not been convicted and had received an absolute discharge (due to being unfit to plead) - despite the offence being proved in a trial of the facts.

<p>In March 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/30/sex-offender-retains-queen-honour-reform">Honours system under scrutiny after sex abuser kept title for years</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lawyers have called for an overhaul of the honours forfeiture system after it emerged that a sex abuser retained an honour bestowed for services to the Queen some three years after a court recognised him as a paedophile.</p>
<p>..Hubert Chesshyre, 78, an expert on heraldry and genealogy, held a number of senior positions within the royal household, rising to become secretary of the most noble order of the garter, the highest order in British chivalry. Among the many honours bestowed upon him over more than 40 years were the Queen’s Silver and Golden Jubilee Medals, and the commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) – the latter for distinguished personal service to the monarch. A fellow or member of several illustrious organisations and charities, <strong>he was a heraldic consultant to the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Lord Sugar and Sir Terry Pratchett.</strong></p>
<p>But it recently emerged during the Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) that in 2015 Chesshyre was found to have sexually abused a teenage chorister during the 1990s, a fact that has remained buried from public record. This is because Chesshyre’s case did not result in a criminal conviction. Rather, the inquiry heard “he was found to have committed the acts in question” in a trial of the facts.</p>
<p>..The fact that Chesshyre’s name was misspelled throughout the trial, despite repeated police efforts to have it corrected, has made it difficult to identify him in legal databases.</p>
<p>His victim told the Observer that he believed there may have been others. “I know of other boys from the choir where their parents became concerned and stopped Mr Chesshyre from having anything more to do with them.”  Chesshyre’s case is similar to that of Lord Janner, who was also accused of sexual abuse. Suffering from dementia, Janner was due to undergo a similar trial of the facts but this was dropped after his death in 2015.</p>

              Academi is an American private military company founded in 1997 by former Navy SEAL officer Erik Prince[2][3] as Blackwater,[4] renamed as Xe Services in 2009 and now known as Academi since 2011 after the company was acquired by a group of private investors.... Academi provides security services to the United States federal government on a contractual basis. Since 2003, the group has provided services to the Central Intelligence Agency.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2014, Academi became a division of Constellis Group along with Triple Canopy and other security companies that were part of the Constellis Group as the result of an acquisition.

             <p>
              After the departure of Erik Prince from his former company, Prince stayed active in private military interests around the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               He was hired by the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and moved to Abu Dhabi in 2010
              </strong>
              . He founded a new company called Reflex Responses (or R2) that entailed a roughly 800-man unit of foreign fighters for the UAE, where Prince retained a majority 51% ownership.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a separate front, he oversaw recruitment for private military companies, such as Executive Outcomes which is a former South African private military firm that gained fame when they were hired by several African governments during the 1990s to defeat violent rebellions in addition to protecting oil and diamond reserves. Then in January 2011, Prince began training ~2,000 Somalis for anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. This program was funded by several Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates and was backed by the United States.
             </p>
             <p>
              Erik Prince currently heads a private equity firm called Frontier Resource Group (FRG) and is chairman of Frontier Services Group Ltd (FSG Ltd), a Bermuda-incorporated logistics and transport company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Frontier Services Group is backed by China’s state-owned CITIC Group and Hong Kong-based investor Chun Shun Ko. FSG Ltd advises and supports Chinese investment in oil and gas exploration operations in Africa. Prince had planned to build a diesel refinery in South Sudan but the operation was suspended, even though $10 million (USD) had already been invested in the project.

            <p>
             A meeting in the Seychelles between the Blackwater founder and a Putin ally has drawn scrutiny. It also indicated another backchannel to the White House.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..another important story has been overlooked: the attempts by the United Arab Emirates, many successful, to influence the Trump administration, especially concerning its archrival Qatar.
            </p>
            <p>
             The de facto ruler of the UAE, crown prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, or “MBZ” as he’s known, has met with members of the Trump coterie in two informal circumstances that we know of: in December 2016 in New York with campaign advisers Steve Bannon, Mike Flynn, and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, and on January 11, 2017, in the Seychelles. There, MBZ arranged for the drink between Erik Prince—the Breitling-wearing founder of the now-defunct paramilitary firm Blackwater and brother of Trump secretary of education Betsy DeVos—and an associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Prince told the House’s Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in November 2017 that he was invited to the Seychelles by “one of the members of the Royal Court” to discuss everything from “security issues to mineral issues to even bauxite.” The Emirati customers “mentioned a guy I should meet who was also in town to see them, a Kirill Dmitriev from Russia, who ran some sort of hedge fund.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Dmitriev is the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the state’s $10 billion sovereign wealth fund.
             <strong>
              RDIF’s links with the Kremlin may have led the U.S. to sanction the fund. It also boasts tight links with Abu Dhabi: The UAE sovereign fund Mubadala has co-invested with RDIF in 40 investments in Russia since 2013.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             ...That year, Prince began building a private army for MBZ for a reported $529 million and helped train a Somali anti-piracy force funded by the UAE. Through a post-Blackwater company R2, founded in the UAE in 2010, Prince has also trained mercenaries who fight under the UAE flag in Yemen. In 2012, when Prince launched a private equity firm, FRG (Frontier Resource Group), eventually listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the investors included both the UAE’s Sheikh Tahnoun bin Mohammed Al Nahyan and Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Court.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Broidy has previously run afoul of the law: In 2009 the 61-year-old fundraiser plead guilty to paying New York pension fund officials almost $1 million in return for $18 million in management fees. In 2013, he withdrew his original felony plea prior to conviction and in return for his cooperation and restitution of the $18 million, the court allowed him to plead to a lesser misdemeanor charge instead. Broidy is now under investigation for influence peddling in China and Malaysia, the Washington Post reported in August.
             <strong>
              Nader has a criminal history as well: in 2003, he was convicted in the Czech Republic on charges of child molestation and child pornography.
             </strong>
             )
            </p>
            <p>
             ....Some Trump-Emirates links suggest MBZ may be managing financial ties with Trump companies in other ways. One example is his bidding in the auction of a Leonardo painting belonging to Dmitry Rybolovlev. In 2008, the Russian billionaire paid Trump $95 million for an oceanfront Palm Beach estate that Trump had purchased for $41 million in 2004; the house sat empty for years before being demolished. The property has since been divided into three lots, two of which Rybolovlev has re-sold for over $71 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             In November 2017 Rybolovlev sold Leonardo’s “Salvator Mundi” in a Christie’s auction that set a new world record price of $450 million. The price of the 26-inch painting–valued at around $80 million the year before–was driven high by a bidding war between a representative for Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince bin Salman and the UAE’s MBZ, each of whom claimed they mistakenly thought they were bidding against the Qataris. MBZ was trying to buy it for the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Saudi Arabia “won” the painting, but then gave it to MBZ in exchange for the crown prince’s $450 million superyacht, the Topaz. (MBZ has donated it to the museum, where it was scheduled to be have been unveiled in September, but its exhibit has been delayed.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Could the bidding war have been a way to funnel UAE funds to the Russian tycoon? While it’s unlikely the painting sale–which made Rybolovlev over $320 million–was related to the Palm Beach purchase, it is conceivable that these two deals are part of a larger number of transactions we don’t yet know about, in which the UAE rewards Trump indirectly for his support.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a UAE link straight to Trump’s business holdings, too. As Trump prepared to run for president, MBZ would have known that in April 2014, Trump bought the Turnberry golf course in Scotland from Leisurecorp, a UAE state-owned enterprise, for what was termed at the time a “bargain price,” in a £35.7 million ($63 million) “cash deal.” The UAE had put a total of £92 million into the property, which it bought in 2008. Leisurecorp paid £52 million for the resort–which comprises three courses, a golf academy, a five-star hotel, as well as lodge and cottage accommodations–and then proceeded to spend a further £40 million on renovations.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s unclear why the UAE effectively made a £58 million gift to Donald Trump in 2014. But this is one of many questions about the Trump-Emirates relationship that needs more attention, especially before that relationship drags the U.S. into more dangerous adventures in the Middle East.

               Centurion is the private airline owned by the VanAndel and Devos families (Amway).

These people are way up there as far as elite people go and from what I understand are part of the Bilderberg Group. I live mere minute from the Amway world headquarters.

There is very, very little to be found about the company online, though. But there is another Centurion Aviation in Fayetteville, which is one of only 15 companies with permission to land inside government installations and bases...

             GREEN PARTY GETS CHILD ABUSE REPORT IT PAID FOR
            </a>

           <h1 id="md-the-verita-report-what-did-green-party-know-about-child-rapist">
            The Verita Report: What did Green Party know about child rapist?
           </h1>
           <p>
            The clue to the depth and width of the long-awaited inquiry into the Green Party’s response to Coventry party member David Challenor’s conviction and imprisonment on 22 charges of the sexual torture of a 10-year-old girl, is the inquiry’s brief.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is, in fact, very brief: last autumn the Verita consultancy was invited, at great expense, to investigate the party’s actions in response to the charges. That meant a narrow aperture, focused on who knew what, when and what they did about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Verita report published on 10 January, has to be read, therefore, as much for the questions it asked and answered, as for what it didn’t ask or answer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Verita inquiry was not invited to address the context and culture which sustained the Challenors. It did conclude, however, that child safeguarding awareness was ‘low’.

            <em>
             Guardian
            </em>
            article, I had skipped it, since I thought it might probably be too boring to read.

             I have to admit I don't follow the Guardian...too much left-wing propaganda.. It's the video at the end that turned me onto the articles..

              I have a love-hate relationship with it. It's still my morning paper. In the headlines section, you can always find what 'they' are up to -  when the Guardian pushes something there, you know it's fishy. ;-)

              I always read Voat
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/news">
               v/news
              </a>
              in the morning as well, so I get a pretty good overview of more conservative voices, and a complete picture of what is going on. Works well for me. :-)
