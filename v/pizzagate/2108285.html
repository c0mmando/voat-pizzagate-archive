            Again as I said yesterday as it seems your original post was deleted. This is incredible research. Many of us have been literally screaming in this forum that Satanists hide amongst all populations but Jews from the beginning in the land of cannon...aka the cannonites where we get the term cannibalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you explained yesterday Damascus literally means spilled blood and is where Cain slain his brother Able. 
In order to fully understand this you have to grasp that Cain and Able had two different bloodlines. Able from Adam thereby from God, but it states Eve was tempted by the serpent (meaning Satan who could take any form on earth) and then she had Cain. They had two different fathers or bloodlines.
           </p>
           <p>
            This happens again in many ancient texts when the Nephelim(giants) are created. If you don't believe the Bible this exists in almost every ancient text possible in some form. The Nephelim were created when the fallen angels who had been cast out of heaven with Lucifer took Gods creation (the daughters of men or Adams lineage) as their own. They bore them children which were called Nephelim or hybrid. Think of the story David &amp; Goliath that is about Gods creation David fighting Satans creation Goliath (Nephelim). I could go on the Old Testament is filled with this including Sodom and Gomorrah.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now you cannot believe in any of the Bible but the historical facts and artifacts back this up. So let's get to Ashkenazi. You can trace them biblically by their own name as to where they came from. They were in the line of Japheth.,They descended from one son Ashekenath (not sure on spelling) from the land of Khazar.,Their lineage was traced back numerous times but Zionists forced its suppression until a genuine Israeli scientists proved it in 2013 for good. The Ashkenazi were not jews they were forced to convert to hide amongst the people. They practiced the mystical Talmudic or Kabbalah because they helped create it as a way to hide in Judaism. They are not Torah Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            They became what is known as the Khazarian mafia or central bankers and supported Hiter and the SS. They became the Royal Families.  They wanted any and all genectic Jews dead because they are in fact frauds and they know it. They have no claim to Israel and don't want just Israel they use it as proxy for their wars. They want the world, one world, one religion (Luceferian) that they sit on top of. Their bloodline is faulty though as has been shown and they need a never ending supply to keep them alive....aka Count Dracula

            Thank you for posting this and for your Courage.  Do you think Browning is caught up in this mess as a pedophile?  I know nothing about his past so am only asking and do not wish to tarnish his image but I am genuinely curious.  I have never heard anything involving him so people should not convict him.  I will now look into his poems as well.  I will be checking this out all day.  Stay safe and Peace.

              THANK YOU so much for Clearing That Up.  So Browning IS ONE OF US.  Good.  We need more from the past to guide us, for nowadays the words are not so kind and beautiful, imo.  I remember a little of him from my High School years.  We had a teacher that really loved literature and instilled a love of reading. I already had that, but I really enjoyed the class.  Browning here I come.  I encourage others to do the same.  Just discovered this was deleted.  So very sad.

              <p>
               Here's Porphyria's Lover (my fav)
              </p>
              <p>
               The rain set early in to-night,
              </p>
              <pre><code>   The sullen wind was soon awake, 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
              </p>
              <pre><code>   And did its worst to vex the lake: 

   I listened with heart fit to break. 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               When glided in Porphyria; straight
              </p>
              <pre><code>   She shut the cold out and the storm, 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
              </p>
              <pre><code>   Blaze up, and all the cottage warm; 

   Which done, she rose, and from her form 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
              </p>
              <pre><code>   And laid her soiled gloves by, untied 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
              </p>
              <pre><code>   And, last, she sat down by my side 

   And called me. When no voice replied, 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               She put my arm about her waist,
              </p>
              <pre><code>   And made her smooth white shoulder bare, 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               And all her yellow hair displaced,
              </p>
              <pre><code>   And, stooping, made my cheek lie there, 

   And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair, 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               Murmuring how she loved me — she
              </p>
              <pre><code>   Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour, 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               To set its struggling passion free
              </p>
              <pre><code>   From pride, and vainer ties dissever, 

   And give herself to me for ever. 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               But passion sometimes would prevail,
              </p>
              <pre><code>   Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               A sudden thought of one so pale
              </p>
              <pre><code>   For love of her, and all in vain: 

   So, she was come through wind and rain. 
</code></pre>
              <p>
               Be sure I looked up at her eyes
              </p>
              <pre><code>   Happy and proud; at last I knew 
</code></pre>

            Nobody here cares if your post is "inflammatory," but you haven't established any relevance of all this to pizzagate (and it doesn't make sense, for that matter), you lack adequate sources for some of your claims, and you misrepresent what some of your sources say, not to mention that your title is too vague.

              No relevance? A disease that requires massive blood transfusions by blood of the young? Not too mention, satanic rituals? I believe this thread has a TON of evidence. Maybe copy the entire thread to Pizzagatewhatever, This regular PG thread seems highly tainted.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe we also need to search medical facilities in Israel that offer treatment for these diseases. They obviously need MASSIVE amounts of blood.

               Thank you, I didn't know about that sub. I'll post it there. And yeah, I've thought of that as well. They would need a wagon full of umbilical chords to save a single child. I think it suspect that every blood bank is owned by Jews, as well.

            YES this is so very informative and I will try to look at all of it.  I already upvoated.  Any one that down voats this is either a shill or has not looked at all of it.  The disease mentioned in the poem is also linked to coloboma. That was posted in comments by

            Excellent research and I didn't put all this together but I have said for a while, the "Zionists" are not Jews but hiding behind the the real Jews.  Of course, some throw out the anti-Semite card, EXACTLY why anti-sémitism was created, by them. No one seems to ask why the Armenian Genocide, which killed 1.5 million, is not really taught in schools versus the Holocaust (it doesn't fit the agenda). This old document shows, 271,000 died

            Also, Jews protested when Bibi came to USA soon after Trump was elected. Are they anti-semite too? Of course, MSM failed to show this

             Dr. Otto Warburg was allowed to continue working by Adolph Hitler himself. Dr. Warburg had been involved in removing a polyp from Hitler's vocal chords and Hitler's was terrified of cancer. Dr. Warburg actually developed some amazing research on treatment of cancer but during the war it was confiscated and never released to the public.
