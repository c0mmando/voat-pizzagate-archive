<p>Whereabouts of almost 1,300 Missouri sex offenders unknown </p>
<p>ST. LOUIS — Police don\'t know the whereabouts of nearly 1,300 registered sex offenders in Missouri, including hundreds who fall into the most dangerous category, according to a state audit released Monday.</p>
<p>Missouri law requires convicted sex offenders to register their names, addresses and other information with their county law enforcement, most often the sheriff\'s department. The Missouri State Highway Patrol maintains a publicly available database. Offenders must keep their information up-to-date and notify law enforcement when they move.</p>
<p>The audit released by state Auditor Nicole Galloway says 1,259 sex offenders are unaccounted for — about 8 percent of the nearly 16,000 registered sex offenders in Missouri — and it blames inadequate enforcement of the registration requirement at the local level. In 14 counties and the city of St. Louis, the whereabouts of more than 10 percent of sex offenders is unknown.</p>
<p>Galloway said the findings are &quot;disturbing and alarming.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As it stands the sex offender registry really provides a false sense of security,&quot; Galloway said at a news conference in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Galloway said the audit did not compare compliance rates in Missouri with other states, nor did it examine if non-compliant sex offenders committed additional crimes.</p>
<p>However, other states have had similar problems with keeping up with sex offenders. A state analysis in August found that Wisconsin didn\'t have current information on 2,735 offenders. A 2017 audit in Massachusetts found no address on file for nearly 1,800 of the state\'s more than 13,000 registered sex offenders.</p>
<p>The registration requirement law took effect in Missouri in 1995 and was updated this year to classify sex offenders into three tiers. The most dangerous sex offenders are listed in Tier III for offenses that include rape, sodomy or first- or second-degree child molestation. Those offenders must register with local police every 90 days for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Galloway said the audit found that at least 794 of the non-compliant offenders met the criteria for Tier III. She singled out St. Louis, where 197 of the 244 unaccounted for sex offenders fall into the most dangerous category.</p>
<p>The audit showed the problem persists in places large and small. Stoddard County in rural southeast Missouri had the highest rate of unaccounted for sex offenders, 25.2 percent, followed by Jackson County, which includes Kansas City, at 20.7 percent. Butler County, also in southeast Missouri, was third-worst at 20 percent, followed by St. Louis city at 19.3 percent.</p>
<p>Phone and email messages seeking comment from officials in St. Louis and the counties with the highest rates of unaccounted for offenders were not immediately returned. But Galloway said law enforcement officials often cite a lack of resources. She acknowledged that understaffed police agencies face an uphill battle in maintaining the registry. &quot;But this is critically important,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with registration requirements is a felony. The audit found that less than 10 percent of noncompliant offenders had an active arrest warrant against them.</p>
<p>In addition to urging strong control at the local level, the audit cites a need for the highway patrol to improve procedures for maintaining the database and for helping local police enforce registration requirements. A highway patrol spokesman did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.</p>
<p>Galloway also encouraged the Legislature to strengthen the state law to require background checks for school volunteers, and to allow her office to access all court records.</p>

<p>Missouri New Sex Offender Registry Law</p>
<p>The new 3-tier system will give some offenders a shot at petitioning to be taken off the sex offender registry.</p>
<p>Criminal Defense Attorney, Dee Wampler said, &quot;There\'s hope for people that have committed minor type sex crimes, that after a while, they can get off the sex registration list and get back to normal. But just to think, 10 years, you can get off the list..... that\'s punishment.&quot;</p>
<p>This is Totally Unfair to the Victims.  What does he mean hope for the criminal.  Everyday the victim can relive that fateful day. We know that many times times a minor sex crime will only escalate and cause them to commit even more heinous crimes, especially with children.  The fact that LE has done nothing to keep track of these horrid perverted perpetrators, well that speaks volumes.  
</p>
<p>Most of all the ones that need the most protection are Our Children.  Now that they have lost so many out of SIXTEEN THOUSAND, what will parents do?  The Elite and Powerful Lawmakers are weakening laws not strengthening them.</p>
<p>Pizzagate related and connected to Elites failing to protect Our Children from the many Sex Offenders because they know they are loose and unaccounted for.  Plus they have decided to weaken not strengthen the protection from them by allowing them to apply for release from the Sex Offender List.</p>',

            It's not really shocking at all until you compare the apparent inability to track these established offenders (seemingly understandable, considering the sheer number of them, the overlap with the notoriously difficult to track homeless and mentally ill populations, etc.) with the intense vigilance with which the intelligence community tracks Muslim immigrants, political dissidents, environmental/animal rights activists etc., many (if not most) of which have no criminal history and thus which we have no concrete statistical basis to support such scrutiny.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the
            <em>
             least
            </em>
            , our priorities here are FUCKED up.  We all know there's a much more likely reason they don't put such effort into tracking pedophiles: it's not in ((their)) best interests to.

             Upvoat4U!  Our govt. has no problem tracking what they call indigents which fall into exactly those you have named.  It's not in their best interest to is correct, for many of them are of their own ilk.  They label people to their convenience and what will dirty those that are innocent but have no defense.  The jails are filled with black and brown people and dirt poor white that have no defense.  They closed the mental health centers for a reason.  They can pull anyone off the streets and they have their fake pedo.  Time to let most of them out and fill the prisons with pedophiles.

            My guess is this is intentional. I was looking more into the Lisa Irwin case and found out that there are people who were investigated who are constantly being arrested for lesser crimes, sentenced to years of prison and then immediately released. 
According to George Webb Kansas City is an area that has a huge cell of operatives brought in from different countries waiting to fight. These guys are convicted felons who have photos of themselves on Facebook shooting automatic weapons and posting photos of missing kids and photos of their cars involved in overnight killings and other horrible things and all of their friends post Satanic stuff. Did you know that one of the people involved in Q anon was a convicted heroin and opium trafficker?

             Did you get my message about a post about an anon saying Ronald Reagan was the last good pres.?   I thought that we have had many comments and posts about him especially C O'Brien's reports about him.  Very Odd Indeed.

             Wow.  That is some scary stuff.  We know they have let some really scary people into the country, on purpose.  Just like infiltrating the schools, religions, etc.  Amazing about Q anon.  I don't know much about it, but people need to do their research on who they follow.  Many follow or did follow Craig S and now we have shown he is compromised as is Tim Ballard and OUR.  They are connected to FLDS/Mormons.  Lisa Irwin is waiting to be rescued if only they will listen to the truth.  There are those that are of the same ilk as GC and will look the other way.

              I'm reasonably sure his info has been almost all scrubbed from court websites. I am going back and looking again and having a hard time remembering what I had on my computer last year, but I know there was a divorce with children, I just can't remember if it was on Missouri or Illinois. I found one new suspect based on my looking into the stabbing I thought might be against Chism. I'll probably post more on that later. It's all so suspicious.

            Just to clarify- some on the registry are not pedos and rapists. There are non- violent offenders on the list as well (18 year old with younger gf. for example. It is not right to limp them all together as they all are currently.

             I get your drift but, it Depends on how young that gf of the 18 yr old is.  Maybe she was 16 and his next one will be 14.  There needs to be oversight on these cases.  Many times crimes lead to something more nefarious when we allow them to slide through a loophole.  It is a message that no one is watching.

             that's not really totally accurate... there is almost always a 3 year window for 18 year old people, called the Romeo and Juliet exception.

             If you spend some time looking at the sex offender registry it says the date of the offense and the age of the victim. I went looking a few different times and the oldest child I saw ever as a victim was around 12. Most were between 3-5 at the time that they were raped and most of the pedos were convicted of aggravated rape meaning at knife or gun point.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sex offender registries do include adult rapes as well.

              I was 16 and my husband was 22 when we met.  Trust me.  He's no pedo.  There are cases where this would be prosecuted.  And then there are the kids getting in trouble for sexting and some of them have to register.   Not ALL sex offenders are dangerous pedophiles.  That's my point.  They should not have to be lumped in with the ones who are dangerous and be punished for life.

             I think arresting someone for urinating is stupid.  If they were exposing themselves, that's another thing, but a ticket could be handed out.  Another way to fill up jails.  The whole system needs overhauling.  Just like our govt.  smh.

             It is really really really hard to get off the registry, it's mostly life time. But I am sure they make an exception for certain operatives.

            How about we give them all face tats -- maybe a big black "P" on their foreheads? That way they won't have to register, and kids will be able to see them coming with plenty of time to run.

              Remember it is because society allows it.

             Anyone living in Mo. should contact those officials.  They have let down the whole state.   Who ever heads those departments, well their heads should roll.

              The Missouri police are all involved in the cover up. Only way that will do any good is if they have something they want to use to punish an operative who doesn't play their game correctly.

                Yeah it's a hotbed of operatives who were brought here from Mexico and the Middle east and Pakistan, as well as obviously the low life people who were already here and appear to be practicing Satanists.

               I wrote a letter with no return address. I told them I lived there and am not voting for anyone that voted for that change in the law. I have done that before.  They want your info so they can send you campaign lit.    I am not from there.

                 I still get all kinds of lit from Democrats and am constantly throwing a bunch in the trash.  I have thought about letting them know I am not voting for them anymore, but I love the idea that they are wasting their money on me.  I am thinking of sending a letter to my state telling them they had better never do what they did.  Everyone should send those letters.

             This is my thought too.  What worries me is they made a change to their laws.  They should be strengthening them, and not finding loopholes for them.  We are on here everyday fighting for the Safety of Our Children and they are helping the pedos hide away.

                 That's why we have to keep posting on here, and spreading their filthy crimes.  Those that know how to meme and to use twitter are also very useful.

                  I continue doing what little I can. Most minds are not ready for the info, so I try to jokingly hint around until people ask questions. Then I challenge them to learn on their own, starting with Aleister Crowley, the Kinsey Reports, and find the connections between L.Ron Hubbard, Anton LeVay and the many politicians that have served for twenty plus years. I'm well aware of much of what pizzagate entails, all the way back to the days of Crowley's sex magick.

                  I meme and post around facebook when I can. I'm currently on another 30day ban. I don't do other social media sites.

                   Thank You from the bottom of my heart.  We could use an army of people like you.  You don't know how much good you are doing.  Each person that you get through to will continue what you have done.
