<p>Testimonies from pizzagate and pedogate survivors are one of the richest sources of information about how to cope with the trauma of sexual abuse as a child and adult.  In her new book <em>PTSD: Time to Heal</em>  Cathy O\'Brien, survivor since infancy of sexual abuse and mind control, tells how she overcame years of intense programming.  It is a small book, but it\'s as though a trusted friend is telling you how they got through it, and you can get through it, too.  Cathy\'s focus is about regaining your freedom of thought and breaking the chains of past trauma.  Her suggestions aren\'t technical but they are sound.  And in this book she does not go into any of the details of her previous books.</p>
<p>Many survivors are afraid to go to therapists because often professional therapists are \'in on it\' or ignorant of SRA or mind control.  While Cathy is clear to say this book is not a substitute for professional care, she suggests that you can trust yourself to find your way back to you.</p>
<p>Her suggestions are simple, but not easy.  Constantly taking notes of surfacing thoughts and impressions is an essential part of her recommendations.  She recommends having a notebook always at hand.</p>
<p>An interesting idea Cathy touches on is that everyone suffers PTSD of one varying degrees, including everyone who witnessed 9/11 for example.  Trauma shuts down part of our brain so we can survive the unthinkable.  This book is a starting place for people seeking to find their way back to themselves.</p>

            Cathy o brien had her genitalia mutilated into a face. Documented. The hampstead kids recall monster and satanic faces on genitalia of the perpetrators. This isn't a coincidence. PleAse please please look into Loving Hut restaurant. I won't sway opinions with my own. Just look and come to your own conclusion....

             Schooling was a problem especially when Senator Byrd moved her to a parochial school where she hung out with a group of Monarchs who switched personalities all the time, in unison. No one seemed to care that her grades were poor because her mother was mind-controlled and her father was using her for personal business gain.

            Conventional therapy is 100% waste of time.  The ONLY therapeutic modality that ever helped me was EMDR, and even some of those sessions didn't do anything.  The practitioner's skill is a critical factor (my sessions were done by different therapists).

            Anyone here take the ACEs quiz?  (Adverse Childhood Experiences)  My score is a freaking 9.  I have only ever even heard of ONE other person who has a 9, and she is a freaking "star" since it is so rare.  Even on the "Aces Too High" website there are no 9s except me.

             Thanks so much for sharing your experience and what worked for you.  I have heard others say that EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) really worked.  And there is no need to trust or build any emotional dependency on the therapist which is another advantage.

            I really am so pleased to see that Cathy OB is coming into her own these days.  She has been so  ahead of the curve, and still is!  She's already on it with help for recovery.  In some ways we are all experiencing echoes of the traumas of the criminal cartel mind control and sex slave victims by listening and reading their stories and hearing about victims that didnt make it.  Also fighting in this fight definitely brings its own set of unexpected traumes on a different level ha ha so we could all use what this brave woman has learned and has to pass on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a good recent interview with her about her life and new book and also an interesting channel to explore

            Could this book help an underground journalist to gain any important new points of view? Or even to find some new evidence?

             It is not evidentiary like her Book
             <em>
              Trance Formation in America
             </em>
             which is very informative about her experience with childhood trauma, MK-Ultra mind control, being a Monarch Presidential model, and the various people in power she was forced to service.
             <em>
              Time for Healing
             </em>
             is all about healing from trauma and regaining your mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             It does emphasize an important but little known fact of time loss in MK Ultra survivors.  Because diffferent personalities can be inadvertently cued, the base or main personality may sense it as an inexplicable loss of time.

             Yes, there's a part that talks about statues that have the organs inside of them and some are created with the cremated remains. I believe this is the kind of statue Abramovic is using in her spirit cooking video where she's splashing/painting blood on a child-like statue.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit to add: To be more clear, in the book, O'Brien says that the statues are sold for ritual purposes and the organs and remains are from aborted fetuses and sacrificed newborns.

               Yes, the statues are made with baby parts. I wish I knew what page it's on, but she talks about how her husband would bake the baby's organs inside the statues when they're being fired, or mix the cremated remains into the clay. I couldn't imagine...

               I hear you. I haven't turned up anything that would provide clues as to where one would get them or any other information. I've tried all sorts of search terms even to find historical references about such practices. Seems like it would definitely be an underground/know someone type of purchase. Silk road product, or back room of a hoodoo shop would probably be a source. In the book, she said her husband sold them to people who knew exactly what the statues were.
