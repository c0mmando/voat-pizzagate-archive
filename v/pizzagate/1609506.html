<p>My research into this topic began with my reading the following: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085</a></p>
<p>It discusses the Alefantis connection in purchasing the Pegasus Museum property at 3518 11th St Rear, Washington DC. It was purchased by Alefantis from the ‘Estate of Joseph T. Scheve’ and ‘Nellie Hubbard’. I wanted to know if Alefantis just bought the Pegasus Building from an estate sale or if there was truly a deeper connection between Scheve/Hubbard and James Alefantis. To do my due diligence, I started by digging for the document that drove the above linked VOAT post.</p>
<p>The following is a direct quote from that document (that drove my entire research path—note: emphasis added by me)</p>
<p>“Superior Court of the District of Columbia PROBATE DIVISION Foreign No. 2011-0104 JOSEPH THEODORE SCHEVE, Deceased NOV 5, 2008, Date of Death Notice of Appointment of Foreign Personal Representatives And Notice to Creditors NELLIE T. HUBBARD, whose address is 1801 HARBINGER TRAIL, EDGEWOOD, MD 21040, was appointed Personal Representative of the estate of JOSEPH T. SCHEVE, deceased, by the DISTRICT Court for PRINCE GEORGES County, State of MARYLAND, on NOV 26, 2008. <strong>Service of process may be made upon JAMES AKFANTIS, 5031 CONN. AVE., NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20008, whose designation as District of Columbia agent has been filed with the Register of Wills, D.C.</strong> The decedent owned the <strong>following District of Columbia real property: 1644 NORTH CAPITAL ST., NW, 3518 REAR 11TH ST.</strong> The decedent owned District of Columbia personal property. Claims against the decedent may be presented to the undersigned and filed with the Register of Wills for the District of Columbia, 515 5th Street, N.W., 3rd Floor, Washington, D.C. 20001 within six months from the date of first publication of this notice.

Pub Dates: SEP 29, OCT 6, 13, 2011. “</p>
<p><strong>Two facts jumped out at me from the above quote:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>James Alefantis was an AGENT OF THE ESTATE of Joseph T. Scheve Since he is not an attorney or fiduciary (that I know of), this means he would have to be a close friend/associate of Scheve/Hubbard (much more than just a casual acquaintance).</li>
<li>Joseph T. Scheve owned TWO (2) properties: “3518 REAR 11TH ST” (Pegasus Museum building) AND 1644 NORTH CAPITAL ST., NW So being the curious person that I am, I decided to investigate the SECOND PROPERTY</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>INVESTIGATION: 1644 NORTH CAPITAL STREET, NW (THE OTHER FORMER SCHEVE/HUBBARD OWNED BUILDING)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here is a list of some important facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This place looks similar to the original Pegasus Building in purpose. A funky art space in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood.</li>
<li>This building was know as the BORF building. It was leased by a funky artist collective who had shows and exhibits there (pretty similar to Pegasus pre-&quot;Pegasus Museum. Pegasus used to be known as Paper Sun which was an underground space used by local bands).</li>
<li>AS OF 2008, BORF NO LONGER RESIDED AT 1644 NORTH CAPITAL. Essentially, they had a rough relationship with the landlord (JOSEPH SCHEVE).</li>
<li>Construction started in 2011 with building of a third story (much like was done at Pegasus.)</li>
<li>
<p>WHEN WAS 1644 NORTH CAPITAL NW SOLD BY SCHEVE?  Actually sold by “Estate of Joseph T. Scheve” because Scheve died in 2008.
Total or partial ownership of this property was transferred via a grant deed on September 28, 2012. Likely sold in a tax sale: This was a MONDAY, JULY 16, 2012 document with a list of District properties with unpaid taxes to be sold at Public Auction.  3101 0080 &amp;IMP TX JOSEPH T SCHEVE G E SCHEVE 1644 NORTH CAPITOL NW <strong>$2,568.01</strong></p>

<p><strong>HERE IS MY DEDUCTIVE REASONING KICKING IN:</strong>The combination of the name of the LLC (1644 North Capitol LLC) and the time it was formed (September, 2011) jumped out at me. An LLC with its name as the address of the property was formed ONE FULL YEAR before it was purchased. According to the JUNE, 2012 document showing the property (still owned by Scheve...whom Alefantis is an agent of his estate) is up for public auction due to unpaid taxes. This is very curious to me. One can (perhaps) logically deduce that the is some connection between Thomas and Alefantis/Scheve. Also, a picture from 2011 (from a link in previous post: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1580870">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1580870))</a>)) shows the renovation of the property in its beginning stages.</p>
<p><strong>A COUPLE OF OTHER FACTS ABOUT 1644 NORTH CAPITAL, NW</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>General Contractor for the 1644 project: AG Contracting Services.</strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ag-contracting-services">https://www.linkedin.com/company/ag-contracting-services</a> <a href="http://www.manta.com/c/mm48dbz/ag-contracting-services-llc">http://www.manta.com/c/mm48dbz/ag-contracting-services-llc</a> </p>

<p>AG Contracting Services is a construction and MINING MACHINERY company. Mining machinery (to me) = TUNNELS IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CONNECTION NEEDS MORE VETTING; HOWEVER...a construction company that is also a MINING MACHINERY company is VERY curious to me in the overall context of Pizzagate.</p>

           It discusses the Alefantis connection in purchasing the Pegasus Museum property at 3518 11th St Rear, Washington DC. It was purchased by Alefantis from the ‘Estate of Joseph T.

           <strong>
            HERE IS MY DEDUCTIVE REASONING KICKING IN:
           </strong>
           The combination of the name of the LLC (1644 North Capitol LLC) and the time it was formed (September, 2011) jumped out at me. An LLC with its name as the address of the property was formed ONE FULL YEAR before it was purchased. According to the JUNE, 2012 document showing the property (still owned by Scheve...whom Alefantis is an agent of his estate) is up for public auction due to unpaid taxes. This is very curious to me. One can (perhaps) logically deduce that the is some connection between Thomas and Alefantis/Scheve. Also, a picture from 2011 (from a link in previous post:
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1580870">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1580870))
           </a>
           )) shows the renovation of the property in its beginning stages.

Mining machinery (to me) = TUNNELS IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CONNECTION NEEDS MORE VETTING; HOWEVER...a construction company that is also a MINING MACHINERY company is VERY curious to me in the overall context of Pizzagate.

             @TimesUp
            </a>
            I'll summarize my findings combined with my conclusions:
           </p>
           <p>
            I found that 1644 North Capital, NW was also owned by the FORMER owner of the Pegasus Building Joseph Scheve (3518 REAR 11th St NW). Because James Alefantis was an AGENT of his Estate, I believe Alefantis had some level of control of BOTH properties. Alefantis BOUGHT 3518 REAR 11th St, NW (Pegasus) in 2014. 1644 North Capital, NW was sold to Syga Thomas (Maedwell Companies) in September of 2012. I believe James Alefantis had some level of control in this sale. Syga Thomas has an interesting connection to James Alefantis due to the fact he is on the board of DuPont Underground (Alefantis also has had a significant level of interest/involvement in this project). The construction of the building happened ONE FULL YEAR prior to Syga Thomas purchasing 1644 North Capital (1644 North Capital LLC was formed in 2011 and purchase happened in 2012). In my opinion, the only way this would happen is if Thomas knew the previous owner and/or knew the person/people in control of Scheve's estate (Alefantis was one of those people).
           </p>
           <p>
            NOTE: Joseph Scheve was the Business Manager for the Hope Academy in Hiattsville, MD (affiliated with the Unification Church (Moonies)). It has been called out in a previous post that the Pizzagate kids may be kept in houses near the Hope Academy including Scheves old address at 7292 Finns Ln, Lanham, MD. The Moonies have had a reputation of having really weird sex rituals promoted within the Unification movement founded in South Korea in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Upon researching 1644 North Capital NW and eventually finding the owner Syga Thomas, I came to see that he has an interesting resume which made alarm bells chime in my head in relation to the context of Pizzagate. He worked for the State Department as a Foreign Service Officer (2007-2015) (Haiti, South Korea, Niger, Pakistan in which he had pictures with children some of these countries), he is an entraprenuer with a variety of small businesses (District Maids, Moano (clothing line), etc.) and he founded Thomas Foundation (NOT related to Wendy's founder Dave Thomas) with an inoperable website. These things (IMHO) are strong candidates to be used in money laundering and other nefarious activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Syga also employed an interesting General Contractor to perform/lead the work on the project: AG Contracting Services. Upon further research, I found that they were also a mining equipment wholesaler (think TUNNELS). Upon looking at the Google street view, I notice a big fence erected behind the building (notice difference between 2009 street view (Google) and 2014ish streat view (Bing)). I also found that Syga Thomas' PRIMARY RESIDENCE is 43 Quincy Pl NW which is RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER from 1644 North Capital. The alley BEHIND 43 Quincy Pl actually runs right up to 1644 North Capital. Who knows what the full extent of the construction behind the buildings was, but he did use a General Contractor that also specialized in mining equipment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as a note, someone notified me that George Webb talked about Syga Thomas in one of his YouTube videos last weekend (Day 97). Webb went as far to call out Syga running a "Brownstone Operation" out of 1644 North Capital. Honestly, that wouldn't surprise me.

            Good discovery and summary of complicated information. It's a challenge to try to explain what's going on around suspicious properties (and tunnel systems) in NW DC, especially in view of the property owners' curious backgrounds! Glad you've taken on this challenge,
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd love to read a brief TL;DR version of your findings, along with a conclusion about what you think it all means!

            Nice to see the property angle being worked! Is there a list of "places of interest "?
