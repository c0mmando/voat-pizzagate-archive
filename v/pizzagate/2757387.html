             Another reason not to watch TV. Unless they're going to be factual and show the little boy becoming a medical patient for the rest of his life on hormones. And when he lacks insurance has to buy the hormone meds blackmarket. 
40% of Israeli female transgenders are having to do that.

             </a>
             The article also states that 3/4 of them have received verbal abuse . I guess Israeli transgenders ,all 0.5% to 3% of them, won't be happy till they have a chief Rabbi and PM as drag queens ordering people to cease and desist their "persecution" of transgenders.

             Very good article! It led off to another story discussing who is involved in making money on this: none other than Planned Parenthood! You know there's big bucks in transgender medicine when they get involved:
            </p>
            <p>
             As dozens of its clinics closed amid a dwindling U.S. abortion rate, Planned Parenthood has moved to diversify its business model by getting into transgender hormone therapy.

            </p>

             A small moneyed minority is able to manipulate public law, public opinion with influence that stigmatizes anyone that disagrees: whose tactics does that sound like?

            I think this is related to pizzagate because it's another way of grooming/indoctrinating/sexualising/perverting/warping our children.  They're saying gender dysphoria is the new anorexia.  What's alarming is that it suits the agenda of big pharma--tell kids there's something wrong with the bodies and put them on life-altering drugs--and it suits the money-grubbing parts of the medical industry who are making a lot of money mutilating kids' bodies.

            The trans agenda sets its sights on putting an end to women's sports, because now any man can claim womanhood and compete w/ women.  Fallon Fox was mediocre until he played against women. Now he's enjoying breaking women's bones and sending them to hospital.  He broke the orbital bone of

             Feminizing men is something I have noticed more and more.  Not only are they doing this with as you say, Atrizine but also with fashion, hair dos.  Remember the big push over pink shirts for men, and they stupid saying, Real Men don't eat quiche.  There is a push yes to feminize them.  The man bun now there is another thing.  Yes, I have also noticed how tall our girls are getting to be.  Some are so tall and big boned they look like small men.  There has been Roundup found in oatmeal health bars.  There is lead in the water.  All of these things contribute.  If you ingest even one of these there is danger, but the thought of consuming all of them or a combo, well it is frightening to say the least.

               Freaky and totally outlandish!  While most of these will be worn by attention seekers, it is the ones that will be spun off as toned down versions for the mainstream that worry me.  This is setting the stage for even further feminine-ization of men in the future.  This is what they are aiming for imo.  Many will totally reject this, and be reviled but it will sneak in some way.I could definitely see a few pieces of this in my wardrobe.  I don't mean that in jest.

             Don't forget soy.It's in everything on the grocery shelf, even things that you'd think wouldn't need it.It's in animal feed, so we get that second hand.

             A lot of illegal pesticides banned here are still used in the national forests in illegal marijuana grows. Many of our rivers start out in national forests and pick up pollution downstream.
Speaking of hormone disruption, when 10 year old boys wear size 12 shoes, you know something's out of kilter. Increasing weight leads to bigger feet. What's in our diet that's so addicting that we eat more and gain more?
            </p>
            <p>
             "  At the beginning of the 20th century the average woman wore a size 3.5 or size 4 shoe. This increased to a 5.5 in the forties and remained this way till the 60s. By the 1970s, the average female foot was a 7.5 and now, forty years later, the most common foot size for the American female is somewhere between an 8 ½ and a 9."

            Oh my God. I will be honest.  This subject always makes me sick.  Sick, because I feel that trans gender, especially children are being led down a horrid path by some therapists, doctors and those that wish to normalize for selfish and NWO reasons.  We have seen stories about Desmond the Amazing who is being forced and egged on to perform as a Child Drag Queen.  There is a march on to screw up our kids.  I have read that  They will never become the sex they think they want to be, for if they stop taking their medication, they will revert back to what they think they Don't want to be.  They will always be the sex they were the day they arrived here on earth, and at conception.
           </p>

            I am sure everyone remembers the sad story of Chelsea Manning.  Chelsea went through a sex change that was paid by our Military.  Can you even imagine that? We helped mutilate that man.   I am not saying that Chelsea was not suffering and going through a lot of anguish, but what she should have had was some serious help by a very experienced doctors and therapists that have specialized training  I don't believe they did their job were she is concerned.  What happens if someone in her situation loses her/his job and can't pay for their medication?  That is something that I don't want to even think about.  I totally agree that this must stop. This is another money maker for those that have no problem preying on the mentally ill. The are the Modern Day Frankensteins,imo.

               Thanks for posting that.  What does that say about surgeons who amputate women's breasts to make them "men".  They must be laughing all the way to the (Swiss) bank.

              OMG.  That is amazing.  I think the only way you could duplicate it would be to do a screenshot and post it with your phone.  I am not sure if that would dox you or not.  I am not privy to that info.  Imagine if we could buy those.  Those two guys in the picture well, they look really weird together.  When you click the pic it says property of brownsteincraine

              On the day whistleblower Chelsea Manning is released from prison, RT looks back on ‘Collateral Murder,’ the most explosive revelation from Manning’s leaked documents – a haunting video depicting US military killing Iraqi civilians.
             </p>
             <p>
              Two Reuters staff – journalist Namir Noor-Eldeen and camera assistant Saeed Chmagh –  were killed in the attack, along with driver Saleh Matasher Tomal, whose two children Sayeed and Doha were injured when the US opened fire as their father attempted to help the injured.

                I was in the US military, so yes, I can absolutely see the possibility. I was gangstalked and harassed heavily for being a whistleblower. I wouldn't put it past them to change Manning's sex. Would it be insensitive to ask? I've never looked into Manning's history. Maybe he's always felt like he was born in the wrong body? Anything like that? If he has zero history of gender dysphoria, then I'd be very inclined to believe the military changed his sex to teach him a lesson.

                 Manning seems to want to actually be a female, so in order to do this do you think the military used heavy MK Ultra type programming or brainwashing of some kind to make him believe he is female? I know it sounds odd but he dresses as a female and wears makeup and whatnot. Vogue magazine ran a story that he was “woman of the year” or some bullshit a while ago. Did he transition before or after he leaked the documents and info? If after, then why would he believe the military would pay for his surgery after he became a whistleblower? That would lead one to believe it was done as punishment for leaking the info. This is also why the president axed the trans in the military so they wouldn’t have to pay for all these people joining just for paid surgery.

                  may be wrong, but I think I saw him in full uniform dress as a man being led to his confinement, the brig which is brutal.  Maybe that is when they tried to break him.  That could be the time they put him under some type of brainwashing treatment.  From what I have seen of her now, what with running for office, I wonder if they plan on using her as a kind of normalizing tool.  See how happy she is now?  That's what I thought last time I saw a pic of her campaigning.  I tend to go with the punishment angle only because I know how demented and evil they are.  Either way it is cruel beyond words and sad.
