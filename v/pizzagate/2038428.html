            The Nazis are dead and buried. But this reminds me of my all-time favorite newspaper correction
           </p>
           <p>
            Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Alfred Kinsey was Jewish.

            <p>
             Your link does not appear relevant to the post, DeanKeyHote.  Whether Alfred Kinsey was Jewish or not, here's some of what we do know about him:  He was fascinated with sham artist and pedophile Aleister Crowley; he claimed incest was a positive thing and that babies should be sexually stimulated by adults....oh and he liked bugs.
             <em>
              So did the serial murderer freak in Silence of the Lambs for that matter
             </em>
             In addition:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               He was promiscuously bisexual, (with his wife and coworkers also encouraged to have sex with each other).
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               His masochism knew no bounds. He had a lifelong habit of sticking toothbrushes into his urethra, bristle end first.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               He circumcised himself with a pocketknife in his bathtub.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               He liked to suspend himself by a rope tied around his testicles, an activity that once landed him in the hospital.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               He had pierced his own genitals in so many places that they wound up almost entirely perforated by the end of his life.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Kinsey's method was notoriously, derived largely from persons on the fringes of society--prison inmates and the denizens of gay bars, the latter being in the 1940s and fifties much farther outside the mainstream of American life than they are now.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              Then there's Kinsey's strange fascination with pedophiles...
             </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              with the horrific data on the frequency of orgasms in infants and children he derived from interviewing child molesters blandly recorded in his volumes alongside the more ordinary perversions. One particularly monstrous pedophile, a man who had sexual relations with various of his family members and molested hundreds of children, kept regular contact with Kinsey and his associates.
             </p>
             <p>
              They assured him that they wouldn't turn him in to the authorities, despite the fact that he continued to molest children throughout the time of their correspondence. Kinsey justified such aiding and abetting of criminality in the name of "science," of course. Never mind that his technique was utterly contemptuous of the science of statistics. Kinsey could not have chosen a less representative sample of American society
              <em>
               (unless)
              </em>
              if he had intentionally set out to do so.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only "beneficiaries" of Kinsey's revolution, if that's what they are, are people pretty much like him: oversexed men, now free to use other human beings as sexual playthings and then toss them aside like so much rubbish as they move on to the next conquest, unconstrained by any legal, financial, or moral obligations to the objects of their lust. Every unborn child scraped out of its mother's womb, every AIDS patient wasting away in suffering, testifies to Kinsey's true legacy. And among the living, it is those whom liberals claim to champion--the poor, especially fatherless black teenagers; unwed mothers; abandoned wives etc....who have perhaps suffered the most from Kinsey's transvaluation of values.
             </p>

               His obsession with Crowley is not what you mentioned...you posted some article with a 100 year old Jewish woman telling people that sex can be great at 20 or at 100.  The link sucked, I had to do a separate search to see who the other 5 were.

                I merely sourced the funny lying "correction." The jewish pornographers was bonus.
               </p>
               <p>
                His obsession with crowley is redundant, which was my point.
               </p>
               <p>
                Europeans evolved in a difficult physical environment in which it was impractical to have multiple sexual partners/illegitimate children.
               </p>
               <p>
                Theres no reason that would suddenly change in 1960.  Elite jews intentionally undermined the family unit as they did in soviet russia as a TACTIC OF CONTROL.
               </p>
               <p>
                The fact that college courses teach the Kinsey Scale without mentioning he was a vile pervert is not sloppy history.
               </p>
               <p>
                Somehow i find that more relevant than his nazi penpal.

                 "Nazi penpal?" Don't you get it? The Nazis were allowing that shitbag to rape children probably in the name of "science." Look up Operation Paperclip. Our enemies are Nazis, not "teh jooz."

                 Actually it's just your word, you didn't source the original (not that I didn't believe you), I didn't see Kinsey mentioned at all.  Since your account is so new and you assume a knockoff of someone else's name, it's on you to prove whether or not you're a troll.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That being said, one would think that that article would give some kudos to Kinsey, if nothing else, they could have like they did here:
                 <a href="http://notchesblog.com/2014/10/28/orthodox-sex-alfred-kinsey-and-the-re-making-of-jewish-sexuality/">
                  http://notchesblog.com/2014/10/28/orthodox-sex-alfred-kinsey-and-the-re-making-of-jewish-sexuality/
                 </a>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  We are indebted to Dr. Kinsey for recording the intriguing paradox of, on the one hand, the openness and frankness of Jews in talking about sex, and on the other hand, their relatively greater restraint in its full biological (and especially illicit expression).
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 You said:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The fact that college courses teach the Kinsey Scale without mentioning he was a vile pervert is not sloppy history.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Somehow i find that more relevant than his nazi penpal.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 The original article, if you read it, is an excerpt from a book:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The following is excerpted from my upcoming book, Kinsey's Attic: The Shocking Story of How One Man's Sexual Pathology Changed the World. Further details on Kinsey's Gestapo/Nazi "sex researcher" are found in my book, Kinsey, Crimes &amp; Consequences.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 I used the title of the page, although I almost changed it to: ... Kinsey: How One Man's Sexual Pathology Changed the World.'
                </p>
                <p>
                 If what you say is true, remember that for people to know
                 <strong>
                  <em>
                   why it's not sloppy history
                  </em>
                 </strong>
                 that college courses don't mention his shoddy science, his perversions, and his paying pedophiles to rape children and babies, then first they need to know exactly those things.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Only when the facts of what he did are known to people, will they be more convinced that the goal of pushing his 'findings' and his career onto the American socio-political stage was to do exactly what you said: Undermine the family unit to exert control over people (i.e. society).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now that does bring up questions regarding those who made that happen, maybe we can ask the 100 year old Jewish sex therapist about that.

                  The best way to honor the Greatest Generation is to expose those who tricked them into a war.  Many American patriots didnt see defending Poland as a vital national interest -- theyre labeled nazi-sympathizers now.  Maybe we should honor the ones who tried to avoid 400k American deaths.

            when they put the german people into those concentration camps they had open slather on the children they had separated from the parents. they performed unspeakable acts on them in the name of science and research. everywhere there is war there are vulnerable children. whoever sanctioned hitler moved the nazis into america, australia and other countries to protect them. they continued their experiments on children under the blessing of the cia. sadistic paedophiles are the worst specimen on the planet. they enjoy power and they gain sexual pleasure from torturing maiming and killing children. there is nothing more dangerous than a paedophile and a sadist combined because they have no empathy no conscience and they enjoy hurting pretty much anything that moves but especially children.

             People say Marquis de Sade had a vivid imagination.  Maybe he was more of a documentarian than we realized.  That's why the elites had him imprisoned and took away his writing materials at times.  What if De Sades writings were more fact than fiction?

             Balluseck...corresponded with the American Kinsey Institute for some time, and had also got books from them which dealt with child sexuality. [Tagespiegel, October 1, 1957].
            </p>
            <p>
             Not only did he commit his crimes in Germany, but also during the war as an occupation officer, he committed numerous sexual crimes against Polish girls of between 10 &amp; 14 years old. [Der Morgen, May 15, 1957]
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Balluseck... [recorded measurements] of his crimes committed against children between 9 and 14 years old... in four thick diaries... of a pseudo-scientific character...while in correspondence with the American sexual researcher Kinsey... about his research results which as he said himself, took place over three decades. [Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, May 22, 1957]
            </p>
            <p>
             The connection with Kinsey, towards whom he'd showed off his crimes, had a disastrous effect on [von Balluseck]...[I]n his diaries he'd stuck in the letters from the sex researcher, Kinsey in which he'd been encouraged to continue his research....He had also started relationships...to expand his researches. One shivers to think of the lengths he went to. [Tagespiegel, May 17, 1957]

             That description reminds me of the doctor who was a topic on here recently because of tapes that were found in his house of the abuse he perpetrated on children in his care.  I don't remember any other details. Anybody?

            <p>
             It's truly horrifying what this man did, but I can't help wonder if he had been a victim before becoming a monster.

               Thanks for checking into that. The last link is the doctor to whom I was referring. But there are sadly too many.

               Dr. Bradley certainly seems like a follower, possibly even a fan, of Kinsey.
