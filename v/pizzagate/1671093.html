            Ok, curiosity got the better of me. The symbol seems clear, Rogan may be implicated, but he cannot do what Milo, as a victim and self identified witness, can. I feel strongly that we are short on time to follow up with him and my focus is there. 
In closing: damnit dude, I'm not mooloch.

            The people on the left who are asking him to "name names" would not make the same request for one of their own. It is another case of exploiting someone else's principles as a weapon against themselves.  Milo is not the first to say that this problem exists and did not specify names.  As I recall, it is only a person with influence and the wrong political opinions that has this demand made against them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Naming names, without evidence, is defamation of character and exposes the victim to a lawsuit. It also normalizes witch-hunts. Maybe a lawyer can make some recommendations, but I think that the best course of action is to contact the local police department of the perpetrators and give them a statement, privately. If the perpetrators are well connected people, then that might not be good enough or expose you to retaliation, which is why most victims stay silent until there is enough public information.  This public information includes the police doing their job and investigating based on statements given to them in private.

             What your argument neglects is the element of public pressure which can bring elite pedophilia into the light.
I am not an attorney, nor do I play one on TV, but understand that there is such a thing as eyewitness testimony.
And you're wrong; Milo's politics have nothing to do with his moral obligation to name the names. It's a false argument, particularly from a community which only exists to break PedoGate wide open. We've no clear idea of how recognized pedogate is - but the documentary An Open Secret has more mainstream visibility. This link, coupled with Milo's platform, would bring 'the rings' to a larger awareness.
 If it were Christ Almighty, Santa Claus or Bernie Sanders who outed himself as a witness to elite pedophilia, I would advocate the exact same thing.

              The topic of elite pedophilia is a bit different because for the unconnected perpetrators, the legal system works if you use it correctly (working with the police, etc.)  For elite pedophilia, the legal system makes exceptions for them.  So we do need to expose the system that makes these exceptions possible.  This community is doing that by finding connections and exposing currption; just naming names is not good enough.  When Cathy O'Brien named names, she also included a preponderance of evidence about how this system worked.  Sorry, but you skipped over the defamation of character problem, so the argument for your methods is incomplete, in my opinion.  Eyewitness testimony is given in court.  You have to get there first.  If you publicly accuse someone of this before going to the police and starting a trial, then it looks like defamation of character because if you were actually harmed, you should have started the legal process to prosecute them first.  So you can end up reducing your chances to bring them to justice if the first move is only a public accusation.  I want these people in jail, and I think that your current advocacy does less to make that happen then the methods that I recommend.

            I see a triangle, it's possible it is the curled into itself pedo symbology we all are haunted by. Do you intend to research Rogan?
If your aim is to elite Hollywood pedophiles, please consider the content of my post and realize we have a singular lead: Milo can name some of "Bryan Singer's stature."

            I agree. I also watched Stephan Molyneux's analysis, and I had to agree with him.

           <p>
            Milo is making excuses to protect his mind, and I can relate and empathize, but it is big-boy pants time, and he needs to stop running and start fighting back.

             Thank you for responding. I cannot understand why the research community refuses to embrace this enormous break, but so be it. Getting Pedogate into the light isn't about remaining in the echo chamber, and Milo's profile puts that in reach.
What I'm advocating is a use of #ExposeEmMilo twinned with pizza and pedo #s - and any others that might boost this tiny effort into the mainstream. I did have some small headway with #DeposeMilo (along with some surreal slander; wtf) and suggest that be used too. We don't have a lot of time, so I ask you directly to use the tags and help the few of us who realize that Milo can do - and must do - what he can to protect victims now, although he sat by and watched at the time. Are you on twitter? Any other platforms? Please help. Thanks for responding.

              I also recommend spreading Molyneux's video, since he is a friend to the cause, and is very popular. If Milo himself could be made to listen to it, or anyone else saying the same thing, that would be great because in the end, this requires Milo to introspect, and probably ragecry a lot, and then make some actually dangerous moves.

              HE has to decide.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have no twitter, I got rid of FB a year ago. I do have a junk FB acct though and used that to appeal to Milo.

               I'm writing a post to send to him and Milo (again) now. Would be glad for your thoughts (formatting did not hold, in terms of readability):
              </p>
              <p>
               We've prayed for a victim or witness to human trafficking to come forward. We've gotten one with an audience: Milo Yiannopoulus. This is a mayday to capitalize on Milo's outing of­ himself as a witness to pedophile parties thrown by Hollywood elites of "Bryan Singer's stature," where he saw acts that "beggared belief," i.e: men drugging and raping "desperately young boys." #ExposeEmMilo Time is of the essence. Although media misdirected from the true leak, TPTB know he is indiscreet. He's in danger now and must realize his only move - for his honor and his safety - is to go name names. He must speak under oath. #DeposeMilo His childhood experiences with pedophilia and past work mean nothing if he does not. It need not be said that his own abuse puts him under the highest moral obligation to do so. Watch Milo's interview with Joe Rogan - the clip tagged pedophilia makes what he saw crystal clear. Watch #AnOpenSecret. Twin the tags here with relevant and trending topics. Please. Milo is singular and could open a floodgate. We won't get this chance again.

                The sentiment is in the right place. However what I would do is humanize it. This reads like profiteering press copy.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would be less wordy, more direct. No need to quote or talk about hashtags, they know. Just include the hashtag at the bottom with the signature.
               </p>
               <p>
                Mention other survivors(like myself) who care deeply about taking action, and who also love and respect Milo. Do talk about time sensitivity, and helping others who cannot help themselves.
               </p>
               <p>
                Make it about the way the offenders get away with it, while the victims self destruct.
