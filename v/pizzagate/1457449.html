<p>at 22:00 a UK mayor states that filming pedophilia is real.  
</p>
<p>The video describes the elite blackmailing process.</p>
<p>Everything after 23 minutes is snips from other youtubers, but the first 23 mins provides interesting information that shows the reality of pizzagate in the elite.  Now to dig for connections... </p>
<p>After 23 minutes a rehash of the podestas involvement in the Mcmann abduction begins.</p>
<p>Edited to add:  RE the podesta/abduction sketches..... Ole Dammegard did an interview saying that he never saw the podesta pictures during his coverage of the Mcann abduction; which causes  some people to   theorize that the  abduction  look-alike sketches  were later planted and used as blackmail to keep podestas in line.   It would make sense because in  2004 Podesta had already done an interview mentioning the construction of his underground living space.  He began to put child torture art in his house,  perhaps in sequence with the Mcann abduction that places them nearby but with no lead to them by investigators during that time.   Now  the pictures emerge which is a warning to everybody else to keep underground and not be as visible. </p>
<p>The first 1/2 of the video helps   remove  the  \'\'fakery  imagination\'\' theory  that the mainstream media want to promote.</p>',
