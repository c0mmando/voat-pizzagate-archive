            Yo, so, after sleeping on it and thinking about it some more. what i am seeing is the first W@ll(the online forum) seems too be a cesspit of libertards that was borne from a group of commies that lived on the "farm" from the 60's. There have been allegations of "deviance" in the said commune the farm, obviously denied, just as they denied it was a cult, and still find it hard to say the word to this day. Anyhoo, judging by the loho of the pyramid im gonna say it was an early attempt at creating an online pedo network and looking into what we know of CIA involvement in the creation of the counter culture of the 60s, it is more than likely the Well, and the Farm were CIA operations. Now, the online Well might be connected to the other Well foundations , so far the only connection is the San Fran liberals, who are all down with the new age Aquarian agenda, which you can see by looking into the farm. So, the libertard connections aside, the common theme i am seeing with the well foundation is that they work with the helpless, the poor, the needy, child abuse and human trafficking, abused mothers, etc etc, are you starting to see a picture here? These people place themselves in and around the vulnerable and the Well Foundation seem to have what i would deem a pretty tight global network all interlinked. The logos on most of the sites i show you are what superficially connects their occult leanings, the same libertards are the second theme, the rd theme is the vulnerable, a forth theme could be the connection to the the Haiti disaster, which im looking into, and a 5th theme they all come under the name Well Foundation but don't seem to be related in anything other in name? Maybe the W@ll is a basic code in itself? I wouldn't use an @ for an e, who the hell is gonna get that without being told? I am going to do an awful lot more reading and get names as its hard to find out info on this Well Foundation, all seems to be one guy according to Company records.

            Thanks. i found that a fascinating read on other levels, and very informative. As for the Well community, it was the very telling logo from their early days that lead me to the Well Foundation, if in nothing but by name association alone. Again, thanks for the article.

            And Comet Pizza is just a pizza joint. The logos are what initially drew interest. The first one was one of there old ones, it was a masonic checkered Pyramid and it also has the pedo @ used twice, once with a man running with a card with just the @, then using the @ symbol for the E in Well. Quite a few of the other logos on twitter etc are also satanic in there symbolic nature, one turns into the Horned Devil salute with a V. It was basically the Well that lead me to the Well Foundation, which is where the trail continued. The logo for the Well(online) was from an old pizza website that had been taken down. I went into archive and go a screenshot and that's where i found the pyramid logo. And yes, San Fran seems to play a big part in this scandal, certainly not just WDC.
