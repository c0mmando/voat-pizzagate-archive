That connection is their Vice President of Technology and Science Dr. Hal Puthoff.
This guy worked with the CIA on Project Stargate(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project)</a>) basically the CIAs infamous program relating to Remote Viewing and other psychic abilities.
This work they did for the CIA was deemed ineffective and declassified in 1995.
Now read this quote from Hal Puthoffs Wiki page (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Puthoff">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Puthoff)</a>)
Puthoff took an interest in the Church of Scientology in the late 1960s and reached what was then the top OT VII level by 1971.[3] Puthoff wrote up his &quot;wins&quot; for a Scientology publication, claiming to have achieved &quot;remote viewing&quot; abilities.[4] In 1974, Puthoff also wrote a piece for Scientology\'s Celebrity magazine, stating that Scientology had given him &quot;a feeling of absolute fearlessness&quot;.
The level that Puthoff attained is described as
&quot;On New OT VII one solo audits at home daily. This is a lengthy level, requiring a considerable amount of time to complete. It is the final pre-OT level, and culminates in attainment of the state of CAUSE OVER LIFE&quot;
Puthoff then leaves the church and proceeds to do start working with the CIA now this isnt to say this guy isnt an amazing and well rounded scientist he has a PHD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford, but why would he get into scientology so deeply as to reach the 8th level only open to a select few AFTER he had already attained his PHD. This means that he was a literal genius already with a Stanford PHD and he decided to drop minimum 200k into this &quot;Religion&quot;
Furthermore he worked with the CIA during the 70s - 80s.
I would like at this point to mention Operation Snow White
&quot; It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history,[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations&quot;
One of the goals of this Infiltration was to plant embarrassing materials in Confidential Archives so as to later embarass the governement through FOIA requesting documents that painted the US Gov as incompetent or evil.
It sounds to me like Mr.Puthoff is one of the Snow White Agents and Project Stargate was targeted disinformation. The fact that he is now working with Tom DeLonges Disclosure movement makes me worried that we may be on the cusp of a Blue Beam scenario coordinated by scientology.</p>',

            Tom DeLonge Lyrics
"Golden Showers In The Golden State" from to the stars-album
           </p>
           <p>
            Your dad can suck my cock if he can come and play
Your mom can to touch my dick every single fucking day
With the fingers on my hand, your brother he will buckle
For another dollar fucking do it to your uncle
It's a hot damn day down in California
It's a grand old way in California
If you come and play, I just gotta warn ya
           </p>
           <p>
            You can take a dump on my chest if it's okay
Just don't take a piss in someone's mouth when you're away
I jack myself to sleep every night, I'll have a dozen
I'll let you watch the show when I'm pooping on your cousin
It's a fun, hard day in California
It's a grand old day in California
Can you come play here in California?
California, this is California
We fuck in California
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a fun, hard day up in California
It's a grand old day up in California
Can you come play here in California?
California, this is California
We fuck in California
           </p>
           <p>
            And this is California
And this is California
We fuck in California
And this is California
We fuck in California
We fuck in California
Cause this is California

            I got a pretty crazy connection between The Clintons, John Podesta, Scalia, and David Miscavige. The leader of Church of Scientology. They use the same set of lawyers and worked on the Scalia cover up and replacement. The church of Scientology was supposed to be investigated by FBI for human trafficking but nothing ever happened with the case and seemed to squashed with no explanation ever about it. I really think there is a huge connection here and the church is POSSIBLY the "Big Fish" in this whole search

            Under the heading “Scalia replacement,” Stone wrote, “Remember our discussion of Wallace Jefferson, Chief Justice in Texas?”
Podesta replied, “Yup.”

            I then stumbled upon how the Clintons and The church of Scientology have been working together since around 1991. There are way too many similarities and coincidences for these two to not be connected. These people are on the same team as each other using the same playbook and plays. I think the church is a cover up for the Elites and the human trafficking. An FBI case doesn't just drop and never hear from it ever again. Clintons 25 year relationship with Scientology
