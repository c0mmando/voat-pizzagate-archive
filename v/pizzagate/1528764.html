<p>After watching the undoing of Comet PP, and seeing the tangible relationships uncovered between each storefront, I decided to take a streetview cruze up Connecticut Ave NW.  I was looking for an area that had not been scrubbed clean and held the potential for clues.  Here’s what I have found so far.</p>
<p>Cruzing on Connecticut Ave, I was looking through the eyes of the awakened. Armed with the incredible amount of information learned on voat, I just started REALLY looking at my surroundings.   Did I see anything that jumped out at me?  What was it, and why did I notice it?  
</p>
<p>I saw the swirly symbol embedded in a store name.  So I stopped in to take a look.  Using Yelp, google images, Instagram, and other similar sites, I virtually walked around and just looked.  
</p>
<p>What things caught my attention?
• Any known symbol (swirl, triangle, heart/heart, etc.)
• Any visual or mention of a basement.
• Any odd photo sharing (especially if it has been linked to other suspicious accounts!)
• Any unnecessary reference to pizza, hotdogs, etc.
• Open Late/Live Bands
• Located near suspect (imo) chains like Starbucks, Subway, Dunkin Donuts, or other homegrown, locally sourced vendors (like Voodoo Donuts)
• Located near schools, or in other non-traditional or unexpected locations
• Connection to suspected elite players
• Connection to known players
• Resemblances to other suspicious setups</p>
<p>I checked out the neighbor businesses too.  First I cruzed with street view, and started a list of what I saw.  Then I went to map view, and noted what businesses currently appeared in the same location/address. What changed, and what stayed the same. And the who’s and why’s of it.</p>
<p>I journeyed through trade magazine and newspaper articles.  (I also archived many of them along the way.) IF YOU DON’T KNOW HOW TO ARCHIVE, please search voat for information.  This is VITAL to the investigation to preserve evidence!!!!! There are many different ways/sites that do it. Just be sure to archive at least one way. BEFORE you post the link.  
</p>
<p>So here’s my journey so far.</p>
<p>I stopped here first because of the &amp; and the embedded swirly symbol.
I have noticed, and found relevant, that the ampersand is used frequently in hiding the swirly in plain sight.  (potential investigative trail: businesses with an ”&amp;” ampersand in their name.) I found their business premise similar to Politics &amp; Prose.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, one of the players in my journey showed up in voat today. &amp;Pizza Pronounced “And-Pizza”.    <a href="https://voat.co/pizzagate/1527997">https://voat.co/pizzagate/1527997</a> Www.andpizza.com Didn’t Prince go through an ambiguous name phase?

<p>Steve Salis********** &amp; Pizza Connection***********:
Fresh management and a new direction at Kramerbooks. <a href="http://archive.is/M4Exw">http://archive.is/M4Exw</a>
“Steve Salis, founder of &amp;Pizza, has a plan for kramerbooks: expansion. Namely, taking over the 800 square Willie Ts next door” 11/18/16.  
</p>
<p>********I have not explored very far down the &amp;Pizza brand or Steve Salis.  THIS IS AN EXCELLENT LEAD TO INVESTIGATE! The &amp;Pizza brand calls its workforce a “tribe” and many of them are tattooed with the brand logo. <a href="http://archive.is/fdUDZ">http://archive.is/fdUDZ</a>
Www.andpizza.com
And it’s cofounder Steve Salis has just moved to Kramerbooks.</p>
<p>&amp;Pizza sounds like another CPP type op setup.  Find the locations.  Look around. What businesses are nearby? Have they changed in any substantial way? Is there a reasonable or logical explanation for this change? Does the setup of businesses indicate anything that could collectively form a resource for the entire operation? Watch some mob movies-how did they keep huge operations secret while in plain sight? I suspect that tattoos have big involvement in this.  When did the term “tramp stamp” come into use?</p>
<p>Willie T’s Lobster Shack (1511 Connecticut) found on streetview:
Sudden closure: According to Yelp, Willie Ts Lobster shack next door closed between Feb 11, 2016 and Feb 20, 2016 according to yelp reviews. “Just went there.   2/20/16.   Closed empty store front.   Had nice walk from hotel!   Sign says &quot;we will be back??&quot;
<a href="http://archive.is/XKsMC">http://archive.is/XKsMC</a></p>
<p>Renovation replacing Willie Ts:<br />
Mums the word on the details of the renovation of Willie T’s <a href="http://archive.is/sGVHm">http://archive.is/sGVHm</a> but another news story gave a little more information <a href="http://archive.is/M4Exw">http://archive.is/M4Exw</a>  It states that renovations will be ongoing for 18 months, and they are also “creating a children’s book annex that is expected to open next week.”</p>
<p>DuPont Optical (1509 Connecticut) using maps:
The next business is located at 1509 Connecticut: Dupont Optical.  <a href="http://archive.is/FBeRb">http://archive.is/FBeRb</a> The reviews on their website go back to 2011, but that may have been in a different location.  However, when I tried checking the business name and address, I got 0 results at this govt lookup site:</p>

<p>Interestingly, on Yelp, Dupont Optical was first reviewed on 9/21/15, with the next review in February 2016. <a href="http://archive.is/GFQ7S">http://archive.is/GFQ7S</a></p>
<p>Axis Salon (Previousy at 1509 Connecticut) found on streetview:
The previous tenant here was Axis Salon.  It closed suddenly in December 2014. Yelp reviewer calls it a “hidden gem with an easy to miss entrance” on 11/11/14.
<a href="http://archive.is/Pt7yv">http://archive.is/Pt7yv</a> Apparently a patron with an appointment arrived to find an empty storefront.<br />
Sidebar: Here is a flickr account for Axis with some of the strange window dressings including bunny ears on pigs, bears, and a raggedy ann doll.  <a href="http://archive.is/clbBz">http://archive.is/clbBz</a>
Note the entrance looks the same as the DuPont Optical entrance, so there were not two different companies occupying/sharing this space at the same time.</p>
<p>Beadazzled (1507 Connecticut):
Not a lot here IMO, but mixed customer service reviews on Yelp. A reviewer for Axis Salon mentioned this shop as providing him more information about the staff relocation from Axis Salon. <a href="http://archive.is/N0MIs">http://archive.is/N0MIs</a></p>
<p>Other Items of Note:
The address for 1519 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington DC has multiple business names associated with it.  I couldn’t’ tell when the business dates overlapped though.  Worth a shot at checking the address and see if any of your investigative keywords show up (i.e. phony business fronts/owners). This may just be shared office space upstairs, but worth checking into. Some preliminary digging: Fundrise. 1519 conn Ave nw D.C.

           Interestingly, on Yelp, Dupont Optical was first reviewed on 9/21/15, with the next review in February 2016.

           Axis Salon (Previousy at 1509 Connecticut) found on streetview:
The previous tenant here was Axis Salon.  It closed suddenly in December 2014. Yelp reviewer calls it a “hidden gem with an easy to miss entrance” on 11/11/14.

           Apparently a patron with an appointment arrived to find an empty storefront.
           <br/>
           Sidebar: Here is a flickr account for Axis with some of the strange window dressings including bunny ears on pigs, bears, and a raggedy ann doll.

           Note the entrance looks the same as the DuPont Optical entrance, so there were not two different companies occupying/sharing this space at the same time.

           Beadazzled (1507 Connecticut):
Not a lot here IMO, but mixed customer service reviews on Yelp. A reviewer for Axis Salon mentioned this shop as providing him more information about the staff relocation from Axis Salon.

           Other Items of Note:
The address for 1519 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington DC has multiple business names associated with it.  I couldn’t’ tell when the business dates overlapped though.  Worth a shot at checking the address and see if any of your investigative keywords show up (i.e. phony business fronts/owners). This may just be shared office space upstairs, but worth checking into. Some preliminary digging: Fundrise. 1519 conn Ave nw D.C.

              The name Carr made me think of Son of Sam and David Berkowitz, hard to believe it would be a related Carr though, he had had a church that was involved in Satanism, the Samuel Carr associated with Berkowitz.
