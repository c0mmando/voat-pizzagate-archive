<blockquote>
<p>In November 2006, after Democrats retook the house, Hastert announced he\'d step down from leadership in the next Congress. He didn’t have much choice in the matter. That fall, a story exploded that likely cost Republicans their House and Senate majority: Florida Republican Rep. Mark Foley, it was revealed, had repeatedly made sexual advances to several congressional pages. Hastert, the speaker at the time, had allegedly been told by House colleagues about Foley’s history of messaging teens, and did nothing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why did the Page report it?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t do it to sink the Republicans, though as an aspiring Democratic politico, I wasn’t sorry to see it happen. I did it because I realized just how easily Rep. Foley had been evading accountability for repeat offenses, and that the House leadership was either unwilling or unable to solve the problem. I had no idea what I’d eventually learn about the speaker in whose hands the problem was placed.</p>
<p>In 2006, it seemed clear the House leadership knew something inappropriate was happening with Foley and the pages; Hastert’s disgraceful exit from the speakership that year reflected this suspicion-by-consensus. But knowing what I now know, it’s chilling to realize that the speaker of the House had, decades earlier, allegedly sexually abused a teenage boy while working as a high school wrestling coach. What if Hastert’s neglect was not simply incompetence, but choice? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Page Program</strong>
Is this just a grooming program? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I knew I wanted to be a page since literally the first time I heard of it, right around the time that my seventh-grade love of professional wrestling gave way to an eighth-grade love of politics—I had to get into the page program. I volunteered long hours with my congressman for years to make it a reality. In August 2001, weeks before my junior year of high school, the acceptance letter came in a thick envelope from House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. I had been granted admission to my own personal Hogwarts.</p>
<p>During Labor Day weekend, my parents and I joined a block-long line of 70 incoming pages and their doting parents for move-in day. We were all living away from home for the first time, housed in a dorm that often took on a summer-camp atmosphere. We were adolescents, subject to the same teenage romances and cliques as all high schoolers, only ours played out in the halls of Congress. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Did he just mention underground tunnels?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That first week was a blur—the need to familiarize yourself with the Capitol, to make sense of the House office building system, the Morse code-like bell system and corresponding row of tiny lightbulbs found on every clock on the Hill, the cramped labyrinth of hallways in the basement, the underground tunnel system. We began memorizing the names and faces of every member of the House, using a stack of hundreds of glossy photos as flashcards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vulnerable kids</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That was our introduction to Washington, D.C.[9-11] We were 16-year-olds, alone and in the middle of it all. Our families were back home, and in their absence, we became a family, with all of the affection, arguments, favoritism, comfort and drama that families entail. Looking back, I realize just how vulnerable we all were. 
When the House was in session, we had to be there, too. If they started early in the morning, we’d end our school day early enough to be on the floor before they arrived. If there was a big vote and they stayed late into the night, we were there until they finished. </p>

<p><strong>This article from May 2015 &quot;Hastert La Vista, Baby!&quot; mentions a lot of rumors and gossip, which could provide more names and relationships to explore.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/EXqo4">http://archive.is/EXqo4</a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Most people now forget that, in 2006, the Mark Foley scandal engendered much talk about outing other secretly gay Republican congressfolk... Lawrence O\'Donnell [on MSNBC] also strongly indicated that Hastert was homosexual. In fact, O\'Donnell came that close to making the claim directly.</li>
<li>At the time, Hastert lived with his Chief of Staff, Scott Palmer. The two were inseparable. When Dennis Hastert\'s wife Jean made one of her rare visits to Washington DC, she stayed in a hotel -- on Valentine\'s Day.</li>
<li>The rumors of homosexuality swirled around Hastert throughout 2006. The next year, he announced that he would not serve out his time in office.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, but the Chief of Staff\'s not underage or anything...
~No, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>WMR\'s State Department sources have also reported that the visits of Hastert and other congressional leaders and staff members to certain Southeast Asian nations and the Northern Marianas should come under the scrutiny of the House Ethics Committee, now officially investigating \'Pagegate.\' The Northern Marianas became infamous in the scandals involving Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff because of the presence in the US slave labor territory of Asian children being used as prostitutes.</li>
<li>&gt;
*&gt;Gotcha. So he was carrying on with underage rent-boys while he was Speaker on fact-finding sex tours of the Northern Marianas.
*&gt;But in that case why does the indictment only have a single &quot;Individual A&quot;?</li>
</ul>
<p>~Oh, wait. Here come those convenient federal prosecutorial leakers again:</p>
<ul>
<li>A source familiar with the investigation told BuzzFeed News that U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon considered but did not pursue additional charges against former Speaker Dennis Hastert, which would have included a reference to an Individual B, one of potentially several alleged victims of &quot;prior misdeeds.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The feds don\'t actually have jurisdiction over Hastert\'s high-school sex life and, in the state that does, the statute of limitations has kicked in. But that\'s no reason for them not to dispatch another couple of dozen investigators to go crawling over Illinois. I mean, it\'s not like they\'ve got anything else to do, like investigating Lois Lerner or Hillary\'s server...</p>
<p>~Speaking of &quot;several alleged victims&quot;, was this one of them?</p>
<ul>
<li>The call came in while Hastert appeared on CSPAN\'s &quot;Washington Journal&quot; on Nov. 13 [2014], a week after last year\'s midterm elections. </li>
<li>The caller identified himself only as &quot;Bruce&quot; from Illinois.</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Hello, Denny,&quot; the caller said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Do you remember me from <strong>Yorkville</strong> ?&quot; he added, before laughing and hanging up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Individual A&quot;? Or &quot;Individual B&quot;? Or C, D, E or F?</p>

            No doubt that Hastert's private life was well known at that time.  I remember in the heat of the Foley scandal reading about Hastert.  It was posted in a story on the sign in page of MSN.  At the time i still had dialup internet with MSN and was really quite surprised to see that in headlines on the sign in page.  The story stated frankly that Hastert was well known within the DC gay community for his penchant for hiring young male teenage prostitutes.  It was also interesting to observe the dead silence about that everywhere else.  It was years later that Hastert had the scandal himself.  But it was clearly well known information at the time of the Foley outing also.

            Here is a blog from 2006 with a good timeline of the Foleygate scandal. It's about a 1/4 down the page.

            However, I would recommend skimming the blog page (the first link) all the way down to the bottom. There is a lot of information in there.

            Sounds like most Congress members had to know about Hastert. He lived with his Chief of Staff and his wife had to stay in a hotel when she visited. Makes you wonder about Pence and others who supported Hastert during the Foley controversy.
