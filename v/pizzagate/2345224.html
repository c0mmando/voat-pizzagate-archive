<p>&quot;A panel of abuse experts cleared Wooody Allen&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Dylan\'s pediatrician cleared him&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Woody Allen has never been charged with pedophilia&quot;</p>
<p>. . . and yada yada yada . . . </p>
<p>Point of facts:</p>
<p>1) It was one of Dylan\'s pediatricians who reported Allen to the police:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dylan-farrow-responds-woody-allen-678552">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dylan-farrow-responds-woody-allen-678552</a></p>
<p>2) The panel of abuse experts were negligent in handling their records, and they all refused to testify under oath in court about their report (possibly because they didn\'t want a public record available in the court records about their negligence?) The judge refused to acknowledge their report as credible:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-shea/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-shea/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866.html</a></p>
<p>3) While the prosecutor declined to charge Allen <strong>criminally</strong> (because Allen\'s lawyers made it clear they would torment Dylan on the stand if the case went forward) <strong>in a family court case in which the judge ruled against Allen completely and denied him custody of the children, refused to give him visitation rights</strong>, and awarded legal fees to Mia Farrow because of abusive litigation tactics on the part of Allen\'s lawyers the judge stated clearly in his judgement that <strong>multiple credible witnesses made it clear that Allen had behaved in sexually inappropriate ways with Dylan Farrow.</strong></p>

<p>So, yeah, Woody Allen\'s lawyers gamed the system to keep him from being charged criminally, <strong>but there is a published family court judgement that describes witnessed pedophiliac behavior by Allen.</strong></p>
<p>It\'s in the public record, folks.</p>
<p>Whenever the shill publish some BS, take to Twitter and comment sections and show people the links to the facts.</p>',

            An especially pernicious claim is that a police report said there was no evidence of molestation and that's why Allen was not charged.
           </p>
           <p>
            Complete BS. It was the State Attorney who made the call not to prosecute, based on what would be inflicted on Dylan.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The state attorney, Maco, said publicly he did have probable cause to press charges against Allen but declined, due to the fragility of the “child victim.
            </strong>
            Maco told me (Maureen Orth) that he refused to put Dylan through an exhausting trial, and without her on the stand, he could not prosecute Allen:

             If Woody Allen took pictures of an underage girl, he could have gone to jail.
However, she was not underage.  She was going into her sophomore year of college I believe
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm the same age as Soon Yi and I just turned 22 when the scandal broke in early 1992.  Her birthday is Oct, so she would have been 21 when the pictures were found and probably 20 when they were taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             Her father is Andre Previn, she was not Woody's step-daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's a ton to be said about Woody and Soon Yi but those are the facts.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is not really meaningful because by law the doctors have to call the cops.  Duty to Report it's called.  This is even if the doctor does not turn up evidence of abuse.  I have a question, can you find a medical professional who thought Dylan Farrow was abused?   I haven't come across one.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were two investigations one in NY and one in CT.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mia Farrow phoned Dr. Susan Coates, a child psychologist who worked with the family.  Coates called New York City Child Welfare. This kicked off the NY investigation.   They would investigate for 14 months
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html.">
             and then conclude no abuse occur.
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             New York State child welfare investigators have dropped their inquiry into the charge that Woody Allen sexually molested his 7-year-old daughter, saying they consider the accusation unfounded.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            After Farrow called Coates, she called a lawyer, the lawyer suggested to take her to a pediatrician.  They go to a CT Doctor and Mia later testified that when asked Dylan said her father touched her shoulders.
            <s>
             I don't think this resulted in the police being called because Farrow would go to another doctor a few days later.
            </s>
            (I'm wrong.  Vanity Fair says the police were called on Aug 6th) But before that doctor visit, over at least the next day Mia Farrow makes a video where she interviews Dylan.  The video is not continuous. It stops and starts.  A nanny would say in a deposition that this was made over 2 or 3 days. So you do not see what Mia and Dylan say off camera.  I just learned today that Linda Fairstein head of the Sex Crimes Unit in NY for 25 years said most prosecutors were put off by the video and disturbingly Dylan was naked for part of it.  The Yale team believed coaching of Dylan occurred when the camera was off based on the fact that what Dylan's story was not consistent.

           </p>
           <p>
            They go back to a different pediatrician with the video four days after the original incident

            <p>
             2) The panel of abuse experts were negligent in handling their records, and they all refused to testify under oath in court about their report (possibly because they didn't want a public record available in the court records about their negligence?)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is complete spin.  This was a very well respected team dealing with Child Abuse.  See the Linda Fairstein interview above.
They were not negligent.  It was their standard procedure that once they finish their report, they got rid of their notes. The report is the work product that stands not their raw notes. The FBI does something similar. They offered a sworn statement in the custody case.  The first couple of pages
            <a href="https://radaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/yale-new-haven-hospital-allen.pdf">
             of the report are available here.

           <p>
            Um, no.  The CT prosecutor could not bring a case because the official State Police investigation stated flatly. "It is our expert opinion that Dylan was not sexually abused by Mr. Allen."
           </p>
           <p>
            And what is your basis for this claim?
(because Allen's lawyers made it clear they would torment Dylan on the stand if the case went forward)
The XO Jane link you post certainly doesn't provide any basis and it barely has anything to do with the facts of the Allen case, as the author never mentions any.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>

           <p>
            Exactly.  Woody Allen was never charged with assaulting Dylan Farrow.  He was never found "not guilty" because there was no criminal case in CT or in NY.  There was a custody case and Farrow won custody.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             So, yeah, Woody Allen's lawyers gamed the system to keep him from being charged criminally,

           <p>
            Complete Bullshit.   Give a single example of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            How did he get the CT State police investigation to conclude no abuse occurred?
           </p>
           <p>
            How did he get the NYC Child Welfare investigation to say the charges were unfounded.

             Why wouldn't he have been allowed to adopt?  Who said he adopted only girls?  I think you are jumbling up your timeline.   Woody Allen adopted Dylan and Moses Farrow at the same time.

                They say a pic is worth a thousand words so yeah the look on the girls faces when he hugs them is pretty sad ? Are you a fan or just think someone accused of being a pedo should be able to adopt because they have money ? I don't know if you have been here a while but there was an excellent post on what the judge said about Woody . He believed it enough that Woody wasn't allowed to see the children unsupervised .

                 A picture is a moment in time and you have not idea what people are thinking when someone snaps a photo, perhaps they don't like papparazzi photos.

                 I'm a fan......of due process.  When accusations get looked into and found to be unsupported (in two different states), then guess what?  You retain your rights.

                 Allen was not found NOT GUILTY, he was never charged because the evidence didn't support it.

            Yes he did what he's accused of doing. No he's not part of any pedo ring he's too neurotic and unreliable and nervous to be involved with other pedos, they could never trust him to keep the secret.  What he did to Dylan he did by himself because that's what he was into back then. Now he's too old to do that but he should have been prosecuted for it 25 years ago.
