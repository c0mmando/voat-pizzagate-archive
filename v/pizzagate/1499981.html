Not saying that that Comet Ping Pong and Pizzagate isn\'t real - I think it WAS before they &quot;sanitized&quot; it (That is for another discussion).</p>
<p>Now I am talking about <strong>BEFORE</strong> Comet Ping Pong became the focus - not the Alefantis Instagram photos and the now infamous, heavily edited, ultra-creepy performance video.</p>

            They must have built a hoax for years if I understand you right ( all made up) That would be unique in sooner history, not? Everytime they hoax, they fail, they are like: Mmmh I am hoaxing fucking apes now...and its funny..

            I certainly hear you on the amoral. That whole world is very foreign to us everyday people I guess. Good perspective to consider. No one has the "whole picture" at any given time. And smoke &amp; mirrors must be a knee jerk reaction.

            I would hope Dr P (can't spell his name) has some respect for democracy bec he is not an elected official but tends to make decisions about our country according to his own judgement, which appear to be good since lying &amp; murder as routine is/was? a v bad thing. So, why did it take so long, how could he allow such atrocities to continue?  There are still so many powerful bad actors on the ground. Just don't see how it is going to get wrPped up. Nourembeg type trials?  Castration of pedos?  Oligarchy still very cozy w Trump. This is not over and I hope he does not think so.

            I guess the release of Podesta emails in particular were perfect for the pizzagate angle to drive the rejection of HC coup. I do remember some relief when someone with *some authority was acknowledging these horrors while all tptb just looked the other way. Without his testimony, that is still the case. Very good analysis.

            So your thesis is that the uncovering of the comet network is a pawn sacrifice to distract from Weiners laptop?

            Pieczenik however, is heavily involved with Russia. He has personally worked with Putin when he was a CIA psychiatrist, and says about the Russians you can get everything done if you only have respect.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is the guy the 'CIA sources' are talking about. The mails were leaked by FBI insiders to wikileaks,  but Pieczenik and guys like Alex Jones have been involved in the ideological background that made these FBI agents act like they did. This is their so called Russian connection.
