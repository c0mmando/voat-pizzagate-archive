            Just speaking as parent who has home schooled in a totally different state it was my responsibility to withdraw my child from public school and notify the school she was now being home schooled. This seems so fucking unnecessary in all aspects. She, the mother, should have notified their public school. At the same time, this is absolutely NO reason to remove children from parental custody.

            Exactly, and when they fuck with the wrong house trying to take kids for the wrong reason things usually get ugly and guns get pulled. Who do these CPS fucks think they are coming into a house thats not theirs to take kids that aren't theirs? I'm pretty sure if we tried them with the same dog shit and pulled a "sir you're taking the wrong vitamins" therefore i have to confiscate your kids, I'm sure they'd flip shit. But no worries nobody fucking trusts the government or anything they are or choose to be or anything they believe in. Fuck them wholeheartedly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having said that, "parents" who deserve to get kids taken away to a better place are usually more than evident and neighbors or surrounding people are more than willing to give their testimony on that particular family. And those shitty families do exist unfortunately. Not everyone under the sun is meant to have children. But I'm seeing more of the former where CPS is the one bending their authority. When really they are meant for last resort.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm a fraction less worried now that more people are seeing the dirt and calling them out on their flaming horseshit.

            Definitely. I'm just saying who is keeping account of this shit. We have stuff like OSHA to make sure business are following safety guidelines, but not for the handling of children? Nobody asks any kids how they are being treated there? Nobody is making sure these kids are doing okay? I don't even know what we would need to make sure CPS is in the best interest of the children. This whole thing just beats my brain to shit. But when CPS is being this fucking lazy, not checking shit, what are we supposed to think? Do they think this shit is a game to them to a point where they just go off of assumptions? do they not know that are playing with the lives of real families who may never recover from shit like that? If I was working there I would check and double check before i get myself and my organization in deeper shit than it can get out of. The shit and smear thier own name left and right and expect people to just trust them? They literally have shit for brains.

            Well... I see what you're saying but I disagree with you. The public school system is shit, so free thinking individuals are definitely a threat to their sick and stupid society that they are trying to breed. Why have a protester to their shitty system if they don't have to have one? Or seven? I mean did you not even look at the reasons for why their kids were taken in this thread? We're talking about an unauthorized mineral dude? &amp; kids were taken? uh oh johnnys dad took some fish oil we that we didn't approve of, better take all his kids? Go ahead, protect CPS now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also noticed a trend in this thread they are going after families with more children because theres strength in numbers and one child who thinks for himself isn't as big a deal to them as a family of 7 children that can all think for themselves and always be able to think deeper and clearer because they are surrounded by one another and can be a stronger example to others and have a safer safety net because they have one another.
           </p>
           <p>
            source: came out of public school system. aware of how shit it is. learned more in 5 minutes of being out of school than 12 years of that garbage.
           </p>
           <p>
            edit: not saying theres not neglectful parents who dont deserve children. just pointing out the incredibly weak reasons for them doing so in many, many cases.

             Last year, Illinois followed the lead of the mecca for asinine initiatives and nanny state legislation (California) and amended the vaccine exemption rules to include the requirement that parents who chose not to vaccinate must now get a signature from a doctor that they've been "counseled" on the dangers of not vaccinating.   The pool of doctors willing to sign off on this is of course slim.  To be sure, the government pretends that this was done simply to protect the children, and to help parents avoid making uninformed decisions.   The next step will be to imitate CA in totally doing away with vaccine exemptions.    Eventually, when enough parents opt for homeschooling to save their kids from being force-vaccinated, this will cut into pharma company profits enough for them to unleash their compromised politicians to pass mandatory vaccines for homeschooled children.  Then CPS can target the "abusive" parents who fail to comply.

             After listening to this attorney speak about his experiences and what he's learned about CPS in CA over the years, going after larger families means big money.   He mentions a staggering amount of federal aid going to CA (700-900 million), but they don't get that funding unless the headcount stays the same or increases.

            I find that CPS is so inept at everything that them actually doing anything is surprising. They don't even have enough people to check up on kids in abusive homes. There are hundreds of cases where a kid has died or been severely abused and the case worker was just too busy to visit or report.

            This homeschooled child was removed by a SWAT team when the parent refused to give her child psychotropic meds that were prescribed.  Now psychotropic meds are also known as black box meds and the FDA recommends that children under the age of 18 not take these drugs yet the medical community along with CPS don't see it that way and there was a 10 hr standoff.

             I remember this case.   I commend her for arming herself to keep the body snatchers from coming for her daughter.   Sadly, they force-vaccinated her daughter when they finally did take her.   Bastards!   I love that she has God in her last name.   In the end, she prevailed, just like God will prevail in the battle of good vs evil.

            This is a video by a Kiarre Harris from 2015 in which there are clips about human trafficking of black people from outside the U.S. and allegations some are used as domestic slaves:

             Wow!   This at first seemed like just another case of CPS stealing children to get the headcount bonus, but given that she is actively working to expose trafficking,  there appears to be more behind this particular attack.   She's a threat that needs to be silenced.    However, their first attempt was sloppy.   I wouldn't be surprised if they go after her with "mentally unfit" allegations, try to cast her as nutcase that not only should lose custody of her children but also needs to be committed.

              Okay there IS WAY MORE to her concern over human trafficking!!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              Check this out from her Facebook page a year ago! It is by appearance the video of a white child with some sort of accent, perhaps British, talking about sexually abusing, sacrifcing babies and cooking and eating them!!! She describes the video as "Sex rituals &amp; blood sacrifices of the secret societies." The video has been viewed 466,000 times. I'm not sure what it is or where it's from, even if it's legitimate, but it's horrifying in any case to hear this child saying what he is:

              It's hard not to wonder if there is more to this case. It is just one brief video but we don't know what else she's posted, and she says she has about 4,000 Facebook followers.

             Sorry, didn't mean to come off the wrong way, I'm one of the biggest proponents of homeschooling, and a lot of experience with it. If you choose to homeschool, it is important to have a law group (support, they do exist) that you're in touch with, plus stay in touch w/ other respected homeschool groups, and stay on the downlow as much as possible.
            </p>

             Keep quiet about it. In Texas all of this is not so  necessary (not so much, but vigilance in all forms is wise). I did it when it wasn't cool, and received my fair share of harassment.

            Homeschooling is a huge threat to the system. Homeschooled kids are not indoctrinated into the leftist ideology and are more likely to be free thinkers. The system is working to control our kids and shape our society by brainwashing our kids from young ages. I am very concerned about the push from the left to provide state run preschool for all children. They just want to get their hooks into the life even younger!

             Unless they are muslim homeschooled. This is why home schooling should have certain rules. Like, don't teach your kids to blow people up, and please teach your kids basic maths. Because, fucking A, that lady at the store cannot, for the life of her count change, but she sure is down with Jesus.

              I'm pretty sure nowhere in the Quran does it allow you to strap your child with explosives and take as many "infidels" down as you possibly can. But what do i know I've only read it a dozen times.

                Of course not arguing that. It happens everywhere, but ultimately it comes down to the individual.

                 Any religion that says that the leaders cant get married, fuck, or have relationships, harbors some bad shit. It's like telling a wolf they can't hunt. Sorry wolf, you only get quinoa and broccoli.

            Yep, neighbor had CPS called on her children because the oldest a Sr in high school had split the side out of his tennis shoe during gym, and a teacher reported that the Sr. had come to school in tattered shoes and was concerned that the child had been neglected. The gym teacher even explained that the Sr. had just done that in class that morning.  Luckly, it was closed immediately! Idiots!

             Makes you wonder why that teacher was so quick to drop a dime.  Considering how vindictive leftists are, maybe the teacher doesn't like that the son is being raised counter to the progressive agenda and saw this as a way to stick it to him and his parents.  Or maybe this teacher is yet another example of a slimy creep who exploits their position with children to serve either their own selfish interests or those of like minds.   Think in terms of a male teacher and a male significant other who are looking for boys to molest.  Unwarranted snitching like this is a great way to keep the pipeline full of prospects.

              I know the students are reprimanded if they get homework help from parents. Children's homework is graded as a zero if it is done any other way but how taught with Commie Core. My nephew will have a complete break down if my sister tries to help him with math homework. He is 13 a 7th grader and will not turn his homework in unless it is completely filled out and answered. If he doesn't understand a problem he says he can't ask teachers for help and even if it means only one problem not completed, he will refuse to turn it in.

            The police and CPS workers are far too often are the goon squad that enforces the globalist agenda on a local level.  I am sorry that you and your children were victimized by these demons, and I pray that God protects you and all the other courageous and wise parents who homeschool or choose not to vaccinate.

             Facebook! good point. As for a lawyer, the system is corrupt, the lawyer will take her money but nothing will change. and then she'll have neither her kids nor her money.

              Yes most lawyers are slimy, but in my experience with CPS of the parent has a lawyer who causes a fuss and scrutinizes the agency, the parents are more likely to get their kids back, and faster. Its sad that it's typically poor families who are most likely to lose their kids permanently.

              There could be more to this, though! She has posted videos on human trafficking, including a horrifying one in March 2016 that shows a young white boy with perhaps a British accent talking about sacrificing and eating babies!!!

               That British boy is the Hampstead kid. He and his sister made some very vivid and disturbing claims of SRA from a cult their father was involved in. The mom videotaped it and went to authorities but ended up having her kids removed by CPS (or the British equivalent). That's an eerie coincidence! There may be something more to this, good find!

                Yes thank you, I just found their page and the video on Facebook:

                I'd heard of the case but only by name with so many other things to look into. Between that video and the one on possibly human trafficking of black people in the U.S., it shows she has an interest in pizzagate topics. We have to keep up on her story and what's going on with her.

                 Those two sibling said a lot of things that were consistent with claims made by others who have been victims of SRA. It was tough to watch. I haven't heard about that second one in Africa but will check that out. Thank you!

             Hello, I was following that thread when it was first posted and was grateful that it was posted, because I had never heard of her case.  I didn't think about it when I posted my submission, thanks for the reminder.

            Oh how quick the system moves to "protect" children from the "neglectful" parent who chooses homeschooling over the indoctrination and social engineering practiced in today's public and even many private schools nationwide.  It is a system that demands total control over its subjects from the cradle to the grave.  Those who thwart the agenda are to be made into examples to discourage further dissension.  The same inefficient and ineffective child protective system that overlooks/ignores countless cases of legitimate neglect and abuse at every turn also moves quickly to "protect" children from parents who have opted for alternative medical treatments for their children over the ineffectual and money-fleecing options suggested by today's corrupt mainstream medical professionals.  This topic relates to PG in that these are two more state-sanctioned methods by which children are kidnapped from their families and oftentimes delivered into the hands of their abusers.
