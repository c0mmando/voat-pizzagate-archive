            If he was married, which who knows, because anyone capable of such a crime cannot be believed.  If he was, his wife knew nothing about the open relationship.  That certainly is a sleazy site.  Those sites should not be allowed on the internet nor on YT.  Anything about How to Kidnap or Murder or Lure a Child or anything similar should not be allowed.  Ever.
