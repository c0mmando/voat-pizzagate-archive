<p>Why create a 16,000 page database of pedogate and all those involved if you\'re just going to delete it?</p>
<p>It doesn\'t seem like this is the case, I don\'t think he deleted it. I think it was flagged and suspended by pedophiles or someone of some institution complaing. REBELSCUM had made many posts that proved DDOS attacks on his site with IP\'s that led straight to security contracters and intel agencies. So, somebody wanted Pizzagate.wiki off the web or at least specific information on the site.</p>
<p>The reason why I beleive is wasn\'t deleted but censored by someone is becuase of the swift deletion of thousands of pizzagate archives on several archive sites related to pizzagate. Rebelscum wouldn\'t go out of his way to delete his own material not only on his site but archives as well. Pedophiles would though.. So, after the deletion of the website a brigade of people started to deleted archive links from the site.</p>
