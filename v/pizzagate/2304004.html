<p>Four For Friday - Annexin A2
Yes, I think it is the most unusual title I may have had for a big blind. It is the focus. The person who has been investigating this for the past decade spent about 30 minutes talking about Annexin A2 and how it works in the body and I just wanted the person to get to the good stuff. The long and short of it from what I understand is that it plays a big part of having a certain kind of cancer. Apparently there is also a way to inject this protein into your body and promote a certain kind of cell invasion which can kill you.</p>
<p>I need you to go back in time a little over a decade ago. Much like last year it was a big political year. Candidates from both parties were desperate to be the next President. One of those candidates had some political baggage. Baggage that was going to come out. Baggage in the form of a written diary that this female former A- list celebrity had kept in longhand for decades. This diary spelled out some very big secrets when it came to sex between herself and some of the most powerful people in politics. When it came to the election, if it came out, it would destroy one of the candidates. The diary mentioned the candidate in detail and also mentioned family members of the candidate. Everyone knew there was a diary. Would the diary be believed? Could they discredit her? Honestly, that would have been tough. Were the entries speculation? Some of it could have been. However, they also knew that she had a year of pillow talk with one of the most powerful people in the country. They couldn\'t take that chance.</p>
<p>Attempts were made to buy the diary. Attempts were made to find and steal the diary. There was one attempt to burn down the home where they thought the diary was located. Finally, they decided to incapacitate her. Their rationalization was that it would incapacitate her and she would be sick for a year or two, but would recover. They were also told during the year of campaigning she would be at her worst and even if she could or did try to speak, they could blame it on the illness and that she was not to be believed.</p>
<p>They waited until flu season. She always got a shot every year. She always did it at an event to encourage others to get theirs. An event that had dozens of volunteer nurses giving shots. One of those nurses gave a very special injection to the celebrity.</p>
<p>Just as predicted, she got sick and developed tumors and was out of commission for a little over a year just like everyone said. It was all a big sigh of relief that they had got away with it and no one died. Our celebrity recovered and people went on with their lives. Then, our candidate thought about that diary and thought about it turning up again if they decided to run again. What would happen if they did it again to her? The scientist said it would probably end up killing the person, especially with the last illness so recent.</p>
<p>Well, once again, our celebrity got a flu shot at the same public event and the same nurse was back four years later. This time the celebrity got sick and never got better. She died.</p>
<p>There is a footnote to this story. The reason the person got in touch with me and gave me a ton of documents and letters and pictures was not because of what happened before, but what happened recently. Last year this A+ list politician was at a public event getting a flu shot and what looked to be the same nurse from before. Before you knew it, the A+ lister was near death. Apparently when you are young you can beat it once, but if you are older, your chances diminish relative to your age.</p>

            Beyond EMF said.....   The Flu Immunization Clinic at the Walter F. Mondale Hall. Addition to the UMN Law School completed in 2001. Possible that Eleanor Mondale received immunizations there. From 2005 onward, Eleanor lived on a farm in Minnesota, until her death.   Wow this is great info, imo.

           <p>
            Bob Marley, Joe Strummer, and the weird case of Katherine McCarthy, assistant to the Dean at Georgetown Law, in the podesta emails - that one bugs me to no end. How does a chatty active single 45 year old woman go from talking to POTUS on phone about clear air act to suddenly dead of (allegedly) cancer in 4 months?

             THIS is a very telling comment left on her obit page from Georgetown:
            </p>
            <p>
             "So shocked to hear . . . Katherine was truly the soul of Georgetown Law.

              She knew everything about the Law Center, everyone knew her and all roads led to Katherine
             </strong>
             . She was a big picture thinker who cared very deeply about the school. It was a privilege to work with her during my fifteen years there. Her family is in my thoughts and prayers."

              And she was the daughter of the former Dean. if you keep digging you will see that nobody even knew she was sick, and that she was in hospice and taking visitors. Lots of big red flags with this woman.

              This reminds me of Molly Macauley.  She knew something too and was killed the same weekend as Seth Rich.  So many died last summer.  The Assange Lawyer was in the Spring, John Ashe, then Joe Montano, then Molly Macauley and then Seth Rich and Shawn Lucas.  Montano Macauley and Seth Rich died very close to each other.  Very Scary and that K McCarthy seems extremely suspicious.  It jumps right out at you, imo.
