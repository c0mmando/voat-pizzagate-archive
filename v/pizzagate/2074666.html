<blockquote>
<p>Tenet Healthcare has had two comings
In its first incarnation during the 1980s and 1990s the company was called National Medical Enterprises (NME). It was involved in a massive scandal defrauding Medicare by buying patients for up to US $2000 each from anyone who could persuade them to come to hospital. The company had contracts with bounty hunters and even pleaded guilty to kidnapping a patients. It bought patients from Canada.</p>
<p>Vast numbers, many of them children did not need hospital admission. The company lied to them and kept them in hospital for the full duration of their insurance all the time providing them with vast amounts of unneeded treatment. All of this was signed for by doctors. The company eventually pleaded guilty to criminal practices in 1994, was forced to sell its specialty hospitals where the fraud occurred, entered into a variety of integrity and compliance agreements and paid in the region of US $1 billion in settlements and compensation to patients.</p>
<p>National Medical now borrowed money and expanded rapidly by a series of takeovers and renamed itself Tenet Healthcare. It claimed to be a kinder and more ethical corporation and many believed them. Its policies were directed to securing regional dominance by buying up not for profit hospitals.</p>
<p>NME entered Australia in 1991. I was already aware of its business practices in its international operations and had been assisted by the Australian Medical Association, the Federal Government and International Airlines in having some matters addressed. I did not however have proof of most of its practices and was unable to block its entry to Australia. During the subsequent years I collected information and was involved in the steps which eventually led to NME, now renamed Tenet Healthcare leaving Australia in 1995.</p>
<p>Tenet\'s second incarnation occurred after the stringent controls lapsed in 1999. It immediately resumed its former business policies and practices. It used its market dominance to rapidly increase its prices while at the same time targeting sicker patients and complex procedures. This allowed it to circumvent the restrictions on profits imposed by Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG\'s) funding.</p>
<p>The second scandal broke in October 2002. It is clear that the many allegations had substance and that Tenet\'s underlying business practices were unchanged from the earlier scandal. It was alleged that it once again gamed Medicare to generate vast profits, and that large numbers of patients were subjected to profitable invasive cardiac procedures and surgery when there was no need for this. There were a host of other allegations and a large number of government agencies investigated. 
Tenet fought bitterly to avoid another criminal conviction. It settled multiple actions from government, community and private entities reaching a final global settlement of US $900 million in 2006. It also accepted a stringent Corporate Integrity Agreement CIA. Although it paid about US $2 billion in relation to all these matters it did not admit guilt in any of them. It insisted that even though some of its practices had been inappropriate they were not illegal.
Insights: There is a vast amount of information available about both of these incarnations. They provide a fascinating insight into the way the corporate marketplace works and why it is so dysfunctional. I have devoted multiple pages to analysing different aspects of their conduct.</p>

            of all places.  Back in 2007 they hated Tenet Healthcare because of the Bush family connection.  Of course, now that the Clinton Foundation is working with them I expect they have forgotten all about Tenet.

            has direct info on this as do I. Tenet healthcare is connected to the Bush Family as well and is linked to organ harvesting...search for connections to Hurricane Katrina. They are also connected through St.Louis Mo and the child trafficking &amp; organ harvesting that is occurring in and around that location. Research where Obama said his favorite Pizza restaurant was and you have struck gold. Hint: It is in St. Louis..Research all the people associated it is not Pizza.

             Hey Jem777, thanks for the comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Pizza place is clearly Pi Pizzeria.  Is the other place you are talking about Union Barber Shop?  I'm not exactly clear what sort of location I am looking for.
             <br/>

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             There is also some mysterious "Euclid Hospitality Group" the Pi Pizzeria guys own.  It barely has an internet presence.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also they run a food truck for charities.

            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: Figured it out.  St. Louis University is partnered with Tenet Healthcare and right around the corner from Pi Pizzeria.

            Tenet Healthcare had plans to deploy to Haiti during the 2010 earthquake.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question is Did they actually have man power there?

             Yes and Tenet is involved in organ harvesting all the way back to Hurried Katrina. You will find Tenet was in Haiti or at least prepared prior to earthquake. How is that possible? Because earthquake was caused by HAARP energy directed weapon, just like 9/11. They create the disaster then make money off the dead bodies.

            Sadly we have surgeons here in UK who are willing to exploit too -  Not saying this is connected, but was interested in knowing where the HOUSE HE OWNED in the USA was.  But can't find any information on it.  Or if he has any connections with people mentioned regarding pizzagate. - He might just be working alone, but its is rather a big operation to fool so many people? Just ignore if doesnt sound connected at all. :)   U.K. doctor convicted of performing unnecessary breast cancer surgeries -

            Archive this stuff NOW! This lead may very well be the "smoking gun" we've been looking for in terms of the organ harvesting aspects of pizzagate.

            When this is all over, I'm gonna host a victory party for the lot of us. Hopefully, the timing of it might end up being a Christmas party.

             Lets hope this IS the piece of the puzzle.  Thanks for linking me in.  The victory party sounds great.  It would be a BIG CHRISTMAS PRESENT to see some of these BIG WIG elites convicted!  That would send celebrations all over the world in the pizzagate research community!  I am excited to see that

            may I request an evidence tag?  All the info in this post are about court cases where Tenet was found guilty or settled out of court.  None of it is speculative the slightest and it is all cited.

            Thank you, mysterywire.  It was harder to find because Tenet Healthcare had the name change but once I found the link it was quite easy because Micheal Wynne provided so much great information in one place.  Usually I would have to make countless extra searches just to get as much info as his one site provided me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found this on Justice Yeldham.  I don't know much about elite pedophilia in Australia so any research you want to do would be greatly appreciated.

             Ok, so reading the story about the compound in Oregon, the researcher said almost everyone on the street to it has the last name Neal. The eye doctor has the last name Neal.....part of all this group?   And with all these types of places around, do you think that the Eagles are alluding to them in the song "Hotel California?"  Cause you know they are creeped out at the beginning of the song and then, realize they know too much now to go back? Just wondering.

              There's theories that Hotel California is based on a former mental health institution with a dark history. That site is now the location of Cal State University Channel Islands, my former college campus. The place is reported to be one of the most heavily haunted sites in all of California.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was this one part of the campus that I could feel a menacing aura of evil from at night. Thankfully most of my time on campus was in the newer buildings where the science labs were.

              I've spent a lot of time researching Oculus Anubis. There are quite a few video's on YouTube. The people on the street do not know or care for their neighbors at the end. It adds to the creepiness.

            FYI carmencita is offline for a while for travel. Anyway, great post! I bet all (or a lot) of the healthcare businesses do this fabricated billing or fake treatment to some extent. It seems to be standard operating procedure.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are fraud charges against Dr. Ali al-Attar (Iraqi fugitive) who "loaned" Imran Awan $100,000;  He is also notable for being among Wolfowitz's associates during the 2003 Iraq war run-up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if Elizabeth Berg (the DNC lawyer) has found anything more on the Mayo clinic connections in her investigations to the FL attorney deaths. Mayo was where peter smith was being treated when he inhaled the helium at the hotel across the street in his alleged suicide.

             I knew she was on vacation but I figured this post would probably be buried by the time she got back and so I pinged her so she could easily see it when she returns.  Also who knows when Wolftrail7272 will be on next.  I think you are right that most healthcare business encourage expensive but needless treatments but medical kidnapping to the extent Tenet/NME did seems pretty darn unusual.  I think that Hillary Clinton associates with a healthcare company that began its existence by abducting kids says it all.
            </p>
            <p>
             I need to look into the Awan case some more.  I got fed up with it and ignored it for a while because George Webb was acting like a drunken histrionic and there was the weird Dave Acton drama.  Then of course Imran gets arrested and it is back in the forefront.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think you mean Elizabeth Beck.  You could ask her.  Here is what I believe is her twitter account.
             <a href="https://twitter.com/eleebeck">
              https://twitter.com/eleebeck
             </a>
             I don't think she will say any more about Mayo Clinic though out of fear of death.  Can't say I blame her.

              yes to all. &amp; I did mean Beck. The Daily Caller has coverage of the Awan's without having to deal with the annoying videos, its where I saw the connection to the Iraqi doctor. I think it  was G. Webb's source in the first place.
