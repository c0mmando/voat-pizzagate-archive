            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/ShaneE11183386">
             @ShaneE11183386
            </a>
            , have you seen our rules in the sidebar? (When on mobile, please switch to desktop view.)
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a research subverse. Unsourced questions can go to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/askpizzagate">
             v/askpizzagate
            </a>
            or
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Please note that headline have to adequately reflect the content of a post (your headline reads like a statement, but you didn't present any evidence for this claim in the body of your post). Also, posts need to have at least one link in the body of the post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Removing, since both the headline and the content of the post would need to be edited (and headlines unfortunately can't be edited on Voat), also since the post doesn't adhere to Rule 4. Apart from that, the post violates Rules 2 and 3.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Rule 2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation. ALL posts must include at least one link.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rule 3: Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate. EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post (except when markup is used to embed links in the specific text they support).
            </p>
            <p>
             Rule 4: Meta submissions and general discussion submissions without sources will be removed. Please submit indirectly relevant posts to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
              /v/pizzagatewhatever
             </a>
             and unsourced questions to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/AskPizzagate">
              /v/AskPizzagate
             </a>
             . Sourced activism / publicity posts and memes are allowed. Posts about the subverse itself go to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
              /v/pizzagatemods
             </a>

            In regards to this subject, it is also REALLY worth checking out the Paul Wilcher's letter to Janet Reno
            <a href="https://jacobsm.com/projfree/report_on_waco.html">
             here
            </a>
            . Paul Wilcher was a Chicago-area businessman back in the 90's who claimed that he was bankrupted by corrupt Judges in the Chicago Bankruptcy Courts (I believe he lost his money in a real estate deal that was supposedly corrupted by certain Judges). Wilcher went on to become something of a "truth crusader", if you will, and started investigating the Waco tragedy. He claims he received information that a Delta Force assassination team was actually responsible for the destruction of the compound.
           </p>
           <p>
            Supposedly, this 4-man Delta Force team  rappelled down into the compound from a helicopter, and released nerve gas into the compound, paralyzing everyone who was inside, except for a small handful of lucky few who were lucky enough to get to the upper floors. The Delta Team then strategically placed white phosphorus ("whiley pete'") tear gas canisters all around the compound, set them on time-release, and retreated from the compound.
           </p>
           <p>
            Horrific shit, as you can obviously guess, supposedly the white phosphorus was released while (mostly) everyone still trapped inside was still paralyzed from the nerve gas the same Delta Team had also supposedly released. According to this theory, everyone was burned to death while still paralyzed. Incomprehensibly evil if actually true. But if you consider the vicious logic of a military assassination mission, using nerve gas followed by white phosphorus is clearly a deadly but effective way to kill everyone, if everyone is trapped in one physical building. Again, horrific shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Wilcher, and this "Bob on the Job," are at all right, clearly the intent was just to get rid of as many of the Branch Davidians as physically possible, no questions asked. Which begs the question WHY? I believe Wilcher claimed he was told that David Koresh and some of his top lieutenants in the Branch Davidians were all mind-controlled already by the CIA, and that the whole Branch Davidian cult was some kind of CIA-run "failed experiment" (not so different from the Jonestown cult) that went seriously wrong, and needed to be terminated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bob on the Job's argument pretty much lines up with this, except he claims that there was another (supposedly CIA-run) compound and secret airstrip right next to the Koresh compound. All kinds of horrific shit was supposedly going on there (trafficking of cocaine, guns, children for CIA-run pedophile and mind control programs). Again, "Bob on the Job" claims the Koresh essentially found out way to much about what was going on, on this property adjacent to theirs, and supposedly had to all be murdered because of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            No doubt this is a serious rabbit hole, just wanted to say my piece. Glad someone brought this up, good luck with more digging!

             Two of the Branch Davidian village members had been able to hack into the  Pentagon/CIA/FBI Black Ops databases, and discovered that the CIA with the  utilization of the CIA's Buffalo Airlines, were daily transferring Cocaine,   laundered money, special operations agents, kidnapped children for CIA  pedophile programs, and arms at the World War Two runway that bordered the  Branch Davidian Village.

            Tonight I am shocked and I never thought I could be anymore after all I read.  These articles are bringing it all back.  The sordid, sick and covert actions and crimes orchestrated by the Clintons and Bushes.  They still freely walk the earth.  Hopefully not for long.

            : Annoymous poster (so take it with a BIG grain of salt), claims that there was a secret, CIA-operated runway directly next to the David Koresh compound (NOT the compound itself, but physically next to it). According to this source, supposedly CIA aircraft were trafficking guns, drugs and children through this secret runway strip. "Bob on the Job" makes the argument that Koresh and his followers found out what was going on at the runway adjacent to their property, started keeping tracking of the flights and what was going in and out. And supposedly they were all killed by the "powers that be" because they knew about it. I don't know any other sources that back this up, but it is definitely worth a read

             I certainly can believe what you just linked.  Of course there is no proof because as you say it is anonymous.  As we know many others have been scrubbed.  What I found was so horrid, a description of how they died and it was by the hands of the FBI.  It was so horrible I had to stop reading.  Believe me I have read some pretty horrid stuff.  I have no idea whether mine is true or not either.  Mine would have a NSFW Tag.  I am still looking but your account is pretty good.  What I have found so far is that Hillary ordered the final attack and of course Janet Reno was in charge.  What a combo Reno and Hillary.

            I had also seen the speculation. Will try to find in my bookmarks. Nothing is shocking anymore.

            Hi.  You will have to find a few sentences about your subject and post a link with it that will take us to the story.  Those are the rules here.  I will try to help out and hope to answer your question.  Maybe others can help too.  Will post here when found.
