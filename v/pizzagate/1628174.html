<p>Flirty Fishing</p>
<p>Flirty Fishing (FFing) was a form of religious prostitution practiced by the Children of God/The Family cult from 1974 until it was officially discontinued in 1987 (due, in part, to the AIDS scare). Its etymology can be traced to Matthew 4:19 where Jesus says &quot;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&quot;</p>
<p>Flirty Fishing was a subset of The Family\'s love bombing activities and involved the use of sexual attraction and intercourse to win converts and favors. Female members were told to be &quot;God\'s whores&quot; and &quot;hookers for Jesus&quot;, and soon after its launch as a method of witnessing, sex was given to complete strangers in combination with a request for a &quot;donation&quot;, or for a required fee in line with Escort Servicing (ESing) or freelance ESing. FFing and prostitution was widely used as a way to raise money for the cult and resulted in many of the second generation births (known as &quot;Jesus Babies&quot;). Internal Family records from 1988 indicate that over 223,000 &quot;fish&quot; were loved sexually between 1978 and 1988.</p>
<p>The Family describes the practice of Flirty Fishing as follows:</p>
<p>In the latter part of the \'70s and early \'80s, [David Berg], responding in part to the sexual liberality of that time period, presented the possibility of trying out a more personal and intimate form of witnessing which became known as \'Flirty Fishing\' or \'FFing\'. In his Letters at that time, he offered the challenging proposal that since \'God is Love\' (1 John 4:8), and His Son, Jesus, is the physical manifestation and embodiment of God\'s Love for humanity, then we as Christian recipients of that Love are in turn responsible to be living samples to others of God\'s great all-encompassing Love. Taking the Apostle Paul\'s writings literally, that saved Christians are \'dead to the Law [of Moses]\' (Romans 7:4), through faith in Jesus, [Berg] arrived at the rather shocking conclusion that Christians were therefore free through God\'s grace to go to great lengths to show the Love of God to others, even as far as meeting their sexual needs.
In The Family\'s internal FF Report Questions &amp; Answers! (PDF), the following description is given:</p>
<p>Q: &quot;What is FF\'ing?&quot; Many of you asked for a definition and what should be reported as actual FF\'ing.
A: We would like to answer that FF\'ing is going out witnessing the love of Jesus with the serious intent to use sex or sex appeal as the bait, regardless of the situation or place. This can be anywhere!–On the street, in a park, while going to the local store, in discotheques or in clubs!</p>
<p>Q: Does &quot;Loved Sexually&quot; also include kissing and light petting?
A: We suggest you only include masturbation, sucking and actual intercourse in the figures of fish, mate, brother or sister loved sexually. It\'s all, or nothing at all! Hallelujah!</p>',

            Louis Theroux did a documentary about evangelical Christians and met "The Family" and it definitely looked like he got Flirty Fished - they mention it many times in that documentary.
           </p>

            The Family enter at about 23mins 55secs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if there's nothing to it, it's a good documentary.
