<p>The port is run by the IFC division of the Haitian government, USAID, Unite Centrale de Gestion des PPP, and a private contractor.

<p>I haven\'t been able to find who the previous contractor was, but that would be one more to look at.</p>
<p>Working with the port as legal consultants for IFC are Dentons Canada LLP, and Cabinet Sales (there\'s an accent over the &quot;e&quot;, they don\'t sell cabinets lol). Legal counsel for USAID is Gide Loyrette Novel A.A.R.P.</p>

            Could be related to SAE-A, the anchor manufacturer for the Caracol Complex from Korea.  Also don't forget, the port also serves the Morne Bossa Mining facility, owned by VCS Mining, which Tony Rodham sits on the board of.
