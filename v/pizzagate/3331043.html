<p>“I’m hearing about the parties, hearing about a guy who’s throwing money around,” says Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management. <strong>While stories about young girls swarming Epstein’s waterfront mansion and the sex parties he hosted for the rich and powerful were the talk of the town</strong>, </p>
<p><em>(Translate to - what Epstein was doing was an open secret, and everybody knew about it.)</em></p>
<p>Kass was more focused on how this obscure person, rumored to be managing billions of dollars, had become so wealthy without much of a track record.</p>
<p>Kass was well-connected on Wall Street, where he’d worked for decades, so he began to ask around. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I went to my institutional brokers, to their trading desks and asked if they ever traded with him. I did it a few times until the date when he was arrested,” he recalls. “Not one institutional trading desk, primary or secondary, had ever traded with Epstein’s firm.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a reporter came to interview Kass about Bernie Madoff shortly before that firm blew up in the biggest Ponzi scheme ever, Kass told her, “There’s another guy who reminds me of Madoff that no one trades with.” That man was Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How did he get the money?” Kass kept asking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For decades, Epstein has been credulously described as a big-time hedge-fund manager and a billionaire, even though there’s not a lot of evidence that he is either. There appears little chance the public is going to get definitive answers anytime soon. </p>
<p>In a July 11 letter to the New York federal judge overseeing Epstein’s sex-trafficking case, Epstein’s attorney offered to provide “sealed disclosures” about Epstein’s finances to determine the size of the bond he would need to post to secure his release from jail pending trial. His brother, Mark, and a friend even offered to chip in, if necessary.</p>
<p>Naturally, this air of mystery has especially piqued the interest of real-life, non-pretend hedge-funders. If this guy wasn’t playing their game — and they seem pretty sure he was not — what game was he playing? </p>
<p><em>Intelligencer</em> spoke to several prominent hedge-fund managers to get a read on what their practiced eyes are detecting in all the new information that is coming to light about Epstein in the wake of his indictment by federal prosecutors in New York. Most saw signs of something unsavory at the heart of his business model.</p>
<p>To begin with, there is much skepticism among the hedgies <em>Intelligencer</em> spoke with that Epstein made the money he has — and he appears to have a lot, given a lavish portfolio of homes and private aircraft — as a traditional money manager. A fund manager who knows well how that kind of fortune is acquired notes, “It’s hard to make a billion dollars quietly.” </p>
<p>Epstein was also missing another key element of a typical thriving hedge fund: investors. Kass couldn’t find any beyond Epstein’s one well-publicized client, retail magnate Les Wexner — nor could other players in the hedge-fund world who undertook similar snooping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know anyone who’s ever invested in him; he’s never talked about by any of the allocators,” says one billionaire hedge-fund manager, referring to firms that distribute large pools money among various funds.</p>
<p>Epstein’s spotty professional history has also drawn a lot of attention in recent days, and Kass says it was one of the first things that raised his suspicions years ago. </p>
<p>Now 66, Epstein didn’t come from money and never graduated from college, yet he landed a teaching job at a fancy private school (“unheard of,” says Kass) and rose through the ranks in the early 1980s at investment bank Bear Stearns. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within no time, Kass notes, Epstein was made a partner of the firm — and then was promptly and unceremoniously ousted. (Epstein reportedly left the firm following a minor securities violation.) Despite this “squishy work experience,” as Kass puts it, at some point after his quick exit, Epstein launched his own hedge fund, J. Epstein &amp; Co., later renamed Financial Trust Co. </p>
<p>Along the way, he began pedaling the improbable narrative that he was so selective he would only work with billionaires.</p>
<p>Oddly, Epstein also claimed to do all the investing by himself while his 150 employees all worked in the back office — which Kass says reminds him of Madoff’s cover story. Though it now appears that Epstein had many fewer employees than he claimed, according to the New York Times:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Volscho, a sociology professor at the College of Staten Island who has been researching for a book on Mr. Epstein, recently obtained [a 2002 disclosure] form, which shows [Epstein’s] Financial Trust had $88 million in contributions from shareholders. In a court filing that year, Mr. Epstein said his firm had about 20 employees, far fewer than the 150 reported at the time by New York magazine.</p>

<p>How such a scheme could hypothetically work has been laid out in detail in a thread on the anonymous Twitter feed of <a href="https://voat.co/u/quantian1">@quantian1</a>. </p>
<p>It’s worth reading in its entirety, but in summary it is a rough blueprint for how a devious aspiring hedge-fund manager could blackmail rich people into investing with him without raising too many flags.</p>
<p>Kass and former hedge-fund manager Whitney Tilson both emailed the thread around in investing circles and both quickly discovered that their colleagues found it quite convincing. “This actually sounds very plausible,” Tilson wrote in an email forwarding the thread to others.</p>
<p>“He somehow cajoled these guys to invest,” says Kass, speaking of hypothetical blackmailed investors who gave Epstein their money to invest, but managed to keep their names private.</p>
<p>The fact that Epstein’s fund is offshore in a tax haven — it is based in the U.S. Virgin Islands — and has a secret client list both add credence to the blackmail theory.</p>
<p>So what did Epstein do with the money he did have under his management, setting aside the questions of how he got it and how much he had? One hedge-fund manager speculates that Epstein could have just put the client money in an S&amp;P 500 index fund, perhaps with a tax dodge thrown in. “I put in $100 million, I get the S&amp;P 500 minus some fees,” he says, speaking of a theoretical client’s experience. </p>
<p>Over the past few decades, the client would have “made a shitload” — as would Epstein. A structure like that wouldn’t have required trading desks or analysts or complex regulatory disclosures.</p>
<p>Kass has kicked around a similar idea: Maybe Epstein just put all the client money in U.S. treasuries — the simplest and safest investment there is, and the kind of thing one guy actually can do by himself.</p>
<p>If the blackmail theory sounds far-fetched, it’s worth keeping in mind that it was also floated by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Epstein … also got girls for Epstein’s friends and acquaintances. Epstein specifically told me that the reason for him doing this was so that they would ‘owe him,’ they would ‘be in his pocket,’ and he would ‘have something on them,’”</strong> she said in a court affidavit, according to the investigative series in the Miami Herald that brought the case back to the public’s attention late last year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 2015 filing, Giuffre claimed that Epstein “debriefed her” after she was forced into sexual encounters <strong>so that he could possess “intimate and potentially embarrassing information” to blackmail friends into parking their money with him.</strong> </p>

              Public knowledge, I hope. Anyway, the attention span of the public is extremely limited.  Just thankful points of interest have stayed along the same lines at all. But that's likely over now that Area 51 is thrown out there.

            Looks like Epstein is following orders alright.  He's someone's patsy/ fall guy.  He got to live the "good life" for years, on condition when the time comes, he takes the fall.  The backers would hold off on action for a specified amount of time, so he could enjoy his life then when it was time to "retire", he would go to jail.  I expect him to fall ill or die soon after conviction.  He will be out on bail during trial.  I suspect it is not at all Mossad backing him, but in fact, the British Royal Family which is why Queenie and Co. had to host that state visit a couple weeks before this broke.  More and more actions are leading back to the Firm, mainly because the heir, Prince PC Charles, can't keep his dumb trap shut on anything, especially his opinions which, for some reason, he seems to think we all want to hear.  The truth is, his mummy only kept her position as long as she has by maintaining a dignified public silence.  She didn't rock the boat.  Her son isn't quite as bright. (Unless he is drinking, then he's beet red....)

             No, it's a joint Mossad and CIA operation. With ties to the Russian mafia (many girls where trafficked from Russia).

             Vanity Fair wrote years ago that Epstein manages money for the Queen, which now can be translated to Prince Andrew was blackmailed too, I guess.

              If you look at the nations that many of our "terror" problems originate from, you will find they are mainly former colonies of the British Empire.  The world's issues of today are interesting when looked at from that perspective.  The Religion of Peas has thrived in and derives from mainly former Empire outposts.  Irag, India, Pakistan, Afghan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt Bahrain, the Emirates, Qatar, Palestine, Kenya, S.Africa, etc... all once British territories.  They either left a serious vacuum in power when the pulled out in favor of letting these nations rule themselves or it's been the Empire vs. Judaism the entire time, being fought under the cloak of a political movement disguised as a medieval religion.  Either way, it seems like the Brits want their empire back and are using this religion, migration and wars as an excuse to re-subordinate them.

              You're legitimately a stupid person.  If "Americans" had literally just destroyed Europe in an offensive Jewish war and set up the state of Israel (ie peak of their influence) it is sheer logic that the subsequent governments (ie NATO) and intelligence services are ALSO effectively arms of the Jews.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would the overrepresentation of Jews in politics and media not also apply to CIA?  It is a known fact for example that FBI/CIA translators of Mideast languages are always Jews who work with Mossad openly (as Sibel Edmonds testified).  How do you they are able to bullshit us into wars with such ease?

              You'd never accept anything less than a rainbow assortment like the UN of Corruption, because you're a silly naive woman and it's that simple.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another example I've pointed out is how you pretentious bovine clowns mindlessly adopt Trumptard memes like muh deep state that was prior an obscure term for Turkey from the 1970s.

               When I started writing The Ghost in January 2015, the term the “deep state” was pretty much unknown publicly, save to a handful of political scientists. When I finished the book two years later, in the spring of 2017, I was informed by an ABC News poll that 48 percent of Americans agreed that there is such a thing as the deep state, which was defined as military or intelligence officials who secretly manipulate U.S. policy

            What I like to know who tipped Epstein off that he was going to be arrested and when? Rememeber the 2 fires at his island about 6 months ago? Also just recently his sold his plane. He obviously knew something was going down.
