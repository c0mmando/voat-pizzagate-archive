Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead!</p>

<p>This chapter ID’s a new suspect based on a super creepy photo and looks at a possible motive for Heather’s death. </p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/g5nwax.jpeg">https://files.catbox.moe/g5nwax.jpeg</a> This photo is the source of new info on this case. This is on set of Poltergeist 3. I know this due to the garb Heather was wearing for the film.  Note the extremely creepy possessive way the man is grabbing Heather. I inquired to gab and 8kun as to the man’s identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobe_Hooper">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobe_Hooper</a> Looking at his works, he depicts cannabalism (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and pedo shit (Eaten Alive).</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001361/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001361/?ref_=tt_ov_dr</a> A potential ID is Tobe Hooper, director of Poltergeist. Meaning that photo is physical evidence that he was on set in Poltergeist 3. If its him that is.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0792446/filmotype?ref_=m_nm_flmg">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0792446/filmotype?ref_=m_nm_flmg</a> Gary Sherman is the other person people think is the man in the photo. His work also includes themes of cannabalism. </p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0</a>  FYI, the girl in the opening scene of Jaws was only 16 during that nude swim scene. Sick bastard Spielberg at it again.</p>
<p>I’ve had a hunch for a while that the date of Heather’s death may have been motivated by occult reasons. Given the date of that Super Bowl thing in the first film being dead on and Heather dying around the same time something has felt off. The possibility her death was meant to be sacrifical in nature. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.history.com/.amp/topics/holidays/imbolc">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.history.com/.amp/topics/holidays/imbolc</a> 2/1-2/2 is a pagan holiday. Could black magic have been involved in Heather’s rapid downturn?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Photocopy/140554NCJRS.pdf">https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Photocopy/140554NCJRS.pdf</a> 1st major Sabbot of the year is 2/1-2/2. 2/2 involves human sacrifice. Target being female (age 7-17). Meaning that Heather was exactly the perfect target.</p>
<p>Remembering what Renegade Anon said, when Hollywood wishes to sacrifice someone, they don’t gather in a bunch of black cloaks. They make the death seem like a suicide, overdose or some other method that deflects attention from them.</p>
<p>Given the above and the hours leading up to Heather’s death, I believe the most logical scenario is “Medical Homicide”. Basically either she was killed on the operating table or intentionally allowed to die.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=2B3ev1QJijI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=2B3ev1QJijI</a> The O’Rourke family are still getting payments to this day. Do they know something? </p>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Tobe Hooper (dead), Gary Sherman.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane, Lewis Arquette.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident. “Medical Homicide” on the operating table.</p>',

           This photo is the source of new info on this case. This is on set of Poltergeist 3. I know this due to the garb Heather was wearing for the film.  Note the extremely creepy possessive way the man is grabbing Heather. I inquired to gab and 8kun as to the man’s identity.

           Looking at his works, he depicts cannabalism (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and pedo shit (Eaten Alive).

           A potential ID is Tobe Hooper, director of Poltergeist. Meaning that photo is physical evidence that he was on set in Poltergeist 3. If its him that is.

           Gary Sherman is the other person people think is the man in the photo. His work also includes themes of cannabalism.

           FYI, the girl in the opening scene of Jaws was only 16 during that nude swim scene. Sick bastard Spielberg at it again.

          <p>
           I’ve had a hunch for a while that the date of Heather’s death may have been motivated by occult reasons. Given the date of that Super Bowl thing in the first film being dead on and Heather dying around the same time something has felt off. The possibility her death was meant to be sacrifical in nature.
          </p>

           2/1-2/2 is a pagan holiday. Could black magic have been involved in Heather’s rapid downturn?

           1st major Sabbot of the year is 2/1-2/2. 2/2 involves human sacrifice. Target being female (age 7-17). Meaning that Heather was exactly the perfect target.
          </p>
          <p>
           Remembering what Renegade Anon said, when Hollywood wishes to sacrifice someone, they don’t gather in a bunch of black cloaks. They make the death seem like a suicide, overdose or some other method that deflects attention from them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Given the above and the hours leading up to Heather’s death, I believe the most logical scenario is “Medical Homicide”. Basically either she was killed on the operating table or intentionally allowed to die.

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Tobe Hooper (dead), Gary Sherman.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane, Lewis Arquette.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident. “Medical Homicide” on the operating table.
