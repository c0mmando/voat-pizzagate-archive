<p>For the first time, the trial saw CCTV footage from the car park beneath Mr and Mrs Brooks’ luxury flat in London’s Chelsea Harbour.

<p>The events, the jury learned, became known to their alleged participants as “Pizzagate”. The prosecution has described the events as part of a “quite complicated and risky” plan to hide material from the police.</p>

<p>Wade became close to Blair and to his wife, Cherie—a “friendship” that would cool but continue even after the police discovered in 2002 that News reporters were planning to set Cherie up by taping a conversation between her and the boyfriend of her “life coach.” </p>
<p>And then there is the baby. As her public-relations firm, <strong>Bell Pottinger, announced recently</strong>, Rebekah and Charlie Brooks are to be the proud parents of a baby girl, due next month via a surrogate mother, rumored to be a relative.</p>

            Has anyone ever heard of the story that an older woman that gave an account of what happened one horrid night in the building where she lived and it was downstairs from the McCanns.  She said that it was evening and she heard loud crying from a child and she assumed it was Maddie and she was  crying and crying.  She said the child was calling for Daddy over and over.  Actually I could barely get through the story.  This crying and calling for Daddy went on for quite some time and she just assumed they were home since the child was too.  But then she heard them coming in through the door and heard them going upstairs.  That's when she realized they had left her alone.  Then who was up there with Maddie.  Has anyone heard or read of this before?  I wish I had a record of it.  Some member sent it to me. If you add it all up you can come to one conclusion.  Someone was up there with her and she was calling her Daddy for help.

              33 Degree no less.  Amazing.  I cried when I read that story.  The poor baby crying for her Daddy and he wasn't coming.  Those two parents should be strung up.  I feel so sorry for their other children.  What will become of them and will they ever read the things that we know.  Imagine reading this story about your missing sister. Heart Breaking.

              This.

             <p>
              This is what psyops are all about. They do it with stars that won't quote play along unquote ... to politicians who won't quote play along unquote and mothers of girls that are murdered or raped or both who won't quote play along unquote. Don't notice Jamie Lee Spears or her mother being called crazy. It's because they did quote play along unquote.
             </p>
             <p>
              So those that quote play along unquote are not accused of playing along and are lauded for being wonderful and pillars of the community. Whoraline and Skankles are two examples. Those that don't quote play along unquote are torn apart in the press, chewed up, spit out, and somehow manage to go on.

             At the Leveson Inquiry,it was divulged to the Inquiry,that the McCann family had paid the Bell-Pottinger Company £500,000 to keep their name in the Red Tops for a minimum of Twelve Months from Madeleine's first anniversary May 2008?
            </p>
            <p>
             At least five serving Prime Ministers,have been involved plus Foreign Overseas staff,John Buck,Justine maGuiness,Clarence Mitchell,embroiled in the fiasco!
            </p>
            <p>
             Conclusion,has there been a Cover Up or Hoax situation,hidden agenda?
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time of Madeleine McCann's Holiday,years earlier,the UK government had planned to introduce "Tracking System" for missing children,by inserting a bar type code,that could be read at various Countries Official Passport Control Centres.
Did the UK Government plan a "False Flag Event" missing child to highlight the New Product,where it was all set up to proceed but did something happen to the" poster child star Madeleine"whilst on the Holiday,then the"False flag event had to be abandonned,Hence the Parents having a"Front Row seat",now how do we get out of dodge!?

              Remember when we were told to focus on the CARDS?  We were researching SIM CARDS at one point.  I still think they are a way to track kids for ulterior purposes.

              It is an Eye Opener on what they have already been doing.  Ultimately they want to track all of us, but what they really want is to have access to Our Children.  Why do you think they are handing out free laptops to schools.  APPLE?
