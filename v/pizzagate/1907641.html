<p>Cernovich also has close ties to Epstein </p>

<p>COOL! ANY LINK TO EPSTEIN IS FAIR GAME. It is already being tried, or beginning to, again. This time with full press looking at it, versus last time when it slipped under the radar like so much else. Salacious means Ratings. I wish there was a special page that focuses on the Epstein Case, by folks who really know law, and know the case. And Pizzagate and the likes of George Webb and others, the links will be many and often.</p>
<p>The Epstein Case is already in the oven. It is right here on a platter and I\'m fucking starving. Can you imagine what might break open if the brain power of Voat focuses on the Epstein Case? I\'m pretty sure the Plea Deal that was reached Included Full Immunity From Further Prosecution to everybody named (and unnamed but ancillary to?) the case, including Dershitz. Absolutely Extraordinary, and so absolutely Iconic of the extreme limits taken to cover-up 1% sex crimes, especially one so no-brainer-guilty-as-sin as this one, which included 40 &quot;known&quot; pedo rape victims, interstate, international trafficking.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, forgot, Epstein seems to have given the Clintons financial backing for their foundations. </p>

<hr />
<p>Today Webb and his handler were invited on Cernovich\'s InfoWars show. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCq0JbzqLAg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCq0JbzqLAg</a> I\'d like help analyzing this. Even though the title insinuates that Seth Rich is the subject, Cernovich actually stops Webb from talking about it and redirects him to Awan brothers, saying Seth is a topic for another day...</p>
<p>Using my working hypothesis that Webb/Goodman are creating a story to detract from the truth, on behalf of the Democratic establishment, with ties to the CIA, I\'m looking for clues, and assuming that the <strong>words being used</strong>, especially by the handler, are very important clues, I found this to be of interest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We\'re <strong>developing</strong> a bunch of other <strong>stories</strong> about how they got ther visas and things that tie the Awan brother to the potential hacking of the NGP VAN system, the voter database... so there\'s not any shortage of evidence and there\'s a lot more to come out of this story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was Goodman in his final few minutes with Cernovich. They are writing the story, not reporting facts that happen to arise. And the story they plan to sell us (on behalf of Epstein et al?) is that there was no leak, it was a hack, which would get all eyes off the Seth Rich murder, and put everything in the lap of the Awans. Geroge also said repeatedly last night that the importance of whether this was a leak or hack has to do with implications to Trump - a hack means he could be impeached, a leak would mean there\'s no chance for his impeachment. Geroge was drunk but hammered this point home, so I think it\'s an important clue as to the overall operation.</p>
<p>Also in the Cernovich interview, Webb drops the claim that Debbie WS was running a spy ring in Congress until Anthony Wiener took it over. So since this guy is already being hung out to dry, why not heap more blame on him? Does anyone believe Anthony Wiener was running a spy ring between his sexting escapades?</p>',

            Very good summation.  I have also come to believe that George is a Obama/Deep State Operative/CIA disinfo agent that gives us crumbs we already knew, then mixes them in with so many other things that we are left confused, exhausted, and throw up our hands.  I believe that the Obama Cartel is trying to focus everything on Hillary/Podesta.  This would explain her freaking out lately, saying that everyone is against her.  If that doesn't work, they also seem to be moving everyone towards placing this all on the Awan Bros. who probably have disappeared and are untouchable.  If not dead.  Which means, nothing will be done.  The Obama Cartel has learned from the Clinton Crime Family how to obfuscate and confuse for so long that **no one ever is prosecuted. **
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice that George has never, as far as I know, put Obama's, Susan Rice's, or anyone in that Administration's picture in his "mashups."  He specifically says not to go after Obama.  He says Donna Brazille is very nice, he likes her.  He says he just wants everyone to "stop."  Doesn't want anyone to go to jail, and this after he's shown us the human trafficking, organ harvesting, pedophilia and murder.  He said two "thugs" were outside his hotel room and had to get someone to come get him.  But he didn't record leaving the hotel live.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the major aspects of Seth Rich's case, is that he had info on voter fraud.  It appears that George, Goodman and Cernovich may be trying to construct a narrative that the Awan Bros. were responsible for the voting fraud - thereby getting the DNC, Hillary/Obama off the hook on that one.  Cernovich has started to concern me too.  His "source" told him Susan Rice did the unmasking and that is his claim to fame, but his info stops right there.  She unmasked it for who?  Why?  Who was unmasked?  Was Seth Rich unmasked?  Since he said she did it, everyone is just moving on to something else.  That's very typical disinfo behavior - give us info that is the tip of the iceberg but never move past it and act like the issue has been settled. Cernovich never goes deeper with most of his stories and frequently says he has breaking info then comes out with nothing.  And where do any of these people get their money from?
           </p>
           <p>
            What George was saying about Trump and the hack vs. leak - I wouldn't be surprised after all this that he says the Russians did it.

             Cernovich is another disinfo agent. The true alt-right hate him, because they know he is a bandwagon-jumping fake conservative, and he is most likely member of the (((tribe)) as well,.
Anyone who keeps on showing up in Alex Jones's programs has been aproved by CIA and the (((Deep State)))

            I honestly feel like people spend more time on this forum focusing on trying to prove people are disinfo rather than accumulating research and posting their own findings like it used to be. So on the front page you end up with a bunch of links about these people rather than actual leads, so we're still wasting time on them regardless. V___Z you're obviously good at gathering quotes and information, but you seem to post about Webb everyday.

             The reason is that George is very dangerous.  I believed in what he was doing for quite sometime until I started noticing that his double-talking was getting too much, he was spending lots of time in front of buildings saying nothing, he appeared to be drinking a lot (who knows if real) to explain if he "slips out the truth" or some such thing, and he was supposedly trapped in his hotel room and had to have a viewer come get him, but he never videoed himself leaving the hotel.  Then he used the excuse that he couldn't post to YouTube and jumped on Periscope to back up the claim.

             He's playing us.  Distracting us.  Deceiving us and either trying to put the blame on the Awan Bros. for everything and/or Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             He's blown his cover.

              I really don't understand why I got downvoted for saying what I did xD Anyone with an ounce of scepticism wouldn't never trust any source 100% anyway. I can understand the odd post here and there but so many posts about him daily, why not just ignore the troll?

            Webb has had a troll team for a long time. That's why on any video remotely related to any of this, in the comments section you will see the same comment "OMG you HAVE to follow George Webb!!" The comments are too similar and frequent to be real. And yes, they are also attack dogs when needed. Questioning Alex Jones will get you similar results here, at least in the past.

            I frankly don't have a friggin' clue what is going on anymore.  Is George Webb a hero?  A narcissistic fabulist suffering a bad midlife crisis?  A employee of Epstein? I thought that his work on the organ harvesting ratlines was excellent but lately he just seems to be going off the rails acting strange and attacking allies.  It could be legitimate fear and stress or gas-lighting.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm concerned by Webb bashing Kim.com and Assange lately.  He also telegraphs his movements waaay too much.  Claiming Mossad ties is actually the least surprising thing about all of this.  Teaming up with Jason Goodman and trying to create a new Scooby gang is actually even more surprising for me.

            I haven't seen the interview yet and will watch. It sounds on par with this weeks change in drama. I'd be interested to see Cernovich's reactions. GW started throwing so much spaghetti at the wall I'm thinking about what he's left in the bowl. Is he intentionally trying to piss off the more alert followers so they leave making it an easier ride for him to wherever he's going?

            All I can say is his reporting is getting really messy now and incoherent. He talks in circles and half thoughts and spouts off names and I can't care anymore. It feels like a school play as he calls them. And him revealing his white lies just makes me not trust anything he's saying, now less than ever. But I guess we're getting a taste of spycraft. But I don't have time for bullshit puzzles. The Singer connection with Jason is unsettling but a lot of people work on movies and doesn't mean they're all pedos on x-men, but it also doesn't mean he's not. So eh? Back to where I was on his first video last fall: "who the hell is this guy? What he said is insane! Woa. Is that true?! I guess it's possible. How does he know this shit? Who the hell is this guy?"

            Yes, Robert Maxwell AKA Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch was the Czechoslovakian "writer" that GW referred to in his Wendy tweets.
           </p>
           <p>
            Robert Maxwell was a Mossad super-spy and not only did he destroy the best "peoples paper" The Daily Mirror, was also involved in selling Promis software with a back door in it. George didn't mention that in the many times he talked about Promis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting read here for more information

             https://cryptome.org/promis-mossad.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And then there's the real smoking gun - Ghislaine is Maxwell's daughter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, the irony of George calling out foreign nationals who spy on the United States yet supporting Mossad.

             "the irony of George calling out foreign nationals "
            </p>
            <p>
             George Webb is Israel and the Mossad turning state's evidence against the Deep State and Hillary Clinton &amp; Co. There's no mystery here. Yes there's some irony but you all are missing the target.
            </p>
            <p>
             Turning state's evidence means you're ratting out your co-conspirators. It's an admission of guilt. So you condemning George Webb is kind of sketchy and is exactly what a shill would do.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've asked resident shill
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/V____Z">
              @V____Z
             </a>
             to acknowledge the fact George Webb and the Mossad are turning states evidence. This off hand question will be my third try. I highly doubt she'll answer.
            </p>
            <p>
             And that's all the evidence you need that V___Z is a shill. She's not allowed to credit George Webb more than a little if at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             The following though is the real clincher, what George Webb and the Mossad did was defang the FBI so that it can go back to doing it's job of catching criminals and not slow walking investigations into the Deep State.
            </p>
            <p>
             You see everybody here, we do our best but the FBI can do a whole lot better. It's their job. George Webb and the Mossad gave America their FBI back. We should cut them a little slack.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes they fucked up along with everyone else in the Deep State but they were the only way the FBI could come down. The CIA wasn't going to do it. The 300+ extortion victims within Congress were'nt going to do it. Heck they're still silent due to the Awan Brothers blackmail data.
            </p>
            <p>
             So everyone please wake up, V____Z is a hard core shill. She needs to be held accountable for defending the Deep State.

                   That's true but it's the only explanation as to why George Webb wasn't killed. GW aired the Deep State's dirty laundry. And we're not talking this was normal dirty laundry. This was toxic radioactive dirty laundry that would get anyone besides a Mossad agent killed immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   George Webb and Mossad are Israel turning state's evidence. It's the simplest explanation for all this. Occum's Razor.

                    I understand what you're saying.  He said he was Mossad to save his life.  You could be right.

                   <p>
                    BUT, why doesn't he implicate Obama at all to the point of saying to stay away from him? Why is it just Hillary?  Why doesn't he want anyone to be arrested?  Why is this Goodman guy involved?  Who is this Trish person?  Something changed after Goodman came on board.  It all got really weird. (er)
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I also think he's FBI Anon.  Same info.  Same way of describing things.

                     Because Obama was the Deep State's house [insert N word here]. Obama is a tragically sad figure.

                    <p>
                     That's coded language meaning prepare to plea bargain and give up some names in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Any lower level person involved in this cluster fuck would be a fool to turn down an offer of immunity in exchange for testimony against the perps at the top.

                     "I also think he's FBI Anon."

                    <p>
                     I highly doubt that. FBIAnon is legit except once the Deep State spoofed us with a fake, but it doesn't matter. FBIAnon are probably a group of lower level FBI people who've had enough of James Comey and Andrew McCabe's slow walking investigations into the Deep State.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     James Comey and Andrew McCabe will be in the group of 23 who are arrested later this year. And to be honest I don't see either of them avoiding the hangman's noose. They committed High Treason and their inaction led to many deaths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If they're not given the death penalty then they'll be in jail for a very long time.

                      He's moving the investigation away from Seth Rich being the leaker to Wikileaks toward the Awan Bros. who are untouchable (if even still alive) which means that no one will be arrested, prosecuted or held accountable and the Clinton Crime Family and the Obama Cartel will go on as before.

                     <p>
                      I believe George is being paid by Obama/Deep State operatives (why is he now saying he likes Robert Maxwell?) to hide the crimes of the Obama Admin, the DNC and Hillary.

                     <p>
                      If he takes out Comey and McCabe that would be very good.  But the swamp draining needs to go further.

                       That's wrong. GW dropped the Awan Brothers story weeks ago to go after finding who killed Seth Rich.

                       Now here's the real important part "lynn", if George Webb fails and Trump is impeached the child raping and organ harvesting continues in earnest irregardless of who the new FBI directory is. Mike Pence is a Godless child fucker himself that will burn in Hell and will do exactly ZERO to bring down the Deep State.

                         I wouldn't go that far. He's still poking holes in the Deep State's effort to frame Trump and get him impeached.

                         That's all that matters at this point. George Webb getting drunk on the Interwebs is meaningless and actually pretty funny if you think about it.

                           You might recall Barack Obama did all he could to fuck over Israel. So Trump deciding Israel is an ally again is very significant. And come to think of it that might be the reason Mossad sent George Webb on a quest to turn state's evidence against Hillary &amp; Co. Barack Obama made a lot of enemies in Israel over the past 8 years and I'm not sure how much Hillary would have done to repair that relationship.

                          <p>
                           And the other thing about Hillary Clinton is she stole Bernie Sanders' campaign contributions and blatantly tried to sabotage his campaign. Bernie is one of "The Jews!(tm)" after all and they did just about everything they could do to him without making him wear a gold star on his lapel. It's really infuriating if you think about it. Given George H.W. Bush's family history of funding the Nazis you really have to wonder if there's been a little pay back in the works for a long time and that could explain the extra mustard on Israel's quite obvious beat down they're giving Hillary these days.

               George Webb is Israel and the Mossad turning state's evidence against the Deep State and Hillary Clinton &amp; Co. There's no mystery here. Yes there's some irony but you all are missing the target.
              </p>
              <p>
               Turning state's evidence means you're ratting out your co-conspirators. It's an admission of guilt. So you condemning George Webb is kind of sketchy and is exactly what a shill would do.

             <p>
              I don't think George Webb would risk his life and his kids lives for that reason.  He wouldn't be announcing where he would be ahead of time if that were the case. He wouldn't be walking around in public freely LIVE on video. He would be scared. He would have been killed a long time ago. The only videos taken down he admitted was by himself. His social media accounts have not been suspended. He wouldn't get away with all of this.
             </p>
             <p>
              For whatever reason, he's being allowed to continue this and that's really strange since several people have already been murdered by investigating things that show our governments corruption. Journalists are being fired. George Webb is doing interviews and even continuing where he left off, even after saying he's from The Mossad and threatening Podesta. I also made a postnthe other day where Webb said he didn't want Podesta going to jail.

               Do you know anything about the Mossad? The Mossad make the CIA look like an autistic 15 year old on stilts who's drank too much Red Bull and has to take a pee.

               He's being allowed to continue because everyone in the Intelligence Community the world over know Hillary Clinton is bad for business. Hillary was bat shit crazy BEFORE she came down with Parkinson's. That ain't good as Parkinson's Disease often leads to psychosis. You can do the rest of the math on that one.

                I don't know much about Mossad. I just started getting into all of this political stuff during the election. I was always into conspiracy theories and followed 9/11. I've watched Alex Jones for like 10 years and was into documentaries. But, I didn't follow current political corruption. I used to HATE anything to do with politics. It trips me out that I'm so interested now. I'm a newbie. So it wasn't until the election that I started reading about how Israel and America secretly work together and even want terrorism and have the same goals about the Middle East. Also, that The Mossad is like our CIA.
               </p>
               <p>
                I wasn't into social media until The election either. I was totally confused when I kept seeing people talking bad about Jews and talking about neocons and zionists. So I started looking into that and seeing how bad they are and running the show.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am still learning. I was shocked when I seen how mean people are to each other on social media. Especially on voat where we should all have the same goal and that's saving these poor kids and bringing down these evil elites. I figured that people here at least had a heart because they care about kids.  But, instead of people supporting each other, people attack each other. I know someone who won't post anymore because of the way she was attacked when she posted. I've learned to have a tougher shell so now I get pissed off.
               </p>
               <p>
                I say all of this because, no I do not know everything. I'm learning as I go along and I take what I read here and research and form my own opinion. So, my comment is not me trying to be a bitch. What you said in your 2nd and 3rd paragraph make sense. But, I still need to research and learn. It's hard for me to understand how they would have someone here so openly exposing our government corruption. Our government could have Webb killed and made it look as if it was a person that followed him on the internet.
               </p>
               <p>
                I just don't get why George would do all this and risk his and his kids lives and stay here even after admitting to all of his followers that he's been lying and is with The Mossad. Especially after threatening Podesta. He's being cocky now too and giving shout outs to his "Mossad homies." It just doesn't make sense. I don't know what to even think anymore.  I'm so confused. I read all these comments and don't know which theory makes the most sense.

                 George Webb is Mossad. His family is not at risk. Full Stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But you have a valid question: why would George Webb go to the trouble of taking down Andrew McCabe. That's an easy answer. He, Mossad and Israel know what could happen if the American Public limit their righteous indignation to Israel only.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Israel played 2nd fiddle on 9/11. They weren't the driving force behind it. That was the Bush Crime Syndicate and their house [insert N word here]s Bill and Hillary Clinton.
                </p>
                <p>
                 George H.W. Bush's father Prescott helped put Hitler into power. Any alliance the Bush's have with "The Jews(tm)" is tenuous as Nazis would very much like to kill every Jew on planet earth.
                </p>

                 Israel is going to be fighting for its life in the coming years and I'm not sure if they're going to make it. I just think it would be sad if the American Aristocracy was able to manipulate public opinion into believing "The Jews(tm)" were acting alone.

              That is idiotic.. why would  Israel and the Mossad turn state evidence against the Deep State??
In case you didn't get the memo, Mossad and Israel basically run the Deep State using blackmail  and other methods.

              Did you forget the five dancing Mossad Agents celebrating the fall of the WTC on 9/11...

              <p>
               I never said Israel and Mossad weren't involved in 9/11. You assumed I did. I know they played a part. But it was 2nd fiddle. George H.W. Bush and David Rockefeller played the leading rolls.
              </p>
              <p>
               All I'm saying is George Webb and Mossad are turning state's evidence on the 9/11 co-conspirators. That's a GOOD thing not a bad thing. Large organized crime rackets can only be brought down by people turning state's evidence. Full Stop.
              </p>
              <p>
               Goerge Webb is Israel exploring how to make amends for their part in 9/11. Unless Israel does something they'll lose America as an ally. In fact they may already have. When the truth about 9/11 comes out people will never look at Israel again.

               <p>
                Your arguments make absoiutely no sense.. 
Mossad basically helped with the WTC demolitions in 9/11 using "14 visiting students" with the help Marvin Bush's security company, and they documented the events using the five Dancing Mossad Agents over Jersey City.
Why would the apartheid state of Israel incriminate itself?

                 "Your arguments make absoiutely no sense.. Mossad basically helped with the WTC demolitions in 9/11 using "14 visiting students" with the help Marvin Bush's security company"
                </p>
                <p>
                 I agree. Mossad helped the Bush-Clinton Crime Syndicate plan 9/11. You're preaching to the choir.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But the Deep State's candidate lost and Trump won. So Israel and Mossad have to come clean and get back into the American Public's good graces. Right now that's George Webb serving up Andrew McCabe's head on a platter.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But again Mossad played 2nd fiddle in 9/11. The prime actors were in the American Aristocracy and Military Industrial Complex.

                 And boy would they love it if you just blamed Israel. That'd let them get off scot-free.

                  Your arguments are ridiculous, the fact that you are calling V____Z "a hard core shill." means you are an IDF shill youself, desperately trying to clear the name of the baby-killing apartheid state of Israhell.

                  <strong>
                   When has George Webb said anything that incriminates AIPAC, Mossad or the state of Israel??

                  The jews never admit to anything, they do everything by way of deception.
Israel and Mossad DO NOT need to come clean to anyone and "get back on anyone's good graces", because doing so, would be an admittance of GUILT, and as we all know, the Zionists are NEVER guilty of anything, they are always the VICTIMS and they are always RIGHT, just like your silly pro-zionist arguments,
Have fun in TelAviv.

                    No genius, i've been following Mossad Webb since he started last year.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    i have some of his early (deleted) videos, 
The first one is a classic, where he whines about being a "targeted individual".. which means the CIA / FBI / NSA are tailing him, tapping his communications, etc.
The mental wards are full of delusional paranoid schizos like him.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    George Webb Sweigert is a delusional, demented, drunken joo.
He is a non-entity, a nobody and no one in their right mind would take him seriously.
He is not going to take down anyone, and if you think he is, you are a total idiot.
But i know you are not an idiot, you are an IDF disinfo agent, a Mossad and Israel apologist.
I hope the IDF is paying you enough to waste my time, Shlomo
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Anyway, 
**When has George Webb said anything that incriminates AIPAC, Mossad or the state of Israel?? 
When have YOU said anything that incriminates AIPAC, Mossad or the state of Israel?? **

                     Great! Then you must be aware of the alternate plan that existed to take down Andrew McCabe at the FBI and the Guccifer 2.0 charade he designed to take down Donald Trump.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So let 'er rip GrDec, lay it on me. Please explain what that alternative plan for McCabe and Guccifer 2.0. because without a plan Donald Trump is impeached and the Deep State goes back to raping children.

            Yeah, I don't know if you know this, but if you work in Hollywood, chances are you're gonna work on multiple projects over the years. And you'll likely be doing a job that you're skilled in. There might even be a director on set.

            He has one very loose tie. He worked on an X Men movie as a 3D tech guy. He's had this job on tons of movies, including Spiderman. It's not like they're business associates.

              Ok. You can make that claim. But then you have to go down the credits list of every single movie Bryan Singer has ever made, and assume that every single person on every single list, down to the Grips, is in the Pedo Ring. Because that's the claim you're making right now.

               i am certain that most of his inner "crew" are part of his "circle"
.
Whether this jew Goodman is part of his inner production crew or not, remains to be seen, but the fact that he is a jew, is enough to make me suspicious.
              </p>
              <p>
               If there is one thing some of the Pizzagate investigations revealed, is that the people in the government and NGOs , in charge of "protecting" children and "investigating" pedophilia are part of the pedo circle themselves.
So it makes sense that anyone publicly "investigating" Pizzagate, like George Sweigert, is a member of the same crooked circle, and the fact that his sidekick turns out to be a Jew, that worked for a well known pedophile jew director in Hollywood.. is it a coincidence??

                I just think it's a major stretch if he's only worked on one project. That said, Goodman's been losing major credibility with me in how he's handled the Defango thing.

               <p>
                I'm looking at these guys with more scrutiny now. We just need to think very carefully about exactly what they're doing, if they are in fact a psy-op.

             "Ties" to Singer? Are you kidding me? One job on one movie is not "ties." It might be "tie" (singular), but it might be more accurately described as "had a job on a movie that Singer also worked on." Hollywood is a surprisingly small world. Even smaller when you're just talking about 3D movies--which is Goodman's trade.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has less ties to Singer than Trump's cabinet has to Putin. I do appreciate you, V____Z, but you need to stop using these WaPo tactics.

              I think you're being overly harsh. For one thing, I am quoting another user, but you have to admit that this is common lexicon even when one is speaking in the singular. I also happen to think that if it strengthens the point, it's not such a bad thing in this case, because he did happen to work right alongside a most notorious child rapist in Hollywood, if not THE most notorious. This speaks to his lack of morals if nothing else. It also brings into question where he stands on helping the pizzagate investigation, which is supposed to be the sole purpose for this sub. I checked and he hasn't made an expose' on, or spoken out against, his former cohort. In fact, I don't see any documentaries in his history at all, so why was he called in to this particular project?
             </p>
             <p>
              He didn't speak out against this pedorapist, and he has now become a very close buddy, indeed a handler and the manager, of George Webb. Consider that Webb has become the face of pizzagate/SethRich even if only by default, since he puts out 10 videos a day and has very white teeth
              <em>
               swoon
              </em>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              The face of pizzagate is someone who doesn't think Podesta should serve jail time, and he has partnered up with someone who seems fine working alongside famous pedorapists, whose true intentions besides filming a movie with Webb as the star, are mostly unknown.
             </p>
             <p>
              What this post was about, is whether he has hinted about his intentions. He was called in by whatever agency is behind Webb, this is per Webb's own words. No, I'm not going to get you the video, but those who've been watching know this and have discussed it here. Now, what did that agency hire him to produce, exactly?
             </p>
             <p>
              In the last two minutes of this video, he says they are creating a story that will perhaps implicate the Awan brothers as the hackers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Last night Webb repeated the strangest thing. He kept saying ' now the important thing here is, was a leak, or a hack. If it was a leak, Trump won't be impeached. But if it was a hack, he could be'.
             </p>
             <p>
              It looks to me like an agency (CIA?) aligned with the DNC, Soros, Clinton's, rothschilds, has hired these guys to make a film they will call a documentary ("true"), but it will tell the story, and contain "evidence", that gets all eyes off the true perps and throws some low level patsies under the bus.
             </p>
             <p>
              When he actually said Anthony Weiner was running a spy ring in Congress in today's video, it became clear. Weiner is already busted, they have no problem throwing him under the bus with the Awan brothers. But does anyone really believe that's where the evidence contained in the Podesta and DNC leaks winds up? We are going to be fed a story that it all can be explained by the big bad Awan brothers, other brown people, and silly dick pic Weiner.
             </p>
             <p>
              One more thing. Soros donated to Netflix this year. Next we get sick stuff about sex being ok as long as you're alive, meaning any age is fine.we also got a documentary about intuition that featured marina abromovich as if she was some illuminated goddess of wisdom. Two days ago Hillary comes out and does an interview. She says very clearly I LOVE NETFLIX and then "but we've really got to invest in documtaries. I looked and there were only documentaries that were negative, about Obama and me. We've got to put our money into those who are making documentaries, to combat this!"
             </p>
             <p>
              This was interesting, it wasn't just some thoughtless comment. That same day in a very long periscope, George blurted out that they've got all the pieces now and have put them all together. All they need now is the money, it needs to be put together in a nice format, a film, and that is where the need for money comes in. (It was a long vid and I'm not going to go looking for it. And this was part of their plan too, making it impossible for us to track them with endless hours of minutia, as well as deleting stuff left and right.)
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not saying everything is connected but I am asking for help in watching what is going on, ok?

               I'm just saying it's a misleading quote. "Ties" is an inaccurate, irresponsible word. I stand by that. It's as irresponsible as "ties to Russia." It's very, very circumstantial, and would be stronger evidence if Goodman worked with Singer on multiple projects. One project means next to nothing to me, especially given the job he had.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I know the vid you're referring to. Webb didn't say Goodman was "called in." He said "they picked you," and makes a vague reference to Mossad somehow directing Goodman's attention to Webb. I'm still trying to piece together how this happened, because I agree it's important to understand. (Another person to look into is Lee Stranahan, who has been friends with Goodman for ~25 years, and whom I believe Webb got in touch with before Goodman.) Point is, it's a stretch right now to say Goodman was "called in." But still worth looking into. I agree, it's very strange and unclear.
              </p>
              <p>
               Webb was pushing the hack/leak thing when he was drunkenly pressuring Kim Dotcom to give him the metadata on Seth Rich. I believe he was trying to explain how important Kim's information is, and his point was that if Kim could confirm, once and for all, that it was a leak, everything would conclusively tip against the DNC's Russian hacker story. I still haven't figured out why you read this as Webb trying to convince everyone that it wasn't a leak.
              </p>
              <p>
               Weiner was where a lot of Pizzagate started. Multiple publications ran stories alleging that sources within the FBI and NYPD said Weiner's laptop contained Hillary's deleted emails, with evidence of all the corrupt shit (including child trafficking) that the CF has been up to. There's also the now-oft-cited "Weiner's trusted staff" email-- Webb has made a good case for that "trusted staff" being the Awan brothers. And I've said this to you before, but the Awan brothers are real. It's not just Webb talking about them. And it makes no sense to equate blaming them for their real activities with this blanket statement of "blaming brown people."
              </p>
              <p>
               Netflix is clearly aligned with democrats. Sure. But Hillary has blamed every crazy thing she can think of for her loss. It's a major leap of logic to deduce that she must be talking about producing Jason Goodman's George Webb documentary that implicates her in crimes far beyond any that anyone in her position has ever been implicated in before.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm willing to help you. This is my attempt to help you. George Webb has rung my "con artist" bell many times. And if he is a psy-op, that's all the more reason why we need to think and write as clearly as possible.

             he used to shit me to tears. I'd always petition him for details or evidence, and he'd zip it &amp; go all cryptic. Wanker. Then one day, someone finally posted a great credible evidence laden article about the corruption in Wisconsin, and the fuckkkr was bloody nowhere to be seen!

               And we see way too much of you V___Z. Shilling for organ harvesters and child rapists is pathetic. Call me Old School American but running drugs is one thing it's quite another to rape children and steal organs. They're not even in the same zip code. You must be New School American.

             I used to deal with hardware salesmen. The high end ones, who sell millions of dollars of equipment, make a LOT of money, more than any of the technical guys who work for them (each regional salesman had a team of tech support guys) They are very smooth.. George Webb Sweigert is a career software salesman, he is a complete BS artist, an actor. Someone contracted him, so he could be built into an "underground" figure for the truth movement, just like that fatso (((Deep State))) agent Alex Jones. There is a team behind him, to make him credible with the fools that follow him.
            </p>
            <p>
             HIs goal is to make sure the name of AIPAC / Israel / Mossad is always clear, and that no conspiracy theory touches them. He is obviously being financed directly or indirectly by the state of Israel. Someone claimed he was being financed by pedophile Jew Epstein..
            </p>
            <p>
             The modus operandi, to build him is the typical Jewish victimization high school play:.. start posting fake videos about being prosecuted by the Deep State, and then claim your videos have been deleted, and then have shills promote him like he's some kind of truth hero in places like redditt and voat.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will do a larger piece / video on him when i have some time.

              See my submissions, just posted on the possible Epstein link, with a link to his girl toy, Wendy, saying that he told her he works for Epstein. They've definitely got a huge troll team online fighting back against criticism, and posting comments that make it sound as if George is the Second Coming.

               Lol, holy shit your shill streak is showing again. V you can quiet my doubts about you by simple providing your opinion on Andrew McCabe. Did he do something wrong? Is he a slow walker? Should he have declared that $650,000
               <s>
                bribe
               </s>
               campaign contribution to his wife's campaign for higher office?
              </p>
              <p>
               Get the picture? If you can't even mention Andrew McCabe's name that means you've been told not to mention Andrew McCabe's name.
              </p>
              <p>
               This isn't complicated. So lay it on me. We won't talk about George Webb at all unless you bring him up to get out of this request you talk about Andrew McCabe. Ready?

             As far as I know V, only 5 pings work at a time (in each message or post). I didn't get yours here so I'm guessing maybe others didn't either.   I'm George'd out and going back to what we were doing before he started this shit to distract us with what... nothing.

             It bugs me that they are planning to say Seth was not murdered for leaking, that the Awan brothers actually did the hack and there was no leak at all. A hero would tell the truth.

              If that is what they are planning, that will also be the set up to keep pushing the theory that Seth was a victim of a robbery as they have always insisted.  The only robbery was the Primary being stolen from Bernie Sanders.  They are all deleting their stuff because they are getting scared. Scared because be were getting too close for comfort.

                I have felt they would keep  pushing and will keep pushing the armed robbery narrative ad infinitum.  They will bring out all the puppets to keep repeating the lies over and over. No way can we let them win that war.

                 There is no way i can imagine "progressive" channels going along wiht this, but there is no sign whatsoever they are being discerning, so i'm nervous. I had to leave Twitter because 100% of the people there are in love with Webb. Literally everyone, afaik.

                <p>
                 We cannot let them spin this story, but without the big channels helping get the truth out, i don't see what we can do.

                  By "progressives" channels  I presume you mean sites such as Tom Hartmann, Lee Camp and others?  They are all trying to hold on to their jobs for even their owners are heavily committed or too scared to reveal the truth.  It isn't even just about doing the right thing and losing money in order to help your country, it is about getting a bullet in the back of your head.

                   Oh good GOD no! They're MSM lite shills. I'm talking about HA Goodman, Tim Black, Hard Bastard, and pizzagate-type channels like the Outer Light. All of these have TONS of viewers and they are all salivating over George.

              But the Awans were working for part of DNC - or Pakistani intelligence with the help of DWS and Huma(?)  Looks like many moving parts.  Visas, organs drugs, weapons  - Mina on steroids - he was talking about a billion US a day going through Offutt and Belgium NATO.  Then there is the money laundering [pizza parlor anyone?]

              Maybe he just objects that they got too greedy and too brutal.  Maybe he is laying breadcrumbs to lead us away from pizzagate,  But if he was only supposed to "blow the bloody doors off" he has done much more than that.  Could be payback and personal.

            He loves his metadata and release the emails, release the emails.  How about real data? This week 2078 pages of new Clinton emails were released of which 115 are classified. Judicial Watch is calling these shocking. Getting into them now. Coincidence that the newly formed gang of journo's are not reporting on this?

             Exactly. If you want real data go tell David Brock to call up Andrew McCabe and get those 650,000 emails released and we'll be bathing in "real data" all Summer.

              Put your paws down and stop attacking me. I'm good with 2,078 emails with 115 being classified. I trust Judicial Watch's comment about being shocked which tells me this is important. Judicial Watch is doing a great job and will get more evidence.  I am not going to respond to the rest.

            We need to ask George if it was both a hack and a leak and watch him conjure up the best conspiracy theory ever.  We'll just have to wait for the results of the evidence lawsuits filed by Seth's parents and Judicial Watch to make any more progress. I was sitting on the fence about George but the last two videos pushed me off in a direction I really didn't want to go. He brought this cloud on his credibility upon  himself, I'm afraid.

             Pizzalawyer "V____Z" is a paid shill. The only people that don't like George Webb are the people he's bringing down.
            </p>
            <p>
             And technically you should replace George Webb with Mossad because that's who he is. Mossad is turning state's evidence against the Deep State and Hillary &amp; Co.

              George Mossad Sweigert hasn't brought anyone "down" and he is not going to.
Anyone who thinks a socialist, demented, drunken paranoid jewish loonie is going to "bring down the power" is delusional, idiotic, and probably both.
The guy is a disinfo agent, who specializes in clearing the name of the AIPAC / Mossad and the state of Israel.

                Nobody is going to take Andrew McCabe "down", you moron.. 
He is the FBI head for a reason, you idiot, do you really think some fat drunken jew with a camera and too much time on his hands
is going to be able to take "down" the head of the FBI?
bhahahahahhah
Even REAL honest journalists who really had a scoop against the CIA, like the REAL George Webb, ended up jobless
You have no clue how the whole system works..

                 That's odd because Donald Trump is actively looking for a new FBI director:

                 Not much longer, see referenced article above.

                 I'm an idiot? You just wrote nobody's going to take Andrew McCabe down despite the fact George Webb from Mossad and Donald Trump the guy currently running the country are actively plotting his imminent dismissal.

                   And thank the Lord for that. Andrew McCabe is a depraved piece of shit for slow walking investigations into the Deep State. I'm still a little unsure of your position on Andrew SlowWalker. Please answer the following question::
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Is there any evidence whatsoever anywhere in the Universe that Andrew McCabe has obstructed justice in anyway?

              The only people who don't like George Webb are the ones who have realized that he is full of it - purposely leading us on a wild goose chase away from Obama, away from the Deep State, away from the CIA, towards "Pakistani's" that we can never arrest or convict so his crew can continue on and "no one goes to jail."

              <p>
               Hillary Clinton is the Chief Operating Officer at the Deep State. She's getting taken out behind the wood shed.
              </p>
              <p>
               You kind of have a valid point though. Technically George Webb should be going after Henry Kissinger because he's the Deep State's chairman of the board, a job he shares with George H.W. Bush.
              </p>
              <p>
               But George Webb steering clear of the Deep State's boardroom as well as the CIA isn't a bad thing at the moment. The American Public needs to be spoon fed the truth at the moment because it's so shocking.
              </p>
              <p>
               I suspect the plan is take down Andrew McCabe at the FBI and at least 23 perps who got caught with their hand in the cookie jar.
              </p>
              <p>
               After that if nothing is done about the CIA running drugs and the Deep State gang raping places like Haiti well you'll have a valid point. But let's cross that bridge on when we come to it.

              It's all starting to become too convoluted for this aging brain. I regret attacking Webb now and taking sides as to Webb is something I really don't want to do with other members of this forum. Its hurtful and doesn't advance the investigation so I'll refrain from further comments that  makes me look like I'm  taking sides.  We have been told that a disinformation agent provides 80% truth, 20% falsehoods  and if those are the proportions that is good enough for me.  Since that 20% could also be good faith error we are no worse off having such traitors amongst us: the truth for the most part wiggles its way out eventually.  I'm just terribly inpatient and that clouds my judgment sometimes.  I love everybody here and I'm amazed that people give up  so much of their time in the pursuit of justice.  Lets hope our collective efforts bear fruit.

               Don't worry about it. That's how MediaMatters and ShareBlue work. They spread doubt. I got caught up in it early on a little bit until I figured out their game.

               But there is a huge consolation at the end of this. When at least 23 high profile perps are arrested sometime this Summer I've got a sneaky suspicion David Brock will be one of him. He cheated the IRS out of around $1,000,000. Now that the shoe's on the other foot we may expect justice directly and it will be one of the sweetest and poetic occasions in American History.

              And I do understand she's a person, and this is a snap judgment on my part. I just think, if there is a case against Webb, it needs to be able to stand up to criticism.

             That just adds to Webb's ill intentions towards her. Honestly, I hate to get into controversy, but Webb is obvious disinfo and not even good at that. I think the boy is an alcoholic too that I can tell you.

             She is bonkers, but i did see the many, many text messages that she released before she deleted them. He being a nutcase does not diminish the validity of that information, in fact it explains how she got so caught up in Webb. A sane person wouldn't have become as involved as she did. He is bonkers too, ya know.

              Maybe. But you back her claims without hesitation. It's a crazy woman's testimony. That should give you some pause.

                     Webb himself said it when he tweeted and told Wendy to feel free to post screenshots of their chats. He has since deleted weeks of tweets, Ive read that anyway, but alot of people read the tweet he tweeted to her on the day all of this broke

                       He deleted all of his tweets save for a few from 2012, and just the past few weeks. So, everything before a month ago was deleted, all of it.

                          No, you posted those, right? I was just asking for any kind of third-party verification of what she's said about Webb. Anything that gives her credibility.

                           I hope that answers your question. There are comments there from voat. If you are wanting all the Twitter comments you should check out her Twitter page. If she deleted them, then maybe there is a way to retrieve them. I don't know how. I see people show things like that here tho.

                         Good grief, thats been months ago. I saw it on his twitter when I followed him.

                         can you answer this man's question? The date that comes up when I google it is April 12, 2017.  I know there was a lot of comment here on Voat and in the comment section of his YT, unless he deleted those comments, so I guess you could look up that date and find it.

                           I still talk to Wendy sometimes. She suddenly left Facebook for a while because she was scared and didn't know who she could trust.

                         I'm actually blocking you now, and anyone can look at my comments to see how much attention i have given your questions today, you have taken up a lot of my time and seem to be doing nothing more than trolling. You are not actually reading posts or watching videos before commenting. I'm done.

                       It was on Georges twitter. He tweeted it to her. Thats why she started posting the screenshots of their convo because he challenged her to do it. I really kinda thought it was a setup between them because in the screenshots, he would tell her what to post as a comment under his YT vids. Who knows? She's nuts/he's nuts. They go together.

            Another hit piece on George. How surprising.
So his information is void and null.
That must be very profitable for Podesta and his Molesta buddies. Are you pleased?

             Would you be pleased if they created a story blaming the leak on a hack, and letting everyone believe that Seth wasn't in fact murdered? Because that's what's happening. I'm not going to let it happen without screaming about it all the while, sorry.

            Yeah that sure is going around. I think it's contagious. Just look at you V. Here I was all this time thinking you were here to help take down the Pediocracy in DC. But no, you'd rather attack the very people who are trying to take it down.
           </p>
           <p>
            And bee tee dubs that's why George Webb is doing what he's doing. Look at George Webb as the Mossad turning state's evidence against their fellow conspirators: the Deep State and the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb is tearing it down because Mossad realized Hillary &amp; Co were bad for business. Running drugs is illegal but apparently everybody in the IC seems to be doing it. But setting up industrial scale organ harvesting and child rape organizations is beyond evil. That's enough to get any alpha male

            Hillary Clinton took this fraud to a new level probably because she's literally a psychopath and couldn't conceive her actions could stir up the basest of human emotions that, ding ding ding, could easily lead to people showing up down in DC with a Gatling gun and 100,000 rounds of 7.62mm full metal jacket and then come back for seconds.

            Killing Extortion 17 launched 8,985 highly trained alpha male assassins who I'm gathering don't care much about the race, religion or pay grade of any of the perps. You feel me?

           <p>
            Israel isn't stupid. George Webb is Israel trying to get as far away from Hillary Clinton as possible before she is fileted and barbecued for the biggest July 4th party since 1776. George Webb is Israel trying to get back in the good graces of the average American alpha male. George Webb is Israel throwing Deplorable Shit Lords a bone because after those 8,985 there are about at least 10,000,000 more with semi-automatic assault rifles and low capacity magazines(which is actually a good thing since they help save ammo and prolong a fire fight, long story. Did I ever tell you I spent 2 weeks in Marine Corp OCS?) 10,000,000 alpha males with assault rifles descending like locusts on DC might look

             Racine, Wisconsin remains as a real Litmus Test for anyone truly investigating the bigger picture of criminal corruption behind the scenes that has enabled and empowered the entire network involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
             George Webb got close at some points in his investigation with some rat lines through Wisconsin, but never pinpointed how unusually important Wisconsin and Racine in particular are in the global picture. He never connected the dots between Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Paul Ryan and John McCain who are all deeply involved and have destroyed America from within, instead focusing on foreign nationals as the boogeymen.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are about to cover up Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption with another new group called The Fight to End Exploitation linked to Ashton Kutcher, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, and many nefarious groups behind the scenes who are actively involved in corruption and other crimes while covering up the elite trafficking and abuse that insiders enable and are complicit to. This is exactly what Monica Petersen was uncovering, and Racine links directly to Denver DHS and other trafficking hubs including Arizona, Pennsylvania, Chicago, New York, DC, Haiti, Ghana, Norway, Belgium, and UK.
            </p>
            <p>
             The feds have more information and Loretta Lynch personally stonewalled the investigations into RICO activities in Racine tied to the Clinton Foundation. None of these investigators seem to want to really solve the underlying truth behind Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It is not safe for non-Mossad agents and others to witness the evil criminal truth that our officials and business leaders are involved in.
            </p>
            <p>
             What is the real secret about Racine, Wisconsin, why is Paul Ryan so powerful, why is Racine used as an experimental model for Agenda 2030, and why do no laws apply in Racine for criminal elite involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption?
            </p>
            <p>
             Jim Comey knows about Racine. Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton know about Racine. Paul Ryan's own backyard is one of the deepest swamps in the world, and some of the most powerful and influential people in the world have direct ties to Racine. Why is Racine, Wisconsin even more TABOO than Seth Rich, Shawn Lucas, and Monica Petersen?

              There was a roaring huge fire that took down Didion Milling of Madison Wi. Riley Dideon was the President and he volunteered at World Missions since 2008  The focus of each mission is different and each mission can have a number of target areas; medical/health, economic empowerment, education, construction, youth related.  There have been other occurances as well.

              "George Webb got close"
             </p>
             <p>
              George Webb was part of a school play of sorts. My take on his movements was he doing a holding pattern so he could time the Coup de Grace on June 1st.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also I have a feeling George Webb is kind of teaching as many people who want to know how to do Citizen Journalism because lets face it the days of people trusting the MSM are over. In 10 years the MSM will be a shadow of their former selves.
             </p>
             <p>
              And that makes me smile every time I think about it.

              I can't figure out if you're implying I'm a Deplorable or a member of some Deep State covert special ops shill division which has plans to take over DC with assault weapons.

               Dont care if youre paid or not you slow down actual researchers. Like me whom they constantly censor. Well not like me cuz i never followed Webb for one second. Rather ive located dozens of pedo restaurants and deduced the significanceof their locations.

                  If there actually is a world wide Jewish conspiracy to dumb down the goy so they can be lead to the slaughter then you are proof it's working. It's double digit IQs like yours that justify your extermination. If only the strong survive then you should just castrate yourself now and get it over with.

              You keep getting twisted around the axle. You responded to the wrong comment above and here:

             <p>
              "Youre blowing your cover with the frequent talk of storming DC with guns"

             <p>
              I can't figure out if you're implying I'm a Deplorable or a member of some Deep State covert special ops shill division which has plans to take over DC with assault weapons.

                         ROFLMAO. Stop making me laugh. Your "research" led you to a Bill Nye music video and establishing that Fiona Hill looks like the lead singer of Jane's Addiction Perry Ferel.

                        <p>
                         We actually need less of your "research" and to be honest none of your constant droning about "The Jews(tm)". You are a chump of no consequence. I'm going to start ignoring you now. You're a waste of my time.

              Media Matters and ShareBlue are on to me? Why would they be on to me? I'm a nobody with a bad back. I'm a Deplorable Shit Lord with only one working toilet. I'm the new Lower Middle Class. I'm so poor I can't even afford a staycation.

              If MediaMatters and ShareBlue are on to people like ME then it won't be long now before the collapse.

                Wrong, wrong and wrong.

                I'm just grateful enough to recognize a favor when I see one. Not that that matters as you already proved yourself a shill.

               <p>
                You think we can't see the hours you soulless bastards spend in a conference room and/or call putting together talking points and then showing up here like a swarm of locusts? You're not fooling anybody. It's just so fucking sad. By George Webb's own admission the "New Mossad" is raping children and organ harvesting. Why you can't see that is beyond me.

               <p>
                Actually please explain to me why you won't acknowledge George Webb is turning state's evidence. Do you even know what that term means?
