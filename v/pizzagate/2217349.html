            His brother having been arrested for CP is not sufficient evidence of a connection to pizzagate.  If you have other evidence linking it to pizzagate, feel free to post that, but we're pretty far currently from anything indicating a likely connection.  By the way, there were over 20k people at the concert.  The number of people who were there who have since died is actually slightly statistically lower than what would be expected.  The latest death was gang-related (Vegas is right next to S. California, which is major Latino gang territory).

            Saw this on Fox News last night . I'm beginning to think all this is a setup to scare us . They see that we're researching and that we point out how people end up dead so they play on that and show us " look what happens to people who call us out " and the fact that it's blasted on the news that they survived vegas only to die a few weeks later in a fiery car crash !?

             Yeah, I'm hearing from several people that Vegas was a distraction but I guess they're just handing out downvoats instead of explaining themselves. It's a little mortifying, but at the same time, these people might not even exist or it could be a diversion and I'm wasting your time by posting this. Either way, I'm just telling it how I'm told.

             This must be relevant to Pedogate; especially after Paddock's brother is caught with CP and Paddock's hard drive is missing. I thought this was a given at this point. I edited the post, I hope it stays up or I'll really question this site's ability to cope with freedom of speech.
