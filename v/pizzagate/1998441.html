            West Bengal: CID Arrests NGO Chief And Shuts Down Orphanage For Selling Babies

           <p>
            In the fourth such case of baby sale crackdown by the police in the last three months, On Feb 20, 2017,Chandana Chakraborty
the chairperson of an NGO, Bimala Shishu Griho, was arrested in the Falakata area of Jalpaiguri ,district in West Bengal.  She
was reportedly running a racket of illegally selling children at high prices to buyers including childless couples in India and abroad. She sold at least 17 children between the ages of 1 to 14 years.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “What is shocking is that the head of the (orphanage) was also running a shelter for destitute women and selling their babies,” Rashmi Sen of the West Bengal state women and child development ministry told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“Ongoing investigations will also probe if the women were trafficked to the home to keep the adoption racket going,” she added.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CID is suspecting Ms Chakraborty’s links with a local BJP leader who had been helping her with the funds and other concessions. Juhi Choudhury, the local BJP leader, is allegedly on the run.
            </p>
            <p>
             As many as 18 people were arrested including doctors, midwives and the owners of charities and clinics, who were suspected of taking babies from women immediately after they had given birth and telling them their children were stillborn.
Reportedly they used forged documents, fake stamps and certificates to sell babies and had been warned multiple times by the government 
in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
             The orphanage was registered with the Central Adoption Resource Authority and was the only orphanage in Jalpaiguri district that was permitted to put up children for adoption.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The accused were also involved in running two other homes in the area. 'Two people were arrested after raids in three charitable homes on Saturday night,' Sashi Panja, state women and child development minister, said.
            </p>
            <p>
             One (Child Welfare official) said the accused ran health camps to identify poor and unmarried pregnant women and convinced them to give away their babies for adoption after paying them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police are also said to be investigating whether the adoption racket was part of a wider human trafficking operation.  
The latest scandal comes four months after police arrested 18 people over the sale of newborn babies in the same state.
Thirteen babies were rescued and skeletons of two other infants found near the port city of Kolkata.
            </p>
            <p>
             'Our own enquiry last year revealed that the children had not been entered into the government system, which mandates recording of every abandoned child,' Sen said.
            </p>
            <p>
             'In January we moved 15 children from the orphanage to other homes for their safety. They were all below the age of five, some just a few months old.'

            <p>
             Feb. 19: The arrest of two women officials of a Jalpaiguri orphanage has unearthed alleged sales of babies to couples from America, Singapore, Spain and France, besides India.
            </p>
            <p>
             Chandana Chakraborty, who runs the NGO and the home, and Sonali Mondal, chief adoption officer with the NGO, were arrested by the CID yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sleuths are looking for Juhee Chowdhury, general secretary of the BJP Mahila Morcha's Bengal chapter. "She's a key suspect. She visited Delhi several times to get renewal papers for the home," an officer said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Officers claimed that Chandana, a schoolteacher, had admitted that Juhee had introduced her to some central ministers and officials. "A couple of days ago, she stayed overnight at Juhee's home," an officer said.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Chandana told reporters some government officials were involved in the racket. "Some people in Jalpaiguri have hatched a conspiracy against me. I shall reveal the names of these people and some government officials to the CID," she said.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Chowdhury‘s arrest could have political implications as investigators may go after other BJP leaders after quizzing her. The head of the NGO Bimala Sishu Griho, Chandana Chakravarty, who was arrested on February 18 reportedly told the CID that Chowdhury took her to Delhi to discuss the matter (trafficking) and she has spoken to BJP leaders such as Kailash Vijayvargiya (national general secretary) and Rupa Ganguly (Rajya Sabha MP).
            </p>
            <p>
             Chowdhury is the fourth person to be arrested so far in connection with the trafficking case. Bimala Sishu Griho head Chandana Chakraborty, its employee Sohini Mondal and her brother Manas Bhowmik were arrested earlier in February.
            </p>
            <p>
             CID officers are now trying to find out who are the influential people that Juhi Chowdhury contacted when she was on the run for about 10 days before her arrest Tuesday night.
            </p>
            <p>
             Earlier, a Salt Lake-based doctor Dilip Ghosh was arrested for his involvement in the child trafficking case that was busted also by CID in south Bengal last year.

             Thanks, I'm in full agreement that the story is big.  The "Humanitarian" industry is unbelievable in scope and (((black market))) implications.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had another thread today regarding the Cambodian anti-pedophile NGO 'Action Pour Les Enfants'  (APLE),  (
             <em>
              do they sell T-Shirts? hmmm, rings a bell
             </em>
             )...and the early 2016 conviction of one of their former directors for abusing 11 victims at an orphanage he founded.
            </p>
            <p>
             After doing some reading I found accusations that APLE engages in some dubious (but lucrative) behavior where they either set up foreigners to be accused as pedophiles and the accused have to pay a lot of money to get out of it, or that they allow foreign pedophiles to go ahead and abuse kids and then extort the money (while doing nothing to many local pedos).  I don't know if it's true or not, however, if you read some of the info within the thread you can see how such a group could be helpful in creating blackmail files.   FBI director Robert Mueller visited Phnom Penh in 2008, right when the FBI office opened in the Cambodian capital, he was there to stress Cambodia's cooperation in the 'war on terror."
            </p>
            <p>
             There are so many ways to make money off this, it's no wonder business is booming (read also my thread on students studying abroad and VolunTouring, another way to keep the funds rolling, but not at no cost to many of the students,
             <em>
              we just have no way of knowing how many
             </em>
             ).

            Jesse Osmun, caught molesting girls at Umvoti AIDS Centre in Greytown, South Africa, where he volunteered.  He previously volunteered at Nyumbani as well. So are AIDS orphanages attracting a certain kind of pedo?  Is it possible that they themselves have aids?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             S.African children may have stopped sex predator
            </p>
            <p>
             U.S. investigators say Jesse Osmun confessed that as a Peace Corps volunteer, he for months sexually molested at least five girls at a South African shelter for AIDS orphans and other children. None of the girls were older than 6.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a Twitter account and blogs, Osmun portrayed himself as a champion of Africa and wrote about working with children. Before coming to South Africa, where he started work at the shelter in March 2010, Osmun volunteered at an orphanage in Kenya, where the director said he did no harm. Osmun also wrote of seeking other international aid work before his arrest last week.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sister Mary Owens, director of the Nyumbani Children's Home, said Osmun volunteered in 2006 at her Nairobi, Kenya shelter for children orphaned by AIDS and children who are HIV-positive. Owens, informed by the AP of the charges against Osmun, said she had spoken with staff and determined he had not been suspected of similar activities there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Asked whether U.S. prosecutors were investigating whether Osmun had abused children in Kenya, Laura Sweeney, a U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman familiar with his case, said she could not comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Osmun had written on a blog of having worked at the Kenyan orphanage, though he said it was in 2004.

             Ezili Danto quotes Kerlens Tilus:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “For more than 10 years, these gentlemen have been involved in arms trafficking, organ trafficking, human trafficking, cocaine trafficking, money laundering and smuggling…Since January 2015, Haiti is on the list of states that finance the international terrorist. No media…has ever asked a question. Well, our Arab and Jewish friends fund terrorism in the Middle East from Haiti..The rotten and corrupt Haitian press protects the interests of the haves. The United States of America knows that these gentlemen are involved in illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs.” — Kerlens Tilus, July 1, 2017
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             She's dubious, however about Kerlens Tilus
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Kerlens’ main point is that these billionaire mulatto collaborators of Arab/Jewish ancestry are now living in fear that Trump may arrest them for tax evasion, money laundering, narcotics trafficking &amp; funding Middle Eastern terrorists.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think that’s wishful thinking and possibly a planted article because of who Kerlens is.
             </p>
             <p>
              I’ve studied and observed Kerlens’ erratic writings from afar for many years; how it’s peppered with Freemasonry occult (egregore) stuff and they’re reflective of a brainwashed, MKUltra colonial operative who has astral functions.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             But there is something to be said for even being able to speak out...something VOAT embodies as a core value.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              There’s a theme here that we wouldn’t be even talking about if the Obama Demoncrats had gotten a third term through crooked Hillary. It is precisely because Hillary Clinton didn’t win the White House, that an article about arresting the Haiti oligarchs, most of whom are also US citizens, for tax evasion and money laundering is at all a possibility.

               The article is long, and it puts names to some of the people who reportedly are driving the Global Terror/Global Exploitation (all forms of trafficking).  She has a good site, a lot of info.  This article is worth digging into, but seems almost risky as well.  These would be some very cut throat people.

                She's quite fearless but considering what is happening to her country she has my admiration for speaking out so consistently. Haiti also seems to be a testing ground for future atrocities with implications for the rest of us. I'll have a read of the article.

                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  This author wrote many years ago, before the Wikileaks and Hillary Clinton release emails vindicated our research with further hard proof, that the humanitarian occupation in Haiti was:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “..blithely focused on establishing luxury hotels, tourist resorts, mining infrastructure to drill and dig up Haiti’s vast minerals and oil for its own coffers. While claiming it’s providing aid to Haiti, the U.S. is stealing Haiti’s gold, copper, marble, iridium, uranium and oil wealth. The U.S. genocidal plans for Haitians continues to displace Haiti’s farmers and fishermen as they battle cholera.”...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  US big-agribusiness agricultural policies, the Neoliberals’ rush to automate and put everyone on a grid as wage workers devalued Haiti’s informal economy and its small subsistence farmers.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Their lands and work are not counted in Haiti’s GDP by the World Bank and international thieves, telling everyone Haitians live on less than $2 dollars per day. Well, that is actually rich, if you have family lands, the ocean breeze, mountain coolness, coastal waters, fruit trees filled with coconuts, avocados, mangos, bananas, small rice paddies and other foodstuffs and just need the manufactured condiments to gild the lily and can trade for some of it, at the local farmers’ market, in exchange for your surplus food, livestock or crafts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Before the three US occupations of Haiti, Haitians lived reasonably well, and elderly Haitians tell us of a time, told to them by their grandparents, before 1915 when school children use to collect monies to help out US orphans and Chinese children. A time when Haiti gave asylum and life to a whole host of different peoples seeking a safe haven from racial, political and religious persecutions. That’s beside helping Simon Bolivar free South America from European slavery and being one of the first nations to recognize Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire with weapons and financial support.

                  Thank you for this.  Yes, what has happened to Haiti, the once proud little Caribbean island that was punished for standing up to imperialists, is a tragedy of epic proportions.  Ezili has also written about the drug testing on the population there too.  For example, this comment of hers on Facebook ...

                   Ezili Dantò's Comment on article titled: Haiti’s Cervical Cancer Epidemic (This comment has since been scrubbed by Newsweek from the internet.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Norplant? Depo Provera? Eugenics? Rape as a tool of US occupation behind UN guns? PAHO/WHO forced infertility vaccines..? Not addressed in the article whatsoever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The colonial narrative continues in this Newsweek. com article titled "Haiti’s Cervical Cancer Epidemic." It is well funded to unleash the "White savior/Black saved" Euro imperial gaze.
To wit, we learn from this, uhmm (ill-described), "well researched" missive that: "Haiti is a beneficiary of billions of dollars in foreign aid, of course, but so much of it is squandered through inefficiency and corruption."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The truth is, foreign aid goes to foreign entities, not the Haitian government, local Haiti doctors or local Haitians. So who is corrupt? Who is inefficient? The implication here, is Black Haiti is, not the white savior industrial complex which raise billions off Haiti's misery and require a Haiti crisis and misery to profit - to feed the Avatar system of US imperialism and its resource pillage from the global South.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Moreover, no mention is made of why these women are so poor? Why Haiti has no health care infrastructure self-sustained by the Haiti government? No mention is made of neoliberal economics and the repugnant conditions imposed by World Bank/IMF structural adjustment on Haiti? How the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) forbid the Haiti government from spending funds on public services, from using the countries assets - gold, oil, iridium, coltan, lands, deep water ports and natural resources - for the benefit of local Haitians.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It's as if US imperialism doesn't keep Haiti CONTAINED in poverty to dominate a sick, weaken and hungry people, while feeding the NGO industry, the pharmaceutical entities, big oil, mining moguls, shipping companies and the human rights industrial complex, et al. As if the US did not destroy Haiti local food sovereignty with trade deals benefiting big US Agro and big US pharmaceutical? Oh yeah, no mention is made, in this article, of the constant heavy menstrual bleeding Haiti women suffer CAUSED by USAID's Depo provera and Norplant experiments on Haiti women over 30years ago and it relations to cervical cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Yep indeed, the white Jesus (NGO) crew have done the Christopher Columbus job thee're meant to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   A Haiti people of resistance have been mostly tamed. Are accommodating in their own destruction. Have been shock and awed by US military/NGO/embedded media forces to swallow their foul vaccines, take poisoned prenatal tetanus shots administered to all child-bearing Haiti women from 14 to 49. Accept the Monsanto GMO-hybrid seeds, the Dominican Republic imports... Resistance against genocide is suffocated. Just like it's done in the US Black communities, foundation and nor-for-profit monies in Haiti are also strategically made to trickle into the coffers Haiti preachers, clergy, priests and the assimilated, sell-out Negroes pushing Establishment choruses. Many Haitians are praying, waiting for relief from who, oh yeah: white Jesus God; Santa Claus Bill Clinton and the "feminist?" Hillary Clinton.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The NGOs promote this DEPENDENCY and abstract, associative irrationality. Haitians are manipulated to befriend their enemies, rail against Desalin Haitians who resist the poverty pimps, their invasion, Trojan-horse foreign aid, tied aid and smallpox-blanket-type "medicines and drugs" imported to Haiti. The slow genocide in Haiti continues. It comes in the form of UN rapes, UN cholera, US occupation, racist DR denationalization, racist US deportations, internal expulsion (i.e. Ilavach, Caracol, Mona Bossa) from peasant lands in Haiti, the toxic US benevolent narrative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The US-Euros fund diseases, palliative care, puppet governments and mock elections to allow foreign resource plunder and the rapist UN army that brought in cholera. Haitian women get cholera insurance, ineffective cholera vaccines, Bill Clinton-imported famine, brutal UN sexual abuse, UN forced pregnancy, forced pedophilia, an epidemic in cervical cancer....but white Jesus and Biblical verses for comfort. The Red Cross uses donation funds to buy Haitian lands, and build a for-profit hotel compound. Currently, there are more whites/foreigners (over 300,000) living the ol' Dixie life in Haiti; more white supremacists, humanitarian saviors, living the good life behind UN proxy guns and private military security contractors at newly built and gated compounds in Haiti than since the first US occupation (1915 to 1934).
They're living well in Haiti, training militarized Haiti police on how to shoot the unarmed demonstrators objection to fake elections and the occupation in Haiti. Some "foreign military experts" make as much as $18,000 per month out of the U.S.-EU "aid to Haiti," live the high life with lots of poor Haiti maids, servants, chauffeurs, sex-servers, gardeners, fixers and cooks, in cholera-infested, quake-ravaged, NGO-invaded Haiti.
The whites and foreign occupiers in Haiti have got the guns, the money, the history of brutality, greed and genocide against Africans for over five centuries and all the material power and want Haitian women to stand, without protest, without a gun of any sorts, except BELIEF in their goodness, pure and good intentions. Haiti must stop the humanitarians and their quiet genocide. Self-defense is a human right! --- Ezili Dantò, HLLN

             Protecting children from orphan-dealers
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A January 2009 study by the Social Welfare Department – responsible for children’s welfare and supervising orphanages – showed that up to 90 percent of the estimated 4,500 children in orphanages in Ghana are not orphans and 140 of the 148 orphanages around the country are un-licensed, said the department’s assistant director Helena Obeng Asamoah.
             </p>
             <p>
              Accra-based child protection specialist with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Eric Okrah told IRIN: “Running an orphanage in Ghana has become a business enterprise, a highly lucrative and profitable venture....Children’s welfare at these orphanages has become secondary to the profit motive.”
             </p>
             <p>
              After researching financing in several Ghanaian orphanages, Ghanaian non-profit Child Rights International (CRI) Bright Apiah surmised that as little as 30 percent of funds received are spent on child care.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Many of the children are not orphans at all...yet if profit is the motive for running an orphanage, one needs to find a supply of "orphans" to use for fundraising.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Across the region some orphanage staff target deprived, rural communities and “exploit the poverty and ignorance of parents” by promising them money and offering to fund their children’s education, CRI’s Apiah said.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some parents unwittingly sign documents giving up their right to legal custody of their child, said the Ghana Social Welfare Department’s Asamoah; many of those signing are illiterate.

             I've read some of the articles regarding voluntourism, and clearly the poor have become a commodity and destination for people who believe they can get a great life experience "helping", without being qualified to really help, at best, and most often making things worse.
            </p>
            <p>
             They don't know about the utter depravity of human traffickers who would sell stolen kids to orphanages, and the orphanages in turn solicit money and provide a voluntourism opportunity for well meaning people on humanitarian work vacay.
            </p>
            <p>
             No doubt some of these orphanages might be stops along the global pedo sex tourist industry map.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              There are several activities for tourists in the riverside villages south of Myanamar’s biggest city Yangon. Some take rickshaw rides around the fruit market or visit local pagodas. Others go to a private orphanage and spend the day unsupervised with a child.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Tourists take the children out, to the zoo or downtown,” said the head of one orphanage of 16 children, a small wooden house built on stilts in flooded fields.
             </p>
             <p>
              As Myanmar braces for mass arrivals following decades under military rule, Unicef is warning against the spread of “orphanage tourism”, whereby the institutionalised care of minors turns into a business, with children from poor families recruited to pose as orphans and extract money from well-meaning foreigners.
             </p>
             <p>
              In its worse form, sexual predators have exploited the unrestricted access to children.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Myanmar could see an exponential increase in the number of orphanages over the coming decade, especially in tourist destinations,” Aaron Greenberg, Unicef Myanmar’s chief of child protection, told the Guardian.

              “Such an increase in orphanage care could violate the rights of tens of thousands of Myanmar children,” he added. “We need to act before orphanages dot the landscape.”

               Kjer House. It is absolutely beautiful. It is located in one of the highest points of [Nyumbani] Village, and is about as nice as any hotel or safari lodge I have seen. It is almost fully finished, and will include its own solar generator complete with hot running water, a refrigerator for cold drinks, and huge comfy beds. And at $15 a night, I think it’s the best deal in Kenya. The long-term plan is to open Kjer House as an eco-lodge to generate revenue for the Village.

               BA has been involved in fraud, price fixing, cocaine shipping, and more.
              </strong>
              I don't know if they are organized crime or if they are no worse than other major airlines only just get caught more.
              <strong>
               But I'm shocked at their connection to voluntourism.  It surely draws pedophiles to work for them, as well as normal volunteer-minded people.

               Great leads!  I'm going to dig into those as soon as I can. Unbelievable that I had not read about Simon Wood.  We know that where there's one prolific pedo, there are pedo networks.  He would post his humanitarian pics online...good place to look too, FB, Instagram etc. (without harassing anyone, just showing off orphan voluntourism pics doesn't mean anyone is a pedo).  Often the really 'perfect people' are suspect, recall Christopher Kloman, volunteer extraordinaire, including serving Habitat for Humanity in Haiti.
              </p>

               Regarding notes, TheBrain8 is a great online mind map that is helpful for organizing connections.

             Great links, thank you!  The article centered on this report, "Orphanage Entrepreneurs: 
The Trafficking of Haiti’s Invisible Children"  (The findings are what I thought is relevant support to what should be self evident: the explosion of NGOs is profitable, and the profit drives some people to create the demand for donations, i.e. selling orphans who aren't really orphans at all).
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              An estimated 32,000 children live in orphanages in Haiti. More than 80% are not orphans.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             and this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Next Generation Nepal (NGN), who work to reconnect trafficked children in Nepal with their parents, found a direct
link between orphanage trafficking, institutionalisation, and voluntourism.
             </p>
             <p>
              New evidence suggests many children
in orphanages globally are taken from their families by recruiters and sold to orphanages for the purpose of profit.
             </p>
             <p>
              In May 2014, 600 children rescued from two Indian railway stations were allegedly being trafficked from their homes
in Bihar and Jharkhand to an orphanage in Kerala. 43 people were arrested and charged with child trafficking
offences.
             </p>
             <p>
              Children living in residential institutions are more likely to go missing than children in families. There is a
significant relationship between missing children and trafficking, meaning that children missing from institutions
are at serious risk of trafficking and exploitation.

             The pdf link in the article didn't work for me...I finally found the report and archived it.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “This orphanage business – where orphanages are established and recruit children to raise donations from foreigners – is becoming increasingly recognised globally as a form of trafficking,” said Jamie Vernaelde, researcher at Lumos.
            </p>
            <p>
             The charity now believes Haiti is experiencing an “orphanage crisis” where the number of facilities have skyrocketed, incentivising the separation of families. Prior to the major Haitian earthquake in 2010, there were an estimated 300 orphanages. When the government reassessed in 2013, there were 752.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It was this response to a real vulnerability but also a perceived idea that, after a humanitarian emergency, children are automatically orphaned,” said Vernaelde.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report also reaffirmed the argument that orphanages cause significant harm to children. Growing up without personal care and a family environment can cause significant developmental and psychological delays.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last 80 years of research into the effects of institutionalised care has found deficits to the child’s “physical growth, cognitive function and social-psychological health”, according to the Lancet medical journal As many as one in 10 children who have been institutionalised commit suicide; one in seven become prostitutes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lumos met people who had lived in Haitian orphanages who described frequent beatings, deliberately withholding food and situations where they were denied the opportunity to learn English to prevent them communicating with foreign visitors.
