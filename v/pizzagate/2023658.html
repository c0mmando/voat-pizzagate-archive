Tony Shaffer says in this interview that at least one of these Awan brothers was helping DWS to manipulate things against Bernie Sanders. What is the theory behind the Seth Rich story? Rich noticed DNC acting against Sanders and in favor of Clinton. He decided to act in the form of various leaks and was killed as a result. There is the connection between the two stories. Also mentioned by Tony Shaffer that the brothers helped with voice alteration technology. Insert phone call to DNC case lawyers that traced back to DWS. THIS IS THE BOMBSHELL: Shaffer than states that a foreign intelligence service may have been a beneficiary of all this and THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. A group which many have traced Huma Abedin back to such as this The Hill article.

How did the Awan brothers get into the country to begin with. Was this something that the U.S. attorney Beranton Whisenant was working on before he died? He was investigating visa cases in or atleast near DWS\' congressional district. This is my lightbulb. I have nothing to say with certainty that this is all accurate, but it makes a lot of sense to me. Call it a hunch. If accurate would HRC have known about it? I\'m betting yes. How does this all relate to pizzagate? Do I have to bring up anthony weiner? Blackmail appears to be something these brothers do not shy away from. Who were they working for and who benefited from their blackmail work. Was it and is it used to control some politicians? Whose to say pedophilia isn\'t one of many things used as blackmail here? Nevermind the fact that more and more we hear about Trump Russia collusion falling apart and find more and more connection between Russia, DNC and Fusion GPS. What if the most egregious interference in our election was not just from some foreign power, but the Clinton campaign and Obama administrations as well. Between the dossier, fusion gps, crowdstrike, obama spying and unmasking, dnc collusion, Ukrainian collusion, russian collusion, refusing fbi and dhs access to dnc servers, none of it points very hard to Trump and very much so at Hillary Clinton.</p>',

            My suspicion is that the Awan Brothers and a few related associates are protected by forces way above the DNC. But the fact that their exposure occurred at all gives me hope that there may be no way to get this cat back in the bag.
           </p>
           <p>
            Years ago, I recall a report from some DC media source that all high level WH staff and other agency staff were required to use Blackberry because it was the only "secure platform." I chuckled at the thought. I believe the Awan Brothers have been reported to be the source of some Blackberry devices as part of their IT roles. My first thought is, no way are these guys running a counter backdoor phone op. They must be tied in with the larger op, helping to distribute and manage devices.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, a small group conspiracy with the likes of Shultz and Clinton or a connection to the grand protection racquet, I'd love to see this thing fully exposed.

            DWS is so caught up in this, she can't get out even if she wants to. The Clintons have the goods on her. She is trapped.  I hope she gets caught and it all unravels.  I suspected that Whisenant was looking into visas but did not know how the visas figured in, maybe DWS was helping bring in all those that would be doing dirty work in this whole mess.  Doctors and nurses even from foreign countries to do the transplants, and people like the Awans.  Who knows?  This is such a rabbit hole and so very entwined it may never be found, but that is their plan.  It is all such a big mess.  I still think JP was involved with SR in some way.   It's a cast of thousands.

            It's gonna be pretty cool for you to go watch George Webb's YouTube videos and hear him say all of the stuff you said ... But he said it all before anyone knew who Awan was and your Whisenant guesswork is right in-line with what George's sources told him.

             Oh, please! He repeated what pizzagate investigators on reddit,4chan, Voat, and other sites were saying. Stop trying to resuscitate a f*cking idiot that actually phoned in false information and has spewed nothing, but disinformation except for the info he repeated like a parrot and then took credit for. I'm so sick of people shilling for this guy. Is he that desperate for validation that he has to have people come here and shill for him? Evidently. Pathetic.
