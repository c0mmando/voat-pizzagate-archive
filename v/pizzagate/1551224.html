After this hoax was tweeted, Twitter suspended the unverified account <a href="https://voat.co/user/RudolphGiuliani">@RudolphGiuliani</a>. 
The last two tweets on the archive page were from <a href="https://voat.co/user/corbett3000">@corbett3000</a>, posted in 2007. One was a friend asking <a href="https://voat.co/user/corbett3000">@corbett3000</a> why RudolphGiuliani was following <a href="https://voat.co/user/corbett3000">@corbett3000</a> on Twitter. Then <a href="https://voat.co/user/corbett3000">@corbett3000</a> replied that <a href="https://voat.co/user/RudolphGiuliani">@RudolphGiuliani</a> was his own account. Someone has now deleted these 2007 Tweets from this archive. Unfortunately, I did not make a copy of them in time, but later in this discussion, you’ll see that <a href="https://voat.co/user/corbett3000">@corbett3000</a> owned up to creating the <a href="https://voat.co/user/RudolphGiuliani">@RudolphGiuliani</a> account.</p>
<p>Here is the current link to the suspended Twitter account <a href="https://voat.co/user/RudolphGiuliani">@RudolphGiuliani</a>, from which at least the last two tweets (the ones from 2007) have been deleted:

<p>A commenter called Save the Kids and Animals responded to my comment: 
I went to this guy\'s Twitter acct. He is the owner/CEO of a D.C. firm that does tech. work for big businesses. He admitted to creating that acct for Giuliani, and said he tried giving it to him, but that Rudy never took it. He also said he didn\'t write those things, and that Twitter must have taken over the acct. He claims he doesn\'t \'do\' Politics, but has a history of doing work with/for politicians and Gov\'t agencies, including the White House, and posts a lot of political stories on his personal Twitter. He has received several awards for his work; one of them was in 2010 for young, successful business ppl in Washington. Guess who else received the same award that night? James Alefantis (owner of Comet Ping Pong)! He also does segments on CNN, GMA about things going on in the tech world. So, if nothing else, he seems to run in the same circles as Hillary\'s crowd.

            Oh wow, I was one of the first ones to post that tweet on Voat, I was super bummed I didn't research it more before posting it. 
It was on a thread on 4chan and thought it was legit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even after posting it, I thought that it still had weight even though it was clearly fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe what they were trying to do with this is discredit it, not with misinformation, but with the clearly fake accounts.
           </p>
           <p>
            So people will associate pizzagate with fake accounts which would equal pizzagate is fake, because people are dumb.

             It was obvious from the tweets that it was fake, to anybody familiar with Giuliani who used common sense.  This was embarrassing and it's sad how many people fell for it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks, OP, for laying out what you have, here.  I'll add that the pattern of tweets over the months was suspicious, the language (talking about "the Lord"... LOL!) was clearly not from Giuliani, and the lack of verification of the account was yet another red flag.  On top of that, just think about it: why would the only outlet for this bombshell change of heart and sudden whistleblowing be one unverified Twitter account?  Giuliani can get messages to the world in any number of ways.
            </p>

             This should never have fooled anybody.  Disinfo -- and, thus, misinfo -- is inevitable, so be watching for it.

             I'm not saying that, because the source of the connection between them was just another commenter on that video, who said that he'd also had a Twitter conversation with Mr Corbett, suggesting that there was a good chance that they knew each other. So, I'm not making allegations. Rather, I'm just noting this interesting coincidence that may or may not tie them together and that the Tweet may have been some sort of attempt at a red herring to make the whole legitimate investigation look silly and discredited.

              There are about 675K people who live in DC. There are about 750K Gov jobs in DC so we can assume that the number of people puttering around DC on a weekday is about 1 million people. We go around this and always get back to the same group of people. Which is not insignificant statistically. The coincidences are plentiful. The awards are also a means for the establishment to create a connection with young people (create a "if it wasn't for us" situation), start to supervise their careers and groom them for future positions. So who gets awards is important.
