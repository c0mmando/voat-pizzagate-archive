<p>&quot;Yesterday\'s sentencing of Vinson, 29, of Williamson, W.Va., culminated a two-year investigation of the prostitution ring by the U.S. Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service and District police. &quot;</p>
<p>This was the call boy ring (known as  Man-to-Man,&quot; &quot;Jovan&quot; and &quot;Dreamboys.&quot; ) that supplied high echelon Washington insiders with male hookers , Among the high roller customers was Craig J. Spence who was involved in those midnight Reagan WhiteHouse sex romps in the West Wing with male prostitutes. Spence ran around with a 15 y.o. he introduced as his &quot;son&quot; but who was a male hooker.</p>
<p>&quot;Others said Mr. Spence used &quot;Reggie&quot; to arrange other White House tours, including one that Mr. Spence took with a 15-year-old boy, whom he identified as his son Will. 
That tour, according to former friends and associates of Mr. Spence, occurred June 29, 1988. The &quot;son&quot; had a Southern accent and was actually a male prostitute who provided sexual services for Mr. Spence and several male friends. &quot;</p>
<p>At his sentencing, Vinson told the judge that &quot;my behavior has certainly not been very complimentary. I\'m sorry if I did hurt society.&quot; Vinson\'s lawyer, Greta Van Susterne, said the judge\'s decision would dampen efforts by prosecutors to gain cooperation from defendants. &quot;You\'d have to be crazy to cooperate when the whole point of such cooperation is to get something in return.&quot;  Yes, that Greta Van Susterne.</p>
<p>(Currently besides being on Voice of America she has founded a Haitian orphanage: In 2012, an orphanage and school opened in Haiti called The Greta Home and Academy, which Greta and her husband helped found alongside Samaritan\'s Purse. She and her husband are Scientologists but apparently Billy Graham\'s sons who run the Samaritan Purse don\'t care.)</p>
<p>&quot;In an apparent contradiction, Mr. Strasser sought a waiver from federal guidelines but in a separate sentencing memorandum called for a harsh sentence because the prostitution ring was cavalier about the spread of the AIDS virus.&quot; When Spence was found a suicide in a Boston hotel room in 1989, AZT bottles were in the room.</p>
<p>Post prison, in 2015 Vinson wrote a book &quot;Confessions of a DC Madam&quot;. He\'s also &quot; a newly-minted lawyer and intends to leverage his considerable communication skills to benefit his clients.&quot; </p>
<p>Too bad some of those teen male hookers that came down with AIDS aren\'t around to write money making exposes and attend law school.</p>

            Are you sure Henry Vinson was involved in providing children? He denies it and claims that his escorts were all adults who could consent. It is, of course, possible that he's lied to make himself look better. But Craig Spence was willing to provide his party guests with any prostitute they wanted -- man, woman, boy, or girl -- and he certainly had other sources of prostitutes (including Larry King). Maybe Vinson only supplied adult male prostitutes and Spence got children from elsewhere, such as King's network.

             Craig Spence is dead. Vinson is alive and possibly revising history. Police found credit card history showing Spence paid Vinson's callboy ring not the other way around. The police were focused among other things in their investigation of Vinson's multiple call boy rings on child sex abuse. Given Vinson's later record of losing his coroner job by harassing his competition and allegedly marrying/ consorting with a doctor who ran a West Virginia opioid pill mill, I don't know how much credibility he has now even with his lawyer license. The prosecuting atty went on record as criticizing the Vinson callboy ring as callous toward the spread of HIV to its customers. Maybe Vinson was ethical in some areas and not in others?

             But you're correct. I should revise the title of my story to "Alleged" Child Pimp.

              As good as I am with most languages, I never considered that. The reason is because I am Native American, and was always taught to hate the Spanish by our history. They did defeat the cannibal cults of Mexico, so I have some respect for the conquistadors. I still can't stand the language though. I look at them like they are, (1) invading tribes, (2) trying to take over. Very non apologetic peoples, and when they are around us Natives they pretend to be like us.

                Depends on tribe, and persons within the tribes. This is well outside the scope of what we are all here for, so I will give you a quick personal summary, for free.  There is no such thing as a white race. Fact. There is no such thing as a black race. Fact. If us primitive First Nation folk can figure this out on our own, why can't others? The answer to your question is you know nothing about history books or your own lineage. Everyone has one, you know.

                  I apologize. It sounded like you were calling me racist, which I am to a certain degree, and have no problem with being so, but it would be wrong for me to hate a large group of people like that, especially since many Seminoles, and Apaches escaped to Mexico. There are also many tribes in Mexico that do not like each other so much. Distaste is not hatred. History is obviously a touchy subject with me.

                   I'm sorry if that is what you thought. It is not what I was intending to do. I live around a lot of Paiute people and I have been told conflicting things from them. I knew of one family who rejected a child within their family because her father was white but we're accepting of the child with a Mexican father. Other people have said the exact opposite. Maybe it's just a personal/individual issue and not a reflection of specific tribes in general. I was just curious. Thank you for clearing that up.

             John DeCamp's bio is very suggestive. He's from Nebraska, goes to Vietnam, organizes in 1975  Operation Baby Lift, which evacuated 2,800 orphaned Vietnamese children.[2] He was later assigned to serve as an aide to former CIA director William Colby, who was Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam at the time. Beginning his campaign for election while still stationed in Vietnam, DeCamp was elected and served four terms as a Nebraska state senator, from 1971 to 1987. This guy had connections and sponsors. Where did those babies end up at? I've read some articles that say Spence ran the call boy ring and other articles that say credit card slips showed he paid the Vinson led ring 20K/mo. Vinson is certainly not hiding his past , it's on his online bio . If Vinson climbs higher job wise in spite of his past, it would seem he has sponsors as powerful as DeCamp had.

              It is, however I personally don't get the feeling DeCamp was evil.  But I totally get where you're coming from.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just came across this interview with John DeCamp and listened to it.  It's good, and it made me sad at the end:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S9z2Tx__hA">
               John Decamp and William Colby: Talk will get you killed
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              3:55:  John DeCamp describes Bill Colby as someone who, having been closely involved in the creation of secret systems/secret "governments" to operate the Cold War, wants to also be involved in the correction of such systems.
             </p>
             <p>
              I sometimes wonder if there is/was a real head of the CIA, and the public head of the CIA.  Not that some public heads have not been all-out evil.  But as in the so-called hidden "black Pope," and then there's the pope that we see.  But maybe that is common knowledge, I don't know.

             Maybe John DeCamp didn't know about Vinson, as he was concentrating more on events surrounding Omaha - just a guess. Perhaps you are aware that Vinson was interviewed by Nick Bryant for his Franklin Scandal book, and had some interesting things to say about Larry King.

              I not only didn't know that about Nick Bryant, but I also just found out Bryant co-wrote Vinson's book, Confessions of a DC Madam --  The Politics of Sex, Lies, and Blackmail, and they have been on radio shows together.  I had no idea - Lots to read and listen to.

               Nick Bryant has delved very deeply into this subject, and generally only writes or speaks about things he can firmly verify are factual. However, there are some things he has been unwilling to mention. In his book, The Franklin Scandal, he refers to someone who can only be Michael Aquino, but doesn't want to mention his name. He calls him a "high-ranking military officer" or an "intelligence officer", I think. He also refers to someone he calls a "conspiracy theorist", who sounds a lot like Ted Gunderson, and says he thinks this man is insane. He seems to accept the official lone-gunman story of the JFK assassination.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't want to tarnish Nick Bryant's name, as he has done courageous and important work, but he seems so afraid of being lumped in with the Alex Jones crowd, and his work not being taken seriously by the mainstream public, that he sometimes leaves things out which are actually quite important.

                I recently discovered there's a preview of Bryant's book The Franklin Scandal (which I need to order a hard copy of, it's great,) and in the preview I noticed his cautiousness, that you mentioned, against being seen as a conspiracy nut.  One example is that in the Prologue, he wrote that when he interviewed John DeCamp he was impressed that DeCamp didn't "voice crazed conjectures" when he couldn't provide an answer to one of Bryant's questions.  I wonder if Nick Bryant has to be like that, to remain safe.  I mention that because from personal experience, my relatives become verbally and emotionally aggressive toward me if I mention anything cabal related, even a television show!  It's like they're fishing for something to use against me, to say I "believe in something" that's not proven yet.   And forget it for me asking questions of any of them regarding the "forgotten" half of my life, as they have been legally and financially aggressive to a pretty dangerous degree towards me when I have.  Don't know if he might have nasty relatives like that.
               </p>
               <p>
                Regarding Michael Aquino - I read on here somewhere that some PG'ers were experiencing "unseen attacks," I think while awake and asleep, after mentioning him on here.  I remember reading a comment from one of those people, who I remembered as someone we have seen on here a lot, stating they previously didn't believe in that.  So it might be wise of NB?  Also, for the record, MA did me a good turn one day when I was a child.  I'm just saying.  This is even though he was well aware I was a believer in Jesus.   It was a series of events, where he helped me out in many ways one day.  I'm not sure why he respected me enough to help me, but I am grateful.  What he told me helped keep me whole so I did not get DID, and he told me an easy trick to protect my psyche when my sister would try to retraumatize me over a past MK Ultra event I suffered, via the words and actions of a particular children's game. I'm not going to say what he told me, as I'm not an expert in that field, and I don't want to give out advice for anything.  I did post this story once in comments (it's since deleted,) with some of his advice.  Someone at the end asked if I was "still in contact with these people...," and although it's pretty hard to hurt my feelings, and they didn't mean anything by it, it hurt my feelings!   Because I am a Pedogate researcher, and just because MA was very kind to me one day, that does not mean I know him in regular life.  Just in emerged memories, and just on that day.

              Thank you I was just about to check if Nick Bryant included him.  I did not know that; for some reason I've never read either book, clearly I need to.  But strangely, although DeCamp mentioned and depicted the headline from the famous WT article,
              <a href="http://www.voxfux.com/features/bush_child_sex_coverup/WashingtonTimes.htm">
               http://www.voxfux.com/features/bush_child_sex_coverup/WashingtonTimes.htm
              </a>
              , he didn't mention Vinson who was named in it pretty importantly.  My guess is DeCamp was only allowed to disclose some things, in part maybe, in order that he and his loved ones would remain safe.

               Thanks for posting that - I'd seen the headline but had never read the whole article. DeCamp must have been aware of Vinson, but why he never mentioned him is a mystery.

            , could you possibly embed the links in the text they support so we know what comes from where? Or at least put them in-line with the text if you don't want to embed? Lumping them all at the end makes things harder to match up. This is especially important for research that is difficult for people to swallow. It's much harder-hitting when you cite the source for each point as you make it.

             I used to follow quotes with source citations, then people would criticize the article as too wieldy. I think you're correct and I'm going back to that technique in the future. The voxfux article is a compilation of 19 newspaper articles and my comments are a summary of them. Some of the readers want a predigested summary and are turned off by too much info and others want a roadmap. Can't please em all.

            <strong>
             mortician
            </strong>

             business partners with Larry King.

             "When Larry entertained, it was a hot ticket," said a public 
relations man King hired, quoted by Rick Hornung and Michael 
Casey, in the February 28, 1989 Village Voice. "Virtually every 
high-ranking black member of the Reagan Administration had 
been out to lunch, over for drinks, or at a dinner party. The food and drink were first rate, as was the mix of people- 
black, white, Republican, Democrat, young, old."
             <strong>
              For King, 
the emphasis was on the young.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             King acquired contacts in Washington's homosexual prostitution scene, one of whom was the late
             <strong>
              Craig Spence.
             </strong>

             <strong>
              A lobbyist 
and political operative, Spence maintained a call boy ring that 
catered to the political elite and,
             </strong>
             <strong>
              <em>
               unlike most D.C. call boy 
rings, offered children to its clients.
              </em>
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Spence's activities made banner headlines in the Washington 
Times on June 29, 1989: "Homosexual prostitution inquiry 
ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush." Spence's access was so 
good, that he could arrange nighttime tours of the White House 
for his clients. The Times added on August 9, 1989, that Spence 
"hinted the tours were arranged by 'top level' persons, including 
Donald Gregg, national security advisor to Vice President Bush . 
..." Spence, according to friends, was also carrying out homo- 
sexual blackmail operations for the CIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to a Washington, D.C. investigative journalist 
who researched the Spence ring,
             <strong>
              "The way we discovered Larry 
King and this Nebraska-based call boy ring, was by looking 
through the credit card chits of Spence's ring, where we found 
King's name."
             </strong>
             Another investigator, with personal knowledge 
of the call-boy rings operating in Washington, put it this way: 
*
             <strong>
              King and Craig Spence were business partners.
             </strong>
             Look 
at two companies, 'Dream Boys' and 'Man to Man', both of 
which operated under another service, 'Bodies by God.' "

              I don't know who Jimmy Mako is, I have a lot of reading to do, but maybe Vinson and Chambers were never convicted of sexual-related crimes, maybe it was racketeering or something?  And as for the "people search" sites, I think people can just opt out of them.

                HS 264 – Confessions of a D.C. Madam with Henry Vinson
               </strong>

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Excerpt:
              </p>
              <p>
               Henry Vinson was slapped with a 43-count RICO indictment and was dubbed by the Washington press as the ‘D.C. Madam’. Henry served five years in prison and has recently released the book Confessions of a D.C. Madam – The Politics of Sex, Lies, and Blackmail.
              </p>
              <p>
               Henry:
I was consistently pressured by D.C. power brokers to provide child prostitutes to their power broker cronies, but I refused to have anything to do with child prostitution and the federal government was aware of this fact.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jason [Hartman]:
I’m curious, what ages did these people ask for? That’s disgusting. What ages? I mean, they specifically requested that from you, huh?
              </p>
              <p>
               Henry:
They specifically requested it and Nick Bryant has written a book, The Franklin Scandal, which goes into great detail. He spent many years researching that and there were very young children 10, 12-years-old and many, many lives were destroyed with Lawrence King and Craig Spence. Craig Spence ran his own underage escort service, if you will.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jason:
Wow. Unbelievable. Okay, so any of the more sinister things you were exposed to. So you talked about, was there more there? I kind of interrupted you, sorry. I want to make sure you finish.
              </p>
              <p>
               Henry:
That’s fine. The federal government is always saying with the interstate child prostitution, the federal government was aware of this fact, because I told my government (#20:04?) about an interstate pedophile network that was providing D.C. politicians and power brokers with children, but the Department of Justice and Secret Service and FBI, they covered up that pedophile network, so I think that was the worst thing I was exposed to.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jason:
Yeah, yeah. Wow. It sure is. It sure is. How do you know they covered it up though? How did you know they didn’t investigate it and try and stop it?
              </p>
              <p>
               Henry:
Well, The Franklin Scandal, which Nick Bryant has written that book. It’s still not out. It’s pretty much ignored by the mainstream media and there’s grand jury testimonies. There’s many, many – Nick put many years into that book. So, there’s lots of overwhelming evidence and has collaborated by many sources in the media. That, that did occur.

               Vinson didn't get convicted on child sex charges because the prosecution downplayed the ages of the call "boys". Vinson appears to be distancing himself from child prostitution yet Craig Spence ran around with a 15y.o. call boy and Craig Spence was a Vinson customer. Not smoking gun proof but suggestive.
From the Hartman interview: "Henry: Sure. I ran the largest gay escort service that’s ever been exposed in Washington, D.C. and my ultimate downfall was precipitated by the fact that I provided escorts to a CIA asset named Craig Spence. He used my escorts to blackmail politicians and other power brokers and I ultimately became the fall guy for a sprawling conspiracy whose coverup was engineered at the pinnacle of the Bush one administration."https://www  .holistic   survival.com/hs264/
"Henry: Well, Craig Spence wasn’t my downfall, but again, Craig Spence was a D.C. power broker and a CIA asset and his house was bugged for audio/visual blackmail and he did mastermind my downfall, but the very fact that I became in mess with Spence ultimately lead to my downfall. I was pretty to Spence’s blackmail enterprise, his collusion with the Secret Service and also his pandering of child to his power broker cronies" " Spence pressured me to provide him with child prostitutes, but I refused to pander children and after Spence pressured me a number of times to provide him with children, I decided to quit dealing with him"
Page 74) Vinson started being a gay pimp, really a broker for male sex workers in 1986. By 1987 he had so many customers that he had a T-1 line installed. He bought up all the Yellow page ads for gay prostitutes and was getting 100 per day, mostly at nighttime. Page 75) Sometimes Vinson would be brokering 20 gay prostitutes per night. Page 198) Henry Vinson says that “a number of media superstars” who used his gay escort service are still around today and thriving in their professions.
               <a href="https://www">
                https://www
               </a>
               .amazon.  com/Confessions-D-C-Madam-Politics-Blackmail/dp/1937584291
So Vinson, himself gay, had a lot of customers, some that liked young boys, but he never provided that service(he says) even though Bill Casey of the CIA was allegedly a customer of Vinson's. How do you say no to Bill Casey if he wants underage kids for sex? . Spence paid call boy rings to provide him with male hookers and Vinson says Spence, himself, provided children for sex in order to blackmail others.Why was Casey, per Vinson, a customer when he could have gone to Spence for his "business"? Doesn't add up.
In the interview, Vinson harps on the harmful use of sexual blackmail. He never produced a list of customers. If he climbs to higher heights in this world it's because he has something on powerful people and in this day and age, it's not hiring homosexual hookers.

                You are correct.  It does not add up.
               </p>
               <p>
                But if you read my hard to believe comments in this thread, you might understand I have one possibility to offer, probably too farfetched for most to understand, in which Henry Vinson may be both "in a way" telling the truth, and lying at the same time.  I mentioned in my other comment I remember talking to him, he was an informant blah blah blah, I don't remember all the details about him or from that day, except that he was nice and very calm.  (I don't try very hard at remembering, maybe I should.)  I was a child then, used not only for blackmail by good and bad groups, but also in espionage, and "sexual espionage," although to be honest I don't know how that works, in my conscious memory.  What I'm saying is, maybe I was one of the children Vinson "sold"?  I am against pedophilia as much as those most against it in this world.  But please don't feel sorry for me as a.)  I had a "bodyguard" for things like this, and was never vaginally raped.  The sexual abuse I suffered was not like Cathy O'Brien's or Brice Taylor's, I'm lucky. I was a virgin until I chose not be as a young adult, never having had any memories of molestation, I still don't, although I know what happened in any instance if I want to remember.  I think TPTB test children to see what they want the child's role to be as their MK slave, and I have a feeling that the tests may have revealed that if I was treated the way CO and BT were, I'd have lost my mind.  Those women are much stronger than me, and I am strong.  Also I must have provided more value sane than insane.  And b.)  there was an alleged good group that I did things for, and hopefully this will all come out one day.  So, there are a lot of ifs in there, but it is potentially the case that Vinson (only) "sold" protected, yet still victimized, children, like me, when I was "working" for "the good guys."  I'm obviously against what happened to the in some ways "protected" children and teens like me, and at the same time, happy if we had a small role in getting this to stop one day, forever.  I'm not sure if any of that made sense.

                 Vinson himself may have been manipulated at a young age. He's very good at public relations, though. He lost his job as Mingo County coroner because he made harassing threatening phone calls to another mortician. He let HIV infected prostitutes spread the disease to their johns . "Mr. Strasser sought a waiver from federal guidelines but in a separate sentencing memorandum called for a harsh sentence because the prostitution ring was cavalier about the spread of the AIDS virus".http://www.voxfux.com/features/bush_child_sex_coverup/article_archive.htm#article8

             Did some more digging on Dr Diane E Shafer. She did some "overbilling" in 1993, convicted, conviction overturned. Then in 2010 she's running a West Virginia pill mill, the lines are snaking out the door.
            </p>
            <p>
             " Shafer had issued 188,445 controlled substance prescriptions since December 2002, including at least 17,065 in 2009, Lafferty’s affidavit said. He also cited evidence suggesting she saw nearly as many patients daily as the Mountain Medical clinic."
 FBI found stacks of $100 bills in her house and in her bank holdings. She plea bargained to one count, got 6 months. She's back in 2016 petitioning to get her WV medical license back but was turned down.
            </p>
            <p>
             In between court dates she got her mortician license. You've got to wonder about unethical morticians that have access to body parts.

              One of the scariest sentences I've ever read.  She gives me a bad feeling.  It just popped in my head that I hope people are actually dead when she works with them.

               Yes.  I hadn't thought of it that way.

               This is anecdotal:

               For what it's worth, he might not be on the side of evil.  I remember he was an informant, for a good (undercover, so to speak) IC group.  I can't prove that.  But for years lately I keep remembering a dark haired mortician/funeral director talking to me and at least one other person involved in helping this alleged good secret group.  It was Henry Vinson, I now realize, although the hair color does not fit as he currently has strawberry blonde hair.   But I do remember my hair was sometimes dyed black when I was a little girl, in the '60's and '70's, for things my evil parents sent me away for/had me do -- and that the alleged "good group," which my parents had no knowledge of, also had me wear wigs and other disguises.  So who knows, regarding his hair color.  And while my gut instinct is it's time now to mention, anecdotally, informants by name, -- intellectually of course I am hesitant to do that, but I have a feeling it's meant to be, to demoralize the pedophiles.

                 Thanks, and I appreciate you letting me know you echo my intuition about naming a few names now and then. You probably never saw my story.  There's no thread, it's too long for that/I don't feel comfortable making it just that length.  I add comments now and then, often "late comments" hardly anyone sees.  I later deleted them all, but recently, added a few more, that are still up.  I will link them, here, but I'm a little concerned that out of the context of the thread I placed them in, they may sound ....really outrageous....  so here are the links to the threads, but my comments are easy to find:

                <p>
                 I don't have any names to name for this one, below, but the man who was with me in the corridor and on the sidewalk in the "tunnel," who I entered the room with, was in this alleged crossover "good group."  As I recall, he did the filming of that sacrifice.  Little did the murderers and rapists, and cannibals, know that they were being filmed by one group, and little does that group all know copies were made.

                 (Side note:  I don't see how people back then didn't know that everything like this was wired for film and for sound, but I don't think they did.)

Ive deleted stuff just like you 🙂 it’s like the pieces are so scattered and hidden. I think there is only so much we can handle and if we knew it all at once , one might go insane .

                   I'm so happy you're alive to see them fall too!  I bet people benefited greatly from reading your info before you deleted it.  And yes, there is only so much we can handle finding out at once, whether it's everything that happens in the world about Pedogate, or what happened to us individually, or to another person.  I agree, for individuals, forgetting is often protection.

             The Washington Post Article says the police investigation was focused among other things on "abduction and use of minors for sexual perversion". Vinson's rings videotaped the acts and "charged" the clients for the tapes : blackmail. And he has an Ohio license to practice law!
