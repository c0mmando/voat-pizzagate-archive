<p><strong>Background of the documentary:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] <strong>“What Haunts Us”</strong> by Porter-Gaud alumna Paige Goldberg Tolmach....recalls the saga of <strong>Eddie Fischer,</strong> who taught at the school for eleven years in the 1970s and early 1980s.  During that time, Fischer molested at least 20 young boys – <strong>actions which officials at Porter-Gaud apparently knew about even as they were assisting him in his efforts to find jobs at other schools (where he molested additional victims).</strong></p>
<p>One of the administrators who helped Fischer – former Porter-Gaud principal <strong>James Bishop Alexander</strong> – killed himself just days before he was scheduled to be deposed   <a href="http://archive.fo/TL6no#selection-757.55-777.115">source</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.whathauntsusfilm.com/"><strong>What Haunts Us</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>The 1979 class of Porter Gaud School in Charleston, South Carolina graduated 49 boys. Within the last 35 years, six of them have died by suicide.</strong> When Paige Goldberg Tolmach gets word that another former student from her beloved high school has killed himself, she decides to take a deep dive into her past in order to uncover the surprising truth and finally release the ghosts that haunt her hometown to this day.</p>

<p><strong>Some things that also stood out to me:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.fo/ibisI"><strong>Secret Shame: Claims of Sex Abuse Involve Elite School (1998)</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fischer <a href="http://archive.fo/ibisI#selection-1201.91-1219.19">photographed his victims, these boys of rich and powerful families,</a> <strong>and they have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about.  They were preyed upon.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fischer sometimes told boys <a href="http://archive.fo/ibisI#selection-1491.0-1535.35">he could get them sex with older women who would pay them.</a>  I can’t help wondering if it was really just a pretense, or did he traffic victims to women and men?   <strong>If so, I hope the Porter-Gaud victims speak out to a trusted person, and know that they should only feel bad if they, of their own free will as an adult, lured a minor to be sex trafficked, otherwise, there’s nothing to feel bad about!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both <a href="http://archive.fo/ibisI#selection-905.0-911.55">Eddie Fischer</a> and principal Major <a href="http://archive.fo/ibisI#selection-209.82-221.40">J. Bishop Alexander</a> graduated from <strong>The Citadel, the military college in Charleston.</strong>  More on The Citadel <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2641771">here.</a>  Beginning at 26:15 in the film:  Fischer and Alexander apparently were in the same class at The Citadel.  Fischer volunteered with the Porter-Gaud football team for 1-2 years before Alexander offered him a paid job at Porter-Gaud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Another former student of the prestigious Porter-Gaud preparatory school in Charleston, South Carolina has committed suicide.</strong></p>
<p>….21-year-old Brennan Roye Bennett of Charleston, S.C. died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound </p>
<p>Bennett also posted a lengthy suicide note to his Facebook page….on Monday as he sat in his car on the campus of Rollins College in Winter Park – a resort community located a few miles northeast of Orlando.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Someone please contact Rollins or call an ambulance or police to remove my body,” the young baseball player wrote.  “I don’t want my family to find me like this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bennett also warned those coming to the scene that “the gun will still be loaded so please be careful.”</p>
<p>In his note, Bennett apologizes to his family, including his father – wealthy Charleston, S.C. businessman Michael Bennett.</p>
<p>Brennan Bennett’s note also references his friendship with Shriver Soliday, a Porter-Gaud student who committed suicide in July of 2014.</p>
<p>Soliday’s death is one of several recent Porter-Gaud suicides that this news site has been investigating over the course of the last few months.</p>

           <p>
            <strong>
             Another former student of the prestigious Porter-Gaud preparatory school in Charleston, South Carolina has committed suicide.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            ….21-year-old Brennan Roye Bennett of Charleston, S.C. died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound
           </p>
           <p>
            Bennett also posted a lengthy suicide note to his Facebook page….on Monday as he sat in his car on the campus of Rollins College in Winter Park – a resort community located a few miles northeast of Orlando.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “Someone please contact Rollins or call an ambulance or police to remove my body,” the young baseball player wrote.  “I don’t want my family to find me like this.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Bennett also warned those coming to the scene that “the gun will still be loaded so please be careful.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In his note, Bennett apologizes to his family, including his father – wealthy Charleston, S.C. businessman Michael Bennett.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brennan Bennett’s note also references his friendship with Shriver Soliday, a Porter-Gaud student who committed suicide in July of 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            Soliday’s death is one of several recent Porter-Gaud suicides that this news site has been investigating over the course of the last few months.

              Porter-Gaud Trial: A witness testifies that he was molested by James B. Alexander, the longtime principal who committed suicide in 1998.
             </strong>
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Despite the abuse, [William] Baker said that he was torn. Alexander was a mentor, "a substitute father figure," and the sex, which continued into his adulthood, "was the penalty I had to pay to keep him as my father."
            </p>
            <p>
             Baker's testimony was one of several revelations in the trial's second day. Other witnesses included a victim of pedophile Eddie Fischer who said Alexander was at Fischer's home on a night when he was molested.

              Pedophilia is a direct result of the merchants who run the show ..having to blackmail politicians and media personalities ..to get the public to spend more debt into existence ..and because they do not settle the debt at the treasury ..they have to pass more and more draconian laws...to tackle the inflatiin from that debt...it is no suprise that hillary clinton and satanists who know the banking system ...passed the three strikes and ure out to incrrase prison populace ..for controlling wage inflation and spending...at the same time providing jobs and contracts for fed debt funding of private corporation prison contracts..

             Quite interesting info on the Angel Oak. The Southern live oaks were also planted for their use in shipbuilding. Some of the old Charleston families had native Welsh heritage. They were a conquered people group and did not always fit in with the English, even though they were citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
             HERE'S A GOOD ARTICLE ON THE WELSH DRUIDS: It ties everything together:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Earliest mention of Druids comes during the 1st century BC, referring to druidae in Gaul (France) and Britain, who were wise men, observers of natural phenomena and moral philosophers. Similar to the druids were the bards (bardoi) - singers and poets, and diviners (vates), who interpreted sacrifices in order to foretell the future."
            </p>
            <p>
             "A druidic ceremony described by Pliny, in his Natural History, describes, a white robed druid climbing an oak tree to cut down mistletoe with a golden sickle."
            </p>
            <p>
             "A revival of interest in druids began during the Renaissance (14th to 16th-centuries), when translations of Classical Greek and Roman texts became widely available. A number of sources describe the druids as performing human sacrifice. Places of worship were described as isolated wooded groves and near sacred pools and lakes. According to one source, the druidic groves on Mona (Anglesey) had the blood of prisoners drenched upon their altars."

            I remember us researching Hillary's dad's and her ties to the mob.  Her dad was tied to Capone and that is how they have the same rat lines. He knew and used the ratlines himself.   If it ain't broke don't fix it.  How do you think they knew?  They have been tied to the Mob for decades, but Hillary was the connection to the Mob and Bill followed willingly.

              I read somewhere that he was a type of gofer for the Capone Outfit now called The Chicago Outfit.  So that means that he was everywhere, learning their ratline ops.  That's why Bill wanted to marry Hillary.  The money behind the mob and the ratlines.

               It's strange that you mention, "So that means that he was everywhere, learning their ratline ops."   I wasn't going to say anything.  But the place Hugh Rodham was posted at in Chicago during WWII,
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Station_Great_Lakes">
                Great Lakes Naval Station,
               </a>
               is somewhere I remember from the 1960's and/or '70's.
              </p>
              <p>
               My memory could be off, I hope it is, but I remember things from there I don't even want to talk about.  But I'll attempt to. 
 Teenage boys were kept imprisoned there.  John Wayne Gacy was not the person that people think he was.  He was controlled, in one way or the other.  He would be ordered to abduct boys, and they would be held at GLNS, and tortured, and trafficked.  Ultimately, they'd be sacrificed at an 'elite' snuff party.  I'm not going to go into why many boys ended up under houses, because it stretches believability, and I don't think people are ready for the good side of JWG yet (preserving evidence; and respect for the dead by buying the silence of the fast food restaurants owner who was supposed to take delivery of their flesh from John after a party, and mix it into hamburger meat at one or both of the owner's two hamburger restaurants; etc.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Carmencita you know, but for others who don't, JWG was my babysitter, (I was born in 1962, he was born in 1942, and was very close to my family but no one talks about it,) and while it was dangerous and terrifying when I was really young, he was very mean and abusive, he sort of "broke programming" around the mid 1960's.  So while he was still MK'd, he also hid evidence -- he changed.  I remember he and I were given the task of looking after the boys at GLNS, I think I was there around once a week.  John lived there, and he lived in many other places as well.  I recall he did not live in the "murder house" once it became such, (which was after his divorce,) and had bodies buried in it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway, this is why I do this, to echo

                @Podge512
               </a>
               , as -- although I have a lot of experiences and feel protective of everyone -- but also as

               mentioned, a lot of people on here "have a story to tell."  This is my story, I have got to do something, if I can, to help vulnerable teenage boys.   Even before I remembered my cabal-related forgotten half of my life, I chose a field to go into based on my potential to help teen boys from ending up in dangerous situations -- even though I never remembered back then knowing anyone like that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway, on a brighter note!  "These people are stupid" as Qanon would say.  They underestimated John, I, and two others.   While I personally don't remember where we hid the items we collected, but for a few fuzzy memories of glass jars and hiding places, I can intuit that somebody knows where all of it is.  We shall see.

               I almost forgot, Carm!  HRC's family knew JWG.  I remember being at someone's house when I was really young, it's not a bad memory.  My grandfather and dad were playing cards, I think pinochle, with Hillary's dad and one other man, at a little table in front of a kitchen/kitchenette.  There were sofas/seating in an L-shape facing the kitchenette.  Someone was holding me on the sofa on the left, and HRC was sitting on the other sofa/seating doing handiwork of some kind, maybe knitting, there was a coffee table in front of her, and she looked quietly amused by the men. (Amused is not the right word, but it's the best I can do.) JWG was in and out of the house.  This was in the 1960's.

                 He didn't kill them, I should have mentioned that.  I'm not saying John never killed anyone, he had a hair trigger insanity mode rage that could go off, which was different than an "alter" that (((they))) switched on in him for a task he would never do while in his real mind.  But, those "just there" insanity "modes" in his brain, were also MK'd into him, at some point, like in a laboratory setting.  I'm not an expert, this is just what I remember about him.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The teen boys I remember getting murdered at snuff film parties were killed by other, older adults, from what I remember.  It's like the older (older than him) adults would take turns.  A child, or other innocent person like me even if they were not a child or teen, who had the right kind of "energy manipulative" abilities in their DNA I guess, would be forced to, usually blindfolded so I/we couldn't see who was at the party, have their hand on a knife, with their hand covered over by the murderer's hand which would guide the blade.  One task John had that I remember was to deliver organs and other parts on ice, to wherever they were supposed to go (obvioulsy not always, if my memory is correct.)  One place he delivered them was to an apartment in Chicago where the couple who lived there would cook cannibal foods for the elite, and John would deliver those as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do not have memories of the last two people you mentioned.  But I have a little (not scary) flash memory of talking to Ted Bundy, and knowing that he was good, and caught up in a similar, if not the same, situation as I remember John in, and by the same "cult."

                I have to read this again at least twice to get it all into my head.  Jaw Dropping.  You never cease to Amaze Me.  WOW.  Maybe HRC was entranced.  Entranced by what the men were talking about while they were playing pinochle.  I have heard things here and there about GLNS through the years, stories you would tell around a campfire.  But I get really spooky abut stuff like that  Nothing definite just like Stay Away and stuff like that.  We knew someone in the Armed Forces and used to meet up at picnics and things. That's where I heard them.  I am no spring chicken and he was  older so I think he is gone now.   This stuff must have been going on way before you were there too.   I had forgotten about your JWG connection and now I am shocked to hear the HRC one too.  Holy Moly.

                 Thank you so much for telling me there are "Stay Away" stories about GLNS.  It never, ever, occurred to me that anyone else knew anything about it, despite that being illogical.  I'm usually the first one to say to others and myself, to put something in perspective, "If _______ happened to you/me/him/her, it's happened to a lot of people."   I've never even Googled GLNS.  If you remember any of the stories, please tell me!  I remember a dungeon.  Large cages that someone could stand up in.  Starvation.  Not me, the boys.

                  There were not any specific stories that I can remember.  We kind of pumped him, but he said that people would just tell him to Stay Away and he told us if any of us ever made it there, we should Stay Away too.  That's about it.  I have a feeling that those places, the military bases, are so secluded so that others would never know what exists.  That's why a lot of people think it is bunk.  But there are people, people like you that are living proof, thank God.  Yes, I can almost see her sitting there with her knitting or work, but being so taken in by their words.  The wheels were already turning, I am sure.    Your Welcome.

            I should mention my intention is not to put down Charleston in any way.  The film really touched my heart, and I want to help in any way I can. 
 My favorite show, of the few I watch occasionally, happens to be Southern Charm, filmed in Charleston.  (I like it all, especially Cameran's wardrobe, and Patricia's home and caftans....I'm just saying.)

             Charleston is an ancient city with a dark hidden past, but beautiful on the outside. Its first colonists' roots go back to Elizabeth l and the sugar barons of Barbados, some  who were early investors in the English East India Company.  Charleston was essentially their colony, supplying food and goods to the island because every square inch was planted in sugar cane, WHITE GOLD. The swampy waters of Charleston's coast proved ideal for growing rice. Some of Charleston's early fortunes were made from growing Carolina Gold rice. These were industrial scale plantations, and the beginnings of the triangle trade, using African enslaved workers and became the economic engine for Colonial America. History books tend to downplay this. South Carolina's "barons" were a very powerful force in the early economic and political history of America- more so than the Northern colonies at that time. Much of their early history was removed from history books after the Civil War. I believe Freemasonry was practiced there from the earliest times, many colonists being of Scottish and Anglo/Welsh descent. In  early Colonial South Carolina, the Church of England dominated.

             Hillary Clinton was one of the last to see Senator Pinckney (pastor) before the horrible prayer group massacre. He was on the powerful State Senate appropriations committee. He had recently helped pass a law requiring police to wear body cams, in response to an unarmed African American being shot by North Charleston police.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Pinckney won election to the South Carolina senate in 2000 at the age of 27, becoming the youngest African American to do so. He had previously been elected to the state’s House of Representatives at 23. Reports said he met Hillary Clinton earlier on Wednesday at a fundraising event in Charleston." Let me just point out that Pinckney was one of the early powerful colonial planter family name, and they were very involved in the American Revolution. After the Civil War, most of the former enslaved Africans were given the family names of their former enslavers.

            This is why I do this.  My brothers and I were altar boys when we were youngsters.  Years later, it emerged that the head altar boy ('boy' is a misnomer as he was in his 30s at the time) was a child molester who had abused some of the altar boys.  He was caught and convicted.  When he served his time, one of the conditions of his release was that he wasn't allowed to come back into our local area, but he did anyway.  He ran into one of his victims.  Seeing his abuser again was more than he could bear.  That kid took his own life shortly thereafter.  He was 19 years old.  I didn't really know him because he was a few years older than me, but a few years younger than my brothers, so we moved in different circles, but our parents knew his parents.  I keep thinking about that lad and about 'what if'?  What if it had been one of my brothers?  What if it had been me?

              It's why, in my darker moments, I think about what I'd like to do to the filth attempting to normalise this evil or those who contend that it does no real harm.  I think about hurting them badly, then let them look me in the eye and tell me I've done no real damage!

              The location of Charleston on the 33rd parallel
             </strong>
             made it the prime site of Isaac Long to establish the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, doing so ritually by first
             <strong>
              bringing a statue of Baphomet there.
             </strong>
             Following that, Albert Pike succeeded Long and moved there....considered to be the Mother Supreme Council of the world.
             <strong>
              The other two centers of this Rite lie in Rome and Berlin.
             </strong>
             ....Pike describes the God of Freemasonry as being Lucifer.
             <strong>
              The alternating dark energy nodes of Rome and Charleston will later prove significant.
             </strong>

            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Earlier than this, in 1780, the Knights Templar Commandery was established in Charleston in 1780.

             Retired professor of the Pontifical Biblical Institute, eminent theologian and former Jesuit priest, Father
             <strong>
              Malachi Martin
             </strong>
             was a close personal friend of Pope Paul VI and worked within the Vatican walls doing research on the Dead Sea Scrolls when he began to notice things were changing by the early 1980s.  He began speaking out....he had become increasingly candid about what he said was
             <strong>
              pedophilic Satanism among certain cardinals and other clergy
             </strong>
             in league with
             <strong>
              a secret Masonic diabolicus that began following the “enthronement of the fallen Archangel Lucifer” in the Roman catholic citadel on June 29, 1963.
             </strong>
             In his book The Keys Of This Blood, Martin wrote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “Most frighteningly for John Paul, he had come up against the irremovable presence of a malign strength in his own Vatican and in certain bishops’ chanceries. It was what knowledgeable Churchmen called the "Superforce." Rumors, always difficult to verify, tied its installation to the beginning of Pope Paul VI’s reign in 1963. Indeed Paul had alluded somberly to "the smoke of Satan which has entered the Sanctuary"…an oblique
              <strong>
               reference to an enthronement ceremony by Satanists in the Vatican.”
              </strong>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Martin had
             <strong>
              concealed greater detail of this Luciferic "enthronement ceremony by Satanists in the Vatican" in his novel, Windswept House:
             </strong>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “The Enthronement of the Fallen Archangel Lucifer was effected within the Roman Catholic Citadel on June 29, 1963;....As the principal agents of this Ceremonial well knew, Satanist tradition had long predicted that the Time of the Prince would be ushered in at the moment when a Pope would take the name of the Apostle Paul [Pope Paul VI]....
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Martin stated publicly on more than one occasion that
             <strong>
              the enthronement of Lucifer in Rome was based on fact, and that to facilitate the black magic, a parallel ceremony was conducted simultaneously in the United States in
             </strong>
             <strong>
              <em>
               Charleston, South Carolina.
              </em>
             </strong>
             The reason this location was selected has remained obscure to many, but given what Malachi said about the
             <strong>
              Masonic connection,
             </strong>
             it makes sense that South Carolina was chosen: It is the site of the first Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite Freemasonry in the United States, called "the Mother Lodge of the World"
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, Charleston, at the 33rd parallel, was perfect for such an event, according to the logic of
             <strong>
              former Sirhan Sirhan attorney, Day Williams, because, "If a life is taken close to the…33rd Parallel, this fits with the Masons’ demonic mythology in which they demonstrate their worldly power by spilling human blood at a predetermined locale."
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Martin provided additional reasoning for the South Carolina location.  Once again, from Windswept House:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “Such unobtrusive elements as the Pentagram and the black candles and the appropriate draperies could be part of the Ceremonial in Rome. But other Rubrics—the Bowl of Bones and the Ritual Din, for example, the sacrificial animals and the victim—would be too much.  There would have to be a Parallel Enthronement.
              <strong>
               A Concelebration could be accomplished with the same effect by the Brethren in an Authorized Targeting Chapel [which is in Charleston, South Carolina in the novel.]
              </strong>
              Provided all the participants in both locations "targeted" every element of the Event on the Roman Chapel, then the Event in its fullness would be accomplished specifically in the target area.  It would all be a matter of unanimity of hearts, identity of intention and perfect synchronization of words and actions
              <strong>
               between the Targeting Chapel and the Target Chapel.
              </strong>
              The living wills and the thinking minds of the Participants concentrated on the specific Aim of the Prince would transcend all distance.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Malachi Martin, after appearing regularly for some five years or more on the late-night, Art Bell radio show Coast to Coast AM, speaking of what he called the “perfect possession” of humanity which was ongoing, and what he thought “was coming this way” in the wake of the Hale Bopp comet and the Phoenix Lights, died an untimely and highly suspicious death in 1999.  His claims and theories remain both unproven, and extremely valid.  The Evil, he always said, is here.  Now.

             They have tried to muddy the waters on Malachi but it is true, that he was found with sticks (small wooden stakes) sticking out of his head.  Whenever you hear something heinous done by the RCC always think worse.

             "The first philosophical document of the Mother Supreme Council of the World was "Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry," written by Confederate General Albert Pike (Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite's Southern Jurisdiction; head of the Mother Supreme Council of the World) in 1872. A copy of Morals &amp; Dogma was given to every new member in the Southern Jurisdiction until 1974, when it was deemed "too advanced to be helpful to the new Scottish Rite member.""

             Titus Frost did a great video on this topic:
"In this video I take a public tour of the Free Masonic Scottish Rite Supreme HQ in Washington DC, a famous building for many public and esoteric reasons. I thoroughly debunk FreeMasonry as another pyramid scheme just like Scientology and other fake secret based religions. I go over Albert Pike's teachings as this entire Temple / Crypt is a basically a monument to him. "

             One of the biggest reasonss Eddie Fischer was able to get away with this for forty some odd years, is because of the very victims that he chose.  The majority of his victims are of the rich and powerful -- the movers and shakers in downtown Charleston, across every field:  medical, legal, political, business....
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a culture where you don't bring scandal on the family name, and the boys understood that.

            <p>
             I'm pretty confident the large majority of the victims in our town have never come forward in any way....they may not have even told their spouses about what happened to them.

             Very true. This also goes on in English boarding schools.

             Here is a Porter grad from the past with quite a genealogy. NOT inferring that anything happened to him, but just showing the history and connections some of these families had:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Born in Charleston, South Carolina, into one of the city's most prominent and wealthy families, with ancestors who were planters, with five who served as governors of the state, Maybank graduated from the Porter Military Academy, now the exclusive Porter-Gaud School. He earned a degree from the College of Charleston. He served in the United States Navy during World War I."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Maybank's sudden death two months before Election Day, threw open the 1954 Senate election in South Carolina. Strom Thurmond won as a write-in candidate against the nominee chosen by Democratic party leaders to replace Maybank."
            </p>
            <p>
             "He is one of only twenty people in United States history to have been elected mayor, governor, and United States senator."
