<p>In March of this year the news came out that 50  women were suing Salesforce <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/lawsuit-claims-salesforce-worked-with-sex-trafficking-site-backpage.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/lawsuit-claims-salesforce-worked-with-sex-trafficking-site-backpage.html</a></p>

<p>Because of the number 50, I think this is a psyop to actually remove the CIA\'s involvement and cover up the child trafficking... time will tell.. but I digress..</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In public, including on Twitter, Salesforce boasted about fighting human trafficking using its data tools. But behind closed doors, Salesforce\'s data tools were actually providing the backbone of Backpage\'s exponential growth. Salesforce didn\'t just provide Backpage with a customer-ready version of its data and marketing tools. Salesforce designed and implemented a heavily customized enterprise database tailored for Backpage\'s operations, both locally and internationally. With Salesforce\'s guidance, Backpage was able to use Salesforce\'s tools to market to new &quot;users&quot; — that is, pimps, johns, and traffickers — on three continents.&quot;</p>

             Salesforce, was founded by Oracle's Marc Benioff and started as a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) product for sales. Salesforce has since developed to capitalize on social networking and recently, the Salesforce organization has partnered with IBM/Watson to incorporate Artificial Intelligence into their product. Salesforce is known for its database and trend forecasting in easy-to-understand infographics. According to Wikipedia, Nancy Pelosi was an early investor in Salesforce.

            Surreal to see pizzagate bursting at the seems everywhere you look. Critical Mass, anons. They will no longer be able to contain it. All it takes is one juicy story that runs away from them to tip the scale and watch gravity do the work. I am enjoying this.

              Pizzagate is only a means to that end.  What do you think Qanon is for but pacifying the boomers that make our white majority.

              No, early on the board was flooded with generic trafficking submissions that had nothing to do with kids, so that was made very specific in the ruleset. We can, of course, change the ruleset if the community wants to, but it will mean we have to leave stuff up that is more general and possibly open the door to forum sliding.

              is saying about the suit actually referencing child prostitution via Backpage. My problem is, I don't understand what Salesforce is, or what it had to do with Backpage. This is one of those submissions that has so much incidental stuff attached to it, it was not easy to see how it satisfied Rule 1.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you could add a sentence at the beginning quoting where the lawsuit itself references the abuse of minors, that would be perfect. Think- found that in one of the links you already have.

Although I think we discussed Backpae and underage trafficking already numerous times, so imo the headline suffices to point out the

              Backpage was the leading online marketplace for commercial sex and sex trafficking.

              The National Association of Attorneys General aptly described Backpage as a “hub” of “human trafficking, especially the trafficking of minors.”

              ...Hedge-fund billionaire and environmental activist Tom Steyer, who could be called the next Al Gore, backs an anti-fossil fuel organization called the Energy Foundation, which has given millions to NRDC. Ironically enough, researchers have uncovered that Steyer’s hedge fund “minted a lot of money off oil and gas investments, among other environmentally destructive business ventures.” A profile of environmental groups profiting from the very oil and gas companies they fundamentally oppose by the progressive magazine The Nation confirmed that “NRDC still holds stocks in mutual funds and mixed assets that do not screen for fossil fuels.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The NRDC also received more than $1.7 million in 2011 from the SeaChange Foundation—a foundation with dubious funders. An exposé by the Washington Free Beacon uncovered that Klein Ltd., a company incorporated in Bermuda that exists solely on paper, donated at least $10 million to the SeaChange Foundation. SeaChange then funnels that shadowy money to a number of progressive organizations.
             </p>
             <p>
              NRDC has received similarly hidden contributions through other “donor-advised” funds, criticized by some watchdogs as “dark money.” The Schwab Charitable Fund, a donor-advised fund that donors to other left-environmentalist groups have used to obscure their identities, funneled at least $4.7 million in NRDC donations since 2008.
             </p>
             <p>
              NRDC also receives considerable funding from more traditional liberal foundations. The George Soros-backed Open Society Institute and Foundation to Support Open Society gave NRDC over $2.2 million since 2008.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Bel-Air mansion is described as a hoarder’s paradise. Court records show that the property is owned by Cynthia Beck, who has three daughters with J. Paul Getty’s son Gordon Getty. Beck bought the property in January 2001, but it remains unclear what, if any, connection she had to Wednesday’s events. Beck could not be reached for comment.

              I remember Rahm E. being involved in some way with backpage.  I think he was dragging his feet on kicking them out of Chicago, etc.  I can't find anything on it. Could have been scrubbed by now.

              Thanks.  This is a mystery of sorts.  Not that I doubt their involvement in trafficking, but who is the actual owner of those weapons.  Possibly Gordon.  Can't wait for updated info.

Larry Lawrence had died in January 1996, leaving Shelia a wealthy widow and in charge of the lavishly appointed Crown Manor. “Now, have you ever spent the night at a home owned by Jane Doe 7 when your wife was not with you?” Clinton was asked in a March 1998 deposition. “I believe I did once. I believe, I believe I did. .."

                   I don't remember exactly when [Lawrence] was confirmed; I wasn't working there at the time. I believe in January of 1994 he went back to Washington, and that was when he received the medal from the Russian Embassy for his exploits during the war. [Laughter] You have to understand, you know, when I see this stuff and read it in print, I'm thinking to myself, "Oh, my!"

                  Much has been written about the Tudor Revival Style mansion at 1015 Ocean Blvd, named the Crown Manor by Larry Lawrence, who lived there off and on until it was sold in 1999 to its new owners who currently have it on the market for $25 million. The house historically should be named the “Richards/DuPee/Burnham/Van Ness/McPartlin/Pastor/Lawrence/Black/Bower” with its storied past.

                  Trivia:  Seems there are several 'Van Ness' mansions in the US, a common aspect is that there are usually rumors of them being haunted

                  The Van Ness House was built in Bodega Bay, California in 1862 by Miles Van Ness who made his money in the gold rush. It is located two miles south of Bodega Bay on Bay Highway (U.S. Highway 1) not far from the shore of Bodega Bay. During Prohibition, parts of the house were altered to include a bar and a hidden room for high-stakes gambling.  Max Finley, however, has a more personal insight and direct observation of what was happening in the house between 1938 to 1943 when the location was a boarding school, mostly for orphans and children of American GIs overseas. Although he was eight years old at the time, he has told and repeated his stories often over the years...

                  ...It is known that there have been seventeen reported disappearances of individuals in a hundred mile radius of Bodega Bay of teenagers...it is not possible to link all of them to the Van Ness House as people do tend to vanish.
