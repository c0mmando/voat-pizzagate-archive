<p><em>Article from <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/08/what-haunts-us-paige-tolmach-emmys-starz-interview-1202443145/">deadline.com</a>:</em></p>
<p>\'Charleston, South Carolina native Paige Goldberg Tolmach is a local girl made good. She co-founded a successful eco products business in LA and recently earned an Emmy nomination for her directorial debut, the documentary <em>What Haunts Us</em>.</p>
<p>Those accomplishments might seem enough for Charleston to take pride in Paige, but to hear Tolmach tell it, the city has decidedly mixed feelings about her.</p>
<p>“Still, in my hometown, right now, they’re really angry at me,” Tolmach tells Deadline. That anger stems from the very film she made, the one that earned recognition in the prestigious Emmy category of Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking.</p>
<p><strong>“People told me, ‘How dare you talk about this?’” she recounts. “‘We worked so hard to sweep it under the rug. Who do you think you are?’”</strong></p>
<p>Tolmach graduated from Porter-Gaud in 1985 and says she was inspired to direct the film <strong>after learning that yet another of her fellow alums had committed suicide. Of the 49 boys from the class of 1979, six have taken their lives.</strong></p>
<p>“It’s just a terrible, terrible statistic. I mean, it’s shocking. And the fact that no one has paid attention to this, no one’s noticed this, in all these years? That the school never noticed this, just kind of slayed me,” Tolmach recalls.</p>
<p><strong>What may link the suicides is widespread sexual abuse that went unchecked at the school for a decade. From 1972-1982 Porter-Gaud employed a teacher named Eddie Fischer who cultivated an unusually close relationship with male students. Fischer was a popular, outgoing presence on campus, and took advantage of his position to secretly molest 20 male students.</strong></p>
<h1></h1>
<p>In her film, Tolmach interviews several of Fischer’s victims including Guerry Glover, one of the few who came forward to denounce his abuser. But the school turned its back on him.</p>
<p><strong>“Guerry, who is the hero of my film, he went to [school] authorities and said, ‘This happened to me.’ And he was inspired to do that because he saw that Fischer was still riding around town with little boys in his car,”</strong> the director recounts. “And Guerry said, ‘Enough is enough. I don’t want it to happen to anyone else.’ And he tried to get the school to help him. And they didn’t.”</p>
<p>A conspiracy of silence kept the abuse under wraps, in part because Fischer cleverly chose his victims from among some of Charleston’s most prominent families, with reputations of their own to consider.</p>
<p>Porter-Gaud students “are the privileged,” Tolmach observes. “And I think, in that environment, you kind of know that these kids aren’t going to say anything, because it’s how they were raised. Sort of like, ‘Make it go away.’ And it was diabolical. It was an absolutely diabolical plan, in [Fischer’s] brain.”</p>
<p>After one family did tell school officials Fischer had sexually abused their son, <strong>he was allowed to quietly leave the faculty. With recommendations from Porter-Gaud in hand, Fischer took up teaching at another private at school in Charleston, where he abused more boys.</strong></p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Tolmach says she approached Porter-Gaud’s current administration about participating in the documentary, but got the cold shoulder.</p>
<p>“I went to them, and I said, ‘I want to make this film, I’d like you to hold my hand, and let’s make this film together, and show this world that it’s not going to happen again on our watch,’” Tolmach states. “And they were not interested in that.”</p>
<p>Since the release of the film on the Starz channel, Porter-Gaud has come closer to seeing things Tolmach’s way. The school’s website offers a statement about What Haunts Us, which reads in part, “The film tells the story of the sexual abuse committed by former Porter-Gaud teacher Eddie Fischer from 1972 until 1982 and the School’s ineffective handling of the allegations… We deeply regret this painful part of our past and the poor manner in which the School treated the victims.”</p>
<p>Fischer eventually was arrested for his crimes in 1997, mostly due to the persistent efforts of Glover. Fischer died in prison in 2002. Although some in the community apparently don’t want further attention trained on the case, Tolmach says it’s vital to confront the issue of sexual abuse of children, whether in Charleston or elsewhere.</p>
<p>“We can stop sexual abuse as long as we’re talking about it. And for me, the film really was the start of that conversation,” she stresses. “I get so many messages from people all over the place who are thanking me for talking about something that no one wanted to talk about. It’s helping them heal.”</p>
<p>The filmmaker adds, “This Emmy nomination is extraordinary for us, because it takes a topic, the icky topic that nobody wants to talk about, and it gives it a platform. It gives it a lot of attention. And that’s what we want.”</p>

            This hits home.  One of my ancestors attended the original Porter School. I know a family member of one of the victims in the film. This is so shocking and sad, but I applaud the courage of the victims to press forward and get a conviction!  This is why we fight for the children. Charleston is a Masonic city. Interestingly, Senator Clementa Pinckney stumped for Hillary Clinton in North Charleston before leaving to attend the fateful Bible study where he and others were gunned down. Charleston still has many secrets.....

            Child abuse seems to be rampant in prep schools since the 1960s. This was a keenly telling point:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A conspiracy of silence kept the abuse under wraps, in part because Fischer cleverly chose his victims from among some of Charleston’s most prominent families, with reputations of their own to consider.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            These are the kids that go on to become the nation's business leaders, judges, powerful lawyers, heads of charities, venture capitalists, media moguls etc. You have to wonder how it would impact their decision making to have hidden in their past an ugly incident involving a teacher or coach that could come back to haunt them. I hadn't really considered the fact that the Brownstone operations could work on victims, too, not just perps. I'll bet something along these lines explains how Derschowitz' legal piranhas were able to get the S. Florida prosecutor's office to cut that sweet deal for Epstein. One or two people on the prosecution who were victimized as kids would create an optics problem easily exploitable as "bias leading to a witch hunt" by Epstein's defense, destroying all his victims' chance to win civil actions against him. It can't be too hard for the deepstate wizards to access their database and look up everyone involved in the prosecution and their families, see what secret smut known sex offenders may have about them, and turn the screws. Very interesting.

             That's an excellent point, Vin. Nor had I. We have read so many stories about run-aways from foster care who got abused, and who were specifically targeted by perps, that it never occured to me that perps would also specifically target victims from elite families, knowing that the families would never speak up due to the feared damage of their public image.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know about the Epstein case though. I think they just told Acosta that it would definitely end his career when he wouldn't do what they wanted him to do. Well, it worked out for him, as we know.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Another former student of the prestigious Porter-Gaud preparatory school in Charleston, South Carolina has committed suicide.
            </p>
            <p>
             21-year-old Brennan Roye Bennett of Charleston, S.C. died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound
            </p>
            <p>
             Bennett also posted a lengthy suicide note to his Facebook page….on Monday as he sat in his car on the campus of Rollins College in Winter Park – a resort community located a few miles northeast of Orlando.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Someone please contact Rollins or call an ambulance or police to remove my body,” the young baseball player wrote. “I don’t want my family to find me like this.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Bennett also warned those coming to the scene that “the gun will still be loaded so please be careful.”
            </p>
            <p>
             In his note, Bennett apologizes to his family, including his father – wealthy Charleston, S.C. businessman Michael Bennett.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brennan Bennett’s note also references his friendship with Shriver Soliday, a Porter-Gaud student who committed suicide in July of 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soliday’s death is one of several recent Porter-Gaud suicides that this news site has been investigating over the course of the last few months.

             Ellis was part of Porter-Gaud’s vestry program during his time on campus….at least three other students associated with this program have committed suicide in recent years – all of them allegedly having experienced abuse at the hands of their “spiritual mentor.”

              Sexual abuse is devastating for any child victim, but there seems to be less support, less services, and more stigma when it happens to boys. These pedos make my blood boil!

               I know how you feel. They know that there is a stigma about getting abused.  They know that many may think the boys are gay.  Many fathers have instilled this in their children, unfortunately, and it is handed down.  That is why many are committing suicide because they cannot bear the pain it will bring them and most of all their fathers shame in them.  It makes me want to cry.

            "I was 12 years old and that was my first introduction to sex," he said during Fischer's sentencing. "At a time in my life when I should have been building self-esteem and building self-confidence, Eddie Fischer had stripped me of any chance I had to lead a normal, healthy, prosperous and productive life."

            This could have been written by any victim.  So Sad.  They steal their Very Souls and rob them of their Childhood.  There is no punishment sever enough for these Child Rapists.

             Yep. That's what I thought as well. And it's not only their childhood that is stolen, it will also have effects on their adult life - lack of trust, PTSD symptoms, possible drug and alcohol abuse, and a higher risk for many diseases, including cancer. And sadly, a high risk for taking their own life because they can't bear the memories.

              I have several adult women in my extended family who were sexually abused as children. They are now in their 60's and 70's and it still effects them! It has interfered with their marriages and even with how they patented their children! When I hear pedos minimizing the trauma it causes and calling it "loving" I want to shoot them in the crotch!

              Some end up getting married and divorced and it messes up their children too.  Just from the PTSD as you say, and the Flashbacks.  I read a story of a man that finally named his Rapist when he was 55.  He was married and had children.  His wife could not understand why, after so many years, did he put himself through this pain.  He said this pain could never compare to the pain he had lived for almost 50 years.  Yes, it never goes away.

             Colbert is very chummy with Oprah. She has been on his show many times. She also seems to like visiting Charleston. The following article is old, but John's Is. / Kiawah is where one of the victims was from....Don't forget pic of Oprah, Gail, and Tom Hanks (black eye).

             A New Trend of Secret Meetings Aside From Bilderberg
"Recently Bill Gates and other dominant globalists met at a sanctuary on Kiawah Island in secret. A local news agency, WBTW13, reported on May 10, 2013, “Suspicion was raised when nearly 20 very expensive jets were seen lined up at the Charleston International Airport on Johns Island.
            </p>
            <p>
             Officials with the Beach Company confirmed to WCBD that other big names such as New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, TV host Oprah Winfrey and Billionaire Warren Buffet flew into the Charleston Executive airport on Johns Island Wednesday night.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other prominent people said to also be staying there this weekend are  Jeb Bush and Dan Gilbert, owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.
            </p>
            <p>
             The famous guests were attending a two day long conference led by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Officials say the meeting was about the foundation Gates and his wife Linda run.
            </p>
            <p>
             The meeting rented out the entire Sanctuary Hotel on the gated island. Security has been high throughout the entire week, keeping the public away from the hotel.”"

              The Pedo Lineup.  Oprah for Prez?  I
              <strong>
               shudder
              </strong>
              at the thought.  Meeting in secret.  We are finding out alot.  Thanks for the news, I just can't stand Oprah and Colbert.  He is surely gushing and possibly that is what the meeting was about.  Can't plan too early.  People even on Data Lounge were not that hot about her.  And that's really bad.
