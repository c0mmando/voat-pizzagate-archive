            Here's the thing about all this:  Spirit Cooking controversy got millions of Christians scared - black and Hispanics especially - as it was shared by Family Forum types group all over the country to either vote Trump or stay home.  So it accomplished what is was supposed to do: WIN.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are after who?   Podesta and Brock.  To bring in tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people to our cause to create the break we need to take down PODESTA and BROCK and wipe out the left in this country we will use any means necessary to do that.
           </p>
           <p>
            What attracts the masses?   IMAGES and STORIES.     Satanic rituals and raped children.   There's enough smoke Hillary, Brock, Podesta Brothers have brought on themselves associating with these folks.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is the way to rid the country of these folks from the political scene and possibly jail them?  That's fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Will there be collateral damage in the war?    Sure.   There always has been and always will be.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know the score.  This is all about POWER and your team is on the way out.   We will now follow the Obama model and weaponize the IRS and go after those who oppose us.  We will take down Amazon Carlos Slim etc. or get them to play ball with our team and leave you guys on the outs.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the real score here.   We need about a million people on board for PizzaGate and some of the YouTubes have hit 450,000 already.
So a few more weeks, Trump sworn into office, then we pay back the folks that need to be paid back and purge those that need to be purged.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were AMPLE Russian spies and Communists operating in the U.S. during McCarthyism.  Do some innocents or clueless leftists get hurt in the process?  Perhaps but we've got to save the country from the "Crowley" globalists who are out to do us in with open borders, 'free trade' etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now it's OUR turn to play hard ball.   Welcome to the game, buddy.   But don't be fooled.  We know EXACTLY what to do to win and are how many days from having full reigns?
           </p>
           <p>
            Enjoy the inauguration.

            If you publicly mock child sexual abuse for your 'family friendly' restaurant on Instagram and hold yourself out as a public figure as one of the 50 most powerful people in DC, visit the White House multiple times, don't bitch when we call out the strange goings on in Washington D.C. from flyover country.

             One place name jimmy-comet, and that was GQ long ago. The idea that a fuck-boy, one of Brocks throw away boy toys can be the 48th most powerful person in DC is pure BULLSHIT. This is just to cover who is really in power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think People, Think.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today Pizza Boy ( jimmy comet) is in bankruptcy, he owes back taxes, he hasn't paid his janitor ( $25k) debt, and this is a powerful man? Your meme is that he supplys the richest ppl in DC with baby's, but he's too broke to pay &amp; file his payroll tax.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is anybody on this investigative wired between the ears?
            </p>
            <p>
             Now Brock or Podesta? Yes
            </p>
            <p>
             Talking about this GQ survey of most powerful ppl, U know they got hillary #11, after Krusty the Klown, Obama isn't even on this list, ... and this FAKE GQ can only be found on one source.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does anybody here realize you have all been played?

              Looks like he was sued for not paying rent in 2016 but that was resolved somehow.   Didn't know about the janitor and can't verify.

               Search it in voat, he owes $25k for not paying his cleaning bill, note if his restaurant really did wet-op children the mob would supply their own cleaners the bill would have been paid, in gold.

              One of the brightest posts I've read on here in days.  GQ is bullshit hype PR done as a favor to Jimmy's friends who actually DO have power (Tony, John, and his ex Brock).
             </p>
             <p>
              I assume that Brock was the one that came up with the media counter attack.    NYT, WaPo, Fortune, Bloomberg, etc.   Why the fuck should they care about some one-horse pizza
joint guy like Alefantis?    They wouldn't UNLESS someone put in a call to them.    Brock is my guess.

 the very crimes that you are condemning on others.
            </p>
            <p>
             The wizard of oz was written by a satanic priest ( Frank Oz ) and all the images are satanic, flying monkeys and all, so why did you subject children to this movie?
            </p>
            <p>
             So a hipster in DC sells pizza, and the theme of the place is occult, which is not a crime, the theme of wizard of oz is occult,
            </p>

             Be careful witch hunters on how you criminalize art, it will come back to haunt you,

            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             The gist of all this is the ppl of comet-pizza were having fun, and perhaps yes they were shitting on jesus christ so that the right could to be made to look like fools, .. and they are again, where's the beef show a single example of a crime related to pizzagate?
            </p>
            <p>
             The entire pizzagate narrative is LIES, Alex Jones is lies, ... this story has legs because of the lies, and you pull out the lies and you have nothing. The sad thing is the witch-hunters are so obsessed that they'll not even listen when proof of the lies are shoved in their face.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lies and Innuendo doesn't make an investigation, it makes a witch hunt.

              Frank Oz is a film director.  I think you meant Frank Baum, the writer of WIZARD OF OZ, actually a series of books.
             </p>
             <p>
              So the band saying James is into children was another joke?   The Majestic Ape.   The Heavy Breathing website page 6 of kids sucking dicks was another artistic expression?
             </p>
             <p>
              I think we have a civic duty to let parents know what they are exposing their children to.   IF abuse is taking place, we have a duty to let the authorities know so they can go investigate.
             </p>
             <p>
              NOBODY in this country is above the law.  Hillary, Jimmy Comet, Podesta, none of them.

               yep your right I meant frank baum assertion stands it was all about occult, did you know the munchkins had wild satanic sex orgys during the entire filming?
              </p>
              <p>
               My point is that if you watch wiz-of-oz, or showed to a child  then your as guilty as jimmy-comet
              </p>
              <p>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Name a lie OK. Alex Jones just yesterday said the Podesta emails had 1,000's of references to PIZZA (CHILD PORN)? Go watch his video.
Then dump the podesta email from wikileaks, all 60,000 email ( they have a button to download the  .gz file ) , then grep -i pizza, and you will get 12-18 references to pizza in 60,000 emails. The entire pizza 'find' is a 4chan circle-jerk, the reason that AlexJones has to lie is to make it sound plausible that everyone involved with podesta was a pedophile. Read the emails and you will find that 99.9999% of the emails are from constituents giving him support and general brown nosing.
              </p>
              <p>
               The CIA took over Wikileaks mid october, and released only these emails, planted their people at 4chan to destroy hillarys campaign. Mission accomplished. WHY?
Because Netanyahu hates Hillary and loves Donald Trump.
Trump is owned by Sheldon Adelson, Netanyahu is owned by Sheldon Adelson, Adelson is the one of the worlds biggest vampire and owns all the whore houses in the world.
Why fucking lie? Because the truth is that this story is based on lies.

             Itemize list one lie in this story? Unlike the NYT this guy rips apart the entire narrative of pizzagate and nails it.
            </p>
            <p>
             NYT didn't want to bring up the so called evidence because in doing so it would lower them. Something's are so obvious that only a fool needs explaining. This article is an explanation for the fools.

            the way this stuff works is that first a crime is committed, then you find evidence to link your suspect to the crime. With Pizzagate, what’s going on is that there has been no crime, but people are tirelessly working to find evidence to support a crime that I’ve still seen no evidence has ever happened. Sure, there is more “evidence” these white righters have gathered. I went through all of it and you know what I didn’t find? Anyone, and I mean anyone, accusing Alefantis of ever being inappropriate with children ever. Didn’t see a single thing where someone was accusing him of sexually abusing them or their kids. Another way of putting that would be, I’ve seen no evidence of a crime.

             Yes, economically but not because of OBAMA the USA is a swamp that is being drained, looted and destroyed, In 200 years the nation was pillaged. Now you have a dependent population fed with a fiat currency that is about to collapse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obama was dark face to sell war's on non-white populations to keep the oil war going, to keep the US Dollar alive, OBAMA is CIA, just like everybody else near power in the USA.

             Obama's crime seems to be that he's a metro-sexual, OK i get it but that's not what McCartyism is about,

             Look denigrate Trump on the site and they'll bash you with real McCarthy tactics.

             Anybody notice that left types don't even bother with this site? Its a circle jerk for alt-right sjw who never leave their mothers basement.

              Now see, I was more thinking that if you say anything about a transgender person,you will get massacred. Say anything about a black person, you will destroyed. McCarthyism would be a breeze compared to today's social media society.
