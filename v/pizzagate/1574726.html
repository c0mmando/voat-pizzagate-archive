            I really want to know what all those people who supported JA, not just the GoFundMe stooges who contributed $xx00 to him, but supposed journalists like those at NYTime and NPR who wrote "Oh poor, poor Comet" articles have to say now?
           </p>
           <p>
            They did not investigate even a BIT. It's literally a bunch of people on the Internet who are doing 100X more actual journalism than these MSM shills who get paid...for what?!! Would it not disgust them if their 17 year old child was seduced and sexually used IN THE KITCHEN of the place which they claim to be the victim???

            Disgusting!

            I tend to believe this because it has to do with Greenwood. I was wondering why he attempted to ruin her name by saying she attempted to have Donald Rumsfeld kicked out of Bucks. Seems the low-key, even-tempered b*stard that allegedly threatened a pizzagate investigator had to play mediator. Maybe by taping Carole's hands and wrists to a table?

             See the comment below.  The story was including in a book that was published in Feb, 2009 or about 4 months before she left Bucks.   Given the lead time of the book, this incident had to have happened before the fall of 2008 or well before she left.

               The Customers You Have
              </p>
              <p>
               "The Gamble," our colleague Thomas E. Ricks's excellent sequel to the extraordinary "Fiasco," will draw the usual plaudits for its insider account of Iraq as seen through the eyes of the top military officers who ran the war in the last three years. Reviewers will focus on strategy disagreements, policy fights and such.
              </p>
              <p>
               But those who don't care about policy -- especially those living in this area -- will be dazzled by fascinating local color. For example, Ricks recounts former defense secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's visit shortly after he was booted out of the Pentagon, to Buck's Fishing and Camping, an upscale Washington eatery.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an example of the "loathing Rumsfeld had generated" he writes that chef-owner Carole Greenwood told her co-owner, James Alefantis, to kick Rumsfeld out.
              </p>
              <p>
               "I'm not serving a war criminal in my restaurant," she said.
              </p>
              <p>
               Alefantis said that she's there to serve people and Rumsfeld was there with his family. Greenwood relented, Ricks writes, "but only on the condition that someone else cook Rumsfeld's meal."
              </p>

               So ever account I ever read about Carole Greenwood says she is a very good chef but has a prickly nature.  So I don't see the article on her leaving Comet/Bucks as character assasination.

               I was just reading a DC food message board that she was answering questions on and one person praised her food, but also asked if she wanted to respond to her reputation as a food authoritarian.  A DC food blogger took a picture of his meal and she hit him with a cease and desist letter from her lawyer.

                Washington, D.C.: Would you like to weigh in on this week's big foodie controversy? A blogger (dcfoodies) took photos of Carole Greenwood's food at Buck's. After dessert, she told him not to. The next day he was served with a cease-and-desist letter telling him he could be sued if he posted the pictures. He has not posted them, or his review, but he has posted the letter.
               </p>
               <p>
                Curious to hear your thoughts (and I've tried to recount the incident in as neutral a tone as I can! I am not either of the parties involved.)
               </p>
               <p>
                Tom Sietsema: I think the whole thing is pretty darn amusing.
               </p>
               <p>
                The blogger is a nice young man who just wants to record a meal he's enjoyed. The chef is an exceptional cook known for her (how do I say it?) occasional odd encounters with customers.
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe the blogger shouldn't have been so obvious. Maybe the chef should have left him alone. Maybe this is a tempest in a teapot.
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe it's time for another question ...

            The article states that Dylan Greenwood was 13 years old in 2003, which supports the idea that he was 17 or 18 around the time that Carole left CPP due to "urgent family matters".
