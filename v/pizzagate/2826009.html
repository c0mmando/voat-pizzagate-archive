<p>This part will focus on the Don Bluth connection and a suspiscious death that I believe is relevant to this case, despite appearing to be off topic.</p>
<p><a href="http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animation-anecdotes-328/">http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animation-anecdotes-328/</a> An account of someone who was in Don Bluth’s studio when Judith’s death was announced. Don Bluth was visibly shaken and left the studio right after the announcement. Definetely NOT the behaviour of someone in the know of or involved in any foul play. Seems Judith was going to be a major selling point of the movie and a go to girl in future works.</p>
<p>The question I have is whether Don was shaken with grief, by fear, or BOTH.</p>
<p><a href="https://please.stfuhollywood.com/sprechgesang-pizzagate-elements-dogs-go-heaven/">https://please.stfuhollywood.com/sprechgesang-pizzagate-elements-dogs-go-heaven/</a> A review of All Dogs Go to Heaven. Seems Don Bluth and Steven Spielberg had a falling out during production of Land Before Time. There were originally going to be 3 movies together. Allegedly for “creative differences”.</p>
<p>Given what the blind said about Judith crying out for help and freaking out regarding being alone, is it possible Don Bluth suspected something was terribly wrong? Did he suspect that Judith was the victim of more than physical/emotional abuse?</p>
<p>Don was the one who tried to get her to migrate into voice over. So far during Voat’s investigation, we’ve run into far fewer incidents within the voice over industry (ie significantly less infested with pedowood shit). If my theory is correct, then the motive for said migration was attempting to protect her. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/10/todays-blind-items-it-was-murder.html?m=1">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/10/todays-blind-items-it-was-murder.html?m=1</a> This link is worthy of its own thread. Heavy speculation that this blind (released on Halloween) is saying that Vic Marrow’s accident on the Twilight Zone movie was actually a “murder disguised as an accident”. According to this blind, the actor in question knew about child exploitation (pedowood related too) and was gonna talk. Partial investigation implicated Landis who BTW signed the Polanski Petition. One of the comments mentions the spreading belief that Judith Barsi was straight up murdered to silence her.</p>
<p>If this is true, then this fits with the Renegade Anon comment about “Hollywood whacking people via mafia tactics”. This also sets a precedent for Spielberg “whacking” people to keep them silent about Pedowood. Basically, Spielberg has it in him to order “hits” and given his ties to the Bronfman Crime Family, the means to do it.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2jHwEc0USS4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2jHwEc0USS4</a> The video of the accident. Found this in the comments of the blind.</p>
<p>Updated Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine (note: the incident mentioned in the “Blame It On Rio” CDAN Blind with that underaged girl makes him a suspect in this incident), Joseph Sargent, Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Lorraine Gary. Person of Interest: Adria Later</p>
<p>-The Murder (my theory has changed here): </p>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg (orders), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She also would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood\'s tracks had a part in the motive.</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) likely warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The well known abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match &quot;Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative.
Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. What this basically is is that it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up. Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the detective’s claim of a possible murder of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at this point. </p>
<ul>
<li>Murder Weapons: Pistol/Revolver (likely with a silencer), gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? Intimidated into playing along with the murder suicide narrative? If Don Bluth suspected something was wrong, then its entirely possible that Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.</p>',

           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge.

           -The Murder (my theory has changed here):
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects: Steven Spielberg (orders), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She also would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood's tracks had a part in the motive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) likely warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The well known abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match "Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative.
Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". What this basically is is that it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up. Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the detective’s claim of a possible murder of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at this point.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Murder Weapons: Pistol/Revolver (likely with a silencer), gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? Intimidated into playing along with the murder suicide narrative? If Don Bluth suspected something was wrong, then its entirely possible that Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.

            Very good and accurate but I don't think they conspired to kill Vic Morrow by crashing the helicopter on him that is way too risky way too complicated. Landis deserved to go to prison for that but I don't think it was a planned murder just a horrible accident that was totally avoidable if not for Landis being an arrogant asshole.

            Hi darkknight. For the sake of those who haven't read all your previous posts on this topic, can you please add some supporting links for the key pieces of the paragraph that begins with the sentence above? Maybe a link that supports the Grand Climax/sacrifice timing (I believe

            did a post that included a law enforcement report on SRA sacrifices). Also a link that supports what you are describing about the crime scene (bodies stacked, etc.).

             Put in some relevant links in the murder section. The body pile is likely closer to a triangular heap than a collumn of bodies. I believe Mariana was at the base of the pile.
            </p>
            <p>
             How I came to my conclusions regarding the time of the time of death. Basically a process of elimination style deduction based on the facts of the case. Chapter 6 is REALLY important in all this. Made a note of that on the thread body.
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               Official narrative admits the murder took place at nighttime. Narrows down time of death to 7-11:59 PM (7/25), 12 AM-5 AM (7/26), 7-11:59 PM (7/26), or 12 AM-5 AM (7/27).
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               There were no reports of anyone hearing any gun shots or suspiscious noises until 8:30 AM 7/27. This suggests that a silencer is absolutely nessecary for this crime to occur. There was
no evidence of Josephz Barsi owning a silencer.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               There was no reports of any suspiscious vehicles coming to and from the Barsi residence. Combined with #2, this essentially rules out both 7-11:59 PM time frames as the true time of death.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               There were no reports of any unusual smells coming from the Barsi residence (smell of a dead body, which like gun shots guarantees a law enforcement or 9-11 call). Given how potent the scent of death is and the climate in Canaoga Park during that month (that super bad heat wave), 12-5 AM (7/26) can be ruled out. Weather like that can spread the scent of death within less than 12 hours. Keep in mind I studied microbiology and ecology in college.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             With these, the true time of death can be assessed as 12-5 AM 7/27. I wish I had a way to prove it, but I suspect that heat wave was a geo engineering false flag to push the “muh global warming” narrative, which was triggered by that very heat wave. How ironic that a false flag exposed one of the crimes of their high level Pedowood operative. “These people are stupid”.

            UpVoat!  Thank You Again for your tireless pursuit of SS.  When you added Caine to the mix I wanted to cheer.  I had long hated him because every time I saw him he made me feel creepy.  Now I know why.  The Crispin Glover piece is a powerful read.  When will the fans of SS realize that everyone wearing a baseball cap and directing movies is not worthy of their adoration.  Adoration that blocks and blinds their judgement. t is called Idolatry.  I hope someday they will find out who and what they have been Idolizing.
