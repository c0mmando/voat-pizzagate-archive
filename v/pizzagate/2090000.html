            I've played in bands, everyone uses bandcamp.  Not a surprise CPP's musical acts would be found on bandcamp...
           </p>
           <p>
            What's wrong with that 11 year old's videos?  The video had me laughing as I skipped through, did I miss something?  Are you religious and easily offended by swear words or something?  She seems really talented with music editing software, better than me...
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of those bands/tracks aren't in defense of pedophilia.  Why not pic out the ones that obviously are and point them out instead of this broad brush stroke.

            How does this thread get upvoats?  What am I missing, I don't see anything overly nefarious other than a handful of fucked up bands.

             Very much aware of bandcamps popularity. My husband is a musician.
            </p>
            <p>
             My personal take on the 11-year old is that she is damaged goods regardless of her "talent." That is simply how I feel.
            </p>
            <p>
             No, I am not a religous zealot and am not offended by profanity.  I am a nurse who has heard it all, seen it all, and have no problem using it freely.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am also grateful for upvoats and do not post bullshit.  Furthermore, you cannot post bullshit on this sub or your post will immediately be deleted or you will be banned.
            </p>
            <p>
             As stated in the submission, James Alefantis relies heavily on bandcamp affiliated musicians.  It certainly speaks for itself that bandcamp is the go-to site for deviant, hard-core bands.  No, I did not listen to any "Pedophilia" tracks.  My choice.  Regardless of song lyrics, what musician in their fucking right mind would use the word anywhere?  In any event, bandcamp is worth keeping an eye on.  And as far as all of the transgender bullshit they're involved in, IMO it's nothing but a far right bunch of probable Antifa assholes.

            No but seriously... when I began reading this post, I was intending to add in my reply, something along the lines of "I doubt Bandcamp itself is complicit, just douchebags abusing the service(s) provided", but, factor in that bizzare money trail and even on it's own merit, the TLC thing you mention...
           </p>
           <p>
            Something's very off here, Bandcamp is definitely now on my radar - was even just discussing it(and other similar services like spotify and soundcloud) with a friend the other night - coincidence? probably in that case as we were actually discussing music distribution, but, coincidences are pretty rare in my experience...
