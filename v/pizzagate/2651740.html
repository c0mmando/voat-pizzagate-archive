<p>&quot;Harry Thomas was the pastor of Come Alive Church in Medford and the co-founder of the Creation Festival, perhaps the largest Christian music festival in the country.</p>
<p>Thomas pleaded guilty in February to one count of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, three counts of second-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;There is no sentence that can approximate justice in light of this defendant\'s despicable acts against these children, but it is gratifying that the victims have been spared the pain of a trial and the defendant almost certainly will spend the rest of his life in prison, where he never can harm a child again,&quot; the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>Thomas\' sentence contains no parole eligibility. He will serve it at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center, a corrections facility for convicted sex offenders in the Avenel section of Woodbridge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thomas admitted to the sexual assault of a 9-year-old in 2005; sexual contact with three girls who were 7, 8 and 9, in 2000 and 2010; and exposing himself and endangering the welfare of a girl between 2008 and 2010, when she was 8 to 10 years old.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thomas founded the church in 1973 and also was the co-founder and director of the Creation Festival, a Christian music event held annually for 40 years.&quot;</p>
