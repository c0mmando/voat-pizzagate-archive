            Everyday there are arrests of individuals charged with child sexual abuse, crimes related to CP, etc, etc.  And I know we are all waiting for big names to be arrested.
           </p>
           <p>
            This particular case is interesting, and related to PG, as this is a story in today's news about a man charged with child sexual exploitation, and the article states he is a member of a popular social media site that is frequented by pedophiles... but all the news articles FAIL TO MENTION which social media website that is!
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently, it is known to authorities that this particular site is frequented by child molesters/ child rapists/ child pornographers, but nothing is indicating which site this is.  Perhaps in a way that is best in order to not give ideas to other child abusers?  At the same time, how can we tackle this problem if we aren't told the whole truth?
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone have any ideas what social media site this might be, or have any thoughts on this particular case?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Here is a quote from the linked article:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "A 39-year-old resident of New Caney has been taken into custody on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Abe Martinez.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joshua James Holmstedt is suspected of actively engaging in the
            <strong>
             sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of a minor female under the age of five
            </strong>
            , according to the charges. He was taken into federal custody today and made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Dena Hanovice Palermo at 10:00 a.m. At that time, he was temporarily ordered into custody pending a probable cause and detention hearing set for July 27 at 2:00 p.m.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the criminal complaint, Holmstedt
            <strong>
             engaged in conversations via a specific social media forum believed to be frequented by individuals who have a sexual interest in children
            </strong>
            .
            <strong>
             The service randomly pairs users in one-on-one chat sessions where they can chat anonymously. Users type in search words and the forum pairs them with random strangers who typed in the same search words.
            </strong>
            Holmstedt allegedly saw a post that contained terms commonly associated with the sexual exploitation of children and had responded to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the course of the chats, Holmstedt allegedly claimed he was sexually active with a minor female and claimed he watched pornographic material with her. Holmstedt later sent an image and four videos he claimed were of the minor, some of which focused on her vagina, according to the charges. He also allegedly sent other videos of other prepubescent children engaged in sexual acts and masturbation. "

              Yeah, I was gonna say Snapchat or Kik. Those apps are notorious for attracting lowlife. Could be anything. WhatsApp?, Skype, Instagram, fucking Facebook Messenger.

              Could that be a ChatRoulette sort of thing?I don't really know how that works.
