            Not random.  The most vocal of immigration rights group is BAMN and ANTIFA...
           </p>
           <p>
            BAMN is connected to Nambla.  BAMN is an immigration rights advocacy group with an unusual number of clueless teens attending their protests.  Yvette Felarca is a BAMN activist, middle school teacher and Den Mother to trafficked teens (as per their own accounts).  All the immigrant advocacy groups seem to go light on the idea of deporting MS-13 gang members, a group that does more than make kids read Marxist Manifestos before bed every night.
           </p>
           <p>
            America (and the world) has a child trafficking problem, for sex, for labor...and now we know that some Marxist Communists traffic in teens, give them fake names, unprescribed prescription drugs if necessary, cut off all ties from parents and friends from their hometowns, ostensibly for the purpose of "voluntary" protesting.  So at some point it's not out of the question to consider that it's not just about kids getting trafficked into the country (which is terrible), but getting moved OUT of the country as well, like runaways or Silsby's definition of orphans and 'emancipated' teens, or to embark on a 'consensual intergenerational relationship'.
To go where exactly?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, I did read an article of a German Antifa  member (fully a radical activist by age 12) who later trained in Syria to fight ISIS.  I'm sure Globalists have ways to place kids on any side of the fight they want them to be.
           </p>
           <p>
            "VICE: Why did you choose, to go in the civil war and fight?
Alexander: It was now not so like the cliché of IS volunteers, that was my life in ruins, and I said I gotta get outta here. This was a deliberate decision. My career since I was 12 or so, was always revolutionary. For me, it was always clear that it is what I want to do with my life: radical political changes cause. I had long thought about to abandon my academic career and the quest for a career and then after a few months decided to do that. Course ' ne hard decision, my life almost "the revolution to opfern"-that sounds pretty damn pathetic."
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider that next time you hear about teachers taking kids as young as 7 to a BLM protest, or middle/high schoolers being taken to protest with Marxist Communist and pedophile associated groups.

            Knowing what we know about Trump, and him being placed into this position of power by his overlord masters, what's the
            <strong>
             real
            </strong>
            reason behind this wall?
As we already know, a wall isn't going to stop or deter the elite from moving children around the globe, considering (((their))) vast resources.
Obviously it's going to create an immediate barrier for poor immigrants trying to cross or low level drug smuggling, but for those with unlimited resources a wall is of little real consequence.
So, again, what's the
            <strong>
             actual
            </strong>
            reason for this thing?

             Also helps Elites to have "enemies" and blocking Mexico with a wall suggests they are the enemy.
There always seem to be attempts at liberalism and democracy in Mexico which get undone by US interference.
Think that's probably also what they fear.

               Meanwhile In Europe the "refugees" (mostly man..) are brought in every day, even by flight.
(European countries need to get there EU targets so sometimes they need a airplane to take them from other EU countries)

            Aside from being true this is sound strategy. Take the commie lefts whinny protests about how the wall only hurts good hard working people and turn that into a liability for them. Straight out of Sun Tzu's Art of War. Just needs done now and said more often.

             The Wall, of course, will also wall in Americans -- and do nothing to stop crime and corruption,drug running, and human trafficking by Elites.  It will do nothing to stop the criminal activities of Elites and their corporations which have destroyed Nature on this planet and likely the planet itself making life her unlivable for humans.  What we are feeling now in the abuse of the planet actually only reflects damage done up to about 1967 because there was a 50 year period when we were feeling nothing of the harm done by Global Warming.

              Votescam, I would like to say I am indeed proud to see you exercising your freedom of speech. I and my family sacrificed many, many decades of our lives for that right and it's good to see it being used. As to the wall not stopping crime,corruption,drug running and human trafficking by elites. Well of course it won't stop those things. We are human, those are things that always need to be fought against and if building a wall to help in that fight is not good enough for you then I suggest you build a spaceship and run away to hide on planet Happy Commie Bull Shit, so you can be free from evil human nature while those who are brave enough to face reality stay here and really fight these evils. As for your bazaar connection of the wall and global warming and corporations, you do realize you are mixing apples and oranges in a topic about border security, don't you? Also you realize you are exposing your true self as just another uninformed brainwashed useful idiot of the leftist. For crying out loud, free your self, question what you have been taught, truly prove those teachings to your self before you accept them as fact and if after doing that if you still find those corporations to be evil, then boycott them and start with your ISP or your computer manufacture.  Edit for spelling.

                I find it funny how we try to change our government for some the very reasons you just sited like they were important to you and we try to build a wall to help with those problems and you want to snivel because I use your leftist tacit on you. We are way past treating you commies like your reasonable humans were are past trying to have a dialog. You burnt those bridges, so don't snivel like a pansy when you get a taste of your own medicine. Yes I am deliberately treating you like an enemy so grow a pair and deal with it, you earned it. At some point you phony do good leftist have to make up your mind either you are for fighting against illegal drugs and trafficking or your not! So if your against those crimes then why the hell you sniveling about the Wall? I know already your just trying to mislead people as you commies always do. Just in case you missed it, my rebuttal was me telling you to check the truthfulness of what you have been taught. So if you are incapable of doing that for yourself and you want me to teach you, you got to pay me a lot for my time.
