<p>While reading recent posts by Neonrevolt and SerialBrain2 along with the Cemex stories, some critical thinking was triggered. I\'d like to share 7 maps, and describe each. Nothing new is here, but I want to tie it all together in a new light. First lets look at Human Sex Trafficking Hot Spots in the US.  
</p>
<p>https ://imgur.com/ocrc3qw</p>
<p>Please note I-15 goes from LA to LV, through NV and up to Salt Lake City and Denver. The red arrow i drew indicates that.</p>
<p>Next for reference and supporting data lets look at Results by county, 2016 Presidential Election.  
</p>
<p>https ://imgur.com/pMA8L0i</p>
<p>From the first two maps I going to continue with the last 5 focusing on that area, from Los Angeles to Las Vegas along i-15 up into Utah.</p>
<p>For the third map lets take a look at sanctuary cities and counties by state.  
</p>
<p>https ://imgur.com/9uafB86</p>
<p>This is going to get better I promise.</p>
<p>Next, please take a look at major drug trafficking corridors of the US. Note I-15.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks, Ill try and reward your time with my final three maps and conclusion.</p>
<p>Lets get to the heart of this. Please take a look at this map of Cemex locations in the US Map borrowed from reddit user SerialBrain2.  
</p>
<p>https ://imgur.com/2xGHePt</p>
<p>Before the last map, I\'m adding this one special because Im convinced it all ties in.</p>
<p>Please view this map which shows a map view of the Bundy Ranch Standoff. https ://imgur.com/NaPl3Xl  Note the Gold Butte conservation land on which the Bundy ranch sits. Mesquite, Nevada, location of the Bundy Ranch, the Gold Butte land, and is the last city on I-15 in Nevada before continuing to Utah.</p>
<p>Now for the final map which is what prompted me to put all of this in a post. Barack Obama National Monument Designations.  https ://imgur.com/N3uWBt8</p>
<p>Now to tie all my maps together and summarize. The highway bloodline of i-15 is critical to the movement of drugs, weapons and humans. All along i-15 Obama placed the Mojave Trail Monument. (to read more about this placement please refer to Mojave Trails National Monument. Read carefully the \'Protected in Perpetuity\')</p>
<p>What they have done here is place national monument protected land all along the route between LA and LV. This means you probably need a permit from the Government to have a picnic let alone carry protection.</p>
<p>To say it another way by placing protected lands between the two sanctuary cities of LA and LV a \'gun free zone\' now \'protects\' the entire corridor.</p>
<p>To say it another way citizens who obey the law wont arm themselves. Citizens cannot use this land to hunt, fish, or travel outside designated areas freely.</p>
<p>The ratline doesn\'t end in LV. it follows i-15 up through Utah but not before the Bundy Ranch on the Nevada Border. Obama placed the Gold Butte National Monument in eastern Nevada to complete the ratline, however the Bundy Ranch has rights grandfathered in. Obama disagreed and sent in the Bureau of Land Management to collect over a million dollars they claimed the Bundy\'s owed because their cattle grazed off of the protected land.</p>
<p>Lets face it the government didn\'t want the money. They wanted the Bundys gone so they could complete their ratline control of i-15 from LA all the way to Utah. Both of these monuments, Mojave and Gold Butte, were placed by Obama in Dec 2016, about a month before President Trump\'s inauguration.</p>
<p>Cemex factories. Drug Trafficking. Human Trafficking. LA to LV and beyond, along the outskirts and protected lands off of I-15. The carotid artery of crime flowing from the American Southwest. Brought to you by the cabal.</p>
<p>These people could care less about the land and monuments. That is what I believe. President Trump is trying to reclaim some of these lands right now. Does he not care about the environment? Is it ego? No. I believe he is reclaiming these lands from the cabal and returning it to the American people.</p>',

              I wrote a follow up, if you look at the bottom of the original reddit post, I later added a link to part 2. In that one I covered the border crossing near el paso texas.

               You should make a separate post as the author. If you aren't able to, let me know and I will revise this post as part 1 and post part 2 for you. Thanks.

            Hi there lamplight. Can you un-break the links so users don't have to copypaste every single one? Also, can you add some links to the actual source material, not just screenshots of those pages? Thank you. Researchers will appreciate it.

            A reddit user asked me to post that to 8chan yesterday.  They made it a notable.  It is a really good post.  He has another one that will be posted soon.  I will get him to post his stuff here in the future.

             U.S. Route 91 (US 91) is a north–south United States highway. The highway currently serves as a connection between the Cache Valley area of Utah and Idaho to the Salt Lake City and Idaho Falls population centers. Prior to the mid-1970s, US 91 was an international commerce route from Long Beach, California to the Canada–US border north of Sweetgrass, Montana. US 91 was routed on the main streets of most of the communities it served, including Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas and State Street in Salt Lake City. From Los Angeles to Salt Lake, the route was built along the corridor of the Arrowhead Trail. US 91 has been largely replaced by Interstate 15.[3] A portion of the highway's former route in California is currently State Route 91.

            <p>
             On the road between Tagaung and Meiktila, we saw "butterflies
of the night" visiting truck drivers resting by the roadside. 
Burma does not have the reputation for prostitution that
Thailand has.  But several Burmese friends told me that the sex
"industry" was becoming a major problem because there were
so few other opportunities for poor women to find decent
employment.  The sexual habits of cross - country truck drivers
are especially important since, if they acquire the AIDS virus,
they can transmit it to sexual partners in widely disbursed areas
of the country, to say nothing of infecting their wives or
girlfriends at home.  The promiscuity of Indian long distance
truck drivers has given that country one of Asia's worst and
fastest-growing AIDS epidemics.

               Laura Biancolini began traveling on Khashoggi’s yacht, along with what is known in some circles as a bevy of lovelies, at the age of seventeen. She converted to Islam, changed her name to Lamia, and became Khashoggi’s second wife before giving birth to her only child and Adnan’s fifth son, Ali, now nine, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Marriage to a man like Adnan Khashoggi cannot have been easy for either of his wives. Women for hire were part and parcel of his everyday life, and he often sent girls as gifts to men with whom he was attempting to do business.

I assume the Logan Police have jurisdiction there, because I believe they have jurisdiction over the county of Cache, Utah. The Logan Police Chief had FBI training and graduated from the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia, session 244 in March of 2011. That 'elite' training is by invitation only.

               The LDS Church has provided nearly a quarter of a million dollars to support Children's Justice Centers in Utah in the past three years. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said Children's Justice Centers are a safe harbor that give vulnerable, abused children a place where their voices can be heard and where they know they are believed and safe. He said the first priority is a child's and a family's healing, safety and growth. HERE is more info on a donation made by the LDS Church, namely this time by Sister Joy D. Jones. There has been mention of the connection to Child Trafficking in this case. I noticed the Butterfly on the Upper left hand corner for the Children's Justice Center and decided to look it up. EDIT: Forgot to add the link to the article.

            Lots of stuff going on in that area : from allegations of child trafficking, military camps, etc. I believe connections to the Las Vegas shooting at the Route 91 Harvest.
