            They are not interested in rescuing any children.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember a case in England in 2017, where a 17 yr. old Eton boy produced most horrible child porn, and he got a slip on the wrist (had to go to some therapy lessons).
           </p>
           <p>
            The police and the judge never asked where he got the children from - it might have led to others involved, and obviously they didn't want to find more perps, especially since he was from an elite family.
