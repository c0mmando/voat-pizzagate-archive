            Thanks. For this.  at least we can count on judicial watch not much more we can count on DC is full of cover ups. fake news and dirty pliticians. I never could of dreamed the government could be as corrupt as they are.

            It might be because I have been sharing the hell out of this ...s#!! i can't post it I would violate rules.  It's an article about election fraud and I linked the screenshot about this:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta: Right, I think how much the government really even understands it is unclear. I think that most of what we know has come from independent sources like Clint Watts, who was a former FBI informer, Army officer who taught at West Point, who actually was tracking ISIS communications, and the communications going out of Syria, and sort of stumbled into the Russian fake news story, and he’s testified on Capitol Hill. I’ve learned more from him than I have from the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta: Well, members of Congress were being briefed, remember that. So, first Harry Reid, and then the Gang of Eight were being briefed, at least they had eyes on what the—what was being—what was coming into the government from both, I think less from the FBI investigation, more from what friendly intelligence services in Europe were feeding back into the U.S. intelligence community. And, I know they were—there was the briefing in early September—nothing public came of that. I think that Senator Reid at the time was sort of pointing a finger in that direction, but there was nothing official from the government. And finally, in early October, they released that statement that I mentioned. We, of course, didn’t have eyes on that, and I don’t think it would have been appropriate for them to be briefing us on it. And we weren’t pressuring them, because I think, again, they would have not believed it was appropriate for us to be in—
           </p>
           <p>
            Glasser: What—it would have seemed political.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta: Well, it would have been political.
           </p>
           <p>
            Glasser: Yes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta: So, I think what we were trying to do was to make our case in public, not in private to the government, that what was going on was unprecedented, and you know, again, the break-in of the DNC computers, when you think about the way the media handled a bunch of bungling burglars going into the DNC in 1972, the fact that the Russians did it electronically, you know, using cyberweapons was just—there wasn’t in, you know, in my mind, a balance. I think, to be fair, to the media now, I think they learned something from that, and they’re aggressively, you know, trying to approach what happened, and what’s going on in these investigations with great vigor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Glasser: OK, so you’ve brought up the spectacle of Watergate, which takes us back to, in a weird way, the present day, and the question of what to make of all this. But just quickly, to finish up on your own email, knowing what you know now, would you have done something different? I mean, you clicked on this link; did you have any idea? Have you ever had any exposure to cyberhacking like this before?
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta: You know, look, there’s a long, complicated story about that. I had assistants that had access to the link. One of them checked what—one of them saw this question, changed the password, asked our cybersecurity expert. He inadvertently told her to click on it, and she did. So, I don’t blame them. I mean, it was, you know, a fast-moving campaign. It’s easy to say, oh, if you’ve already done this and that and the other thing—I think we’re—I’m, you know, I’ve been around for a while. I’m fairly careful. I don’t just go click on random links, and—but, you know, if—I’m sure that if I had gotten the advice to go ahead and click on it, I probably would have done it, too, so you know, it is what it is. And people make mistakes. And if you look—if you think about it, the Bundestag has been hacked, you know, the Norwegian defense department has been hacked, the White House was hacked by the Russians, and the State Department’s been hacked. It’s like, I think you can’t come back and blame the victim for this. This was a crime; it was painful. You know, I thought I was, you know, had a relatively secure profile. It turned out I didn’t, but a lot of other people have fallen prey to fairly sophisticated hackers that are operating under Russian intelligence. In this case, most likely, from the GRU, but it’s Russian military intelligence. It’s pretty sophisticated, so they did this. So, it is what it is. I can’t really beat myself up or beat my team up over that. I just have to move on, and you know, they committed a crime. I was a victim of the crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            And he is full of sh%= that Norwegians are also victims of these mysterious Russians.  He is only making that claim because of this:
           </p>
           <p>
            Norwegian police have filed charges against 51 individuals involved in a grotesque paedophilia ring thought to be one of the largest child sexual abuse cases in the nation's history.
Dubbed ‘Operation Dark Room', the police action revealed a number of atrocities against children as young as infancy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police seized 150 terabytes of data material in the form of photos, movies and chat transcripts between members of various paedophile networks.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The material shows the abuse of children of all ages, including infants,” Hilde Reikrås, the head of Operation Dark Room, said at a press conference on Sunday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reikrås also gave examples of the scope of the horrific abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The material shows, among other things, the penetration of toddlers, children being tied up, children having sex with animals and children having sex with other children,” she said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Twenty of the 51 people involved in the cases were arrested by the Western Police District. The other 31 people are from other police districts across Norway, and those cases are still under investigation. An additional individual is also under investigation abroad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police stressed that their operation uncovered not just one paedophilia network, but several.
           </p>
           <p>
            “We have the clear perception that like-minded individuals met with each other in the so-called dark net, where they could talk with one another and cultivate their interest in children in peace,” Reikrås said.
           </p>
           <p>
            “There are several highly educated [individuals] with high IT skills. They've used encryption and anonymity to hide their tracks,” head police prosecutor Janne Ringset Heltne said at the Sunday press conference. She also said that all of the perpetrators involved are men.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the involved men had a pregnant girlfriend and discussed plans with another man to sexually abuse the child once it was born, police said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the accused men also live-streamed their abuse online and performed atrocities with their own children.
           </p>
           <p>
            The accused include two current or former elected officials, one teacher and a lawyer.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to VG, Norwegian police began their investigation after receiving a tip-off from the FBI, whose agents had managed to hack their way into one of the paedophilia sites and track its users.

             And the Harry Reid reference I am guessing is about when I pointed out on Trump's Facebook timeline that I thought Mitt Romney was a bad idea to become Secretary of State.  It was a bad idea and I am so glad that he listened to all the thousands of people who were pointing out the guy's character defects.  My reasoning was that I saw an article claiming Harry Reid was a pedo.  Then it turned out by reading the other articles that the source for that news story was some top person at a company called Bain Capital.  Mitt Romney owned Bain Capital and the reason I knew that is because Bain Capital owned hundreds of these f'd up juvenile torture prison programs/ " Emotional Growth Schools" and I went to one of them.
             <br/>
             But about Romney, he demonstrates bad character when he said that about Reid BECAUSE Hello!  If he is one, he should have said something as soon as he found out! Not saved it and used it for political opportunity when Harry Reid asked why he didnt pay taxes back when he ran against Obama.  And if it's a lie, well obviously that is really F'd up too.  So I did post that with links on Trump's timeline and maybe Reid thought there was an internal leak.  Nope.  Just found it on a random Google Search going dow the line googling random politician names and the word pedophile.  It was Pizzagate seasin, after all.

              And I am not suicidal nor do I take fentanyl or any opiate derived crap so if anyone hears that, it's BS.  I don't drive and can't cook so no gas leak explosions or car wrecks !  It would look pretty stupid to get rid of some crazy conspiracy theorist like me who just repeats some " fake" Russian news.  I must be a Russian.  Oh wait, nope.  My Grandpa almost got killed by Russians in WW2 though They want us to be paranoid over Bullcrap like ISIS , Russia, false flag terror crap and that is their bread and butter.  World war three paranoia sells a lot of missiles.   I am saying something because my Grandpa, a partisan fighter for Latvia, wanted to be an American citizen so bad because we have a Constitution here.  Anyone who loves the USA and hates the insane people who have seized control of much of our government has the duty to speak the truth.  I am so over the Russia crapaganda.  Trump is not my first choice for President.  I'll be honest.  But he has way more supporters than the KKKlintons and since the DNC took away our choice, then who is she to try and get Trump impeached? The military war complex has been running our country into the ground for waaay too long.  Bernie knows it.  I hope Trump starts to realize it.  The establishmentarians are a lost cause, however.  They are beyond help.None of us should be arguing with each other because it is us vs them.  I just want this planet to be decent for my kids and I want these pedophiles where they belong.

             Upvoated because I see what you're going for and you're right, but technically there is no such thing as "civil murder", and the term "charges" only refers to criminal actions prosecuted by the State. Because the enemy country does not allow private prosecutions, the term "civil charges" is self-contradictory.
            </p>
            <p>
             The correct terminology would be "They should sue for wrongful death".

             Judicial Watch must be cool because I have been sharing theur article and I made some pretty controversial yet absolutely true claims.  If they didn't appreciate the truth, they would have taken that article down and I would not be able to make it the basis for my quest to spread the word about the need to take back our elections from the estblishment.
