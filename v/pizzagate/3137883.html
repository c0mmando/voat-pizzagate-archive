<blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, John Podesta, played a central role in another potential Russian collusion scandal that has not yet been investigated.</p>
<p>Podesta, the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, served on the board of Joule Unlimited, a now defunct alternative energy company, from January 2011 to January 2014. He resigned from the company’s board to accept the powerful job of Counselor to President Barack Obama.</p>
<p><strong>During Podesta’s tenure on the board of Joule Unlimited, a significant investment in the company by a firm owned by the Russian government escaped review and scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).</strong></p>
<p><strong>In September 2011, eight months after Podesta joined the board of Joule Unlimited, Rusnano, a venture capital fund wholly owned by the Russian government, announced it was investing one billion Russian rubles, $35 million, in the company, which accounted for 46 percent of the $75 million invested in it up to that time from its launch in 2007</strong>. Founders Afeyan Noubar and Dr. David Berry invested an estimated $10 million in the 2007 first round. The venture firm Noubar heads, Flagship Ventures – now known as Flagship Pioneering – led a second round investment of  $30 million in 2010, as the Boston Globe reported.</p>
<p><strong>Curiously, the CFIUS failed to initiate a review of the transaction despite statutory and administrative guidelines that any such transaction in which a foreign country or foreign company obtained more than a ten percent interest in an American company was reviewable.</strong></p>

            is a good read for joining up dots. "Davis was also a pornographer. In his book Sex Rebel, he wrote excitedly about having sex with minors. Pedophilia was not unusual for Communists of the era: Harry Hay, another Communist and associate of Davis, was reportedly an advocate of NAMBLA, the National Man-Boy Love Association."  "Auchi and Tony Rezko were partners in real estate and pizza."

            Plus this alleged Biden collusion:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Ukrainian to US prosecutors: Why don't you want our evidence on Democrats?
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Ukrainian law enforcement officials believe they have evidence of wrongdoing by American Democrats and their allies in Kiev, ranging from 2016 election interference to obstructing criminal probes. But, they say, they’ve been thwarted in trying to get the Trump Justice Department to act.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kostiantyn Kulyk, deputy head of the Prosecutor General’s International Legal Cooperation Department, told me he and other senior law enforcement officials tried unsuccessfully since last year to get visas from the U.S. embassy in Kiev to deliver their evidence to Washington.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ukrainian businessmen “authorized payments for lobbying efforts directed at the U.S. government,” he told me. “In addition, these payments were made from funds that were acquired during the money-laundering operation. We have information that a U.S. company was involved in these payments.” That company is tied to one or more prominent Democrats, Ukrainian officials insist.
           </p>
           <p>
            Financial records showing a Ukrainian natural gas company routed more than $3 million to American accounts tied to Hunter Biden, younger son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, who managed U.S.-Ukrainian relations for the Obama administration. Biden’s son served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings;
           </p>
           <p>
            Records that Vice President Biden pressured Ukrainian officials in March 2016 to fire the prosecutor who oversaw an investigation of Burisma Holdings and who planned to interview Hunter Biden about the financial transfers
           </p>
           <p>
            Ukrainian officials say they don’t want to hand the evidence to FBI agents working in Ukraine because they believe the bureau has a close relationship with NABU and the U.S. embassy. “
           </p>
           <p>
            Kulyk’s boss, Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, told me he has enough evidence — particularly involving Biden, his family and money spirited out of Ukraine — to warrant a meeting with U.S. Attorney General William Barr. “I’m looking forward to meeting with the attorney general of the United States in order to start and facilitate our joint investigation regarding the appropriation of another $7 billion in U.S. dollars with Ukrainian legal origin,” Lutsenko said.

             One Degree Of Separation: Ruben Varadanyan Has Connections To John Podesta (Joule Company), And Prince Charles (Prince Charities Foundation)
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Vardanyan is close to Putin. He founded the biggest Russian investment bank after the Soviet Union collapsed, and later sold it to the Russian state. He regards himself as a philanthropist. And we all know what that means.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was on the Joule Board when Podesta was there, and is connected to Prince Charles (good buddy of notorious pedo Jimmy Savile). Vardanyan sends Armenian pupils to a British heritage site which Charles was able to buy with Vardanyan's money (money laundered money it seems).

             Enron was into wind farms. Many were built in upper state NY , ME and Vt. The one that built in ME, was First Wind. ...which I was told had a lot of mid level management from Enron.They built a wind farm very close to my house so I researched ...esp. after noticing state govt. and First Wind reps . lied with abandon, so much it was self destructive to themselves...Wind farms were a democratic scam on the American people. The first one built in ME and a few others were financed by Deutsche bank, United Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse........the turbines for wind farms cost millions and only last 20 years...The target market was Boston , Mass. The turbines cannot be close to people because they cause severe physical ailments ...irregular heart beat , insomnia etc. many many serious symptoms...a group home for developmentally disabled had to move after the first one was built as there was an increase in seizure activity.Power is lost for every mile of transmission. Although cap and trade never was passed in congress, New England got them. Illegally. There is an increased incidence of leukemia in children who live under the huge transmission lines necessary to transmit the power....the wind has to blow twenty miles an hour for them to even make power......ride in a car at that speed and hold your hand out the window. ...rare...AND there is no way to store the power. So all the lawmakers so eager to pass legislation to make them possible had to be bought off.ME had a gov. Baldacci who sold his soul to usher them in. Deutsche bank has been sued in several European countries for their part in the scam. Upper state ME had  a state legislator who was very pro wind farm....he had about 6 rental properties and home mortgage with Deutsche bank. Former gov. of Conn. and now senator Richard Blumenthal sued FERC for a million dollars worth of energy charged to rate payers but was never produced. The real money is in Renewable Energy Credits........this is what the Paris Accords are all about.......First Wind, the corporation which built in NY and ME at first included in their SEC report, wind farms do not have to produce energy to make money. Who knows where the money from renewable energy goes to........but I have a feeling it is the super super rich. Certainly not the people...Oh, another reason that wind farms have to be built away from people? Property values plummet for those who live around them + the many health issues. ME had 2 big power companies which at the time of the wind farm heist were sold to foreign corporations. ...all this was about 14 years ago when it started. Word has gotten around enough that they no longer try to build the monstrocities like they used to........now it goes, new transmission lines are needed for hydro power out of Canada.......Queen still has a lot of influence there ....and with the current news showing queen tried to interfere with US elections.......wouldn't it be better to use US hydropower which works?  Oh...2 hedge funds owned First Wind...big share holder in one was Rahm Emanuel.........the other big share holder was Larry Summers........who even worked as a marketing director for it while holding down a job in the obomba administration...until this fact was made public...then he quit... Both heavily tied into clintons , bill and hill.

              One more thing, someone found out how much power was used in ME by wind farms...they were the #1 user of power. ..next being Eastern Maine Medical hospital and paper mills. So, this proved they were USING power not producing it. It takes a mighty big village to pull off this kind of heist. And the democrats USED to have that power...........and Deutsche bank lost when sued in foreign countries in the EU over renewable energy credits. BUT not in the US...kinda' indicates they have better justice systems.......all newspapers and TV covered for them.
