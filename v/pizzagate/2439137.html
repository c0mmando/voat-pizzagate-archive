Clifford also mentions that this is a common practice amongst well known celebrities.  (He also mentions Simon Cowell.) <a href="https://youtu.be/BBrTOTJRen8">https://youtu.be/BBrTOTJRen8</a></p>
<p>So I went googling this hospice..</p>
<p>Interesting to note their patrons  : <a href="https://www.shootingstarchase.org.uk/about-us/patrons/">https://www.shootingstarchase.org.uk/about-us/patrons/</a></p>
<p>So, we have the AlFayed Charitable Foundation who works with them: <a href="https://the-acf.com/who-we-help/childrens-hospices/shooting-star-chase/">https://the-acf.com/who-we-help/childrens-hospices/shooting-star-chase/</a></p>
<p>and then I see Fulham Football Club does too – well, it came up in the google search but the page was removed from the hospice website <a href="https://the-acf.com/our-work-in-action/news/ffcf-and-ssc.aspx">https://the-acf.com/our-work-in-action/news/ffcf-and-ssc.aspx</a> . HOWEVER, the good ol\' way back machine: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503035846/https://the-acf.com/our-work-in-action/news/ffcf-and-ssc.aspx">https://web.archive.org/web/20130503035846/https://the-acf.com/our-work-in-action/news/ffcf-and-ssc.aspx</a></p>

<p>A partnership between Shooting Star CHASE and the Fulham FC Foundation has been welcomed by Mohamed Al Fayed.</p>

<p>For those Brits amongst you, I bet like me when you saw a west London football club mentioned you thought back to the paedophile scandal, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/sexual-abuse-in-football-the-response-from-each-london-club-when-asked-about-the-met-police-a3420291.html">Sexual abuse in football: The responses from each London club when asked about the Met police investigation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four Premier League clubs and five in the Football League from London are being investigated by Scotland Yard over claims of historical sexual abuse in football.</p>
<p><strong>A total of 30 London clubs</strong>, many of them amateur, are being investigated by the Met, with 106 separate allegations of abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Evening Standard asked various London clubs if they were amongst the clubs being investigated.  The response from Fulham FC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FULHAM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is your club among those the Metropolitan Police is investigating?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> “Due to ongoing investigations by a number of police forces into allegations of non-recent child abuse at professional clubs, it would not be appropriate to provide information on the matter at this time.”</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Have you received any allegations of sexual abuse at your club?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> “Due to ongoing investigations by a number of police forces into allegations of non-recent child abuse at professional clubs, it would not be appropriate to provide information on the matter at this time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This website came up in the search for paedophilia in west London and mentions AlFayed, Michael Jackson, the Fulham FC, Jill Dando.  I\'m afraid that the articles just scroll and scroll so Ctrl+F is your friend with this page: <a href="https://goodnessandharmony.wordpress.com/tag/fulham-f-c/">https://goodnessandharmony.wordpress.com/tag/fulham-f-c/</a></p>
<p>Bizarrely, Alfayed had a statue of Michael Jackson erected outside the Fulham club : <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1372985/Mohammed-Al-Fayed-defends-Michael-Jackson-statue-Craven-Cootage.html">\'Anyone who doesn\'t like it can go to hell\': Mohammed Al-Fayed defends 7ft 6ins Michael Jackson statue at Craven Cottage</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Al-Fayed, 78, commissioned the statue following the singer\'s death in June 2009 and originally planned to place it in Harrods before selling the department store. </p>
<p>Many football fans have been bemused by the placing outside the West London club, believing the so-called link between the singer and team isn\'t strong enough to warrant such a statue. </p>

<p>I\'m sure there\'s more if anyone cares to look.</p>',

            This is so Bleeping Obvious.  The evidence is huge.  Also, I am taking it to mean this is the same Al-Fayed that would have become the father-in-law of Princess Diana and grandfather to her and Dodi's soon to be born baby.  Holy Cow.

                Yeah, I thought of that too.  But I would have to be living in a dream world.  Walking around in a fog or daze.  Knowing what we now know, we will never be able to block it from our minds.  It's really kind of a huge cloud hanging over our heads that never goes away.  Always following us everywhere.

              Millionaire vice-president of Chelsea, Phillip Carter,  died in a helicopter crash (the twin-engined Squirrel, which was previously owned by North Wales Police) on his way back from watching the team’s Champions League semi-final defeat.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mr Carter, a lifelong Chelsea fan, was a close friend of Matthew Harding, the club’s former vice-chairman and major benefactor, who also died in a helicopter crash 11 years ago in similar circumstances. Both Mr Carter and Mr Harding were travelling in twin-engined Squirrel helicopters
             </p>
             <p>
              Jill Dando had been probing the death of Chelsea millionaire Matthew Harding
             </p>
             <p>
              Harding funded New Labour and was close to Blair and Mandelson.
             </p>
             <p>
              He may have stumbled across the paedophile network and it’s links to Mossad and wanted out. Shortly before his death he made a large donation to the NSPCC for boys abused in care. Peter Mandelson is the president of the NSPCC
             </p>
             <p>
              Jill Dando started her own investigation into Matthew Harding’s mysterious death. A few months later, she was dead too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Peter Mandelson had multiple entries in convicted billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s black book.
             </p>
             <p>
              Esther Rantzen is a trustee of the NSPCC.

Six other people were also arrested, 13 properties were raided and £1m in cash seized as part of Operation Bannock, an HMRC-led investigation involving police officers from across the UK, as well as investigators on the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
