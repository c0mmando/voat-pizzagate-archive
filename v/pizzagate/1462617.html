<p>The above linked article is from January 22, 2008</p>
<p>quote from article: “”Take a look at the fact that Both Bill and Hillary make tons of bucks from their extensive involvement with Dubai. Why is that bad? Well besides being a leader in the movement to boycott Israel, DubaiHong Kong” of the Arab world. and major commerce and shipping point for the “business-side” of terrorism.””</p>
<p>Business side?   We’ve already established that child/sex trafficking is the biggest commodity and the Arab nation has a well-known acceptance of child sex. </p>
<p>Quote article: “”Bill and Hilary are major friends of Dubai, to the point where the Clinton Foundation have established Dubai Study departments in universities in the US and London. They worked hard at granting legitimacy to this Jew-hating, terrorist supporting nation. is the ” Clinton isn’t alone in legitimizing Dubai. Other FOBs including disgraced former National Security Adviser Sandy (I’ve got papers in my socks) Berger, ex-Secretary of State Madeline Albright and Al and Tipper Gore – have attended highly publicized events there. Republican ex-Sen. Bob Dole and Democratic ex-Rep. Tom Downey lobby for Dubai; so does The Glover Park Group, home of Hillary Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson and former President Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart. No one is as involved as to the extent of the Clintons. According to San Francisco Examiner columnist P.J. Corkery,  “”</p>
<p>What’s the connection of these names, finances, data  in the below attached Dubai information? </p>
<p>Quote from article:&gt;&gt; “Clinton makes $10 million a year from Yucaipa a Dubai firm. Ron Berkle, the owner of Yucaipa companies and a major fund-raiser for Bill and Hillary. And then there is the Clinton connection to the world’s biggest exporter of terrorism, Saudi Arabi”</p>
<p>Quote:  “The royal family of Saudi Arabia gave the Clinton facility in Little Rock about $10 million, roughly the same amount it gave toward the presidential library of George H.W. Bush.”</p>
<p>(($10 million for a library???)  really?    
</p>
<p>Quote:   “”the Saudis are heavily involved in providing funding and educational materials for students in the United States about the Middle East. According to Stanley Kurtz, The United States government gives money – and a federal seal of approval – to a university Middle East Studies center. That center offers a government-approved K-12 Middle East studies curriculum to America’s teachers. But in fact, that curriculum has been bought and paid for by the Saudis, who may even have trained the personnel who operate the university’s outreach program. Meanwhile, the American government is asleep at the wheel – paying scant attention to how its federally mandated public outreach programs actually work. So without ever realizing it, America’s taxpayers end up subsidizing – and providing official federal approval for – K-12 educational materials on the Middle East that have been created under Saudi auspices.””</p>
<p>What?  Where is the evidence that students in the US have educational materials about the middle east that reflects this heavy funding? </p>
<p>Quote: “” According to a 1993 New York Times article, Prince Turki bin Feisal was a college classmate of Bill’s at Georgetown University and (at the time of the article’s writing) was the head of the Saudi Arabian intelligence service. While he was still governor of Arkansas, it looks like Bill Clinton cashed in on that relationship, “work[ing] hard to secure a multimillion-dollar Saudi donation to a Middle Eastern studies program at the University of Arkansas.”</p>
<p>Why am I not surprised there are schools involved.  How much of this is legit and how much is a front? </p>
<p>Quote: “”Due to the intervention of the Gulf War, the first installment of $3.5 million didn’t arrive until 1992, with another $20 million arriving after Bill Clinton’s first inauguration. So a Clinton connection to the Saudis and their money goes back nearly 20 years. While this doesn’t necessarily mean that the Clintons are in the Saudis’ pockets, it does raise the red flag of perceived impropriety and a possible conflict of interest.””</p>
<p>Is there really a conflict of interest?  
</p>
<p>Quote:  “”have been getting a reported $10 million per year from a fund that administers the investments of the Emir of Dubai, the largest component state in the UAE?””</p>
<p>The article ends by saying:  quote: “””Transparency” is not enough. The leaders of our nation must be beyond reproach, both personally and officially, when it comes to dealing with any country – but especially one that espouses fundamentalist Islam. Full disclosure of conflicts of interest from all of our presidential candidates is essential when it comes not only to personal integrity, but to policies that affect our security interests at home and abroad.”””</p>

            We learned yesterday that ownership of Besta-Pizza tax lots goes back to Saudi/Dubai more than 20+ years, that means it goes back to Clinton's first term.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton Foundation was a front for child murder, slavery, and snuff films. Remember the messages founds where you could take your order of children being murdered on video as an APP, I'm sure the main consumer was Saudi/Dubai, they love that stuff.

              I think the DC saudi story is the APP we found they sadistically butcher  children for DUBAI/SAUDI on video, and these rich arab's masturbate to snuff films of DC children (white) being slaughtered, as to sex slaves, they're full to the gill with children from Syria, &amp; Ukraine. Whorehouses in Israel are over-flowing with children, the price in Athens for Sex has dropped to a Euro because there is so many hungry people, and sex is all they have to sell.

              All wars are banker wars, and bankers want sex, &amp; power, and snuff films.
