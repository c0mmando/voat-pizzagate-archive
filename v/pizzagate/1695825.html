            Graham James was his name. He was a coach for several youth hockey teams. He had several players make it to the NHL including Theon Flurrey and Sheldon Kennedy. He molested a lot of kids and as far as sports go especially hockey in Canada this is just the tip of the iceberg. These guys are the lucky few that actually made it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like most, they never go reported. I have no doubt that Hockey Canada as a list just like the Boy Scouts had/have a list as does the Vatican. Any group that deals with young kids especially in settings away from their parents - is most likely to turn into an exploitative situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have played at a decent level in hockey in Canada and there are good people there that love the sport and want to help and teach then there are the Graham James' of the world.

             It should have been the Canadian dream. A kid from a small prairie town is scouted by a famous Junior-A coach. The coach mentors and tutors him all the way to an NHL dream career.  Except the coach was Graham James, a now-infamous sexual predator whose behavior was abetted and ignored through two Western League coaching stints and one in Europe.  And the kid was Sheldon Kennedy, a National Hockey League player whose self-destructive behavior finally made sense when he came out to the world as a survivor of sex abuse at the hands of James, his coach with the Swift Current Broncos.

            <em>
             Kennedy, who traded his star athlete status for a challenging job of role model, is the sometimes-uncomfortable star of Joshua Rofé’s riveting documentary Swift Current.  As filmed by Rofé, Kennedy’s is a redemption story of stops and starts, of a dream turned nightmare, wounded families and one man’s determination to take back his life despite repeated setbacks.  “You sink or swim, and ultimately I chose to swim,” Kennedy says. “We know the social impact of abuse and we now know how it affects the brain. Going to a counselor a couple of times isn’t enough.”  Rofé’s previous acclaimed documentary Lost For Life looked at a background of childhood abuse that violent criminals shared. He finds echoes of that theme with Kennedy’s lapses – alcohol and drug abuse, substance-related auto accidents, etc., – that continued to pull him down even after he’d become a hero and rollerbladed across Canada to raise awareness and money for sexual abuse victims.

           <p>
            *Kennedy’s final, successful stint in rehab put him on a path that led to his being awarded the Order Of Canada this year.  Turning his lens afield, Rofé also profiles Graham Jolicouer and Mikki Decker two young people whose experiences (with a predator ‘family friend’ and an incestuous father respectively) lead them to connect with Kennedy and his message at a university speaking engagement.  “Sheldon is a survivor, and an amazingly self-aware spokesman for the cause of dealing with trauma,” Rofé says. “He talks about the long-term effects of child abuse in a way no one else, to my knowledge, ever has on film.” *

            Thanks for sharing this. It's a devastating indictment of Pedophilia and anyone who for even one second thinks adult men fucking boys is ok.
           </p>
           <p>
            Theo Fluery could be one of our "battle flags" in this sordid fight against sexualizing children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophiles are heartless and selfish narcissists. They can't understand the utter devastation they're wreaking on these kids who are too young and too naive to defend themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            God Bless everybody and lets remember Theo Fluery the next time we get flak from some fucking heartless CTR/ShareBlue shill who thinks covering for the sick fucks on the Dark Side is a worthwhile endeavor.

            I was thinking about this a few months back. Apparently pedophilia is rife in little league hockey but it's kept quiet because the coaches produce results. Which brings to mind what Cathy O'brien said about MKUltra victims being groomed to be athletes. A victim is easily able to compartmentalize being tired as they've had much practice compartmentalizing sexual abuse.
