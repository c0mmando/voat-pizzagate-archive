            Yes Pizzagate is fake news. I am glad that Mr. Obama is cracking down on fake news. You folks will be chasing chem trails, bigfoot, and 9/11 again in a month or so. Pizzagate is fading out...like fake news always does.

            A story from a local news source:

            Can't seem to find this story anywhere in the MSM as they must consider it "fake news" given the potential implications.

             P.I.C.T.U.R.E.S. undeniable photo or video footage. most of the places this stuff is carried out are outfitted with mics and vid cams;  all of Epstein's places were; they pulled stuff from his Florida mansion. gotta be somewhere. Same with all those other prime time pedo busts. Is there somebody on the inside with a conscience? Anybody?

             Yes the "royals" are involved I'm sure. However, they are just big pieces in a bigger puzzle. Power over others is the drug of choice of those who seek or wish to maintain power. The only solution is people taking responsibility for themselves. Unfortunately people are lazy and easily lead, while others are happy to lead and in turn exploit.

             This is why the lgbt homo agenda has been in fast forward...
They know that once gay marriage becomes the orthodox they can move onto the next process which is the age of consent.
Check the anagram used that they operated openly with in the 70s and 80's.Surely the sexual revolution was just wedging the door open to role in their deviations.

              With the introduction of transgender children (BBC documentary / I am Jazz), they are trying to reboot the idea that children are able to have sexual orientations/desires, etc....
             </p>
             <p>
              They tried to normalize child sexuality with filthy piece of shit Kinsey (quack - pseudo scientist)
             </p>
             <p>
              they want to bring back the ideology popular during the industrial revolution- children would pretty much have an adult life (clothing/smoking/sex/work)...

                   he does not understand the agenda or he is partner to the agenda......when you look at the group P.I.E that existed openly post flower power ,you see that there are homosexuals that meet and BELEIEVE that age of consent should be fluid.

                     There are some on the forum that are jamming...which is the 2nd motion of the gay agenda...They are working overtime to excise homosexuality with paedophilia.....some are sending AMA studies suggesting that no homosexuals commit paedophilia...these studies are skewed and do not measure per capita ...Their argument is if they molest under the consenting age they are not homosexual..

            All stories I've seen on these pedophile rings show that they are protected by police enforcement, political figures and often aided by justice figures/courts when they are arrested.  We have always known that Mafia organizations enjoy the same kind of protection -- not everywhere at all times -- but quite often.  This shouldn't be a surprise.
What I think is the numbers seem to be reaching terrifying levels.  And, I'm presuming that families involved with generational pedophilia and Satanic ritual are creating more pedophiles than we might naturally have.  NOT everyone who is abused becomes a pedophile.  But some do.  Same with split personalities which have been created by CIAMKULTRA through torture and sexual abuse.  Those personalities can be programmed to do things they would not ordinarily do.  In fact, they are often unaware that they are doing them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd also say this kind of protection is necessary in order for Mafia or pedophiles to flourish and to take control.  Otherwise, they'd quickly be rounded up before they were actually involved in trafficking and jailed.  And, of course, the Mafia also engages in trafficking children and adults.

             It is like the catholic church hierachy.Some people think they are paedophile or the culture is paedophile in the church.
The culture is homosexual with a belief that children can consent.
There are reports that 40 % of jesuits in the USA are closet free homo's.

Once the homo gains position ,he promotes like minded people until the whole heirarchy is filthy lustful deviants.

              No -- Our sexual abusers of children are MALES -- and they are heterosexual males according to studies.
Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
In fact, in earlier days in Hawaii, homosexuals were held in great esteem and honor as caretakers of orphaned children.
             </p>
             <p>
              HOWEVER, this does not mean that if torture or sexual abuse is inflicted upon any individual that they cannot be forced to perform
according to a new program under mind control.

              A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.

              Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.

             <p>
              Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
             </p>
             <p>
              A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
             </p>
             <p>
              Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.

              At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
             </p>
             <p>
              Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
             </p>

              Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.*

A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

               I'll take it further in that I believe even at the age of consent a woman or man that is isolated from the social herd is vulnerable for exploitation.Men are still boys up till 25.
A young girl does not fully understand the ramifications of her decisions.This being a new 20th century way of life.  The family is not in close quarters at all  time....This was one of the attractive upsides of the womens liberation movement....Because the wife had become isolated from her family in another town or across town.She had no women kin to sound out.

               oF COURSE....there are differences between the old grand pa who bounces little grand child on his lap and then crosses the line to a active predator style paedophile or a affiliated paedophiles....I would agree that many if not more are towards the female of the species,I believe that most people are stimulated to fantasy on the thought of what was their first sexual encounter.Hence,why many men return and act towards the post pubescent girl of 14-16......Some men can't deal with the reality that they are not 16 again and act.
                But my point probably echoes what you are saying in that the gay male searches for approval or permission.That is whay these organisations seek to lower the consenting age.Not all homosexual men are of the gay variety,.Many are the high school jock type or the very early sexually advanced...(facial hair at 12).These are the aggressive types and seek to impose themselves.EXAMPLE....the heavy leather fetish.
In many cases of youth rape in the male category, is these men that activate the notion in the effiminate male that he is gay.This causes imbalances in next generational creative types.I have no problem with gay men.It is the agenda that they are being used for that i object to and if that sounds as if i'm against then so be it.
i agree 100% with what you state here but every girl that has lost her virginity prior to 16 can be attributed to be tampered with by a paedophile.Does the study distinguish between molested or just sexed....Men who have been sodomised when young sometimes will have a older man fetish....women as well.

                Witless -- Wow, you have a lot of confusion going on there.  What do you mean by an "affiliated" pedophile?
               </p>
               <p>
                Actually, homosexuals seek adult relationships with other homosexuals.
Our sexual abusers of children are heterosexual males.  Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than 
a homosexual male.  Studies show that to be true.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pedophiles are seeking in a number of ways to try to suggest that pedophilia is something normal. 
However, since pedophilia is actually a sexual assault on a minor -- even babies and toddlers at times -- that is an outrageous 
suggestion.
               </p>
               <p>
                <em>
                 Not all homosexual men are of the gay variety
                </em>
                .... ?  The word "gay" in our culture today actually means homosexual.
               </p>
               <p>
                And this is beyond me to try to straighten out for you . . .

                 I agree 100% the hetero's  are the majority paedophile.....What i mean by affiliated paedophile are those that communicate with each other for the sole purpose of there illegal pursuit....Gay is a term that has become generalized to mean the whole of the male homosexual community.Its roots lie with the effeminate behaviour of those men.....not all gay men have limp wrists..
.My other point is that if a young man finds himself raped in some social situation or institute ,it is usually by one who does not view himself or identifies himself as gay.
I 'm sure you know that young men get raped?......and the rapist is a aggressive sexual male who as i stated does not identify gay.....Do you think the heavy leather freaks consider themselves gay....There are many men that practice homosexuality that dont buy into the stereotype and many on the down low......(because how can the so called gay gene be transfered.
The part about under age girls is reference to the study about people sexual experience.....I'm asking that if a girl wrote on the questionaire they had sex before sixteen were they regarded as being molested even though they consent......that is my point....i'm not going to relieve hetero peds from the equation and neither should the homosexual....
.From the begining my point is the church and paedophlia therein...
Also the study pulled from a small sample of convicted child molester and I get what your saying that the ones who could not find mature relationships homo or hetro.....They were sexually retarded from a psycological perspective.....
I investigated the study and I understand your points.....sorry about my hash of ideas.

                  I don't think homosexuals consider themselves "freaks" -- but there are "lipstick" lesbians -- and there are 
males homosexuals who certainly are not by any means "weak."

                  The POINT about the law which protects girls or males from sexual contact considered to be illegal ....
**is that a 16 year old cannot give consent legally.

                  Catholic pedophile priests are heterosexuals -- not homosexuals.
Pedophilia has to do with the AGE of the victim as the primary attraction -- not the gender.
Though there can be preferences of a pedophile for males or females, or both.
And, as we recall from Father Porter who abused hundreds of children, he also later married, had children -- 
and was trying to sexually impose himself on the children's babysitter.
                  <br/>
                  Many of these pedophiles will also abuse children who are handicapped, in hospitals, or mentally impaired.
I recall one Catholic priest who raped a child lying on his stomach in a body cast recovering from an operation on his spine.
Read something along the same lines about Jimmy Saville in the UK -- notorious.

            Great article to share with skeptics of pizzagate. Two DC officers were arrested in the past couple of years for pimping young girls and child porn. One was found dead in the river soon after being released on house arrest. I posted links to those stories in this thread if interested
