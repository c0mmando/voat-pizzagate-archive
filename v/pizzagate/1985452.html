            If the facts only came to light at the end of Obama's presidency, the timing is not interesting at all.  State Department acted earlier because they aren't pursuing a criminal case like the FBI.  It's not surprising at all the FBI's work would take longer.
           </p>
           <p>
            You seem to be making the claim, they sat on the information.

            Why do you think Trump even knew about this?  Obviously by your own post the US government was taking action against this agency in Dec 2016 and the FBI probably opened its case at least about that time.  The White House/Attorney General can outline certain broad priorities but directing the FBI to act in a specific case would be quite alarming.  This is why there was so much hubbub when Trump kept trying to talk directly to Comey.  The FBI is not there to be the President's police force.

            Uh, not really.   It was not about CHILD ADOPTION!!!!!!  It's about theft of hundreds of millions of dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not about adoption policy unless you actually believe Team Trump held an innocent meeting on with a lawyer close to the Kremlin and then chose to lie about it.  Unless you believe Putin actually had legit concerns about adoption and was not doing as retaliation for the economic sanctions that we're part of the Magnistky Act. The Magnistky Act was named after a Russia tax lawyer who helped uncover a $230 million dollar tax fraud involving officials at the highest levels of government.  He was killed in custody.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Russian lawyer invited to the Trump Tower meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is best known for mounting a multipronged attack against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law so enraged Mr. Putin that he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Under the law, some 44 Russian citizens have been put on a list that allows the United States to seize their American assets and deny them visas. The United States asserts that many of them are connected to fraud exposed by Mr. Magnitsky, who after being jailed for more than a year was found dead in his cell. A Russian human rights panel found that he had been assaulted. To critics of Mr. Putin, Mr. Magnitsky, in death, became a symbol of corruption and brutality in the Russian state.

             Look past that for a minute. The article says there was a meeting with Trump JR and Manaford with a Russian Attorney about ADOPTION. Go past the regular Trump-Russia narrative. Don, JR hasn't denied the meeting. Acknolwedged it!

             I'm wondering if this meeting was PG related, as it had to do with Adoption.

             <p>
              Don JR previously denied this meeting.   In fact, he denied meeting with any Russians.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The previously unreported meeting ..... this episode at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, is the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle during the campaign. It is also the first time that his son Donald Trump Jr. is known to have been involved in such a meeting.........Donald Trump Jr. **had denied participating in any campaign-related meetings with Russian nationals when he was interviewed by The Times in March......Asked at that time whether he had ever discussed government policies related to Russia, the younger Mr. Trump replied, “A hundred percent no. **

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              So he denied meeting with Russians and denied discussing any government policies.
Now he acknowledges meeting with Russians AND discussing a government policy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why?  Because he was confronted with the fact that the Time already had the details of the meeting.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Representatives of Donald Trump Jr. and Mr. Kushner confirmed the meeting after The Times approached them with information about it.

              Jared Kushner was required under oath to list any meetings he had with Russians to get his security clearance and he did not report this meeting.

             <p>
              And guess what.  The Russian woman was also asked about the meeting and she said
             </p>
             <p>
              Ms. Veselnitskaya said the meeting lasted about 30 minutes and focused on
              <strong>
               the Magnitsky Act
              </strong>
              and the adoption issue.  If this is true Donald Trump Jr is lying about this meeting.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Russians adoption issue is not what you think it is.  It's just a way of hitting US citizens after we passed the Magnitsky Act.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's all about this

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The Magnitsky Act, formally known as the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, is a bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. Congress and President Obama in November–December 2012, intending to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009.
              </p>
              <p>
               The main intention of the law was to punish Russian officials who were thought to be responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky by prohibiting their entrance to the United States and their use of its banking system.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The Russians have always discussed this adoption law as "retaliation" for the Magnitsky Act.

              Oh, I read that part and good job seeing it.  Putin's move to end adoption of Russian children to the US and his comments about pedophilia and trafficking at the same time are EXACTLY what the MSM and the Pedo Cult are worried to death about.

             The article may have a headline and a first few paragraphs that stoke the imagination of the impeach-Trump fanatics, but it's pretty complete, and upon reading thoroughly one can draw different conclusions.

              The OP did nothing but plunk a link to an article, not even stating why s/he was doing it. Nor was there any kind of investigative work on if this lawyer's name was linked to any of the known international adoption groups Voat has identified as problematic. I would agree that some articles are complete and don't need anything more than to be posted, but this one did. You know as well as I do that the NYT published it to make add to the Pedosta "Russian collusion" narrative. Like the whole place wasn't wiretapped and like this meeting wasn't known about before. I seriously doubt the claims. But the point is, there should have been follow up. What other meetings did Trump or his son have? How about Ivanka? What about the White House registry? Any other adoption professionals? Make the case for why you're posting.

            So many weird little factoid in this article. Bharara is on Putin's List, and wasn't he just added to Mueller's team? maybe he ought to recuse...

             He is not on Mueller's list.   And that is absolutely no basis for recusal.  Do you want Putin to be able to interfere with US Law enforcement?  Think about the implications.

             Bharara needed to go he was holding onto HRC prosecution with Comey &amp; McCabe. He has the goods on pizzagate but did nothing.

             He also is involved with the Gulenist movement who is bringing massive heroin into the US via Pak..

             BTW the adoption rules were changed when Putin called the Satanic Pedophiles out and on stage in front of world leaders....don't let them fool you. They are scared to death because Putin called them out has the evidence and now so does Trump. Why do you think Gen. Flynn got attacked? He knows

              No. Bharara had to go because he was working a money laundering case tied to the Magnistky fraud.  Some of that stolen money  was invested in NY real estate.

               Yes he is more than biased. Jeff Sessions asked him for his resignation and he refused forcing Trump to fire him then had Comey place reserve seating for him right behind him during Senate testimony. Next forcing Trump to fire Comey setting up the Mueller the with all of them back together again. Disgusting and congress better get rid of them immediatetly. They are all holding back Trump from bringing the pizzagate/pedogate arrests to fruition with their false russia story.

             Hell yes. Trump is definitely one of us. I was skeptical at first but he's playing dumb. He's biding his time and gathering evidence. And if Hillary &amp; Co maintain their current rate of fuck ups they'll show up in front of Trump Tower hands behind their backs in their own handcuffs.
