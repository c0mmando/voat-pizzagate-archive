            This needs more upvoats!! good post!
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the two area's of real weakness for the DC pedo's is the Mcann connection and anything that would tie them to S Korea! As soon as Alefantis and Podesta are forced outside the protective bubble of US MSM they will crumble. I'm thinking of hitting up my mates in Korea to find some good journo's to get them some of this info! Seriously if we can link them before you know it they will be big news in Korea and like I said they won't be able to use the fakenews meme to shut it down. There has been little to no mention of Pizzagate on UK MSM for the simple fact that the fakenews meme won't really work here since Savile scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't forget the UK has just outed the football [soccer] wing of the Elite Pedo Network....
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know about you but I'm getting confident that 2017 will be the downfall of the Elite Pedo system of control! fingers crossed. I think they're afraid of this as well,,,, don't think they thought people would still be digging at this point [I thought it was gonna be over as soon as they shut down the chan's and then reddit]. It makes me happy there are so many dedicated citizen journo's involved now, this is no longer 'fringe'. I remember the day's when David Icke was ridiculed for calling out Savile and the Royals for being satanic pedo's!!

             Well if you hadn't sent me the link to the pictures I couldn't have it.  I still wish I knew where the picture came from.  Was it one on alefantis' Instagram ?  If you do talk to someone in Korea, ask about Zong and his sons from the FBI investigation.  He's supposedly in prison there.

            This article on Park Gyeun-hye shows a picture of Choi Soon-sil, who, IMO, actually is the woman in the Instagram.  She is an occultist who claimed to be able to contact Park Gyeun-hye's mother for "advice".  Shamanism would likely share many common elements with Thelema and "Spirit Cooking" beliefs.

            It is an interesting image to find in an Instagram connected to Alefantis, especially since Podesta received the "pizza.jpg" with the pictures of the two reporters who were in North Korea researching human trafficking:

            Good catch OP.  UpVoat IMO as it is a very clear occult connection tied to North Korea, politics and human trafficking and, once again, Alefantis via MrSoliar.

             Do we know who MrSoliar is? She seems to like the glasses on her head to.  Weird how they knew who this Occultist was.  The ties run deep and long!

             A few of us have been trying to make a connection to what's going on in South Korea with the impeachment of their president who has been consulting with an Occultist.  Several sources consider her to be a Korean version of Rasputin.  I found a picture of this woman in Alefantis' Instagram or at least in the group of instagrams linked to Alefantis.

               Are you being for real! Even the sunglasses are the same.  It's a picture of the Occult leader who they are saying was basically running the country.

               It's the person in the picture who is the Occult leader the people are saying is the puppet master to the president in South Korea that was impeached a few weeks ago.
