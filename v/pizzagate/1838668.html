            Pizza gate isn't about belief.  You believe something when there is ignorance and you just don't know for sure due to lack of physical evidence.  Therefore belief is a choice of perspective.  Pizzagate research (or just research in general) should always remain based on provable verifiable facts.  Please do not bring beliefs into this.

            One thing in the spiritual contest we all benefit is the light, the love, the unity of everything. I do want to take myself into forest to breath that in every know and then, especially for balancing myself after digging into these horrible crimes. I've found it giving positive energy to understand every individual here, and sometimes getting a true feeling we're in this together.

            Hopefully the person who runs the Energetic Synthesis website (Lisa Renee) is genuine in what she believes in.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, if you go to the Home page, one of the slides shows an Egyptian mural with the Eye of Horus (All-seeing Eye).
           </p>
           <p>
            The first slide shows three circles, one of them showing the Star of Remphan and another one showing the Tree of Life (from the Kaballah).
           </p>
           <p>
            Another slide shows what looks like might be the Hindu goddess Kali the destroyer.  I could be wrong though...
           </p>
           <p>
            Not exactly re-assuring, at least to me anyway...

             Yea I've noticed those things. She does seem honest in her writings but with the amount of BS that is being spread everywhere these days it's hard to know who or what to trust, even some readings make it sound as if your intuition can even be a trick so it's one big mind fuck! As for the tree of life there is a bit of information on her site about it, it explains how different dimensions vibrate from it and so on, pretty confusing but worth the read.

            I'd love to meditate to fact check an article like this... To answer your question in topic, it's hard to believe mainly because lack of resources to study or confirm any spiritual knowledge. Love.

           <p>
            I've lived old enough, and met people spiritual enough, to not drop anything, so I'm not sharing this comment to downgrade your post. I'm just thinking it doesn't belong here at this time. It's more of a risk to our case than a helpful add. Humanity in general is not close to such levels yet. 
I suggest you put up a separate subverse here on Voat gathering people interested on this perspective, or maybe join

            Just because it doesn't sound plausible tonis doesnt mean  THEY don't believe in this stuff. Infowars Millie Weaver did some research and found old manuscripts in libraries depicting this entire process.  The images are on infowars. Not having an opened mind is what caused this issue in the first place. So yea, it's a fuxking deep rabbit hole that leads to some unbelievable suit.

            The issue isn't whether we believe it,, it's whether the perpetrators of SRA believe it which they obviously do. I'm thinking of Marina Abramovic Then I suppose there are some who engage in SRA to satisfy their sadistic urges but rationalize their conduct on the need to keep their batteries charged by stealing energy from others. But you don't have to believe in Reptilians ruling the earth; we humans still possess primal, limbic traits that can explain a lot of our aberrant behavior and actions but which we have endeavored to domesticate for the past 200,000 years as there are  collective and selfish benefits to domestication. SRA is a reversion to the feral state of being in my opinion and is wholly unnecessary yet some humans apparently lack the neural sensors indicating satiation. Thus they keep moving through life in a state of never-ending gluttony and primitive urges.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think you advance the cause of Pizzagate by bringing up such matters, in fact you make us look ridiculous. You have made some worthy submissions in the past so I don't understand why you are undermining the energy of your colleagues. I would like to see you follow up your national park/missing children research with the Droop Museum evidence presented by others a few months ago. There might be some connections; there might even be some SRA for you to chew on.

            Psyops originating from DARPA and the CIA do not qualify as pizzagate research.

            In the MKUltra program, during sexual torture often the handlers dressed in "alien costumes"--they used pain, sleep derivation, and hypnosis to bolster this in the damaged minds of the survivors. There is documentation on this from years ago.

            You might also wish to research Project Bluebeam, though most of the good stuff about that has been scrubbed and people who told about it have been murdered.

            While you may very well have a case and point for this theory VOAT/v/pizzagate is NOT the place to pitch it.  Your intentions seem honest but this is not the place.  We are here to investigate and uncover corrupt politicians that participate in child trafficking, abuse and worse.  Was JFK killed by Oswald? Fuck no, but I'm not here to explain to you why oswald DIDN'T act alone.

               Thank you! I think these paintings and all the other reptile imagery and symbolism that these people praise Shld be more than enough for ppl to question this. Even the guy who did the #Avosecrets shows the reptilian theme, the damn church even looks like a lizard laying flat.

             It's a rather mind blowing rabbit hole, if you take a walk i'm sure you'll come across some interesting things. The site that the article is on has some great reads if you find the link for Negative Alien Agenda (NAA).
