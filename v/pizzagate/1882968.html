            I really don't think this is a left/ring wing thing. It's about freedom. Freedom for kids to not be literally fucked. Adults do not have the freedom to fuck children, just like they don't have the freedom to fuck other adults who do not consent, because kids cannot consent since they are kids. How fucking hard is this to understand?!

             123r thanks for letting us know about the info. Your right this is about freedom and what should never be allowed because it denies the freedom to have a innocent childhood. But it also covers a political tactic called the big tent policy adopted by the Democrats at LBJ insistence. That policy was adopted by the republican some 20 to 30 years later so when you see people tying the left to issues about pedophilia it is only because the right are years behind them in the political manipulation for the advancement of pedo rights. It does not imply there are more pedos in the one party then the other. The pedos are everywhere. But it our left who has pushed teaching sex acts to our smallest school kids. It is the left who keeps pushing the envelop on sex education and outright sex propaganda to our children, which is where Blair White becomes involved. I have watched and been appalled by this perverse subversion of education while I raised my own children and I assure you it was never endorsed by the right. The main purpose of this education madness is to get our kids to calmly and curiously accept the advances of the pedos. Seriously why would any middle school kid need to know how to give a blow job or preform anal sex? This is part of the grooming process. It is and has been one of the  US leftist agendas for over a generation now and fits in with their goal of destroying western culture. Yes this is about freedom and the destruction of freedom and the globalist leftist are deeply invested in this cause. Thank you again for your time and effort. I hope you can see past any difference of opinion to consider this with an open mind. Good luck to you.

              I remember learning how to put a condom on by watching a public health nurse demonstrate it with a wooden thing that looked waaaay too large to be an actual penis. Though at the time I had never seen an adult penis, or really any penis apart from a two-second look at a naked toddler running around a changeroom. This was fifth grade. Even at the time I thought it was kinda o.o and I was a very open and curious kid... Years later I learned one of the kids in my class (it was a grade 5-6 split) was having sex for money.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think middle school is an okay age to learn about condom use, but just in a general sense, like "this is a condom, you use it to protect yourself against STDs and pregnancy, and no you can't re-use it. If you need one, please go to the office and pick some up or you can go to the Public Health office." Then when they go, they can get some counselling. Like "So you're interested in sex, eh?" and the adult can see whether it's youth hormones and curiosity or a sign that they have been abused.

               I am old and it is easy to see things that are connected when you watch them for many years. When my kids were young the push in the schools was to question authority and strip power from the parents and legitimatize gay sex. In one generation many states went from the level of teaching that you were exposed, to teaching middle school kids how to preform anal sex. Not all schools but still many did. Now look at the teenage and younger birthrates compared to those of the past. The more we teach to younger kids the worst the problem gets. That teaching comes from many sources like schools, parents, pears, perverts and of course the US pedo factory Hollywood. The main line of defense these kids have in this issue is the line our lobbyist controlled Government has tried it's best to weaken. The parents. If we really wanted a more positive effect on under age birth rates and STDs we would give the parents more tools to work with not strip them of their power. Look at the number of pedos arrested who are teachers. These are some of the very same people who are teaching Sex Ed to our children and this is the way they want it. Now consider the number of pedos working in the school system compared to the number of pedo fathers who get their daughters knocked up. The excuse the leftist controlled school systems and their leftist unions used to strip parents of their power and then gave that power to the schools was, we have to protect the children from pedo parents. But in doing so they gave that power to uncountable pedos who do next  to nothing in their employment screening to ensure their number is free from pedophiles. The two Ytubers that Blair made reference to are very young in my eyes. Who taught them to like kids and that it was ok? Who had the power to teach them this was wrong and failed at the job? This is just how I see this through these old eyes. 123r, Good luck.

             Yes they are. I believe this was all part of the plan only Hillary got her ass handed to her. They still hope to be legalized and are still pushing their agenda and this is some of why free speech is intolerable to them. I am waiting for them to start using the old prohibition argument. You know, in order to control it we need to legalize it malarkey.
