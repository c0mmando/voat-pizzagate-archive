<p>The United States government placed an unknown number of Central American migrant children into the custody of human traffickers after neglecting to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a Senate report released on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2013, tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors traveled to the U.S. southern border, in flight from poverty and gang violence in Central America. At least six of those children were eventually resettled on an egg farm in Marion, Ohio, where their sponsors forced them to work 12 hours a day under threats of death. Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.</p>
<p>“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”</p>
<p>As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters. The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.</p>
<p>The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required. However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.</p>
<p>The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.</p>',

            You can't lose 100's of thousands of children. Do they get their own apartments? Are 100's of thousands taking care of missing children? Nope. Just how do the sheeple reason? And for organization who are children's welfare, to admit they don't keep records of missing children simply means they don't care how many are missing and where they are. This is not difficult to understand. Blatant child churning machine. If 900 thousand go missing every year, in 5 years you have 4.5 million missing. where are they? See thousands of missing kids walking around your hood?

             About 30 years ago I was seeing a therapist. We became close and she told me this: she went to a conference, a gathering of police from all across the U.S., they were there to discuss the missing child epidemic. They were told by the FBI that it had discovered THE cause of the massive number of missing kids. The reason? I was singular. Satanic sacrifices.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is an absolutely true story. This therapist is very well respected and a serious person.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is by we don't see the kids running around on the streets.

            That's a lot of children to lose track of. I can only imagine slavery is alive and well in the USA. There should be some accountability for where these kids were placed. This is just a lack of caring or an intentional move to traffick more children.

             Here is a good article that discusses where that number of 1500 migrant kids unaccounted for comes from. The info is towards the end of the article, but basically says the kids aren't actually missing, but that their parents/relatives they were placed with did not return the 30 day post placement follow up telephone call from DHS. True? Not true? Who knows, but this appeared to be a pretty balanced and well researched article.

              I don't think people want to hear that about Obama.  There are people I talk to and they agree he was not what they had hoped for, but when I expand to include some of the things we post here, they shut down.  But people are shutting down on many things.  They just don't want to know about heinous things.  They will watch them in movies, but real life, NOpe.  Brain Dead.

                Yes, it does, but for those of us here, we have been hurt over and over by the truth, but we still keep seeking it out.  I think they have been conditioned. By what I have not decided.  But we here have opened our minds.  Theirs are closed.

            The question is, Where the heck are those 90K children.  They are hiding the numbers on everyday missing children as runaways or that they have returned when in fact, I bet they have not.  They are good at Creative Math.  Thousands have been lost within the foster care programs as well.  What a Nasty Shameful Business HHS is running.

               From all I've seen, when the government "loses" something, they really mean they gave it to someone else. Like, for example, supplies our government has "lost" that ISIS has recovered in previous years.

                I see what you mean.  Yes, they certainly have a strange way of leaving things around.  Very careless with our own people also.  They certainly don't care whether those people are "found" or not.  They don't really even care for their own.  They would give them up in a heartbeat for the "cause".

                  Yeah, well in their case it is deliberate.  They have been doing it for decades, unfortunately.  Without our knowledge. The problem is how to get them to stop.  There are more of us than them but so many are still asleep.

                In the mid-1990's, President Bill Clinton denounced Illinois as the Calcutta of the child-welfare system, but after a class-action lawsuit and a reduction in the number of foster children from 52,000 to about 23,000, the Federal Department of Health and Human Services called it the ''Illinois Miracle,'' and asked the state to mentor others.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's Worse!!! just did the exact math on that and OH BOY was I off.  It was 29K Children.  Where did they go?  A Reduction. To Where?  No explanation.  There never is.

                I know that these words are used over and over and by me as well.   It gets to the point where somehow the words do not seem evil enough.  I guess it is because we have been at this so long and have read about so much.  Evil Incarnate.

                 That's true. One wonders why these emails were allowed to leak to the public.I know this isn't a popular opinion, but i have seen evidence that Wikileaks and Assange are controlled opposition. Those emails were leaked for a reason. I wonder if they are simply getting us so used to their evil that finally  we won't have any reaction at all. And judging by the response to WalMart/Merkley, I think we have reached that point. That is why i believe humans can't do anything to counteract this, and why God sends Jesus to help us out.

                  I fully believe that if Wikileaks was 100% independent from any government influence, Assange would have turned up dead a long time ago.  The scary thing is, that dude doesn't even need to be in on it to be used as controlled opposition.  In fact, it would behoove the handling organization to let him keep up the fiction in his own mind that's he's the hero of his story, and feed him whatever info they want to see him publish.

                   Exactly. He was raised in a cult, he was fodder to be used in this way.

                  <p>
                   We are to believe he is enemy number one of the U.S., that, like Snowden, the CIA really really wants him but they just can't get to him? Lol. Snowden was interviewed by NBC news in person, in Russia, but the CIA couldn't get him. Ok.

                  <p>
                   What I've noticed is that whenever questions arise about Assange, like when Steve Pzeniac came out and stated that Assange leaked on behalf of US Intel, instead of ever addressing the discrepancy, suddenly there is some drama - in this case it was of a series of disappearing acts and th script is flipped, the questions are forgotten, people join in vigils for him. He reappears and never ever explains to his adoring fans where he was or what happened. From what I can tell he thrives on drama or depends on it to keep the story going. If the CIA wanted him, that would be the end of it.

                  I have hoped that Assange is for real, but am keeping an open mind.  After all we have read and what has transpired Nothing is for sure at this point.  So many people are uninformed that is the problem.  If they took the time to find the truth, I am sure they would be protesting.  I can't and don't want to believe that of my fellow humans.  At least not most of them.

                   "We've been flourided, sprayed from above, we're swimming in a soup of 5-G and all kinds of cancer-causing chaotic energy fields, none of us have enough money to live, we are fed GMOs and told there is no reason to hope for a good future. Hillary can steal and election, the FBI can help her, and she won't get in trouble. That plan fails so we hear about it being Russia's fault, without proof, whilst the powers that be KNOWINGLY mess with a nuclear power.

                   It seems everything is bend on destruction right now. And if what we've learned from Pizzagate is true (and it is) the reason for this is that the world is run by a handful of families who actually legitimately worship satan, and do this all for him.

                   I think people are numbed down, dumbed down, programmed with deception, and very sick both physically and energetically.

                   Also we get so much thrown at us we can't appropriately react to any of it."

                   As for Assange, TIME magazine released an article announcing the new "leak site" Wikileaks when they first came on the scene - BEFORE they had even leaked anything. Assange thinks questions around 911 are tedious and won't talk about it, has never released anything about it. He promised to release the goods on BP during the oil spill, never did. And finally, Steve Pieczenik claimed that it was he and others in the 'white hat' side of the intel community that released the email through Assange, and thanked him profusely (since it kept HRClinton from getting in the White House, their sole intention). Assange never pushed back against those claims even though he has denied over and over leaking for US intel.
