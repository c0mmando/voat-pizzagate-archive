            So in short everyone involved with the rituals can be prosecuted on their connections? Like the charles manson case. He didn't actually murder anyone it was just his cult.

            This post is very, very important because the behavioral analysis  provides an authoritative label and definition to the phenomenon which  Pizzagaters have been researching  when they zero in on Alefantis, Podesta and company, much like having a "profile" for certain kind of criminals, a serial killer or kidnapper, etc. Here we have a "profile" for a particular kind of criminal enterprise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Up till now I've been relying on "pedo-subculture"  to explain to others what has been found thus far since there have not yet been any discernable victims. But now we have an identifying label &amp; definition to validate the researchers work product.
           </p>
           <p>
            This behavioral analysis approach also permits a more expansive definition of victims. Children at large are  victims of the bands like Heavy Breathing playing at CPP.  Caris Cummings/James is a victim when her photos are displayed to the public with sexuallly charged labels. Those 3 boys blindfolded before an alter are victims. Carole Greenwood's son was a  victim. Alefantis' employee who didn't reveal his identity was a victim even though he was 19.  NCMEC includes young adults as potential victims of sexual exploitation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong should have been investigated by the proper authorties last fall because researchers had already uncovered sufficient evidence that met the above  criteria of a criminal enterprise. Good job HereticalPeasant.

             Thank you very much. That was precisely my point. The entire purpose of criminal profiling to see whether or not certain individuals and their patterns of activities fit a certain typology of crime, which is very useful in preventing crimes, which is what all citizens would prefer. We, for example do not want the authorities to catch terrorists after they kill a bunch of people, no, we want the authorities to catch them before they carry out their criminal intentions to carry out the heinous crime. Likewise, in this case, I believe there is a robust profile which without a doubt invokes the rational judgement that this issue be thoroughly investigated.
            </p>

             No, common sensical person in their sober mind can call this - "tin foil hat conspiracy theory". It is not.

               I know. I can't believe it either. I was hoping we would take this approach with pizzagate because if you read the entire research written by this man, he gives a format on how to go about raising awareness and disseminating information regarding such issues in a way which upholds credibility.
              </p>
              <p>
               In his preface, Kenneth Lanning states:
              </p>
              <p>
               "I have devoted more than seven years part­time, and eleven years full-time, of my profes­sional life to researching, training, and consulting in the area of the sexual victimization of children. The issues of child sexual abuse and exploitation are a big part of my professional life's work. I have no reason to deny their existence or nature. In fact, I have done everything I can to make people more aware of the problem. Some have even blamed me for helping to create the hysteria that has led to these bizarre allegations. I can accept no outside income and am paid the same salary by the FBI whether or not children are abused and exploited-and whether the number is one or one million. As someone deeply con­cerned about and professionally committed to the issue, I did not lightly question the allegations of hundreds of victims of child sexual abuse and exploitation..."
              </p>
              <p>
               "The reason I have taken the position I have is not because I support or believe in "satanism/' but because I sincerely believe that my approach is the proper and most effective investigative strategy. I believe that my approach is in the best interest of victims of child sexual abuse. It would have been easy to sit back, as many have, and say nothing publicly about this controversy. I have spoken out and published on this issue because I am concerned about the credibility of the child sexual abuse issue and outraged that, in some cases, individuals are getting away with molest­ing children because we cannot prove the allega­tions of some people that these individuals are satanic devil worshipers who engage in brain­washing, human sacrifice, and cannibalism as part of a large conspiracy."
              </p>
              <p>
               "We need to be concerned about the distribu­tion and publication of unsubstantiated allega­tions of bizarre sexual abuse. Information needs to be disseminated to encourage communication and research about the phenomena. The risks, however, of intervenor and victim "contagion" and public hysteria are potential negative aspects of such dissemination. Because of the highly emotional and often religious nature of this topic, there is a greater possibility that the spreading of information will result in a kind of self-fulfilling prophesy. If such extreme allegations are going to be disseminated to the general public, they must be presented in the context of being assessed and evaluated, at least, from the professional perspec­tive of the disserninator and, at best, also from the professional perspective of relevant others. This is what I will attempt to do in this discussion."

               What he is saying here is right on the money with our situation with pizzagate. What do you think?

            Super post. Great for redpilling those who have taken the dive (sadly many are still
asleep). There was a great 1 hour interview, Jom Fetzer and former detective Jim Rothstein - and they went on to discuss psychpathology of pedophiles in detail. 
Excellent post.

            Title's a bit confusing. What do you mean by "dimensional" (as in, several axes)?

             I believe the FBI agent wrote this explains it like this: multi dimensional means that it multifaceted. It includes multiple victims and perps and also involve other criminal activities such as recruiting the children, trafficking the children as well delivering the children for sexual activities.
            </p>
            <p>
             He states, quote: " In the syndicated ring, a well-structured organisation recruits children, produces pornography, delivers direct sexual services and establishes an extensive network of customers."
