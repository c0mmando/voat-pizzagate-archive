I don’t intend to miss it this time to preempt a similar incident that could likely play out at Pegasus in the near future; although I’ve already lost a few days due to not keeping up here, making it all the more urgent these ideas spread post-haste.</p>
<p>While I do agree with the assertion that the site of Alefantis’s “construction Instagram” is located at Pegasus, I refuse to take seriously the logical leap that the “killroom Instagram” is necessarily found at the same location. How this seeming consensus could occur without the help of intentional disinfo peddling is unfathomable to me; perhaps people with short memory spans are conflating werkinonmahnightcheese’s Pajama Factory “construction/killroom Instagrams” with Alefantis’s, and that’s how they’ve so thoughtlessly come to this conclusion. Either way, it’s a wrongheaded assumption, particularly considering a walk-in freezer has no place being in a museum, yet is right at home in a restaurant, like… oh I don’t know, Buck’s! But then there’s the tale of the “Alefantis threat” circulating, which lends credence to it being shills guiding the narrative toward Pegasus. Only those credulous enough to believe the Joe Biggs’ “email leak” was legitimate, could possibly believe this load… seriously, what a hulking boob. {If you’re reading this, don’t kill yourself over it Jo-Jo}</p>
<p>Still not convinced the “Pegasus killroom” is yet another red herring? Here’s an edited version (for easier consumption) of my previous post (which failed to gain the traction it deserved) on the CPP red herring, and my appeal to shift focus to Buck’s, insofar as building a case for the procurement of tangible forensics there (and even if you are already convinced, it’s worth the read if you haven’t yet):</p>
<p>Regardless of whether CPP was ever used for nefarious purposes, in light of the recent shooting incident (which, whether legitimate or staged, has served as excellent misdirection) it is evident there is nothing incriminating extant here.  Buck\'s Fishing &amp; Camping, in my evaluation is the most likely location where forensic evidence would be obtained in regards to Alefantis’s properties.</p>
<p>My support for this assertion lies in the &quot;10 Year Birthday Party&quot; promo picture currently featured at bucksfishingandcamping.com. Herein, all elements of this image shall be analyzed in logical turn, each ostensibly serving a purpose. This photo was very limitedly discussed here and on reddit. What had been pointed out previously, before it fell into obscurity, were exactly those things which could most easily be claimed incidental or arbitrary, so those bits will be left for last.  What I’ve chosen to begin with, however, is not so easily explained away, the three seemingly grizzly images found on the left behind the pink backdrop. Each is cropped with diagonal separation between them. I will describe them from most to least apparent, starting with the middle image, which is a bloody head, cropped from the nose down to his left shoulder,  which the head is bent toward, and has a forked stream of blood dripping down, as well as a horizontal gash in it. There also appears to be a gash on the face above the lip. Next, the bottom image is another bloody face, this time cropped from the nose to the mouth, which is agape. And finally, the top image is a bloody torso, with nipple visible at the left edge. Whether these are genuine snuff photography or lifted from some piece of art, one can\'t be sure (I was thinking Caravaggio was the most likely candidate, but haven’t finished viewing his oeuvre yet). Perhaps more disturbingly however, is the true &quot;centerpiece&quot; of the photo, which is not the steak as one initially assumes, but rather is hidden in plain sight underneath it. It appears to be a body in a light green body bag (…or sleeping bag), mostly covered by the tablecloth, but with the feet end poking out next to the steak sign. Note the nylon sheen of the bag. Now over to the right, the blue and white striped fabric next to the oysters sign is most likely a bed pillow and the dark green fabric, a bed sheet in context with the pillow. I’ve read in an infographic posted here somewhere that &quot;oysters&quot; is code for sedatives, which is very relevant to these items, but I\'m unaware of the authenticity of this translation. However, I am aware that in homosexual handkerchief code, a hunter green handkerchief is code for &quot;daddy seeking orphan boy&quot; (and vice versa) which is located next to the steak sign. And even If you’re not convinced that this is hunter green, all of the greens are related to some form of sex for compensation among homosexual males. Then there are the dead plants, which are juxtaposed with depictions of live plants on the yellow sheet directly behind them to symbolize life and death, since this does appear to be an avert for a snuff party.</p>
<p>Now, shifting to the more speculative elements (including the aforementioned ones); there is a single piece of pasta lain on the left of the tablecloth (code for boys of course), and the pattern/color of the tablecloth itself is supposedly code for alt-lifestyle (haven’t verified this bit). Then we see a very conspicuously placed “candlestick” which may very well be an actual penis digitally edited to appear as a candle. Blue candles (which the establishment keeps in its windows) supposedly symbolizes gay friendliness, and the white… gross.  I would venture to say that the bit of red exposed by the gap in the fake wooden slats is indicative of a sinister reality hidden behind a thin facade. Behind the yellow string holding up the banner is a green object hanging from an orange string and another orange string dangling from it, this could be a bracelet pendant to identify members by. Now, back to the left side, below the previously described images, my best guess as to what is written in the green and blue area is &quot;NATO $$$$.&quot; As for what the image itself is of, it\'s clearly a lawn, a structure of some kind, and sky. Beyond this it is far too nondescript for me to tell. Whatever it is, you can be assured it has a meaning relevant to the rest of the photo. One of the weakest observations made by others was that of the &quot;hotdog&quot; shaped contact info (code for little boys of course). We are now left with only the sheer orange striped fabric unaccounted for. This could be explained by the fact that sheer curtains have acted in the past as a one-way glass before such technology existed, so that when the “inside” of the curtain is lit brighter than the “outside,” the observed cannot see the observer. In this way the predator may chose its prey by its neutral, rather than a foul facial expression.</p>
<p>Please help to spread this, because I doubt dinnertime on Sunday on the east coast is the opportune time to post.</p>',

            You can see the hole in the floor, very faintly, in the picture of the kill room. (Back right corner, floor) If you look at the hole in the construction pictures, its the same exact shape.

            Lordcantido, we have made some improvements over the past few weeks due to serious flooding problems that bury the hard-hitting, linked-source backed submissions that move this investigation forward. Please give the sidebar submission guidelines a thorough read, and edit this post to succinctly state the evidence for the premise in your title, with links to the evidence. Please remove all the meta discussion. Otherwise, this will be removed by mods for failing to meet Rules 2 and 4. Alternatively, you can post this in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever

then continue with the meta discussion in the comments as a obnoxious-as-fuck workaround.

I add a proper link, and I add a disclaimer that states meta discussion ahead and people make up their minds on their own.

              Another mod here.  Your post makes some great points about the sub being taken for a ride by posts that jump to conclusions without evidence.  I hope you will at least take the step of adding some appropriate links so it doesn't get removed.  I would also recommend working on brevity.  Brevity is the soul of wit.  Being able to make your points in an incisive, condensed, and systematic fashion is an important skill.  Your paragraphs are way too big.

                Thanks for adding the link. What would be really helpful is if either you, or one the commentors, added some additional links of the zoomed-in bits you are discussing in detail. It would significantly undergird your argument.
               </p>
               <p>
                One of the reasons we all agreed to the submission requirements that we did, after discussing them for weeks, is to increase the red-pill potency of the content. And to help people discern exactly what you are advocating -- false flags and wild goose chases.

            and the mods will no doubt soon delete your post if you do not provide a link because its against the rules. My own view is that research threads should be in a group pizzagateresearch as mods are pissing into the wind if they think that people will post correctly in a group called pizzagate when so many people are interest in contributing about pizzagate, as they do it by mistake. Doomed to produce conflict, but i dont make the rules

              Edit: Oh, and I've just noticed you're the jackass telling me to research a super secret and intricate network of subterranean tunnels. Really? Give me a break, who's the disinfo purveyor here?

              No one should post comments about a photo on this forum without provide a link to the photo itself. We do not all have time to trawl through dozens of websites a day looking for the things people are talking about.
