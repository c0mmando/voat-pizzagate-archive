            PrivatePizza. Concerning the phone convo defango goes over. Pretty sure this was the convo released by Gwen Jackman, or Wendy, whichever her name was,  that posted it on twitter awhile back.  So his hacking team, since I read much of this like a month ago, is just someone who took screen shots of what gwen was posting. (or she sent it to him herself)  And dcdale, one of his og followers, one I don't see much anymore on his page, talked about the cp files he didn't want anything to do with around the same time. He's been pretty consistent about not wanting to get involved with the child sex SRA stuff. Pretty sure dcdale also mentioned something about there being a Ramsey vid?, which was a weird development that I have no idea if valid or not. Just putting this up here for further background. Whether G is psyop or not or discrediting this or that (when it comes to SRA: don't agree; SR: maybe so, but it's not like anyone else is actually investigating it rather than commenting) but again probs is, this is all house of mirrors at this point, but what exactly are the ardent critics wanting to do about it?  IMO, it would be to investigate and bring forth your own leads rather than spending time investigating Webb (it's been done, and this might actually be the honey peeps be worried about). I've just been keeping track of it since it's interesting as shit. Also, it's funny to me Defango is making statements about credibility. I mean, come on (outer light Ed stopped covering tengri, and never touched the spear narrative, for a reason). I'll still watch his show as well tho, cuz he, like Webb, is an interesting character.

            Seaman is an opportunistic Soros shill. He was shilling for Goldmoney and said it was backed by the legendary George Soros. He also does no research, said he was poisoned twice and deleted his videos when he thought people were on to him.

            George Webb is a spook, and spooks job is to lie and manipulate. The only good spook is a dead one. The good spook is a fantasy for children.

            Dr Steve P is a spook and a habitual liar. He created a fantasy story about the inteligence agency deep state civil war and the white hats won with Trump as their leader. I won't waste time with telling you in any detail how pathetic an attempt at disinfo I see that as.

            If your are a truth community "personality", you are usually limited hangout half truther. If you are a spookl you are a subhuman. I have no issues with trashing any or all the names above. For the idiot who is so behind, or so unsophisticated in his disinfo, that he defends Alex Jones, you can go double fuck yourself.

             Try digging more into Racine. None of the the people you mentioned have yet. Racine is full of corrupt Freemasons, with obelisks front and center on display and ties to Denver and other known freemason hubs. So is Milwaukee and the entire state of Wisconsin. The higher ups become part of the other more powerful secret societies like the Knights of Pythias, the Pilgrims Society, the Club of Rome, the Committee of 300 and more open organizations involved including the Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations. How do Wisconsin politicians instantly become so powerful?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is everyone so afraid of investigating Racine when they claim to want to follow the story where the information leads? Why is Racine so taboo? The more you know about what everyone is investigating, the more you know about what everyone is not investigating.

            Here is a short clip where HA really does a nice job explaining how the psyop works, and how dangerous it is.

            He also feels like George is giving Jewish people a bad name by claiming to be Mossad. However, in this clip, he sort of suggests that there are other ways of being Mossad (and remember when he claimed anyone who helped him was now Mossad by virtue of having helped?)

             Hey that's an awesome clip that everyone needs to see.  I hadn't seen it before... thanks.

             I agree that GW is giving Jewish people a bad name. Thing is, I'm sure people wouldn't want a foreign intelligence service interfering in their country's affairs. That's natural. Unfortunately, we see people who may not be taking money for their passions, however may be benefiting in some other way, or are simply working for the benefit of their home country.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's cool, however this cannot be left to be subterranean. And why do it undercover in a PsyOp?  It's disingenuous and just
             <em>
              wrong
             </em>
             to have not told people and followers what your real agenda is. In another country they'd be out on their asses for working against the country and state.
            </p>

             Great clip from HA Goodman too on the subject, who seems like a genuine Jewish person.

            George Webb has raised many red flags for anyone who has watched his series since the beginning. There are more red flags than revelations. If George wants to be credible among those with integrity who are honest and know the real truth about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, he needs to investigate and report on something outside of the chaotic wild ever-shifting goose chase he is on with Seth Rich and the Awan brothers. What makes the most sense from the meta data as he focuses on, is that the feds murdered Seth Rich, not foreign nationals. This is disturbing. Some information is already exposed, and many know what will, and what won't be exposed, so they need to get in front of the story and control both the narrative and the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            George was just reporting about controlling the Bellwether districts in America to control the election. Racine, Wisconsin is a Bellwether county and it is a main hub for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we want to find out if Trump or Jeff Sessions or George Webb or Christopher Wray or anyone else is really interested in draining the swamp and restoring the rule of law and justice to the world, there is a very simple litmus test. Shine the light on Racine, Wisconsin and ensure protection for those who know the truth. The entire system will be exposed, and Racine will begin connecting the dots across every other Bellwether district, Sanctuary city, and hubs for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you want a real story? Not to diminish Allison's story, but relatively speaking, that is nothing. Racine is the story. Racine is Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Fight to End Exploitation is a cover for Pizzagate. Start with that and the connections to the Clintons, John McCain, Paul Ryan, Ashton Kutcher, foundations and universities, mafia, gangs, corrupt churches, corrupt businesses, PACs, and corrupt authorities that are being used as cover to abuse the law acting above the law under the color of law. When the criminals are in partnership with law enforcement, Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption become standard practice.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a tip of the Racine iceberg. This goes far back, and thus far George Webb wants to tie it off with Hillary Clinton and Andy McCabe, but it goes much deeper than the McCabes, Lynch, Comey and the Clintons. We challenge Trump, George Webb, and anyone else to dare investigate it, and we will verify anything they investigate and report on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The world needs the TRUTH. Not part of the truth. Not the distorted truth. They need the real truth. We do not need to suffer anymore. There is plenty for everyone in a free and fair world. This is what they are afraid of.

             Pizzagate is a small puzzle piece of a much bigger picture and there are many powerful players trying to perpetuate the old system.
             <br/>
             When there is enough people knowing the reality of all this then there will be too much momentum to the events that dismantle the old system.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately the general public avoid truth and turn away from reality, but with people constantly applying effort the balance will shift.

             "George Webb has raised many red flags"
            </p>
            <p>
             I can think of one good reason George has been acting strange lately. Something tells me he's being fed a lot of leads that were known for a while. If George Webb is a school play then he may be at the finish line first while Trump, the DoJ and FBI catch up.
            </p>
            <p>
             In other words I could see George Webb being told if you "solve" the case before we get there then just start doing random stuff to waste time. I think George Webb and Mossad are in a holding pattern. They're waiting for all the other players to get in place. And then one day in late June when everyone's ready the whole story going to drop. There's going to be a big reveal and Eric Braverman will pop out of a cake and there will be a giant celebration.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know that sounds corny as fuck but that's what my gut's telling me. It's all over but the cryin' so George Webb and Jason Goodman started celebrating early.

              No one should be celebrating anything yet. Until George and Jason investigate Racine, they should stop celebrating, sober up and dig further. This goes far beyond what they have exposed to date, and you have to realize that those who know the system has been compromised have to get in front of the story and hedge all sides.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine is not part of the controlled narrative. If George and Jason want to prove they are not limiting the scope of the investigation to select parties, they need to investigate and report on Racine. Not to diminish Allison's story, but that was no worldwide event or major revelation. If they want the real truth, they need to circle back to Racine, Wisconsin. If George said the key to everything is the Bellwether districts, then there should be no reason not to investigate Racine. It is one of the most important in the nation, and there are many reasons why.
             </p>
             <p>
              George's brownstone handler Janine Lindemulder and Mark Hoppus might know something about Racine and its ties to satanism, Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
             </p>
             <p>
              And those involved need to go to jail. The new way is unacceptable. The old way is unacceptable. Only the full truth and nothing but the truth is acceptable. Truth is not selective.

               The quickest way to investigate Racine is keep Andrew McCabe and James Comey from manufacturing a bull shit school play with the final goal of getting Trump impeached. If Trump is impeached you can kiss Racine good bye. Actually if Trump is impeached you can kiss this entire country good-bye because the day Trump is forced to leave office is the day about 10,000,000 alpha males go out and get a brand new gun license for the very first time because they're white and went to college and won't tolerate the Deep State Nazi Police State any longer.

              It doesn't sound corny, it sounds like your continued attempt to find some way, any way to defend obvious shills and spooks. You defend Alex jones. Nuff said. You have no use in this forum other than being the obvious shill like AreWeSure. ArWeSure sucked, but you swallow.

               Hhhmmm, I guess you don't like my numerous submissions putting Pizzagate in a historical context which is actually going to become really important coming up in a few months. But until then I admit I'm not doing much raw research anymore. I'm only here to defend

              </p>
              <p>
               Just curious I looked at your ONE submission just to get an idea of who you are:
              </p>
              <p>
               "Hollywood's job is to open the door for pedo acceptance by breaking down all sexual barriers."

              <p>
               That pretty much says it all DeathTooMasons doesn't it. You should change your name to Captain Obvious. You posted neither research or anything that anyone didn't fucking know already. The real kicker is you have the gall to accuse me of adding no value. Holy fuck. You're not a shill. You're just a complete fucking idiot.

                The above commenter actually has all the hallmarks of a forum manipulation spook using a decade old playbook.

                Create drama, question the efforts of the forum operators and statements about other participants utility.

                All this is designed to get people worked up and wasting energy refuting the statements, as a a strategy I'm not sure how well it works on voat but it's extremely effective in other social media.

                 I'm sure you're right when considering most people who might get turned off by the strife. Unfortunately for me I'm Irish and getting all worked up is highly enjoyable. We've even turned it into a pastime. Arguing with an Irishman is like wrestling a pig. You'll both get dirty but only one of you will enjoy it. Did you know the Celts were

              DM, I find you like GW.  You go around and around and never get to anywhere. Personally, I find that you avoid questions, reply with vague answers or distracting YT videos or attempt to distract with humor. Really, I'm out of conversing with you.  Let's agree to disagree, and keep a distance from each other. Please don't come on my threads, and I won't come on yours or your comments.  Deal?

             Winsconsin, I appreciate your comment and information. I understand you've been posting about this for a
             <em>
              long time
             </em>
             , and would like to, respectively, suggest a change of tack.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rather than repeat the same thing, maybe you would like to post a thread here, outlining what you know and giving investigators
             <em>
              solid leads
             </em>
             into what to research. It's easy to say this Racine is the key to Pizzagate, but why?  What should we research, what is going on there, what is the
             <em>
              story
             </em>
             you allude to?  Really, I do hope that you do make a solid reseach thread with sources, links and information we can follow up.  Otherwise, you're just being seen as a spammer, and by your persistence and passion, I believe this is not the case.
            </p>

             I saw you rock up on the Defango chat this evening !!  Hey, why don't you spill your secrets Racine?

               Do you think this is some kind of joke? Do you see our faces on youtube or see us selling vitamins? Do you see us claiming to be Mossad or any other group? Do you see us supporting any politician? Go back to the early comments and you will see the posts calling out Corrupt Jim Comey and Lying Loretta Lynch since day one. Why? Because we wanted to do this the right way and gave the feds more than enough "links" to expose Racine and the global system of Pizzagate and Criminal Corruption. They showed their true colors long ago in regards to investigating Racine. Both Sanders and Trump campaign representatives and media outlets were given detailed information about the criminal corruption in Racine linked to many powerful groups including but not limited to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. None would touch it. Racine is TABOO, and those involved are scared about Racine being exposed. This is why so many officials are suddenly resigning and retiring in the middle of major development projects in order to hide and cover up what they fear will be exposed.

              <p>
               People need to know the real truth, and the litmus test for anyone who really wants to find the truth is Racine, Wisconsin. More people are starting to connect the dots, and it is a massive investigation. Have you researched anything posted in the comments? Have you started noticing how they are all true and connected to so many other emerging disclosures in corroborating investigations? Have you looked into any of it or clicked on any of the links that were provided in some of the comments?
              </p>
              <p>
               What is your purpose here if not to expose and eliminate the system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption?
              </p>
              <p>
               Racine is a key to the bigger picture. Try researching it for yourself and understanding that there are real people who know the real truth about what is going on through two decades of experience, multiple private investigations, and witnessing extreme acts of corruption linked to Pizzagate and the global system that enables it. Do you know anything about Racine, Wisconsin? Do you think others might know more about Racine, Wisconsin than you? Take a look. You may be enlightened.

               Start with this link:

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Still don't think Racine is important? Do you know what the Pilgrims Society or Agenda 2030 are? They must not be important either. Education, banking, vaccines, viruses, and community policing must not be important. Do you think the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative play a role in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption? Have you figured out how Racine is connected with those groups? What about John McCain and Ashton Kutcher? Nothing to see here?
              </p>
              <p>
               How many people do you know who were murdered in relation to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption? Maybe all of the corruption, murders, secret societies, resignations, lawsuits, links to establishment leaders and powerful PACs, and mafia ties are just a miraculous coincidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is real, Vindicator, whether you bother to research it or not. Try helping. Ask real questions. We dare you to disprove any of it. When you witness something so horrifying that you cannot think of anything else, and realize it is all connected to the bigger picture of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, there is no turning back.
              </p>
              <p>
               Shine the light on Racine and you will see what happens.

               <p>
                If mods delete comments that are not illegal we will promptly be demodded.

                is only barely tolerated by the rest of the Voat community and in the past when a mod has gone too far with removing posts, banning users or started deleting racist, hateful or bigoted comments (censorship) it has resulted in an onslaught of troll attacks from other Voaters trying to shitpost the subverse into oblivion in defense of Voat's commitment to zero censorship. The submission rules the community developed are there to take as much of the subjectivity as possible out of mod decisions about what is and is not on topic. You are welcome to verify all this with

              It is a huge case with many arms. The real story is that Racine is a hub for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption that links to every aspects of the entire network, and Racine is used as a model for global tyranny - sustainability and sustainable development, community policing, foster and day care programs, women and children programs, drug abuse programs, trafficking, organ harvesting, racketeering, blackmail, election rigging, fake news, sanctuary cities, corruption of religion, educational reform, vaccines, viruses, and more. Racine is closely linked with both the DNC and RNC establishment, mafia, gangs, UK and Dutch royalty, and some of the most powerful people in the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              Read more comments, ask more questions. As it stands, Racine is a litmus test to determine who is really credible and determined to drain the swamp, and no one has passed it to date. What has been posted here and in select other places are not the same comment over and over. Much that was posted was censored or banned. Reddit shut down when more people showed an interest in investigating Racine. This is not spam. This is not disinformation.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are many entry points to choose from. Where would you like to start? On the Pizzagate surface level investigate the high profile pedo cases in Racine and The Fight to End Exploitation. It is connected to the Clintons, John McCain, Ashton Kutcher and many people much more powerful than them. Posts are made based on relevancy. Some of the information provided to authorities cannot be posted here without putting more lives in further jeopardy, however that may be the only way. Some information is posted to filter out who is credible and who is not. George Webb has touched on many aspects that relate to Racine, but steers clear of some of the bigger connections which is a cause for concern. This goes far beyond the Clintons.
             </p>
             <p>
              More than enough information and time has been given to those who should have done something by now. Now there is no choice but to begin unveiling the full story. Look into anything posted already here and other places, and you will see it is all true and it is shocking. No one would ever expect a city like Racine to be so important on the global scale, but it is, and there are many reasons why, involving everything from satanic ritual abuse to murder of Senator Paul Wellstone and many others. One major reason for Racine's significance involves the Pilgrims Society, another is the Knights of Pythias, and the most important involves Agenda 2030 and global governance.
             </p>
             <p>
              Making a list of links on Voat is one way to expose the real truth about Racine, but another better solution is in the works. Research anything you can to help, and the full story will come out soon. More leads are being added every day. Others here on Voat and a few other groups are helping add to it. Additional steps are being made for protection due to the complete lack of officials and agencies with integrity that should provide protection and a real investigation. Murders and attempted murders are all too common as witnessed through private investigations. Protecting other innocent people who could be harmed is the concern.
             </p>
             <p>
              Faith in every government agency, official, and media outlet in America is officially lost. The entire system is corrupt or complicit to corruption. The only path to avoid the hell on Earth we are moving toward is by telling the world the truth and praying they understand it. Investigate anything written, and please help. This is not Mossad or a YouTuber. This is the truth.

               Appreciate your comment Racine and your pointers and leads to research. It's good to hear that you've a group working on it and I wish you all God speed with it. As you say, if Racine does hold the keys to Pizzagate then we all need to be looking into it.  Thanks again for your detailed answer. God speed.

                Your interest in the real truth is admirable and appreciated. Racine has more connections related to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption than 95% of the dead ends and disinformation posted. If only more people began realizing it, things could move much faster. If you want to find out who is really interested in the truth, ask them to investigate Racine. You will be amazed at how many people are afraid of it.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is not stopping this. The truth is coming out. We tried doing this the right way, and are left with fewer and fewer options. Is there any official or agency interested in the real truth, or are they all corrupt, complicit and compromised?
               </p>
               <p>
                Chuck Grassley - are you interested in the real truth about the Clinton Foundation? Is Christopher Wray honest enough to pick up where Comey, McCabe, Kadzik, Lynch and others purposely never started?
               </p>
               <p>
                Shine the light on Racine, Wisconsin and you will be amazed by what is discovered.

                 Thank you Winsconsin, and I admire your passion and persistence. It would be so good for things to be moving faster. I intuitively trust you know what's going on and know that it could happen if we focused on Racine.

                 It's great that there's no stopping it now, and again wish you God speed.

            Wait, WHAT?  Titus Frost admitted to disseminating CP?  I think he should expect a visit from law enforcement, since disseminating CP is a crime.   He better -- quick, hurry up -- teach himself how to take showers without dropping the soap.  He's going to need that skill . . .

              , I'm one of the good guys who wants the swamp drained and wants to see this God-awful satanic pedophilia and government corruption come to a complete end.  But I know it's illegal, under the United States Code, to distribute CP (

              ) and if Titus Frost has done that he could be in very, very, very big trouble.  He could be jailed if the U.S. Attorney in his area decides to prosecute that crime.  If he's prosecuted, he'll either plead guilty and do a stint in prison, or he'll plead not guilty, have a trial, and then do an even lengthier stint in prison if he's convicted.  Hence, my reference to taking showers without dropping the soap.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Titus Frost really did this and admitted it, he should be expecting a visit from the authorities, given that they all read this stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              This research by citizens can be done without ever disseminating CP.  If Titus Frost did this he SHOULD go to prison, as should all the creeps that are researched here.  That ain't my opinion, that's the law.

               Thanks for your thoughts. To me, there's a huge difference between disseminating CP and passing it onto the authorities. In this case, the files were passed onto them and nothing was done. What's a good person, someone who's fighting against CP to do?
              </p>
              <p>
               To me you're taking the law too far, and not making an allowance for people who come across these things to ensure something is actually done about files of these type.
              </p>
              <p>
               You argument seems very 'politically correct', and meanwhile, if this is true, even more children are being raped and tortured.  At what point do you change your 'law is the law' stance when it's in the case of someone doing this to help?

             Yea... I think he didn't realize GW's psyop, which many of us didn't. Now he has it's interesting that he publicly said he's having nothing more to do with him or Jason Goodman (video in the OP).

              He jumped the gun after the Wheeler interview. HA's in dangerous country now. Whether psiop or not, mentioning Webb, as well as delving into the SR murder (if it wasn't a botched robbery, it'd mean it was gov related hit or even faked all together, which means there will not be any investigation and will likely always remain in conspiracy country no matter how ridiculous official narrative is) was a good way to go from huffpo journalist to conspiracy theorist.

            Super good interesting and important post.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see some Voat people are still
defending GW.😩
           </p>
           <p>
            And for what it is worth:David Seaman has lost
credibility with me.

           <p>
            When I saw Titus Frost mentioned it got my attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks.

            Upvote for you.
My mind feels better since I stopped watching
GW.

             Thank you for your support, I agree it's info we need to know.  I haven't seen anything posted here regarding this.

             I feel sorry for the GW followers who've been duped... and I feel pretty duped myself even though I didn't watch him.

            "Titus Frost says that GW was sent the Child Porn files found on the Comet Ping Pong Website "

           <p>
            Why would Titus expect GW to know how to decrypt those files? Your comment doesn't make any sense. I'm detecting some shillage here. People seem really really really eager to discredit GW.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me the shillage proves if anything he's getting close to something important and this might just be it:

            The Wikileaks cable they're talking about seems to be suggesting the Awan Brothers may have gotten the idea to hack Congress from a MI6 operation in 2009 to hack into Pakistan's NADRA. If true this could be another smoking gun.

              I agree. The NSA leak was bull shit. The Portland train stabbing looks like yet another False Flag. And I hate passionate liberals with the heat of a thousand suns.

              But "The Jews(tm)" don't have a corner on corruption. There are plenty of W.A.S.P.'s like the Bush-Clinton Crime Syndicate.

              I don't buy the patsie line. If awan story really pops, it won't just implicate Muslims since AIPAC  types at DNC and dc in gen are directly involved with them. Sure, they can claim, like DWS, that they were happless victims but that argument can only hold for so long.

              Really? George Webb has done exactly the opposite. He's dismissed the [insert N word here] did it and put the blame solely on the Deep State. In fact that's so obvious I have a hard to believing you missed that fact.

               I'm sorry DM, where have you been?  GW has spoken about the Awan brothers for
               <em>
                months
               </em>
               !  I'm surprised you've missed that as I know you're a huge fan.
              </p>
              <p>
               He's blaming the Awan brothers for the SR murder, saying they contracted Jalloh, naming him as the murderer. He's blaming the Awan brothers for being spies within congress, syncing all the members information from their hacked blackberries to the Pakistani ISI.  Dude... where has GW done the opposite?  You're saying the Awan brothers are deep state?  Seriously?

                No he didn't. The Awan brothers were hacking Congress. Seth Rich was leaking DNC data. You're not even familiar with the facts of what GW has even said. GW claimed the FBI hired Jalloh. Remember when he found out Jalloh got a sweetheart deal getting out of prison early?

                 No. If you've followed GW you'll know he's pushing heavily that the Awan Brothers hired Jalloh to murder SR.  I'll find you a link, many many of  them, or just watch his videos from when he
                 <em>
                  named the killer
                 </em>
                 and then changed the subject from then on.

                 <p>
                  No they didn't. You're mixing two separate stories together. Seth Rich worked for the DNC in voter registration. The Awan brothers worked in IT for around 20 members of Congress. Their paths never crossed.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you can find the youtube video where GW says the Awans hired Jalloh then paste it in here. I think you're confusing the fact GW says Seth Rich's murderers were killed after they shot Seth Rich in the same way the Awan brothers hired a hitman who then hired 2 Guatamalans to kill a car dealer. I believe it's called "kill the killers". You're getting confused by an analogy GW used to compare the two killings.

                         Racine, Wisconsin.

                        <p>
                         We can argue about George Webb or Alex Jones all day. If George is 'Old Mossad', then his investigation parameters make a lot of sense, and they have to do something to buy time and limit their liability. No matter what truths he exposes, it is only a part of the bigger whole and frankly there is something not right about him and some of the statements he has made, and he is definitely not being completely honest. Obama was a clueless victim? Brazile is a good person? No one should go to jail? Allison's story is a 'worldwide event'? George were brownstoned four times and wants to go back to the old rat lines, trafficking and harvesting, and should be trusted? It doesn't involve secret societies and pedo elite? The rat lines of corruption don't include major businesses outside of DynCorp and a few shell companies?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         See if anyone can get George Webb and Jason Goodman to investigate Racine. It would be a pleasant surprise and a true test to see if they really want to expose the underlying system of corruption rather than cherry pick some bargained pleas for a few and close the book with a few foreign patsies and fall guys. They know Racine is one of the few key Bellwether districts, along with all of the areas named in previous comments that Racine is connected to. Why not dig into it further?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Their story keeps shifting, so why not shift to Racine? There are honeypots everywhere which is a genuine concern with contacting them. Racine is not a honeypot or a dead end - there are a trillion directions to go. It is a jackpot full of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. If they want to solve the bigger picture and prove they are not following a script, they need to investigate Racine.

                          It's not George Webb's job to investigate Racine. It's the FBI's job and now that Andrew SlowWalker is gone from the FBI you're going to see all these leads get followed up including Racine.

                         <p>
                          Do you know who they put in charge of the FBI? It's a guy named Christopher Wray and he was one of the prosecuting attorneys in the Enron case. That's all you need to know right there. Trump put Wray in charge of the FBI because Trump wants to see Hillary Clinton strung up by her toe nails.

                           It is frankly both their jobs to investigate it. If you start investigating Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, you have to go where the truth goes. It goes to satanic ritual abuse. It goes to human trafficking. It goes to Seth Rich and the DNC. It also goes to Racine, Wisconsin time and again. It is an absolute astonishment how connected Racine is to everything, and George just mentioned that the key to the entire case has to do with Van Bellwether - that is Racine, Wisconsin.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           From experience, which was a great cause for concern and more private investigations, the feds only looked for ways not to investigate or to limit the scope, and worked harder to protect the criminal officials and elite involved than to uphold the law. This experience destroys any faith in government and the system as a whole. The only way to fix it is with the truth. The truth about Seth Rich, the truth about Satanic Ritual Abuse, and the truth about Racine, Wisconsin. If this is the information age, why are there so many secrets? If it is the experience age, why does the experience have to be so horrifying for so many poor people around the world?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The optimism is appreciated but the reality is reserved. Let us all hope if there is a will there is a Wray, but if the Jersey bridge scandal is any indicator, we should move on to plan C.

                            Yes under Comey and McCabe the FBI did nothing to investigate any crime associated with the Deep State. The new FBI directory Christopher Wray will change all of that. He was one of the prosecutors in the DoJ's case against Enron.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I have no connections and no one is feeding me information but I can assure you the reason Christopher Wray is now running the FBI is the Clinton Foundation is coming down. That includes whatever the fuck happened out in Racine Wisconsin.

                           Was GW dreaming and reiterated his dreams on his channel, havering for 2 hours ?  Because that what's he's doing.  He has absolutely no evidence. ABSOLUTEY NO EVIDENCE, NOT EVEN CIRCUMSTANTIAL.  Please, show me the evidence and the paper trail or KYS.

                            You mean an email from Julien Assange explaining how he's got data on MI6 hacking Pakistan's NADRA and in that email he references the same exact names the Awan brothers coinkydinkly would later use to hack NGA........you mean that's not evidence? JA wouldn't make something like that up. That's evidence and it's actually kind of a smoking gun.

                            What will happen now that Andrew SlowWalker is no longer FBI director the new guy Christopher Wray will just pick up the case where George left it off today and probably have most of a case against the Awan brothers and their domestic minders in less than a month.

                             So in Wikileaks we see (if you say), that MI6 have hacked NADRA, and the names on the email are the same names the Awan brothers hacked.

                              How is that evidence? Evidently you've never heard of a subpoena.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Here's how this stuff works. An investigator or journalist or detective would establish some connection and possible motive and explanation about a crime. Say detectives for example find something fishy, some coincidence that is just a little too big a coincidence. They would call up someone like a District Attorney who would then get a subpoena and start digging and proceed to dismiss whatever was found or continue on with the investigation:
                             </p>
                             <p>

                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena
                              </a>
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              It's not George Webb's job to get a subpoena. He just turns over what he finds and the FBI will take care of the rest. You expecting George Webb to find the killer's confession letter outlining his motive, the exact time he killed someone and his own fingerprints and blood sample just in case is a little unreasonable.

                                Here's George Webb explaining the focus of his investigation now:

                                Pizzagate is a side show, the real story is the stuff George Webb is spilling the beans on. This is why CrowdStrike seems to have sent people here to discredit him. What I think happened is you just by coincidence posted your stuff on George Webb as well at around the same time. You're legit but many others posting about George Webb are not. GW is a big time threat to them.

                                The NGA leak is an extremely hot potato right up there with 9/11. What NGA did was highly illegal and a threat to our democracy. It will be brought down eventually but it's scary to find out how Fascist these people got. NGA/NSA are quite literally George Orwell's Big Brother from 1984 come to life. In fact it's worse. In 1984 Winston had parts of his apartment where he couldn't be seen because light can't travel through walls. But radio signals can and that's what we've got now. It's really bad.
