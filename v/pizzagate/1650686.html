<p>Uploaded a wav here that compares the voices from the Fatherhood.webm video with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_6_jf63OLI">this &quot;go home&quot; speech from election night</a> and looked at the specific words &quot;you, your, want, listen, call, me, I, will, say, to, is&quot;. </p>
<p>The &quot;to&quot; is a little hard to hear but it\'s basically a &quot;tuh&quot; sound. At the end there is a notice of the confusion of pronouns, in the Fatherhood video &quot;I you will call me your father... What do <strong>you</strong> want me what do <strong>I</strong> want you to call me?&quot;  compared with &quot;<strong>We</strong> are <strong>you</strong> are in all of our hearts, thank you&quot; from the election night speech.</p>
<p>I wanted the listeners to be able to decide for themselves if they hear any similarities in the nuances of the voices.  Let me know what you think.  
</p>
<p>This audio is very loud and hurt my ears so adjust your speakers and headphones accordingly.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Don\'t know if this is proper to do, but I lowered the speed down by 0.650 to help hear the &quot;to&quot; and &quot;is&quot; better.
