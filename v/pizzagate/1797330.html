<p>Ken Plummer is emeritus professor of sociology at Essex University, where he has an office and teaches courses, the most recent scheduled for last month. “The isolation, secrecy, guilt and anguish of many paedophiles,” he wrote in Perspectives on Paedophilia, “are not intrinsic to the phenomen[on] but are derived from the extreme social repression placed on minorities …</p>
<p>“Paedophiles are told they are the seducers and rapists of children; they know their experiences are often loving and tender ones.

          <p>
           <p>
            Recently I've been researching pedo rights activists psychology and  although I'm not a shrink I want to attempt to understand where they prioritize  sex in their belief system, or how they have a disconnect from placing them as protectors of children rather than their desire as sexual perpetrators of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            So far it appears that because children have penis and vaginas that delivery physical sensations, and that children are often curious about these body parts,  the adult pedo assumes that this must mean the child is available for
            <strong>
             their
            </strong>
            sexuality,  or anyone's sexuality for that matter,  simply because a child  has a working penis and vagina.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or, because the adult had no boundaries in place when they were a child they think that all children have no boundaries in regard to curiosity about  their body parts and children shouldn't be required to have boundaries, nor should adult pedo's be required to teach them boundaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the pedo's    bodies are a raging mass of chemical and hormones attached to a mind/brain  or  conscience that doesn't appear to operate under any type of socio-ethical standards involving protecting and caring for children.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example,  a child is curious about a burning stove or walking off a cliff, or into a busy street,  but that doesn't mean the adult let's them do any of those things.   The child needs direction and safety from adults even though they may have feet to walk into traffic or a penis, vagina, or in the case of sodomy -  an anus in which to have sex or be used sexually.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears that the ability to understand the nature of care,  empathy and  boundaries  are common among those who can't grasp this issue.
Psychologically speaking a watermark for sociopathy /  psychopathy is the lack of empathy.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears that the lack of ability to understand or incorporate personal boundaries  (specifically sexually)  is also relevant to their nature.

             thanks for your comment. I think so, too.

              This post f.e. at the christian boy lover forum
             </a>
             stands for itself. He is asking if the children need boundaries. First answer he recieves doesn't care about the boundary question and tries to convince him/her that he shouldn't trust his own beliefs in terms of questions like if the children think he/she's mean and described how he once thought a boy would hate him but than found out that this boy actually was talking about him permanantly (told ny his parents). The third comment however is really showing.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Explained boundaries are better... It really depends on the age of the kid; explanations are seriously necessary with a 14 yo, good with a 9yo and probably a lost cause with a 4 yo. But boundaries are necessary for your sanity, and for the relationship to go anywhere significant; if it's just a kid running all over you, it's not a relationship, it's abuse.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This is crazy. At first this comment seam to be written in the consciousness that children are under our responsibility and need direction. It's the closest to understanding the difference between adults and kids as far as I've found in this forum but than it gets twisted as hell and claims that kids would be abusers and not lovers if they are running all over you. This is a big sign for denial. And denial is a good indicator for a working morality system which my behaviour won't fit to. It's not as easy diagnosed as that but that would them make sociopaths. People who do things knowingly wrong. But I am not a shrink as well. so now we have 4 cents here. :)

             <p>
              We know the best support for students often comes from other students - the people who are facing exactly the same challenges as you or who have just managed to overcome them.
             </p>
             <p>
              TSR is a student community that exists for every student to use to support each other – whatever your background. From GCSEs to University, to landing a job and everything else life decides to throw at you.
The Student Room community is here for you.
