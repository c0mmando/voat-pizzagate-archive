            The mother of the two Hampstead children disassociated herself from this poster "GumpGump" Charlotte Ward/Jacqui Farmer, who DESTROYED the Hampstead case,

             here in this video
            </a>
            Ella never disassociated me.  She comments on my blog and is always very positive feed back.  Sorry, but you don't get to destroy everything I've put together regarding this case over the last two years.  You just don't.  I think people can see for themselves what an evil being you are.  It's ugly, what you just did to me, to my children...It will take me a really long time to forgive you for this, if I ever can.

            I can't even report you.  Voat won't let me.  Why are you putting my NAME in this public arena?  You are endangering my children.  I can't believe you are this evil.  I have never done ANYTHING to you but you keep attacking, attacking, attacking...you're evil.  You are everything I fight against.  You're jealousy is ugly and unbecoming of a human being.  There was a video put out by Abe &amp; Ella, the mother and her boyfriend of the two Hampstead children who warned us about this evil being who used to run a blog called "Hampstead Research" and it's

You are going so out of your way to discredit my work.  You gave Dearman MY ADDRESS WHERE I LIVE WITH MY 3 YOUNG CHILDREN.  And then you have the nerve to attack me like this?  Shame on you, you child-less, cold-hearted bitch.  I live in the US, you don't, the DC case affects us American's much more than you.
