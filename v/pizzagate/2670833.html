            Don't know what's up with kaps, could be legit could be not or somewhere in between, but the basics of it is he gets really specific about fairly vague  statements he alleges to have heard and gets crazy vague about what should be specific statements, such as, iparaphrasing here, when he says seth green told him he and clare are pedo illumanists without saying specifically what they/he actually  said.

            Most of us are informed. We know what our establishment is doing because we read it here

            However, not everyone has access to the same information at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            There has been a massive effort to post beneficial information here. We are directing traffic to WikiLeaks and bolstering our free speech defense. Give the groupthinkers a day or two to catch up...

             Funny how "unbiased" Wikileaks hasn't posted anything negative of Trump's yet. Wikileaks is controlled, as is Trump. Congratulations, you're so "informed" that you've been following multiple psyops.

            There's been NOTHING this nothingburger has exposed. He's RTing? And acting like some leader? Leader of what? Hey, pal! You're late to the party! And you didn't even bring potato salad!
