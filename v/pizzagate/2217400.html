             “Their telephone number in Brussels rang in Kiev. It was a sham, yet it had a presence in Washington. The European Centre for a Modern Ukraine was a major client of the Podesta Group. Why did the Russians choose the Podesta Group? Because both Podestas were close to the Clintons, and Hillary was then Secretary of State. She could get things done for the Podestas’ Russian clients. It was influence peddling, the most obvious kind,” he continued.

            <p>
             The Podesta Group has close ties with Hillary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             Carlson said of the ties, “Sometimes, our source told us, ties between the Podesta Group and the Clintons were explicit. Tony Podesta spoke regularly to Hillary Clinton while she ran the State Department. Our source remembers Podesta’s assistant announcing that Secretary Clinton is on the line.'”

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Podesta Group has struggled in the wake of the Mueller investigation. More than a dozen of its lobbying clients have cut ties with the firm this year, according to lobbying filings. Revenues have also declined: The firm brought in an estimated $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, down from $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2017 and from $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2016.

             This has nothing to do with UraniumOne.  Read the Manafort indictment.  Two lobbying firms are mentioned but not by name.   Firms knew they were working for Ukrainian govt, but didn't file as foreign agent.

                For example let's start when he even though he played sports all through college as soon as he graduated he magically got bone spurs that gave him a 1-Y classification that kept him from being called to Vietnam.  This bone spurs then magically went away on their own with no operation needed and it was either the left or the right or both legs.  He can't remember.

                 It's surface patriotism, he's as selfish as anyone else, and if placed in his shoes we'd cop out too (if indeed he did and I wouldn't be surprised, just as W. Bush did in National Guard service). Possibly I should have said "faulty" patriotism instead of patriot to a fault.

                 "It's hard to carry a full cup." He's done fairly well. I would say in these last years he has put the "country" ahead of his own interests. Unfortunately we don't have a "country," it was hijacked by moneyed interests since at least Woodrow Wilson, who admits he sold us out.

                  Faulty patriotism definitely sounds more like it.  Remind me, are you from the same church as his mother?  Or am I thinking of someone else.

                  I have no idea why you think he has put the country ahead of his own interests.

                  He would have divested himself from his business if he actually believe in that.  He would be following government ethics rules. He would have called the American Justice service a laughingstock.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He's championing a tax bill that is designed to serve his interests, the interests of his children and his rich friends and will take away my usual tax refund to pay for it.

                 <p>
                  He promoted his wife jewelry line and Ivanka's clothing line.  Jared Kusner's family was touting EB-5 investor visas to the Chinese.  HIs business is still pursuing foreign deals after pledging not too.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I also have no idea why think he has done fairly well.  He's had one scandal after another since he took office.  His National Security Advisor didn't last a month and Trump knew all about what he was accused of and didn't fire him.  He only fired him when it became public.  Flynn told Trump he was under investigation as being a paid foreign agent BEFORE Trump was innaugurated.

                   Yes I'm the one that has the church connection and I've been to his island and home church twice. It's quite remote. I have many friends over there. Trump's so called scandals are nothing compared to others (Clinton, Obama and his birth certificate and "wife," and he hasn't conspired to kill Americans by false flagging on 911 as Bush has). Etc. Bush Sr. You really don't like the man do you? I'm not sure what to make or think of you. I think you're sincere tho in your contempt for Trump, you still think the whole thing is a con. You should look at other sources, not MSM.

Four months into his campaign for president of the United States, Donald Trump signed a letter of intent to pursue a Trump Tower–style building development in Moscow, according to a statement from the Trump Organization’s then–chief counsel, Michael Cohen.

                    <p>
                     The involvement of then-candidate Trump in a proposed Russian skyscraper deal contradicts repeated statements Trump made during the campaign, including telling ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that his business had “no relationship to Russia whatsoever.”

                     My point is that he's not in the White House w/ a view to conning the American people. He's not there for money. He sincerely believes he can make a difference. Trump has been talking about this for decades. It's all over youtube.

                     If you are confused about 911 being a false flag then you're way behind the eight ball. Tell me you don't think Oswald killed the president. You surely do not believe terrorists w/ box cutters defeated the US defense system and flew the equivalent of airborne cruise ships perfectly into the towers?? You're smarter than that.

                      Oswald definitely was the only shooter.   No doubt whatsoever.

                      are you a 9/11 MIHOP or LIHOP guy?    So 9/11 was a false flag to invade Iraq by having an event with no Iraqis involved?   We invaded Afghanistan just throw people off the trail right?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      What US defense system?   We don't have a defense system against domestic air traffic?    Look up history of hijackers.  Prior to 9/11 none were on suicide mission were they?

                      Trump is very much attempting to personally profit all the presidency.  In many, many, many ways.  Why do you think he spends as much time as possible at Trump properties? Look into the tax plan and the benefits it hold for real estate businesses.

                       Gosh you're confused and misled. (No planes hit the towers BTW.) No doubt whatsoever about Oswald? Do you live under a rock? Come on arewesure, that's an easy one.

                        I personally know three people who were in lower Manhattan who heard/saw the event.  One witnessed the first impact and two witnessed the second.  A jet engine is very loud that close to the ground.

                       <p>
                        You think all that footaged is faked?   (Wierdly, I actually just found a video that was taken very close to where I was on 9/11)

                         I've never seen that video but I'm sure others have (so I cannot comment on it). This is plainly CGI animation (below). Interesting that you were there in NYC at the time, must have been scary.

                         This is not what happens when an aluminum airliner impacts concrete and steel bldg. The official report states the aircraft were clocking 500 mph at sea level upon impact, that is impossible for jumbo jets unless they are going straight down in a descent ... they would break apart. Etc. Google "911 planes the ball."

                         Eyewitnesses, there are many plausible possibilities w/ a false flag. Yes, this event was the excuse to go into Iraq.

                          It was actually not scary to be in NY that day unless you were close the event or if you knew somebody who was.    Watching the fires and collapse was horrific, and the rest of day was spooky and very sad.  Ironically it was a perfect day weather-wise.  but I never felt like I was physically in danger and neither did anyone close to me.  I was sad for the people involved it, but I didn't feel like I was in danger.  I felt like a witness.    I found out later a close friend was caught up in dust cloud and that a relative I didn't know worked down there and was just getting off the ferry as the plane hit and debris started falling and jumped back on the ferry.   He never went back to Manhattan.  I was not in that level of danger and it wasn't scary.   That night all the restaurants and bars were packed.   Everyone wanted to be with friends and among people, I guess.   The subways were stopped at some point so I had to walk home, but I could use one of the upper Manhattan bridges and didn't have to go close to the WTC.  There was a sense of goodwill and camaraderie among people as we all walked home, but not fear.   A couple of times we saw someone walking in the opposite direction completely covered in dust and that was just eerie.

                          That's just ridiculous nonsense.  Conspiracy gibberish added after the fact.   CGI effects added in real time?  To home video cameras?   In 2001?
There a ton of videos of 911 made by regular folks.  Many were examined by NIST and are available on youtube by search for FOIA 911 videos.  All sorts of cameras captured the experience not just broadcast news cameras.   Furthermore, this would involve a conspiracy of thousands of ordinary people.   It's ridiculous.

                          I didn't experience 9/11 on TV.   I experienced in on the street looking at the WTC as did thousands of other New Yorkers.   There's an incredible number of people who were eyewitnesses to the second plane.  You could see in Manhattan of course, but also from Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and NJ.  Lot of people in high rises could look outside their apartment windows.

                          This is nonsense.  First of all. Planes are not tested for straight down descents.  A descent is any time a plane lowers its altitude, which happens all the time and not straight down.

                          Secondly, the speed limit that people throw around is a number that determines what would be safe for the aircraft, not the disintegration point of an aircraft. People who make the claim you make misunderstand what this limit is and what would happen if you exceeded it.  All aircraft undergo testing to determine their V speeds.

Using them is considered a best practice to maximize aviation safety, aircraft performance or both.[2]

                          When they test a 767 airliner, they do not test it until it disintegrates.  They test for its safe operation.   A number that wouldn't apply in a suicide mission.  Moreover since the plane manufacture is guaranteeing the plane can be safely flow at its v speeds, they build in a tolerance factor, so that the published V speed is well within safety limits.

                          Vd for a 767-200 is 483mph. I have seen the tolerances defined as 1.2 and 1.5 times Vd speed.
So for the faster of the two planes that hit the towers, it would be 1.2 Vd or 580 mph.

                          This still doesn't mean you the plane disintegrates at 581mph.  It means it becomes unsafe and not recommended.
The hijacker on 9/11 was not concerned about plane safety or having his wings flutter.

                           Don't have time to respond to everything, but these are pilots who say the planes can't be flown that fast and at that height. They break apart in simulators also at that speed.

                           You simply cannot accept, w/out doing injustice to your own common sense, that an airplane disappears neatly into a building like that, per the video clip fed to the public by MSM. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Picture it the other way round. A plane is suspended mid-air and a gigantic wall of steel and concrete moving at 500 mph slams into it. What would happen? The nose alone of one of these planes can be destroyed by a kid w/ a sledge hammer. No, the tornado argument doesn't work here, it's a false comparison to say the least.

                           As for witnesses seeing and witnessing planes and sound, you have to work backwards ... "eliminate everything that is impossible, and whatever is left, however improbable, is the truth." I liken the operation to a master magician, who can astonish crowds, same w/ false flags and sophisticated rogue intel agencies. We are left scratching our heads and saying "Incredible, how did they do that?" And then you begin to see the holes. For most, it is much easier to accept what we're told and move on with our lives, despite glaring inconsistencies.

I seem to remember massive destruction and a fireball at impact.    Right off the bat you are stepping away from a neutral nonbiased description of the events.  You also don't seem aware of the size of these buildings.  The floorspace of the WTC was about the size of a football field.

                            The plane acted upon the building and created a giant hole.  The building acted upon the plane and the plane was completely destroyed in the process.  As for you example of a stationary plane and a moving building, I believe physics would say the exact same impact would happen, but I haven't studied physics in a while.  A tornado which has winds less than 500mph can put a plank of wood into a cinderblock wall.

                            This is the standard conspiracy bit about the MSM all work together, they are not competing against each other for money and they work lockstep with the government.  By the time of the second impact thousands of people were looking at the burning world trade center tower when the plane hit the other tower.   Many of these people were videoing in the event.  There's no way for the government or the media to control these many people.  Downtown Manhattan is one of the most densely populated places in world at 9am on a workday.  Just those two buildings had 50,000 occupants and it was surrounded by other large buildings.  The towers offered unobstructed views in 360 degrees to folks uptown across the Hudson in NJ, across the harbor to Staten Island, across the East River to Brooklyn and Queens. Not mention anyone on a boat on these waterways.

                            This compliation of raw footage shows how many neighborhoods had a clear view of the WTC that day.  I can recognize a few for certain.

                            That's like several hundred thousand potential witnesses any of whom could have a camera and as you could tell if you lived in a high rise apartment building you would have an awesome obstructed view of the Towers.

                             As for witnesses seeing and witnessing planes and sound, you have to work backwards ... "eliminate everything that is impossible, and whatever is left, however improbable, is the truth."

                            Oh no, you did buy this cliche did you?   A man in a cave?  Really?  Did he grow up in that cave and live there full time?  Or did he go there to avoid bombs being dropped?  Bin Laden was an elite member of his society had travelled and worked at his father's business on massive construction projects.  The guys who came up with this plot graduated with an engineering degree from a college in the UK and an engineering degree from a college in the US.  The ringleader who actually pulled it off was trained as an architect and was studing at a technical College in Germany.

                             Not the greatest example but come on, why are you so deceived? You still think Trump "colluded" w/ Russians? I'm talking to someone smart, but someone who admits they believe the Warren Commission. Do you know it is documented that there was a casket switch of Kennedy aboard Air Force One? Documented, eyewitnesses, on tape. Body loaded onto plane in expensive bronze casket (unloaded empty on news), arrived at back of Bethesda in a body bag and cheap metal shipping casket. You got a lot to catch up on.

Do you believe Purdue or your own eyes? The media disseminated a cartoon. Further, when the security video of the pentagon plane was released, there was no plane, just an explosion. You are buying into nonsense concerning the biggest false flag in the history of the USA. Screw Purdue, they have an agenda.

                                Why are you bringing politics into an argument about physics?  That's a big red flag for motivated reasoning.  Furthermore, you are not describing mutually exclusive events.

                                A 911 false flag to active this plan COULD involve a plane crashing into the building.  You don't need any alternate theories.

                                You're still in denial that I told I personally know three witnesses who heard a plane screaming overhead loud and low and looked up to see it smash into the Trade Center.  There's many, many other people like.  I learned of 911 on the street, not from the media.  I was miles away though.

                                The highway into Manhattan from Brooklyn offers a clear view of both towers and is usually very slow due to traffic.  There would be thousands of witnesses with this view.

                                I have no idea what you are talking about here.  The plane did break into smaller parts.  Most that destruction would have happened as the disintegrating plane and its parts continued through the building.   This is standard physics.

                                A 22 bullet fired from a pistol will easily go through a quarter inch of wood.  However it may not go through a foot of wood or two feet of wood.  In order to stop the bullet you have to absorb all the kinetic energy. The physics are exactly the same as with the plane.   I showed you that it doesn't matter the hardness of the materials involved.  A ping pong ball moving fast enough smashes through a wooden ping pong paddle.  In fact it acts just a like bullet even though the bullet is made of lead and the ball light plastic.

                                For the building to stop the plane from entering it would have to absorb all the kinetic energy from the plane.....an energy that is massively more than the bullet.   A 22 bullet fired from a pistol might weigh 2 grams and travel at a bit under 700 mph.  Well the plane was slower, travelling at 500 mph per hour, but it weighed massively more, like 120 million times more.  This gives us a massive kinetic energy even before the jet fuel fireball.

                               <p>
                                22 bullet roughly equal to 95 joules of energy
Plane roughly equal to 2983740000 Joules of energy

                               <p>
                                The slower, but more massive object has 34 million times more energy.   It's equivalent to 1572 pounds of dynamite.

                                The wings of the plane are filled with fuel, so the wings are massively heavy and moving very fast.   When they hit the building, standard physics would apply.  The impact force would create a certain strain over the area impacted, the strain would create a deformation in the material.  If the strain placed on an object is so great that it deforms beyond its elastic limit, it will fracture.  This is true for a breadstick, a two by four and a steel column.  If the force it great enough, the material will fracture.  The physics stays absolutely the same

                                In, the WTC, the outer walls were made of many smaller pieces were bolted together, so the first thing to fail would have been the connections between these parts.

                                Here's the type of destruction of the plane I was talking about.  Even as the plane falls to pieces, those pieces are still doing massive damage.   Like the shrapnel from a bomb does damage.

When we start dealing with huge numbers our eyes become very poor gauges.  Most of what occurred would have occurred way to fast for human eyes or TV cameras that record 30 frames a second.  Your eyes can't tell how much force a collision has.  You can only see the effects.  The entire point of using a physics software is to build an accurate model and then let the computer show us what happened after it does the trillions of calculations needed.

                                 This is how it was done. Below. BTW your scientific animation simulated video states that the plane came out thru the other side of the bldg.! Ridiculous! You can "prove" anything you want w/ this simulated crap. Peter Jennings did it to "prove" Oswald acted alone. How many skyscrapers have collapsed, historically, due to fire? Three. The twin towers and bldg. 7. It's never happened before. It was extra hot jet fuel right? Lol. You sound like my wife, who read "Let's Roll!" And other propaganda. Of course the "Let's Roll" story had a homosexual hero.

Left and right wing are two sides of the same coin. We are owned by bigger interests. You've fallen for the "illusion of choice" and that a vote counts.There is no choice, historically. Both "sides" are warmongers, both sides fear the banksters. Etc. Woodrow Wilson actually stated this.

                                 No plane hit the pentagon, no plane blew a hole in the ground, no bodies anywhere, no plane parts (oh, they'll show a few lol). I can't address the rest of your stuff, you will never accept it. You don't understand the evil that permeates this world and the psychos in charge. You need to go back to JFK first, you have cognitive hurdles to overcome, then you can move on to other stuff. Take the red pill. Why are you so stubborn and unteachable? Again, please show me a compilation of all the amateur footage that was taken. Yes of course hundreds could have, would have seen. BUT, eliminate all that is impossible (planes don't slice thru bldgs. and jet fuel doesn't bring down, thru fire, two of the tallest and sturdiest bldgs. in the world) and whatever is left, however improbable (hundreds, thousands would have witnessed planes), is the truth.

                                  This is why on most building the steel support columns are either encased in concrete or sprayed with Spray-on Fire Resistant Material.  Chicago built a new convention center in 1960 that was thought to be fireproof.  In 1967, it totally collapsed in a fire. It made them rethink and update the fire codes.

                                  It happen to school in Holland.  The Steel frame side of the building collapsed while the concrete construction stayed intact.
It happened to a 16 story building in Iran that completely collapsed due to fire.

                                  The jet fuel would have burned out early in the fire, but what it would have done was ignite the entire floor pretty much all at once.   It would have been an enormous football field of fire.  The office had enough fuel to get the fire to 1000C in spots which signficantly weaken steel..   (one thing I learned while looking into this is the difference between temperature and heat. It's real counterintutive, but paper has more heat energy than thermite, kerosene much more so.  Thermite is very heavy and releases all it's energy very quickly.  A pound of paper will release more enegery than a pound of thermite.)  However a plane crashing into the building and disitengrating into shrapnel going over 100mph, will shatter and strip the SFRM right from the beams.

                                  It was also missing in several areas before 9/11.   (If you're in a high rise built before 1977, you can't expect the SFRM material is adequate.)

                                   This is what happened to the towers. Below. They didn't collapse. They turned into dust. You won't accept this, I understand. Here's physics. Research Dr. Judy Wood. Alex Jones is a gatekeeper to keep the thermite truthers going and to guardrail against Dr. Wood. "To control the opposition, lead it." No kinetic energy brought the towers down, kinetic initially yes, to cause the explosions.

                                   Politics has nothing to do w/ this. Doesn't matter who's in power, they're both warmongers. They're all puppets and controlled by their handlers, powerful, moneyed people. Mostly Jewish, and I don't hate Jews like everyone else here does.

                                    Meanwhile in reality the pile of debris at ground zero was 10 stories high, even with tons of rubble in in the 6 story subbasement.

                                    Again, I'm a New Yorker.   I brought supplies down there.  I know people who worked at ground zero.    This stupid theories of how the builidng came down and it turned to dust were not going on when dump truck after dump truck was removing debris for months and months and months.

                                      I've done that.  So irritating.  VOAT needs a save, but not post feature.  Or save then publish.

                                       The rubble you're seeing is minuscule compared to what should be there. You wouldn't even be able to get relatively close to ground zero it would be heaped so high

                                      When you go to the WTC memorial, where the buildings stood are two large deep pools that empty into an and even deeper whole in the center.   There were six floors of parking/subbasements. The collapse was basically only stopped when you hit bedrock. It was travelling over 100 mph by the lowest floors. The WTC was known for big, wide open offices with few columns in the way.  Most of the volume of the building was air.  We see that "meterorite" they found at the bottom of the pile, 4 full floors compressed down into a rock 4 feet high.

                                      So if you have 6 feet of subbasement filled with debris and a visible pile 100 feet or more, that's your building.

                                      This is where the scale of WTC space fools people and where photographs don't do it justice.  There was a massive empty plaza around the WTC buldings.  Today's it's a park surrounding the memorial.  There's plenty of extra space for the pile of debris.    People who don't know what they are taking about say the WTC fell in its own foot print.   Well if that were so, how did so many other buildings get hit with falling debris.   WTC 7 was at least a football field away, it was across this empty plaza and across the street from the WTC builidings and it got hit from its roof on down.  Over 600 feet of damage.   WTC 7 was like a 2 minute walk away.  I walked it once.

                                     Do you believe in ANY false flag, conspiratorial happenings, events, hoaxes at all? The govt. is benign and has your best interest at heart? If you believe the official JFK story then you're never going to make any progress. That one is a no brainer. Go back to the beginning w/ Mark Lane's Rush To Judgement and work forward.

                                     I'm friends w/ many who historically were part of the event. People who knew Oswald and David Ferrie and Clay Shaw (and Ted Cruz's dad), people who were standing by the limousine and saw the head shot (this woman knows Trump personally FWIW), doctors at the Bethesda autopsy, Parkland doctor, black JFK secret service guy who Kennedy hired personally, CIA operatives and forgers, people who flew w/ Ruby, CIA pilot, children of these people and the actual grassy knoll shooter (his kids and Tippet's killer's kids), famous Jim Garrison interviewer John Barbour (has a walk of fame star).

                                     I don't understand why you trust media when they lie time and again. I used to watch the Trump rallies (a lot, mainly because it was a "phenomena"), then turn on the evening news (Lester Holt) and see them completely lie and twist and soundbite POTUS's words. It was shocking.

At least start w/ JFK, it opens the doors to accept other things. W/ the internet now there is no excuse to believe lies we've been fed for generations. History is written by the victors. We now have the opportunity to see who Hitler really was for example. So much more. It's an incredible day and age, we can now wake up, shake off the propaganda, and see the truth. I grew up being spoon-fed by three TV channels. The jig is up.

                                     You probably don't have the time like others to research, sounds like you're working full-time. I got sick and was able to research for almost three years. I'm just now getting better. Trust me, there's a lot of garbage out there, and I'm no loon. The things I've encountered, it's like experiencing PTSD having to accept things. I'd just as soon stay in my comfy zone, forget it all, and eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die. But I can't now, I feel I have a duty.

                                     The rubble ... yes that looks like a lot of rubble in the photos, but of course there would be some rubble and some of the building(s) still standing, but you're looking at a tiny fraction of what should be there, you've got an up close view there (and they didn't "smash into the ground," Jennings and George are in disbelief concerning the lack of rubble) ... Hudson River dam would have been breached and part of Manhattan flooded, we're talking TWO 70 plus story bldgs. Massive amounts of debris. No bodies were recovered either, no toilets, no filing cabinets, no plane parts, no desks.

                                     You're a hard one to figure cause you seem sincere in your beliefs, not so much a "shill," to me. That's why I talk to you. But I don't think I'm going to persuade you of anything. Besides, you can't TELL or teach people, they have to want to learn and have the time to do so, and then discover it themselves. I laughed myself silly when I heard that people believed McCartney really died and was replaced, I thought, "what fools." Then I looked into it. I was shocked at what I found, sound, credible proof, a lot, too much to deny, and I had to finally embrace it.

                                     There are photos post 911 immediately after, verifiable, that show the underground areas still intact, no rubble smashed into the ground. In any / all bldg. collapses and detonations the smoke never rises above the original height of the bldg. ... the "smoke" (dustified debris) here is blathering up and remaining suspended 70 stories in the air.

                                      This is kind of a ridiculous factoid, how smoke disperses would depend on the air currents. Updrafts would lift up smoke.  First of all Nothing detonated at the WTC.
Secondly, remember there was a massive fire going on, the original line of smoke went up with the hot air coming from the fire.

                                      Also 70 stories in the air is far less than the height of the WTC, the smoke was over 110 stories off the ground.   The scale of these buildings throws so many people off.  I can also tell you as a personal eyewitness, once the smoke left the hot air of the trade center, it did not rise on that day, it went horizontal and east.  This picutre is exactly how I remember it that day. The closer to the Trade Center it was black and dense, the further away it became dispersed and grey and then white.  I remember walking to the river to get a better view and see the smoke get darker and then eerily, before I knew a second plane had hit, see the big PUFF of smoke in the stream of smoke representing the fireball of the second plane.

                                      At the collapse, you can clearly see the smoke is different from the debris

                                       I'm a "big picture" type of person, in advertising, once we came up w/ the concept of an ad etc., I'd get bored quickly and pass it on to be executed. So once I found out who took the grassy knoll headshot I became bored w/ Kennedy, same thing w/ the twin towers, once I understood what happened (and I don't care so much about the whodunnit aspects and minor details) I got  bored and don't study it anymore. Once the mystery is gone I move on to something else, and there's always been "something else" to move on to. As I research these things (again, it takes time), I will have these "aha" moments, like a light switch being turned on. I will then continue and try to affirm in my own head (trying to be objective as possible), that what I'm seeing is the truth, regardless of how improbable it seems (having ruled out all that is impossible). There is no way to understand some of these seemingly crazy things w/out investing the time, and most people are so rushed off their feet it is simply not an option. I am "lucky" that I got house bound long enough to do some serious research. W/ Podesta's and pedophilia, something is going on, but I can't accept it wholly w/out more proof.

                                        It sounds to me you skepticism about the media/government (which I advocate along with critical thinking) curdle into kneejerk cyncism and rejectionism. This is, of course, a lot easier than critical thinking.

                                       No that's not me. I've had time to do a lot of digging, it takes time and an open mind. Critical thinking is something I study. I hate to find myself, and I do at times, repeating logical fallacies and such. It's interesting to talk to an eyewitness of the events. We'll agree to disagree. I had a friend who was at the top of the towers just a few weeks before they collapsed, when he heard about it (he was fairly young) it changed his life it affected him so bad. "The scale fools you." I know, that's kind of what I'm saying to prove my point about the rubble (and the fact that photos don't do justice). I regret having never visited there tho I've been near.

                                         I don't mean I formally study it. It fascinates me because we are all such contradictions, products of many different things, and so very flawed. Have you watched David Eagleman's The Brain on PBS, I like that sort of thing, neurology, Oliver Sacks.

Oh okay, I think that's the guy that walked a twin towers tightrope. If that's not it let me know. Thanks. I'll let you know if I pick up on what you're talking about.

                But Obama is an illegitimate president. If you want to protect the highest office of the land then you must start by following the rules (LAW and ORDER). Sheriff Joe Apiro already proved that the birth certificate of Obama was forged, yet the news was buried because it came out right around the transition in the White House. Obama has ZERO actual evidence of being a US citizen, not to mention he killed his grandma the day before the inauguration. She’s the one who claimed to see him born in Kenya.

                 I know. And hopefully his time will come. But a drowning man will grab a straw. And right now I'm just glad to see some movement in a positive direction. The swamp POTUS faces is international, monolithic, well-financed (they own everything), and, humanly speaking, impossible to stop. He's got a full plate to say the least, insomuch that if he succeeds to any great extent, it will be only thru divine providence.

                  He was able to get elected, wasn’t he? That was the first sign of many to come - that the people, regardless of our serfdom, GREATLY OUTNUMBER our oppressors. All it takes is an informed populace to stop it immediately. People need to wake up!

                   Carroll Quigley said that a democracy can succeed (and I have my doubts if any democracy can succeed, even representative, for long), only if the people are armed w/ the same weaponry as their rulers. That has happened w/ the internet. What happens next in the "course of human events and affairs" who knows, might be best that we don't know. "Start the Revolution Without Me."

             I’m not. It means their heinous crimes will be buried from the public - and then what?! Our precious children stay in the dungeons being raped and killed by their elite network. It makes me sick. FUCK the whole “Al Capone went down for tax evasion” argument....it’s not enough.

              Not until information starts circulating around in prison indicating Podesta's likely crimes against children.  Granted, it will be a Federal prison, but there is always someone willing to "step up to the table".

              Yup, I want the people to see what they DEMANDED everyone vote for.  A bunch of sick, pedo fucking, satanic cult pizza ordering pieces of shit that they are.  That way we can ridicule them with it, any time they try to argue about a damn thing you just bring that up and how violent they got when we didn't vote for that.

               The thing is, if we pile all the crimes on them at once, all of the cucks and SJWs will start to believe that all of the charges are fake across the board (resulting in similar feelings of falsified charges among the MAGA voters who haven't researched PizzaGate enough).
