            Same goes to James Alifantis and Podesta brothers. They could take anyone to ciurt for slander but chose not to? Why - because they are guilty. David Icke is on record calling George Bush snr. A serial child murderer - Bush never got back to Icke!

            Poor Bill Clinton has AIDS and wasn't expected to live past 2016. according to Able Danger (field McConnell)he is turning states evidence on Killary the baby eater, Child trafficker, Chinese agent, arms, drugs and child trafficker and overall worthless piece of feces. At one point Field McConnell was talking about Bill rolling over on Hildabeast (the smelly, vile satanist) and Field was saying that Bill was saying that he only had a short time to live and didn't want to spend it in prison and that was why he was rolling over on Satan and when Chelsea HUBBLE was mentioned Field say Bill said "she is not my daughter".

            Any allegations will not be acknowledged. Regardless of innocence or guilt, as it would bring attention to the fact. 
Don't forget that he straight faced lied on national TV to the American public in regards to Monica Lewinsky. He learned his lesson and will keep his mouth shut at all costs.

            It is also a strong point about Podesta....if the bastard was innocent he could rip some people a new asshole with his little pecker...but he doesnt get anywhere near a court room....because the would have to give the other side rights of discovery and he knows he doesnt want to draw more attention to him and his crimes......

             Imagine a good, honest owner of a truly kid friendly pizza joint accused of child trafficking. I adked one of my friend's dad who owns a great Italian Pizza Parlor. He told me this, 'he would immediately order the reporter to stop in its tracks, call the mainstream news, FBI (equivalent here in Australia), Archeologist immediately - and if nothing turned up, he would sue utubers pants off. Now parallel this to the way Alifantis reacts. Stages fake shooting, media covers up for him.

            Jones et al and Info Wars are the supreme gatekeepers, surely no one with half a brain is fooled by this false profit any more?!  For those in doubt of what I speak, please pay no more lip service to anyone currently involved with Info Wars until you've researched the myriad reasons for the truth communities accusations against.

             Dude Alex Jones has a video of himself screaming to call your congressman and stop the false flag he is hearing about.....he is yelling it could be the World Trade Center and being hit with a plane....46 days before 9/11.   Alex Jones may be somewhat hyper, somewhat aggressive, but the dude has brought the facts.....
            </p>
            <p>
             And he got into Boheminan Grove with a camera and got out again.  I think the dude is legit.  He may not be everyones cup of tea.  His style may rub people wrong.  But I dont think he is controlled opposition.

                Bill Cooper was a former naval intelligence officer turned whistleblower. He had the most popular show on the internet called The Hour of Our Time.. He was murdered shortly after 911. He predicted a major terrorist attack in 2001 before anyone else.. I know Alex Jones likes to take credit for being the first to see it coming but it isn't true it was Bill who first broadcast what he felt was the media priming the population for a major attack using osama bin laden as the bogey man. He was a true patriot I highly recommend his work.

              Bill Cooper was the real deal and exposed  AJ for what he is. Bill Cooper was murdered. AJ is promoted by the MSM. Google news has often linked to him. Nuff said.

               You got that right!  And Cooper would admit the mistakes he made and he even said himself sometimes he was fed disinfo often to obfuscate the truth..I've never heard Alex admit a mistake..ever. If someone else has I'd love to hear it

              You will need to understand that killing him would only have made non believer stand up and take note. The guy sounds like an absolute crack pot to most people, he has never really been a threat to them up until recently he has been gaining more listeners and helped Trump win the election in some way. Not all of his leaks are legit so he will get some stuff wrong but most have been proven to be true

            This is a terrible argument.  The libel bar for public officials, especially a president is very, very high.  To point where it's not worth it to sue.

           <p>
            Secondly, Jones could very well say it's his opinion, and opinions are protected speech.
           </p>
           <p>
            And given that Jones holds many, many opinions that no sane person shares, the court could rule that no defamation occurred because no reasonable person would believe the opinion of Alex Jones matters.

              She didn't "win" because the case never went to trial. They settled. The blogger tried to get the case dismissed on 1st amendment grounds and the judge said, the case could go forward. Then they reached a settlement of an undetermined amount and he retracted and apologized.  However, Tarpley.net is still publishing.  This suit certainly didn't "shut down" this website overnight.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since we don't know what the amount of the settlement is, it could have been less than what his lawyer costs would have been to fight the suit.  As noted above Jones would have more resources to fight a suit and would love the publicity of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The question for the blogger becomes  is it worth it to me to spend $200,000 in legal fees to "win" my case?  Is it worth it to risk losing?
             </p>

              Trump once sued the author of a book for $5 billion dollars because the author wrote he was not a billionaire.  The book was published by Warner Books, so they had to resources to fight the case all the way down the line.   It took three years. The case was dismissed and then Trump appealed, Trump finally lost the case, because he wouldn't comply with the discovery requests and kept trying to draw out the process.  So this blogger understood he could fighting this for years.

               Melania Trump sued the blogger. A short time later he retracted and apologized. But that's not technically "winning". Epic.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course technically you're correct AreWeSure. But that's not the issue here. The issue is you are so dogmatically precise about some things but not others.
              </p>
              <p>
               Where's your dogmatic precision in labeling Laura Silsby a child trafficker after she was, duh, convicted in Haiti of child trafficking?
              </p>
              <p>
               Technically Laura Silsby is a child trafficker. Hillary intervened and got her out of jail. Technically that means Hillary Clinton condones child trafficking.
              </p>
              <p>
               Working to get a child trafficker out of jail is technically appalling is it not?

               She was the plaintive and SHE accepted the settlement, therefore she won. The amount of the settlement is irrelevant. What is relevant is the fact that she shut down anyone else calling her a prostitute - because she wasn't. Your whole point was that it is too hard for a high profile individual to prove libel/slander - obviously, it's not. A lot of people have called Clinton a rapist. He could have picked someone without as many resources as Alex Jones to make an example of, but he hasn't. Bill Clinton does not sue because he is a rapist and a statutory rapist.

                She still didn't win.  She settled......on very favorable terms, but what she didn't do is prove libel/slander.    In fact, there's another case with the Daily Mail that is still ongoing.  We shall see where that goes.  You also don't know if she was the first to offer to settle.
               </p>
               <p>
                This individual case does not change what I said: "The libel bar for public officials, especially a president is very, very high. To point where it's not worth it to sue."

                Hustler Magazine said Jerry Falwell lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse.  He sued and lost.
               </p>
               <p>
                In answer to the original question, "Isn't it strange......"   The answer is a clear no.  It's not strange because it's often not worth it, you can sue like Jerry Falwell, spend a lot of time and money and still lose.
               </p>
               <p>
                Does anyone ask, "Isn't it strange that Alex Jones was never sued by George W. Bush for saying 9/11 was an inside job and selling Tshirts?              No.  They don't.  And for the same reason.

                  Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit public figures from recovering damages for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), if the emotional distress was caused by a caricature, parody, or satire of the public figure that a reasonable person would not have interpreted as factual.

                 Also, the blogger in the Melanie case apologized and admitted the statements were false...

                <p>
                 So I'm not sure where you are going with this. The 9/11 case would involve the emails and communications of George W. and other top politicians to be revealed, so it would be best they kept silent.

                   Sorry for being bothersome, but this thought-experiment has me really interested haha

                  <p>
                   Like in the Melanie vs. Daily Mail case, Daily Mail quickly retracted their earlier article, almost instantly, and was based purely on rumors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   With Info Wars, it is a constantly pushed the Bill is a rapist, for many years, with a large audience, with merchandise sales, and so on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I honestly can't think of any case close to resembling Info Wars calling, as a matter of fact not opinion, that Bill is a Rapist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Even if Bill forced Info Wars to issue an apology, it would deal a huge blow to Info Wars. But given the many efforts to shut down InfoWars, I think if Bill was truly innocent, it would be best way to shut down InfoWars...
