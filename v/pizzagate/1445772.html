            Hey kiddo. let me just say first how great it is to see younger people waking up and investing themselves in staying informed. Keep it up and speak as much of the truth you gauge someone is ready for, because what may or may not be happening has the potential to be the motherload of all redpill's concerning the nature of our leaders and governing bodies. It's the gauging that's the hardest part of sharing with friends and loved ones. Depending on where you live and how invested into the leftist narrative people around you are however, you might just have to accept that nothing short of Hillary clinton or John Podesta literally being walked to the paddywagon in handcuffs on CNN could sway them. These next 1-3 months are potentially going to be the most trying in our nation's recent history, and our next president is facing the greatest litmus test I can ever remember in my lifetime. But there is at least moderate-high probability that the old order's chickens will come home to roost, and you will in fact see at least John Podesta and many key players face those consequences and even the legacy media will be forced to cover it.
If someone around you falls more to center and acts dismissive at first, depending what you shared that can be verified there's probably fair probably they'll at least google that to see what they get. For those kinds of people, of which I was one, I think the most important question is what is enough? It's like the email scandals. The left tries to blow it off by saying nothing serious was in the emails. There was, but that's not the point. The point is even if 30,000-650,000 email were literally all about yoga, the existence of the server itself was the crime. The very server was enough to question her character.
For me I haven't decided on the absolute guilt of all these parties, but the scandal happening now is at the very least a very drastic questioning of these people's characters. So if your facing an undecided, ask yourself what part of the scandal do you think would make the relate with you in questioning the character of these people and be sure to back up what you say with evidence.
There's a lot we definitely know that while it is circumstantial and character driven it's still something objective and observable. For me the first that got me questioning was Tony Podesta's art. That alone made me uncomfortable with the nature of these people's psyches. From there the Kim Noble art that was at Comet ping pong just gets worse, and from there you can definitely prove that's the kind of man that contributes to the clinton campaign, gets invites to the whitehouse, is friends with the Podestas, gets 11,000 donations from a billionaire for no apparent reason etc. 
Make sure you forward and share exact links if they're open to it. Try not to get too invested and be ready to hear about Trump's Epstein connection (it still has me nervous and is why I see Trump as going through a litmus test). If you're religious pray, and if your spiritual meditate, and don't let your anger be blind. Decide about what parts of this scandal are making you the most suspect and be a realist about what's going on. No matter what this scandal is still a crisis of character for our nation and you can expect pushback because of how difficult realizations like this are to process.

           <p>
            In what world is it normal to have politicians make negotiations in a cooling chamber, and posting about it under synonym "jimmycomet" on social media, adding the hashtag #murder. commenting himself with "Oh yeah looks like fun" And then have other questionable people (see their posts) commmenting things like:
"rinse it off when you're done", "Just a pile of money under a sheet"

            Ok then pint out the emails where words like pizza are being used clearly as code. No i am not sure about it just looking for alternative explanation what these codes could mean.

            EDIT. Very difficult to argue the facts presented in that article. What convinced you about pizzagate? Show them the same pieces that got you convinced. To me it was historical evidence of these types of events happening over and over again and always covered up.

            You said it in your last sentence, they don't have a clue what they re talking about. That is their weak point.
Just give em 1 or two key facts to chew on. Like the torture chamber post. Or ask them what alternative theory they have for meaning of codes used in podesta mails. Like, don't tell them hey look i found out clintons are involved in global child trafficking balblabla.... better show something like the torture chamber post and ask them "hey don't you think this is creepy? I cant  explain it to myself but what could this be?"  He will strt ask questions
           </p>
           <p>
            hope i am getting my point across there. what i am trying to say is trigger their interest so they start asking you - do not try to educate them.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they have been triggered, but try to ignore it.... whenever eg. clintons come up at the dinner table, like "omg have you heard hilly wants a recount" answer something like: "it doesn't really matter - they gonna be in jail soon for raping, murdering and eating babies and children anyway" .... Probably better to keep it a little more vague at some times - they will usually start asking questions soon enough...
