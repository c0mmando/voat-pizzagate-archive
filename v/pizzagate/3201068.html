           A Swedish rehabilitation program for convicted pedophiles and other sex offenders that has been used for decades has been criticised for giving the opposite effect to that intended.
          </p>
          <p>
           Prisoners who have undergone the so-called Ros program (“Ros” stands for “relationship and coexistence”), are at increased risk for a relapse into criminal behaviour when they are released.
          </p>
          <p>
           The term “prison correctional services” which is used throughout Sweden when locking up criminals, signals that it is more about care and rehabilitation than punishment.
          </p>
          <p>
           The approach is controversial but defended by the fact that the convict is to be rehabilitated into society, and be readapted and better equipped for a law-abiding life than when he was locked up.
The program which has been developed for sex offenders and especially those with a pedophile orientation who have committed child abuse, is voluntary and not all sex offenders choose to participate in it.
Now, however, the alarm has been raised that the therapy offered to the prisoners does not reduce the risk of relapse into crime but, on the contrary, increases it.

            J Peterson was a part of this research. Many canadians, in-fact, were hired by the CIA for MKultra research with video and sound and drugs. Techno was the first introduction, behind a 'disco beat' to show that memory could be nearly erased and modified with nothing more than sound.
           </p>
           <p>
            Canada is not exempt from anything as they are closely tied to all MK research and projects. Peterson's writing programs emulate the same procedures.

            Writing is an alternative outlet for everyone, not just pedophiles. Exercise is an outlet. Conversation is an outlet. What is not mentioned is that the abused people who become imprisoned are continually abused when released. It remains ongoing torture in order to push them further into more crime of suicide in general.

            Amongst the countless approaches, studies, theories surrounding the sexual attraction towards infants, pre pubescent  and pubescent kids - male or female - along with the wide array of paraphelias that exist, the work by an obscure therapist, Dr. Ed Balyk, stands out as a powerful beacon of understanding in this field.
           </p>
           <p>
            Succinctly  stated, Dr. Balyk staunchly embraced the view that the arousal is a bio-social phenomena - permanently imprinted into an individual's hard wiring (actual physical self) that can never be undone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Somewhat akin to PTSD (which orgasms or horrendous experiences can both  create in young people), these latent potentialities are ever present and need only environmental circumstances to initiate the processes leading to acting out against others.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the chilling realization that these characteristics - now biologically imprinted and, therefore immutable - can prompt horror, this reality can provide a pathway to both controlling these impulses and preventing them from harming others by being acted upon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much,  much more to this topic,  but Dr. Balyk's stance explains so much about this stuff.

              if you're a child and you're being raped and have an orgasm-it doesn't mean you enjoyed the act. Being raped is still bad, and now it's attached psychologically to some hairy, nasty person that raped you. voila: PTSD.

              My description 'akin to PTSD'  was purposefully  phrased in an attempt to link powerful, externally induced actions which can prompt a life long response.
             </p>
             <p>
              The sharp reaction of a combat vet when hearing a loud noise, uncontrollable panic when in a car, swimming pool, etc when one had previously dramatic, negative experiences are all somewhat well recognized.
             </p>
             <p>
              Less attention is given in the arena of orgasmic activity involving young people, such as in innocent horseplay, which can leave no less a powerful imprint on the person involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is greatly magnified when seemingly positive attention is given to young people otherwise abandoned by society.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those NAMBLA guys seek out troubled youth and deliberately groom them via attention and the ensuing sexual gratification.
             </p>
             <p>
              One consequence of this is that the young boys, now grown men, see no negative aspects regarding the sexualization of young males.
             </p>
             <p>
              The main point that  Balyk tried to communicate was that VERY impactful experiences left a life long, unchangeable biological mark.
             </p>
             <p>
              These experiences could include those that induced orgasms in young people, whether the actions were deliberate or not.

              Maybe they're referring to how women often have orgasms when being raped and feel guilt, or how most women have rape fantasies several times a year etc etc

               I am not familiar with the dynamics of how women respond to rape.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, I did have occasion to interact with rapists several decades ago.

              <p>
               Every one, that is Every. Single. One. of them held their mothers in seething contempt.
The power of this venom was especially startling when often their 'conscious' selves did not allow them to even acknowledge their true, underlying feelings.
              </p>
              <p>
               I perhaps ought not to have originally commented on the above post.
              </p>
              <p>
               My exposure in this field is more extensive than most, and my desire to prevent harm to children is why I mentioned Dr. Balyk's work as it is FAR more pertinent than the efforts such as the above mentioned Swedes having people write letters.
              </p>
              <p>
               Good intentions all.
              </p>
              <p>
               Far from being on point.
