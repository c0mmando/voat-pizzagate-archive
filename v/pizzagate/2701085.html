            Neither Clinton had ever heard of Laura Silsby or her group before they were arrested in Haiti.  You don't need to anyone to sound an alarm. They arebroadcast on radio, TV and phones
           </p>
           <p>
            The children were destined for The East Coast???   They were headed for the Dominican Republic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Neither Clinton Petitioned the Haitian Government for her release.  The Hatian courts dropped the kidnapping charges because their parents handed the kids over.
           </p>
           <p>
            She worked at Alert Sense.   Alert Sense does not run the Amber Alert System.  That is run by law enforcement.  Alert Sense is the equipment vendor. She has no influence over Amber Alerts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amber Alerts are literally a system of Alert alarms that are widely broadcast

              Good for you.  Do you think anyone on this board is a normal person?

             <p>
              I looked in up in response to this claims.   It's not very hard. It's a government program, alerts are issued by law enforcement, the national coordinator of the program works in the DOJ.
             </p>
             <p>
              From Wiki
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The decision to declare an AMBER Alert is made by each police organization (in many cases, the state police or highway patrol) that investigates each of the abductions.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              <a href="https://www.amberalert.gov/faqs.htm#faq2">
               https://www.amberalert.gov/faqs.htm#faq2
              </a>
              How does it work?
Once law enforcement has determined that a child has been abducted and the abduction meets AMBER Alert criteria, law enforcement notifies broadcasters and state transportation officials. AMBER Alerts interrupt regular programming and are broadcast on radio and television and DOT highway signs. AMBER Alerts can also be re-disseminated through lottery, digital billboards, Internet Ad exchanges, Internet Service Providers, Internet search engines, as well as wireless devices such as mobile phones.
             </p>
             <p>
              Who is the National Coordinator for AMBER Alert and what is the Coordinator's role?
The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, serves as the National AMBER Alert Coordinator. The role of the National Coordinator is to facilitate the development of the AMBER network, support the development of state AMBER plans and efforts, help eliminate geographic gaps in AMBER networks, provide regional AMBER network coordination and provide guidance on criteria for issuing an AMBER Alert

              I have no idea.   I know that in the Baptist Community she was treated as someone with sincere intentions.  Baptist leaders petitioned President Obama and Secretary Clinton to step in. They were denied.

               </a>
               Hillary and Bill Clinton took an extraordinary interest in Silsby’s case from the moment she was arrested and almost immediately stepped in on her behalf. The Harvard Human Rights Journal stated that one of Bill Clinton's first acts as special envoy for the United Nations in Haiti "was to put out the fire of a child abduction scandal involving American citizens." On February 7th, 2010, The Sunday Times reported that Bill Clinton had intervened to strike a deal with the Haitian government, securing the release of all co-conspirators except for Silsby. Prosecutors ultimately sought a six-month sentence in Silsby's case, reducing charges for conspiracy and child abduction to mere "arranging irregular travel." A shockingly light penalty given the circumstances of her arrest, which would likely not have been possible but for the intervention of the Clintons in Silsby's case.
              </p>
              <p>
               On February 9th, 2010 Hillary Clinton consulted with Counselor Cheryl Mills and other attorneys in an email discussing the U.S. Government's "options" regarding the arrested Americans. The heavily redacted memo attached to that email does not reveal what these "options" consisted of. However, the State Department's American Citizens Services is only authorized to offer lists of local, English speaking attorneys to Americans arrested or detained abroad. To go beyond that authorization is a severe violation of protocol and is illegal. Additional emails reveal that the State Department was involved with making statements on the Silsby scandal and preparing to assist Silsby's co-conspirators with their return to the United States, although this is consistent with State Department protocol in these situations.

                That William Craddick article is false.   He was the redditor who started the false Silsby Clinton narrative posted under the username PleadingtheYiff.  He also posted here on Voat.   He started this posting on TheDonald reddit where any dissenting views were deleted.  This probably helped him as the central claim of his post is obviously false and any posts pointed this out would have been deleted.

                We can say without a doubt he has zero evidence for this claim.

               <p>
                This is completely false and the Wikileaks emails have evidence of why this is false.  He bases his claim on this.

               <blockquote>

               <p>
                There's multiple things wrong with this sentence.  Emails?  No, a single document, not plural.  OK a single email from 2001 then?  No.  The document in question is not an email and is not from 2001.  Wikileaks has this document miscategorized and the wrong date.....And this isn't even the most obvious of the evidence as we will get to later.

               <p>
                This is true if you mean for a couple of weeks after Silsby got arrested.  It's false if he means Human sent anything before this woman got arrested.    His writing is deceptive and the intent is to give the impression.  Hillary and Huma were closely following this woman since 2001.
               </p>
               <p>
                He says
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 One of the first things the Clintons did when they took over the scene in Haiti was to have Bill get Laura off the hook:
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Except this didn't happen.  Neither Clinton stepped in.  Any discussions with the Haitian government was handled at a lower level in the State Department and followed the usual procedures for when an American is arrested overseas.   Laura Silsby stayed imprisoned in Haiti and went to trial in a Haitian court months later.  We'll examine this claim too.
               </p>

                Um, this guy was a conman and not a lawyer.  He acted as a spokesman for some of the group, but he was not lawyer anywhere and certainly not in Haiti where he didn't even speak the local languages.  Silsby had lawyers from Haiti actually representing her in court.

                Let's start with the obvious.

               <p>
                There is no way that Clinton had been following Silsby and her NGO since 2001.

                How can I say this so definitively?

                Laura Silsby started her NGO in 2009.

                That's just for one.   For two the Clinton emails Wikileaks has are from her time as the Secretary of State.   They were released by the State Department.
               </p>
               <p>
                Hillary Clinton was not Secretary of State in 2001.
               </p>
               <p>
                The private email domain that was at the heart of the Clinton email controversy at State was "clintonemail.com."  This domain was not registered until Jan. 13, 2009:

               <h2>
                Document is obviously from 2010. NOT 2001.
               </h2>
               <p>
                So how did William Craddick/PleadingTheYiff get this SO VERY WRONG?  He uses this document from Wikileaks to support his claim.
                <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776">
                 https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                However, if you know what that document is and how it got in Hillary's emails it shows the opposite of what he claims.
               </p>
               <p>
                The first thing to note this is not an email.  Look at the To: and From: fields.  there's no information there.  View as a PDF, you can see it has no email metadata whatsoever attached to it. It looks like a PDF of a Word document. Even if this was just an email draft the From: would be filled in.  This document is dated.  2001-01-01 However, this is incorrect.  He did not make up this date, it's in the Wikileaks system with an incorrect date.  The State Department has a date of n/a for this document meaning not applicable.  So someone Wikileaks mistakenly added a date of 2001-01-01 on this.  Probably an automated glitch.
               </p>
               <p>
                Secondly Read the document.  It's obviously NOT from 2001 as it describes the aftermath of the 2010 Haitian earthquake and Silsby's plans to go to Haiti in January 2010.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thirdly, we know exactly what this document is and how it got to Clinton because of a different email in the Wikileaks archive. This email has been released since 2015 explains exactly how Clinton learned of Laura Silsby and her team.

                The document that Pizzagate researchers claim was in Hillary's emails in 2001 was sent to her on Jan 30 2010.  AFTER Silsby was arrested.  It was not an email, the document is the attachment to this email.  It's a PDF file.
               </p>
               <p>
                Note the subject: "10AmCits arrested......"  AmCits stands for American Citizens.  That is why Huma and the State Department were sending emails.  The State Department is involved any time American Citizens are arrested abroad.

                This is why Huma and others were sending emails, because the State Department is routinely involved in the cases of American's arrested abroad.  Look at the Amanda Knox case of an American arrested and then falsely convicted of murder in Italy. The State Department followed that case from the beginning.
                <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/amanda-knox/article/Cables-show-State-Department-has-monitored-Knox-1383417.php">

               </p>
               <p>
                The Silsby case reached the level of the Secretary of State because it was an international incident and Secretary Clinton, President Obama and others could be sure to be asked questions about this case at press conferences.  That is why they were trying to find out so much information.  That is routine.  It's not because of some personal interest on behalf of Secretary Clinton.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you read the whole email thread that contains the PDF, that Craddick/Yiff claims was from 2001
                <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3765">
                 https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3765
                </a>
                you can see how the PDF got to Clinton.  The embassy in the Domincan Republic was alerted by Haitian Police was alerted 10 American Citizens were arrested, they contacted Consular Affairs and many other groups/people in the State Department were alerted that they had an issue on their hands and a State Department employee googled their name and found that PDF on a Church Website.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). Bill Bistransky found the attached "Plan of Action"(P0A) on their web site when he googled that name.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                So the email threads make clear nobody at the State Department knew who these 10 American Citizens were or what they were doing when they got arrested.  All the emails were after they were arrested.
               </p>
               <h1>
                Silsby was not gotten off the hook.
               </h1>
               <p>
                The link that claims Bill got Silsby off the hook relies on the same UK Times report I have shown to be wrong elsewhere in the thread.  Look at the Footnotes in that professor's article in the Harvard Human Rights Journal.  He based his claim on the UK times, he didn't do original reporting. So this is the same single claim.    This would have a been a huge story worldwide and in Haiti and to this day the UK Times was the only paper that made this claim and they dropped this claim and never followed up on it.  No Haitian sources have reported it and this would have been discovered during the 2016 campaign if it actually happened.  Silsby and her aide Coulter remained in prison in Haiti after Clinton left.  Coulter was let go in March and Silsby face trial in May.  She was convicted at trial.

              I, of course, am not lying.  I looked deeply into all the Silsby/Clinton pizzagate claims and they don't stand up at all.  There's a specific claim that Clinton knew Silsby from 2001.....except the document this claim is based on is clearly written after the Haitian Earthquake in 2010.  (The date in the Wikileaks archive is wrong.  Wikileaks also mistakenly calls it an email, when it's not an email.  The explanation for what this documet is and how it got in Clinton's email is clearly explain in another email.)

              All of the following are true: 
Clinton did not know or know of Silsby before she was arrested, the State Department got invovled in this case because it involved American citizens not because of any personal connection.  The State Department left their fates up the Haiti courts.  President Obama and the State Department rejected any calls for personal intervention, and neither Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton intervened on behalf of Silsby.

              It is true that the The UK Times claimed BC was there on a diplomatic mission.
However there's a mountain of evidence that this article was wrong.  They were the only media organization in the world that made that claim and then they dropped it and never mentioned it again.  Read their coverage of Bill Clinton the week after this claim.  They don't mention it at all.  In all the time since 2010, no other media organization in Haiti or elsewhere ever made this claim.  Bill Clinton left Haiti months before Laura Silsby went to jail.

              Clinton was quoted by tons of media when visited in his capacity as the U.N. special envoy to Haiti.  All those media used the same quotes the UK Times used, but they used in articles that pointed out Bill Clinton was not involved. Baptist leaders were calling for personal intervention but the State Department explicity shut it down and pointed out

               Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will not get directly involved in the case of the 10 Americans detained in Haiti on child abduction charges, a State Department spokesman said Tuesday.

               The State Department also has ruled out any special role for former President Bill Clinton in a possible release of the Americans.

               "It is unnecessary for former President Bill Clinton to play the role of intermediary as he did in North Korea in the case of the journalists being held," Crowley told CNN on Monday. "The situation in North Korea and the situation in Haiti are dramatically different. In Haiti there is a functioning government with which we have diplomatic relations and established channels to monitor and deal with bilateral issues. North Korea is an opaque society with which we have no diplomatic relations."

              Yup.  And they clearly show the State Department only becoming aware of Silsby's group after they got arrested.  The first time her name appears in the State Department emails was after a State Department official downloaded a document from one the Churches involved in Silsby's group.  She is not even named in that email.   One of the prime responsibilities of the State Department is to provide consular services

              I know that Silsby's idea for her orphanage was it would permit adoptions, but I haven't seen plans beyond that and Silsby's group was mainly from Idaho with some Texans.

            They will do all kinds of gross things to those kids and then unleash them on society. Sad that these kids don't really have a shot. Haitians seem to like Brazilians. Maybe they would have a shot there? Clinton will be forever known as the great pedophiliac and she likes the thought of third-worlders raping third-world dictators too. She is disgusting.

            Interesting find. Could you please edit in a few sentences on who Laura Silsby/Laura Gayler is and why she is of importance for our investigation. Nothing excessive, just a few sentences. I will also give your submission an accuracy flair for the time being. Keep up the great job. Thank you.

               Actually, most of it was, but you are SO right with all these articles flying around. It’s hard to keep up with the details unless you’re adhd like me, lol.
