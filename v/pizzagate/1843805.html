            Grimm's fairy tales always freaked me out...

             The Gruesome Side of Grimms’ Fairy Tales

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If a violent death isn’t enough to turn you off of Grimms’ fairy tales, how do you feel about devouring human flesh? Cannibalism is another theme found within several of their collected stories.

            Oh gosh, completely escaped me the goodship lollypop licking.  I was in such a state of shock just realizing where those strange fantasies just popped up when I was 6.  Right, right, the lollypop.

            Came to mind yesterday about Little Orphan Annie too.  Had not realized it might also be mkultra.  It's the rich older man who takes you in and provides protection.  Wonder how many pedo symbols are in that comic series?

            I'll be looking for your story of the daughter.  I really hope she has found some peace and resolution.

            Thank you for sharing this very personal story. I am so sorry that this happened to you. I can't begin to imagine what you must be going through on a daily basis and I commend you for speaking up and defending your 4 year-old self when nobody else did. It takes courage and a lot of patience to deal with trauma like this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish you lots of love, peace and harmony in your life :)

            When I was growing up I began to detest any touching from my mother.  It wasn't until I got older that I realized there was a sexual content to her touching that made it feel creepy to me.  I fended her off but she went somewhat farther with my brother.  I suspect that she had been abused as a child.  I don't know how far she would have gone if we hadn't fended her off.  I doubt that many kids at all feel any sexual interest in their parents UNLESS they get signals from their parents that that is how to get other things they want.
            <br/>
            Just being a parent or caretaker does not mean you are suddenly good at raising kids or moral in the way you do it.  That is why we have societal laws.  Since car seats have been shown to save lives we make parents use them whether or not the parents want.  Kids would always prefer not being restrained.  We don't leave it up to the parents or the kids.  When society should step in regarding parents and kids is a tricky issue for sure, but parents don't become saints when they become parents and thus society has to address parent/child issues.  Adults are held to task for how they conduct themselves in other areas of life, surely they can be held to task for issues of how they raise their children.  Some parents think it is OK to beat their children for their own good to the point of breaking bones.  Do we interfere.  Of course we do.

            I cannot believe that any one could write such complete and utter #$%@.  OK so at what age does this guy think they can consent.  Since we know infants have been abused does he think a 3 year old can consent, a 2 year old.  Just a blanket "they can consent" argument.  But if they can consent because they can know what is good for them and what is not, then I guess we should let them decide whether to go to school or not.  Since they know what is good and safe for them, lets let them decide when to run across the street.  As soon as they can reach the pedals on the car lets let them drive on an expressway.  No more laws regulating the age you can buy booze or cigarettes, they are clearly able to decide at any young age if such activities are safe and wise.  Heck lets let them vote....well on that one why not.  We elect the most corrupt and despicable people to public office, maybe the kids would do better :)  Had to put a little joke in there because I am on the verge of crying.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Bonding with others is arguably among the most beneficial of things a human could possibly do. In fact, it’s probably the single most important and beneficial thing. There’s nothing about sexual activity that prevents a child from sharing in that benefit...The punishments you are a supporter of and the bigotry you feel towards pedophiles is entirely the reason children are traumatized when they come to be involved in not only harmless, but profoundly beneficial sexual activity with a loving and responsible caretaker. You are the reason little children suffer. You are a child abuser, and you are the reason why their suffering turns into a lifelong struggle.

              You know, when I was 6 I started having sexually toned fantasies but not sex per se bc I was clueless.  It was always the same, lots of little girls on a runway parading out while wealthy older men, nice looking, would bid on us.  I found these fantasies troubling and made them stop.  All my life I wondered where they came from.  I was not around any pedo's, nothing weird happened at nursery school, parents divorced but dad was very 'proper' in that respect.  Mom watched over me like a bear and would have killed anyone who laid a hand on me in that manner bc growing up she had an uncle that was a little touchy feely, but she was never raped or anything like that.  Then recently on this forum a thread on Shirley Temple and her sexualization.  I grew up watching her movies.  My fantasy was all there right down to the dresses and curly hair.  It was actually a relief to finally know where the fantasies originated from bc I secretly wondered if I was a perverted 6 year old for so long growing up.

              It's the reason I'm aghast at what is being shown to children these days.  These images go in and mess with the psyche in ways we don't always realize.  The young innocent mind is wide open to distortion.  Absolutely the pedo symbols subtly placed or the forget the name of those twins, oh Olsen, that sing the pizza song is beyond just mentally harmful/it's mkultra stuff.

              Every civilization when it reaches this level of debauchery implodes.  There are enough creative awakened ppl, and more every day, that will fill the vacuum when the implosion occurs.  I think it's going to take something like the realization of annihilation of all life to shake loose the satanic hold that has been going on for thousands of years.  It's going to be an interesting ride.

               I am soon to become a parent and have never been more conscious of these influences nor felt more helpless to protect from them. I recently received lots of baby toys from a relative and they were covered in spiral designs so I gave them all to a charity shop.

               The more time passes, the less certain I am that people are going to wake up to the truth, or even recognise it when it's put directly in their faces. For many it's simply easier to buy into the lie

            The writer is Daniel Gaither. It's Nick Martinez's site, but he has others contribute articles. In the "About" section, there's this:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Moderators of Heart Progress, any writers who publish on their behalf, and Nick Martinez are not responsible for the actions of others. Heart Progress condemns illegal activities and does not promote them in any way."
           </p>
           <p>
            Kind of sounds like they're promoting illegal activities. Someone should let him know.

            There is so much wrong with that attempt to believe their own bullshit.  No, CHILDREN CANNOT CONSENT, no matter how many times they tell themselves that.  A willingness does NOT mean consent.

            This needs to be reported to the police.  this is beyond disgusting and insane.  Some children have the desire to hurt others or kill animals, humanity doesn't honor those feelings and let them do it.  Some things are just completely wrong as with this nutz desires for kids.

            When i was a six year old boy there was nothing more I wanted to do than to blow the fattest, hairiest, oldest, and most shriveled up unattractive man that I could -- way more than playing with toys, watching cartoons, riding my bike in the park, and laughing with my friends.
