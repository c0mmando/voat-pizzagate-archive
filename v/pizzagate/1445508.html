            I keep talking about 4chan because it gave birth to every single meme that drives TRUMP's Agenda, even prior to reddit things begin on 4chan.
           </p>
           <p>
            4chan is where they disseminate the marching orders for the habara shills, from there they all head out to their target sites and pile on the memes until they get traction, then they return to 4chan, for new direction; How does one know this? Just follow the timelines.
           </p>

            Good points my friend. I do learn, you learn. I dumped the wikileak emails over the past year and read them follow this stuff, don't worry I get bored quick and this thing is winding down. No you will never here me say "I told you so" I don't seek affirmation from any man. I can tell you this I have known many great soldiers, they all be dead now. I know what a real leader looks like, and we don't have any. U bring up a good point on FEMA, the USD is kapoot, its all going down that is really what this is all about, RNC wants to put a band-aide and DNC wouldn't the band to keep playing on the Titanic deck. Smart men leave a civil war zone my friend long before the shooting begins.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            But lets talk of the situation at hand. NSA hates CIA. Romney is NSA and TRUMP needs him desperately. This CIA using Pizzagate to throw the election violates every national law we have, nothing is going to mend this fence between NSA &amp; CIA; The FBI is fucked they need to be purged they're fudge packers top to bottom. DOJ also Purge.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need a COUP friend and BAD. But again SOROS wants a civil war and more than likely that has a HIGHER PROBABILITY than a managed COUP. You know under smedly butler in 1937 depression, not unlike now the right-wing tried this COUP against the then FDR not unlike CLINTON-machine,and the right lost their ass. The problem is that too many vested interests in the USA want to maintain the status quo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus it all goes back to square-one, we wait until the US Dollar collapses DOJ/FBI goes unpaid, and we then reset america with good people. :)
