            Child Porn Charges Against Man In Israel
POSTED BY: BENJAMIN VITÁRIS  MARCH 13, 2017 IN FEATURED, NEWS UPDATES 2 COMMENTS
           </p>
           <p>
            A 50-year-old man from Tel Aviv, Israel was arrested for serious child porn charges.
On Sunday, the State Attorney’s Cyber Division filed an indictment to the Magistrate’s Court against the security employee. According to the indictment, the defendant advertised and watched extremely violent child porn videos. The man is charged with “obscene advertisement, possession of images of a minor, solicitation of a minor’s abuse, solicitation of a minor to use his body making an obscene advertisement.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The suspect was active on dark net pedophile forums in the past years, the indictment said. The defendant used these sites to download movies and photos showing the sexual abuse of children. After law enforcement authorities arrested the 50-year-old, they confiscated the hard drives of his computer. A forensic examination showed that the defendant had thousands of child porn movies and images on his drive. Police estimate the total size of the content at “several hundred gigabytes”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, the suspect allegedly used his computer to download movies and obscene images, where people were abusing various animals. According to law enforcement authorities, the 50-year-old watched this content for sexual gratification. Police found tens of thousands of animal abuse videos and pictures on his hard drive. Apart from this, investigators found a software on the man’s computer, which was used to share content by giving an access password. The forensic examination showed that the suspect did this 280 times.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2015 and 2016, the defendant allegedly contacted horror film producers in Honduras and Columbia, who specialized in making movies where minors were abused. For his request, the producers sent him seven movies, including the sexual and physical abuse of two children. However, the suspect complained to the producers that the films were not extreme enough to the extent required. Consequently, he urged them multiple times to send movies where minors were abused more severely. One of the producers sent two more films of the same nature to the defendant, according to the indictment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, the suspect allegedly reached out to women who agreed to abuse minors by following orders. He tried to find potential candidates on websites where women live broadcast pornography for a fee. However, the 50-year-old’s attempt was unsuccessful.
Since the defendant ordered hateful and extremist content, the prosecution seeks to arrest the accused until the legal proceedings end against him. It is unclear whether the suspect is still in police custody, or has been released.
           </p>
           <p>
            “This is not a case in which he is indifferent to the suffering of the minors, but he was interested in causing suffering to minors, to result in pleasure and sexual satisfaction. Furthermore, he was willing to pay that money, and worked actively to get others to harm minors for it,” the prosecutor said, requesting the further detention of the defendant.
           </p>
           <p>
            “As the Child Rights Committee chairman, and no less a mother to children, I was shocked to hear the details of the case,” Child Rights Committee Chairman, MK Yifat Biton Shasha, said in response to the case. “Such disgusting acts are the preserve of monsters. I call on the judicial system to prosecute the accused and impose the maximum punishment for all to see. We must deter people like this and condemn them. This moment is a test for the judges that this case reaches the front door. Furthermore, I call on the judicial system to remove the gag order on the identity of the suspect. This is our most basic responsibility to the child victims and their families.”
