            I can't see the part of the image that discusses the status rebuttals.  Was (B) and (C) not present on the doc, or were they left out of your post because they were not relevant?

            It's a great share either way.  Thanks.

             If it were only open for murder, it would be in the hands of DCMPD. This proves DOJ has stepped in and supplanted MPD in charge of the investigation.

              How exactly does this prove your claim?  It seems to me you are making an assumption here.  The assumption being the grand jury that is open is a federal grand jury.  Because they did not say it was a federal grand jury.  I'm wondering if that's significant.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have no expertise in FOIA docs or in local vs federal jurisdiction, but couldn't it be that MPD is still the lead agency in the case, but in some cases they reached to the FBI for assistance?  In this hypothetical, there still would be correspondence related to Seth Rich with DOJ.  My understanding is local police forces do reach out the FBI often and this is a reasonable hypothetical.

                The FOIA request asked for any correspondence the the USAO might have.  It did not ask if there was a federal grand jury.  A reason they were a denied was "A grand jury" is open, but did not mention if this is a federal or local grand jury.
               </p>
               <p>
                Unless anyone here is very good at Federal FOIA requests or the regular language used by the USAO, this remains an assumption.

               It seems to me you arent a lawyer, so let me explain.
              </p>
              <p>
               First - the exception being invoked is part of the arguement being claimed as reason for denying a FOIA. I cant invoked an exception stating on grounds it would interfere with a court case proceeding if say, there was not actually a court case on going. Likewise I can't claim exemptions stating that release of information would damage the ongoing proceedings are criminal investigation and a grand jury proceeding if those things were not already taking place.
              </p>
              <p>
               The exemption invoked thereby proves the fact that there is a court proceeding going on, without actually needing to stay in explicit terms that there is a court proceeding going on. Does that make sense?
              </p>
              <p>
               Think of it like the legal equivalent of me saying I can't hand it in because my dog ate it - the implication in that sentence is that I own a dog in order for the eating to have taken place. (sorry it's sometimes hard to translate lawyer speak for regular people).
              </p>
              <p>
               If it has gone to Grand Jury status beneath the auspices of the DOJ, than MPD is no longer the lead Agency on the case. Some agencies do AT times call in the FBI for assistance in case, and/or have their cases taken over by the FBI, but the fact that this has become a federally-recognized case beneath it Department implicates for us that what we are looking at is a case that has been given over in its entirety.

            That's great! I don't know how helpful this is, but I was gonna mention how special access is sometimes given when issuing a FOIA under an "author's exemption", specifically a published author. But seeing as this is an ongoing criminal case, I don't think we can request anymore info than we have. I wish we had some attorney we could ask for advice or use to request additional information.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope this is good news, I have far more faith in the justice system being able to handle it at this point.

                According to the July 9 Baltimore Sun, she was stabbed to death while  walking her two dogs in the Roland Park neighborhood in Baltimore.  No  suspects have been identified. [The Baltimore Sun published an updated article on July 11 with a few more details, but there is still no suspect or motive.  Funeral arrangements have not been announced yet.] [Update July 12:  Funeral arrangements are not yet confirmed, but Resources for the Future, where Molly worked for more than 30 years, will hold a memorial service in September.  Details TBA.]

               <p>
                Macauley was a valued member of the space policy community for decades and renowned for her expertise on the economics of satellites, especially in the earth observation arena. Her professional portfolio was much broader, however, including the use of economic incentives in environmental regulation, climate and earth science, and recycling and solid waste management.  She testified before Congress many times and was the author of more than 80 journal articles, books, and book chapters.
               </p>
               <p>
                She was Vice President for Research and a Senior Fellow at Resources for the Future, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on the economics of natural resources.  She was a past member of the Space Studies Board (SSB) and of the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board (ASEB) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and served on many of its study committees.  She was a member of the steering committee for the ongoing Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space at the time of her death.

                I bring up Molley whenever possible.  She was killed right after Seth Rich and Seth was murdered right after John Ashe. I may not have the order correct but right near each other.  Not many know about her. A Real Loss

                 Carmencita, when I read, also, that the DOJ is investigating SR, I, like you said a quick prayer that these three stranger than fiction murders  can be solved. Slowly the things we have known to be true are being confirmed as true. I don't remember where I read it but Europian surgeons confirmed this week that organ trafficking is happening, so, with eyes on the space program will help with these investigations. Thanks for the mention.

                  Oh I am so glad you are still checking in!  I too have seen some surprising admissions.  Believe me I was shocked about the Seth Rich investigation.  Amazing.  Let's hope it opens a whole can of worms and yes, it leads to what really happened to those three and hopefully Montano as well.  I believe he may be connected too.  Although thy were really on a murderous roll.

                  I pinged someone else. But he is not always on here too often.  Will see.  It had something to do with Obama's space program I believe.  She found out something they were up to. John Ashe died a short time he was to testify about a case involving some Chinese man involved with the Clintons, that I believe went all the way back to Arkansas.    Also there was another death that might be connected and that was Joe Montao aide to Tim Kaine (vp candidate for HRC) and you just have to know that Joe and Seth had to know each other both working on voter outreach.  This whole thing REEKS.

                   Good stuff.  You've got my attention.  Your theories pass the smell test and are plausible in my book.

                   Side note: our understanding of how "they" work and think sometimes scares me.  They have a sick mindset, and I wonder if we do damage to our own selves by learning their ways.  If so, I'm ok with it as long as the goal is reached, but I hope we keep our own humanity.  Does this make sense?

                    Yes it makes sense.  I believe there were weaklings that possibly were researching them or in LE too and they tripped stumbled and fell.  You have to be very strong to not follow.  Strong morals and  know that good and evil are cut and dry.   Those that are clear on what is good and evil they will not fall. It's never fuzzy to me.

                     I have always been one who thinks and acts in extremes like good vs evil, although until recently, I was more inclined to use definitions like right vs wrong and just vs unjust.  I've come closer to defining our current fight as good vs evil, though.

                     I get your lack of fuzziness.  I get criticized by some close to me for being so rigid, but as my username implies, when one is Lawful Good, clarity is easier.

                      I too am a stickler for right and wrong.  But I am ready to forgive very light shades of grey.  The hard stuff?  No way.  If someone were to stay to me well, the teen girl came on to me so, how could I refuse,  Some idiots would say  Well, she wanted it.  People have changed so much in the last 30 years.  A whole turnaround.  It's really sad. Why exactly we can't let people on here say horrid things about people of different races or about Children.  It's up to us to try to bring about that change and to call them out.
