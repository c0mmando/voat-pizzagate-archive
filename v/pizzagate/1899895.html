           <p>
            Existing criminal organizations in Sicily team up with Bonanno crime family in Brooklyn to develop a heroin distribution network using pizzerias is a conspiracy.

            Conspiracy theories help people feel more important than they are.  You imply that I've been sent here, but some larger entity. By raising my status to some of person who might be in danger, you raise your own.  It's comforting in a way.

            There's a particular stupid theory that Podesta emails contain the conspiracy to kill Scalia.  It involves some guy trying to make a movie in Texas.   I wouldn't trouble you with it.   It's really loopy.    But then again you believe a bunch of murders benefiting the Clintons.

            Because these "murders" are entirely fictional.  Why would you choose to deny reality?

           <p>
            The Scalia theory is particularly stupid even by conspiracy theory standards.  Then the idea that Podesta was involved and emails relate to it is just stupid on top of stupid.

            Yeah, they asked Poindexter about that.  He said he never meant to imply the pillow was over his face.   It was on the bed between his head and the headboard and there were no signs of foul play.  Scalia's doctor and family knew him to be in poor health.  He had a shoulder issue that they wouldn't operate on because he might not survive the surgery.

           <p>
            B.  An evening pool party?  In February?   In the freezing cold?    Scalia would have died before he got to bed.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you were describing where Scalia was you would say a hunting trip because that is what he was on and hunts were the activities planned.

            Two things about Bernie.  1.  The CF bought him and wife a lake house, evidently to quiet any hurt feelings about not getting nomination 2.  His wife did some creative things in her tenure as college president that ended up closing the school.  Possibly, HRC, BC and CF would send in people to examine and then......

             As I recall Bernie's wife made  serious misrepresentations, if not outright lies  under penalty of perjury on the college mortgage loan application. If you think about your own mortgage, applicants are suppose to fund their own downpayments, not borrow money in order to borrow more money. Anyway, she inflated and maybe even lied about the source of the equity  and/or  downpayment on the part of the college. Given the amount of the loan, this could very well have been a felony.  The college went bankrupt anyway and there are felony provisions for hanky-pank  leading up to a ibankruptcy separate and apart from the banking crimes. In reality few if any white collar criminals see prison time for such crimes but the monetary penalties and fines would have bankrupted Mrs. Sanders and indirectly Bernie. To say nothing of ruined reputations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now this is my take on the situation. I have never studied the facts carefully and I have never read any explanations for Bernie's capitulation that resembles my theory so I could be full of b.s. I was and remain a Bernie supporter and was shocked by his post primary conduct. But I felt the TBTB had a sword over his head and so in time I forgave him or i should say with Hillary's defeat I forgave him.

            Also, even the liberal rag DailyKos published an election watchdog study demonstrating that Sanders would have won by a landslide if vote fraud hadn't happened during the Democratic primaries. And that is
            <strong>
             aside from
            </strong>
            the superdelegates that are openly used by the DNC to rig primaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are some of their conclusions about how the fraud was done:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Targeted voter suppression
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Registration tampering
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Illegal voter purges
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Exit polling discrepancies
           </p>
           <p>
            5)
            <strong>
             Evidence for voting machine tampering
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            6)
            <strong>
             The security (or lack thereof) of various voting machine types

              The DNC doesn't need anything as complicated as blackmail to get the superdelegates to vote the way they want.
             </p>
             <p>
              In most states the superdelegates are required by a legal agreement to vote the way the Democratic party tells them to. If they were to vote any other way, they are subject to civil legal penalties. In most cases, a superdelegate who defies party orders will end up paying a "fine" (really a civil legal settlement) and will never get to be a superdelegate again.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are a few states where superdelegates are legally free to vote their conscience, but in those states, the party brass makes sure that only "reliable" party members, who will vote the way they want, get chosen. The number states that have free superdelegates are so small that it doesn't make much of a difference to the overall result anyhow.
