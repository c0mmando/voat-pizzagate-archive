<p>Again i am sorry for the disorganized manner this pictures are submitted. I cannot work on this, i need you to join all the dots yourself. The ring is huge, the amount of people on it is impossible to know. Please make sure to save this data and dont let trolls and debunkers ruin this information. Just stay focused and to the point. This is important.</p>
<p>I need everybodys help to search/look/uncover more info on members, activities, codewords. We need to be quick before they start erasing all possible evidence.
Most members of this Pedophile Ring belong to LGBT communities, support Hillary actively and work particularly in Child Care. 
Please look for the word &quot;obsessed&quot; &quot;thrilled&quot; &quot;excited&quot; or various strange extremists manners of expressing delight upon the imagen of an infant.
Please look for the word BIBI as a new term coined by the pedo\'s to refer to their child lover
Please look for the phrase &quot;im not crying, you are crying&quot; as a hint between themselves, used for calming their victims.
Please look for an exagerated show of family photos, this is just like a supermarket show for pedo\'s to choose what they like. Understand that in this ring they are two types of people BUYERS and SELLERS. GIDON FEE is a buyer, JOEY KRAMINER and KIKI ODED are sellers.
Please look for images of pigs. references to teddy bears, references to disneyland
Please look for the word SLAY</p>
<p>Thank you and sorry for not making more but i am truly scared of these demonic beings. I truly believed they are evil and we need to fight them together. Any intent at trying to divide us should we interpret instantly as a double face against the truth being revealead. 
May god guide us,</p>

            I'm seeing an INSTANT red flag here, this Feen character is certainly most interesting:
           </p>
           <p>
            Gidon Feen
           </p>
           <p>
            As the founder and editor-in-chief of “CYHSB Weekly” (The Cooper Yeshiva High School for Boys) Gidon brought homosexuality to the forefront of his high school Orthodox community in Memphis, TN. Since then, he has continued to champion Jewish Orthodox LGBT rights, joining Eshel’s speakers bureau. Gidon has been invited to speak at Brandeis University, the University of Maryland, and to numerous parent groups and communities. He is now in his senior year at the George Washington University, studying International Affairs. On campus Gidon helped orchestrate the largest TEDx college event in the world and was part of Hillel’s Jewish Learning Fellowship. He previously worked at the White House and on Hillary Clinton’s presidential election campaign. Gidon identifies as Modern Orthodox.

              FROM THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
I remember telling my mom after
coming back to St. Louis from
Washington DC that, “I’m
              <strong>
               excited
              </strong>
              for when I get to go back home.” My
mom gave me an odd look, saying,
“Gidon what do you mean? You just
came back from DC and are now
home.” Realizing the mistake I
made I gave an embarrassed smile
and explained that I meant
Memphis. Well, now that she’s not
here, it’s great to be home.

            Gidon Feen gets around quite a bit in DC.  Here we see Alefantis and Feen spotted on 04/29/17 at The Non-White House Correspondents Party hosted by the left wing, cruel, hypocritical, non-defender of free speech, fake, phony, full of shit - Samantha Bee.
           </p>
           <p>
            Memory reftesher - President Trump declined to attend the "real" White House Correspondents Party, so as a sick joke, Bee decided to throw an alternative one.
           </p>
           <p>
            "SPOTTED at the Samantha Bee “Not the White House Correspondents” Dinner at the DAR Constitution Hall -- (Video of Bee’s opening segment Will Ferrell returned as George W. Bush: Dana Bash, Jake Tapper, Jim Acosta, Ari Melber, Betsy Woodruff, Hadas Gold, Matt Walsh, Kurt Bardella, Adam Hodge, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), Ana Gasteyer, Don Lemon, Jonathan Capehart, Steve Clemons, Andrew Oros, Margaret Carlson, James Alefantis, Jessica Williams, Gidon Feen, Josh and Ali Rogin and Max and Becky Weinberg."

             He certainly goes around and that takes a long trip to visit foreign babies.
Take a look to this instagram account, he posts photo of macy pig ride in Georgia where adults can ride with kids and says:
"Officially a Georgia 🍑. Pricilla welcomed me into the family #pinkpig 🐷"
Again the figure of the pig for the "Rich"
Also see picture of red dog costume  with comment "Spent the morning advocating for childhood literacy as everyone's favorite red dog #reading #literacymatters 🐶📚"

            Now take a look at his very weirdy homo Instagram account. He is hanging with Hillary and Bill Clinton themselves in several pictures, you make your own assumptions as to why

           <p>
            Please take note again of the phrase "im not crying, you are crying" it is widely used as a hint, i believe it is like a sort of mental mantra trap for little children involving depersonalization.
Again, take note of the word EXCITE, OBSESSED, SLAY. When they say it feels as if they are applauding the behaviour. These people take care of each other, they are very careful with what they say, but from time to time they get sloppy, all jokes feel very sectarious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding PIG. Just check what the Talmud says about the Goyim (non-jews). Do your own research. We are livestock to these people and i believe it is a fusion between Zionism and the Caanite religion (hence the use of Moloch a sacrificial deity). They are killing children both for pleasure and to boost their own health while supporting their acts on their own religion. Every mention or picture to dead pigs, roasted pigs, dogs, etc, is just a mention of goyim, which are considered animal food to their own particular views (which clearly are not the ones of any regular sane jewish individual).
           </p>
           <p>
            The LGBT movement is a hook to push the moral boundaries of world society. Again nothing against the gay movement itself. These people love to use screens as cover up for other things. So if you accuse them they will call you homophobic or antisemitic, they need to hide under a moral superiority and make you feel guilty for even thinking about accusing them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also please remember Pizza is an old codeword. They know they have been revealed so that is why they are changing the coded language. That is why we need to start making a glossary again for the codewording they are using.

            Jeanette Lindholt Madsen based on one of her comments (if OPs code is correct) might need looking into.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who is a facebook friend of Alefantis is also a potential person of interest.
           </p>
           <p>
            If by the term "demonic beings" OP means "metaphorical demon" (basically a person who's pure evil), then yeah I'd be inclined to believe them in that regard.

            Beyond my scope, but, you have my proverbial support.

           <p>
            PS: regarding the demonic beings stuff, I hear ya, there's a bit more to it than that but you're not totally off-track - just advisable to not use such wording or they(the shills) latch on to it like mad - whether there's truth to 'demons' or whether they just see it as the perfect way to discredit someone, it's fodder.

              "demonic" is a matter of semantics, is my point. What the OP refers to, however 'real' or not, have/has been described by many religions under different names and visages. The interesting part is that despite obvious differences in the tellings, certain factors and elements remain largely unchanged.

            I was with you and was going to upvoat until I got to this:  "
            <strong>
             <strong>
              i am truly scared of these demonic beings.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            I truly believed they are evil and we need to fight them together. Any intent at trying to divide us should we interpret instantly as a double face against the truth being revealead. May god guide us,"
           </p>
           <p>
            This is supposedly a research subforum.  Do you have one iota of empirical evidence to support your assertion that they are "demonic beings?"  Of course you don't because it's superstitious nonsense.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Any intent at trying to divide us should we interpret instantly as a double face against the truth being revealead."
           </p>
           <p>
            So, anyone who downvoats this post is automatically "trying to divide us" to prevent "the truth from being revealed."
           </p>
           <p>
            It COULDN'T POSSIBLY be that some here disagree with your "religious" views so downvoated your post for that reason -- right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Please take a logic course and then get back to us.  Of course, in order to process the logic info you will have to put your superstitions aside, which may be a lost cause.

              as esoteric said, ignore the shit heads, it's hard sometimes (believe me I know), but, given enough time you'll start to see who the blatant trolls/shills are - they're going to no effort to hide themselves lately.
