           There goes the neighborhood. Or at least that's what the Advisory Neighborhood Commission ("ANC") thought when they saw Comet Pizza and Ping Pong move into this normally placid section of Connecticut Avenue.

            That's the same thing that neighbor guy said at the City Counsel meeting or Zoning meeting!    Must have been him that typed up a review as well!

            Comet was featured (with Jimmy on the cover) in a DC gay magazine.   In another, Jimmy and CTR Brock were named a 'DC Power Couple."

             Yes, after reading more, I think you're right.  Just general apathy about a punk ping pong pizza bar with numerous unexplained children at all hours in a relatively quiet neighborhood.  Didn't make sense.  He's a commissioner, not an Illuminati operative. haha. (the ANC guy)

              Someone posted a MP3 the other night of that guy getting shouted down at the meeting when he showed up to oppose it. He (the guy screaming 'murder') took video of the Comet place wiht a ping pong table set up at night outside.
