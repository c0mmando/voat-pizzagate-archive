<p>Women who have had sex with Keith Raniere say it was billed as a spiritual experience, a transfer of his godlike energy.</p>
<p>One said Raniere told her their union would make her see a blue light.</p>
<p>Another recalled him explaining a threesome would cure the pain of childhood molestation — that she could then start to view sex as just sex.</p>
<p>Today, two women who had sex with him when they were just girls, the sister of a third underage partner of Raniere\'s, and some of Raniere\'s former adult lovers have come forward to tell their stories.</p>
<p>One woman, whose name is being withheld for this story, was just a girl in 1990, a 12-year-old with feathered bangs and long blond hair who was trying to adjust to a new life following her parents\' divorce and a move from the country to Clifton Park. Her mother was a saleswoman for Raniere\'s members-only buying club, Consumers\' Buyline Inc., and was trying to raise two daughters.</p>
<p>She recalled her mother saying Raniere was &quot;an Einstein.&quot; Consumers\' Buyline, which Raniere ran through the first half of the 1990s after he left a job as a computer programmer for the state Division of Parole, was the kind of place where managers kept late hours and the culture was informal. Raniere would call staff meetings to deliver sometimes tearful, emotional messages. He frequently showed a film about a man who plants seeds in the desert to build a forest. He suggested he was that type of noble cultivator of people.</p>
<p>The girl was a seedling, a kid who thought of boys as schoolyard playmates. She hadn\'t even started a seventh-grader\'s crush on New Kids on the Block.</p>
<p>When Raniere offered free tutoring, the girl\'s mother jumped at the opportunity. At the same time, that girl has recalled today, one of Raniere\'s longtime girlfriends, Pamela Cafritz, hired her to walk a dog twice a day.</p>
<p>Cafritz encouraged the girl\'s visits to the townhouse she and Raniere shared with other women. And Raniere showered the girl with attention. She said he urged her to talk about her life. He gave her a necklace — a heart with a stone in it.</p>
<p>The girl had braces and bright eyes, liked to climb trees and play with Matchbox cars. Raniere was almost 30 and dressed in business suits. He was spearheading a company that boasted of selling at least 250,000 memberships nationwide.</p>
<p>He was supposed to teach her Latin and algebra. Instead, she said, he told her she hugged like a child, her arms wrapped around him but her hips pushed away.</p>
<p>He taught her to hug the way adults do, pelvis-to-pelvis.</p>
<p>He took her virginity.</p>
<p>The girl liked being able to hang out with Raniere and the women around him. She thought sex was just part of fitting in</p>
<p>&quot;They told me I was smart and took an interest in me; they let me spend every afternoon at their house,&quot; she said. &quot;It was exciting to be somewhere where people wanted me. I was perfect picking — insecure at the time... To have someone that mature and that well thought of to be interested in me, it was flattering. I was young, inexperienced, overwhelmed, out of my league.&quot;</p>
<p>Even though the girl was several years shy of the legal age for sexual consent in New York, which is 17, Raniere continued to have sex with her not only in his townhouse but in empty offices, in an elevator and in a broom closet at the plaza that housed Consumers\' Buyline, she said.</p>
<p>But after several months and about 60 sexual encounters with Raniere, she said, her emotions had changed. She started skipping school and running away from home. He lived nearby, and as her uncertainty about the relationship grew, she didn\'t feel safe at home.</p>
<p>It wasn\'t until 1993, about two years after their relationship ended, that the woman reported the sex with Raniere to police.</p>
<p>..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>In 1984, when Raniere was living in apartments in Troy, he met Gina Melita, a 15-year-old from Cohoes who performed with him in an RPI theater group that included members of the community.</p>
<p>Melita was a precocious girl with an independent streak and a longing to find meaning. Before she met Raniere, she had explored being a born-again Christian. She kept journals and wrote poetry and thought school was holding her back from discovering what life was about.</p>
<p>She and Raniere, then 24, went to arcades together, where he liked to play Pac-Man and a game called Vanguard, in which destroying enemies increases the fuel in the player\'s tank. He described himself as a genius and judo champion. She thought it was cool to be with an older, smart guy who might help her graduate from high school early. He took her virginity in a dark room, her T-shirt left flecked with blood. She told him it was painful, yet a short time later, he wanted more. During their four-month relationship, he hounded the 135-pound girl to lose weight and urged her to keep their relationship secret from her mother.</p>

<p>After a while, she said she told Raniere she wanted to break off the relationship but he told her they should keep having sex. Even as a 15-year-old, she said, she realized Raniere didn\'t care about her.</p>
<p>..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Before Melita left Raniere\'s life, though, she had introduced him to a 15-year old friend from Cohoes High School named Gina Hutchinson, another girl from a broken family in the working-class town.</p>
<p>Hutchinson isn\'t here to tell her story. She died in 2002, when she was 33. She went to a Buddhist monastery in Woodstock and for reasons that remain unknown, shot herself in the head.</p>
<p>Her sister, Heidi Hutchinson, is left to speak for her.</p>
<p>It was the Christmas season of 1984 and around the time of Gina\'s 16th birthday when Heidi discovered Gina was having sex with Raniere. Heidi was home from college and Raniere crawled through the window of her sister\'s bedroom</p>
<p>After Gina, who was raised as a Mormon, revealed the details of their relationship, Heidi confronted Raniere. Heidi said Raniere told her she did not understand her sister\'s soul was much older than her biological age. He explained Gina was a Buddhist goddess meant to be with him.</p>
<p>Raniere convinced Gina to drop out of school and be tutored by him, her sister recalled. The Hutchinson family assumed they would marry</p>
<p>Gina, a good listener who would introduce herself to strangers at bus stops and who had a burning curiosity about spiritual things, worked at Consumers\' Buyline, continuing at least a friendship with Raniere for many years. Heidi doesn\'t know exactly how long her sister\'s sexual relationship with Raniere lasted.</p>
<p>Gina studied religion and anthropology at the University at Albany and found mentors among her male professors, which her sister said Raniere didn\'t like. And in those times Gina tried to break away, Heidi said, one of the women in Raniere\'s inner circle would call repeatedly, urging her to return.</p>
<p>When Gina killed herself, she was found with a Buddha medal in her pocket. Only a few days earlier, she had sent a friend a card that said &quot;Never stop believing.&quot;

<p>These are just 3 girls, who have spoken out, one being told by her sister </p>
<p>How many more were there?</p>',

            NXIVM is some dark shit. This NYTimes article talks about women unknowingly sitting down to watch a snuff film involving  the murder and dismemberment  of four women.

            This one from Vanity Fair in 2010 talks about some golden child named Gaelen, who was being groomed to be Raniere's heir, whose origin is a mystery, and who was being taken care of by "by five nannies who each speak to him in a different language—including Russian, Spanish, Hindi, and Chinese."

            So this must be the 12-year old girl that has been mentioned. Of course incident was 28 years ago and outside of statue of limitations.

            Raniere's operation seems all about getting sex and money for Raniere himself. Well, apparently there's that Dalai Lama male aide seduced in a hot tub also and there was a lot of lesbian sex, much involuntary. Other than that though, AFAIK no allegations that The Vanguard used sex (esp. illicit) for blackmail and to control others. (Apparently part of Epstein's operation.)
           </p>
           <p>
            It's interesting that the DOS ladies had to submit information compromising themselves or their family (info could be real or fake though). That suggest blackmail and control possibilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Charges of 'sex trafficking' against KR at this point seem to focus on the cooercive aspects of his DOS 'social club', not so much the usual thing we might think of. The biggest revelation so far is three of the NXIVM inner circle were also CGI members, along with a minor political donation to HRC.

            <em>
             There's a couple of things investigator Frank Parlato has brought up that really interest me about this story:
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            1) The Libyan backstory:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://frankreport.com/2016/01/13/more-on-sara-bronfmans-husband-and-a-libyans-view-of-nxivm/">
             https://frankreport.com/2016/01/13/more-on-sara-bronfmans-husband-and-a-libyans-view-of-nxivm/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            According to this story Sara Bronfman is married to a photogenic Libyan Basit Igtet since 2012, who wants to be the Zionist-friendly ruler of Libya and is backed by McCain and Liebermann, as well as the Bronfman empire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good tie in to HRC and the Kenyan bombing Libya back to the stone age, in the context of a garden variety Zionist plot. What a mess, and a necessary precursor to unlimited immigration into Europe through Libya. When I want to redpill people I tell them you can buy a black male slave for $400 in Libya nowadays thanks to their wonder children Obama and Clinton. (Hell, back in the day during the revolt it was widely reported the 'good guy' rebels were hanging kaffirs in Libya.)
           </p>
           <p>
            (More here:

            )
           </p>

            2) The Vanguard as Nazi:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            According to this story there was some kind of struggle between Raniere and the Bronfman empire. Raniere's weapon against Zionism is that he has proof the holocaust was just a big hoax though. He even claims some of his lovers were reincarnated top level Nazis.

            Okay I think this one seems bogus, might appeal to some voat users.

            "he liked to play Pac-Man and a game called Vanguard", well actually, Raniere titles himself "The Vanguard"!
           </p>
           <p>
            It's rather pathetic, they claim he's some kind of sex god, but then if you read about the 'DOS' 'social club' (which is an entirely separate organization from the NXIVM of course :) ), they go to great lengths to keep it a secret that the grand prize is going to be sex with Keith Raniere indeed that the only male in the club is him. Accounts I've read emphasize the reluctance of the participants, or is that just 'buyers remorse'?

              No doubt, the name is from the game. What is the significance?
             </p>
             <p>
              "Plot
             </p>
             <p>
              The Gond has been terrorizing nearby space colonies with its periodic raids of destruction. The time has come to put an end to his reign of terror. The player has been selected to pilot an advanced fighter ship with high offensive capabilities, and must enter the cave inside the asteroid where the Gond makes his home, and safely fly through every zone; the Mountain Zone, Rainbow Zone, Styx Zone, Stripe Zone, Bleak Zone, and the City of Mystery (aka Last Zone) where the Gond is rumored to reside. The player must take the Gond out, and succeed in the mission. If unsuccessful, the colonies will be doomed."
             </p>
             <p>
              So let's see, The Gond must be Edgar Bronfman Sr. and The Vanguard is going to save us with his neurolinguistic offensive capabilities. Just kidding, what a dorky wanker Raniere really is!
             </p>
             <p>
              Speaking of 'dorky wankers', I've read varying accounts of his charisma. I think he worked the social approval he got from his gallery of admiring females. 'No really, Keith is a frigging genius and also highly evolved."

            Those characteristics include grandiosity, fantasies of power, belief in their own status, insistence on excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, interpersonal exploitation and lack of true empathy
           </p>
           <p>
            The process of involvement and control is gradual," Ross said. "There's a spoon-feeding process, constant emphasis on the special nature of the leader, the aura of power and intellect of the leader. ... It's not unusual for women or men to fall in love with their therapist. With cult leaders, there are no boundaries. ... You see the leader in godlike terms, and it's difficult to refuse anything that the leader wants.
           </p>
           <p>
            . Cult leaders "have sex with their followers and it has as much to do with power and control as it has to do with sex," Ross said.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the final years of the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Texas, Ross said, David Koresh used sex to control the compound.

             This is F'd up!  "Rational Inquiry," God nows how many women and children this degenerate sicko has brainwashed.  Say he's eventually sentenced to a minimum of 15-years.  He will never serve the full sentence.  While he sits in his special treatment prison cell, someone else takes his place.
