<p>Let\'s remember that <strong>Donna Karan</strong>, founder of the notorious fashion house <strong>&quot;DKNY&quot;</strong> is directly very tied to the <strong>Clintons</strong>, so tied I\'m actually surprised her name has remain in the surface of this pizza/pedo gate:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3283662/Designer-Donna-Karan-cheated-husband-YEARS-married-love-life-nervous-met-BFF-Barbra-Streisand-time-pop-Valium.html">&quot;She designed 20 suits for Bill Clinton...&quot;</a></p>

<p>Ok so the connection between the families is there, now let\'s see what <a href="http://wikileaks.org">wikileaks</a> said about the Donna-Clinton connect:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/365">The Clinton Foundation gave the 2012 &quot;Global Citizen Award&quot; to DK for her work in Haiti</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40421">Donna Karan as key factor on Clinton\'s Foundation\'s &quot;Art and Handicrafts&quot; </a> !!!!!!</p>
<p>Ok so here is where things start to get fishy... in this email found in <strong>wikileaks</strong> Donna is sending a very specific birthday message to Hillary Clinton...</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/17498">&quot;7 easy pieces&quot; birthday message.. (sounds like spirit cooking to me)</a> </p>
<p>All of us following this subject relate the <strong>7 easy pieces</strong> with <strong>Marina Abramovic</strong>, actually, if you google &quot;7 easy pieces&quot; all you find is articles about <strong>Donna or Marina</strong>. People interested in the occult might know that the seven pieces is an old term used in magick rituals, for different purposes as representing the creation of the planets and, that, <strong>Aleister Crowley</strong>, founder of Marina\'s beloved <strong>&quot;Thelema&quot;</strong> religion used the term numerous times in his writings and teachings:</p>
<p><a href="http://thelema.ca/156/Confessions/chapter81.html">Aleister Crowley 7 pieces symbolism </a></p>
<p>So after all this coincidental coincidences I found more than strange that, the &quot;mother&quot; of modern fashion itself was so obsessed with <strong>Haitian pizza!!!</strong> while being based in New York City and having the opportunity to be in Italy any given day of the week because of Fashion manners:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/08/donna-karan-home-turks-caicos-parrot-cay">Donna Karan: &quot;I have to say that Haiti has some of the best pizza I’ve ever had.&quot;</a> !!!!!</p>
<p>Even though she can fly to Italy on her private jet any moment she wants and while being a New Yorker from Queens, she preferred to mention Haiti\'s Pizza instead... the insolence of these people is outraging!! </p>
<p>I still wouldn\'t find that odd enough if I didn\'t know that after being economically and totally backed up by the <strong>Clinton Foundation</strong> in Haiti as part of the foundation\'s &quot;art&quot; program, her brand Urban Zen and her <strong>&quot;Children for Children&quot;</strong> &quot;initiative&quot; partnered up with <strong>&quot;Sow a seed&quot;</strong> organization with the goal of <strong>&quot;bringing hope and creating sustainable change in the lives of orphans in Haiti.&quot;</strong> What I found weird about it is that the logo of the &quot;orphan helper&quot; &quot;non-profit&quot; organization is very similar to the &quot;GLogo&quot; or &quot;Girl lover&quot; logo found in this #pizzagate investigation, not forgetting the ties between Donna Karan and Kim Kardashian (one of Marina\'s spirit cookers) designing together for this organization,  look it up yourselves:</p>

<p>This is still a conspiracy but, after knowing that Donna Karan was part of the master plan of the Clintons for their foundation and with all the hype going on in Haiti with the child trafficking through Dominican Republic and all the initiatives related to the Clintons and orphanages, after her own words about her love for Haitian pizza, don\'t you guys think there\'s a connection that we should dig a bit deeper into it?</p>
<p>Let me know what y\'all think! and keep fighting the good fight!</p>

           Ok so the connection between the families is there, now let's see what

           !!!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
           Ok so here is where things start to get fishy... in this email found in
           <strong>
            wikileaks
           </strong>
           Donna is sending a very specific birthday message to Hillary Clinton...
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/17498">
            "7 easy pieces" birthday message.. (sounds like spirit cooking to me)
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           All of us following this subject relate the
           <strong>
            7 easy pieces
           </strong>
           with
           <strong>
            Marina Abramovic
           </strong>
           , actually, if you google "7 easy pieces" all you find is articles about
           <strong>
            Donna or Marina
           </strong>
           . People interested in the occult might know that the seven pieces is an old term used in magick rituals, for different purposes as representing the creation of the planets and, that,
           <strong>
            Aleister Crowley
           </strong>
           , founder of Marina's beloved
           <strong>
            "Thelema"
           </strong>
           religion used the term numerous times in his writings and teachings:
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://thelema.ca/156/Confessions/chapter81.html">
            Aleister Crowley 7 pieces symbolism
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           So after all this coincidental coincidences I found more than strange that, the "mother" of modern fashion itself was so obsessed with
           <strong>
            Haitian pizza!!!
           </strong>
           while being based in New York City and having the opportunity to be in Italy any given day of the week because of Fashion manners:
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/08/donna-karan-home-turks-caicos-parrot-cay">
            Donna Karan: "I have to say that Haiti has some of the best pizza I’ve ever had."
           </a>
           !!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
           Even though she can fly to Italy on her private jet any moment she wants and while being a New Yorker from Queens, she preferred to mention Haiti's Pizza instead... the insolence of these people is outraging!!
          </p>
          <p>
           I still wouldn't find that odd enough if I didn't know that after being economically and totally backed up by the
           <strong>
            Clinton Foundation
           </strong>
           in Haiti as part of the foundation's "art" program, her brand Urban Zen and her
           <strong>
            "Children for Children"
           </strong>
           "initiative" partnered up with
           <strong>
            "Sow a seed"
           </strong>
           organization with the goal of
           <strong>
            "bringing hope and creating sustainable change in the lives of orphans in Haiti."
           </strong>
           What I found weird about it is that the logo of the "orphan helper" "non-profit" organization is very similar to the "GLogo" or "Girl lover" logo found in this #pizzagate investigation, not forgetting the ties between Donna Karan and Kim Kardashian (one of Marina's spirit cookers) designing together for this organization,  look it up yourselves:

            Very interesting. There's no way DK doesn't know what's going on especially when she's vacationing with the clintons and around them in that environment. I always thought she was Jewish and she'd talked about it years ago in fashion articles. I guess maybe Kabbalah since they practice the occult. I also personally thought she was a lesbian for some reason and it sounds like she's into little Haitian girls. What a sick pig. Again, WTF is a "Haitian Pizza" besides an under 12 yr old girl. These sick fucks think they can front their Save The Children propaganda and hide behind it meanwhile all the Goyum think they're heros for their humanitarian efforts.

            The kardashians are a whole other batch of wicked evil. Kris Jenner being their handler. Every single one of those kids is messed up psychologically. Kanye West was reprogrammed at the psych hospital because he came out with the truth in his last rant. I've never liked him whatsoever but after his last rant I was fascinated by what would happen once the handlers got ahold of him-yup, in the psych ward for reprogramming. This just confirms Hollywierd and its celebs and musicians are all programmed robots.

              Wow. Did u notice the whole article talks about Kabbalah. They're all Luciferian blood drinking vampires. Sometimes I feel for Lohan she must have been just passed out to everyone in the circle. Pretty sad.

            First off, burn any DKNY crap. If you are involved with the clintons, you are involved in bullshit of the smelliest kind.
I've been wondering about the fake fashion industry from the beginning of the pizzagate inquiry.  Many designers would HAVE to be involved.  Take for instance, Georgio Armani, who designed madonna's illuminati cape that almost choked her to death at some awards show.  If it has "art" and "celebrities" involved, it's probably a guaranteed part of this deranged nonsense.

            The CF helped build a sewing factory in Haiti. It involved Koreans, and the Gap, DKNY has associations with the Gap (I know someone who did freelance work for DKNY). the apparel industry will often use "piece work" in manufacturing terms, or "pieces" from a collection, but the birthday email language is different and I agree that it is weird.

            There's the art world where Karan promoted the Haitian artisans works and then there's also George Webb's video series where he has reported on President of Rwanda Kagame,  Martelle who was in power in Haiti and also Paul Farmer in his videos.  All three of these individuals are also mentioned as being connected to Karan &amp; her Foundation.

             Do it! I am almost convinced there's a connection with child trafficking here.

            Good work OP. I definitely think this is worth digging deeper. Anyone directly tied to the Clintons is suspect as it is, but when you bring child charities and pedo logos into it, they certainly look even more suspicious.

             Thanks, I think this is bigger than we think I'm pretty sure this has to do with the way they got all those innocent children away.

             Huma Abedin comes off as the most compassionate in this article. She explains that they need medical supplies, surgeons &amp; trauma doctors first. Interesting find. Chelsea &amp; Jane sound like they are being manipulated by Donna Karan who has her own motives for sending down alternative doctors to Haiti.
