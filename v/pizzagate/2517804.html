            There will be no consequences. This should be clear by now? The CIA said they lost Kennedy's brain when it was demanded they return it for an independent autopsy. Dang it, they lost it. Why were they allowed to seize it from the doctors in the first place? No consequences. Our entire history is of Spooks being above the law while commiting every crime, politicians in endless probes and investigations, nobody goes to jail. Except for Lyndon Larouche. He claimed Bush was an occultist mass murderer and our government was Satanic. He had charges of fraud trumped up on him and was jailed. Other than that, zero corruption and consequences for our leaders.

             You're right. It was business as usual for the Cannibal Elite to cover for one another and derail any honest attempt to out them.

             I believe there will be arrests and convictions. If there are, it will demonstrate that things are different. We'll all find out together.

              There isn't even an investigation, how can their be arrest? They know what they are doing, the entire system is owned by the Rothschild banking cartel, and the children are being procured for their beast system. Who do you guys suppose will be doing the arresting and jailing? They don't work for us, they work for the controlers. This is not your country, you have no say.

             its definitely the same oblivious bitch always trying to make it about cannibalism.  she literally said "Trump is a savior sent from God."  have u noticed they dont even try to defend his ties to extremist supremacist Judaism?  not just his family but e.g. the presidential pardon of the notorious and infamous human trafficker meth-dealer kosher meatpacker, which included sexual abuse of minors.

              But we have Trump's tweet on Oct8, 2012. It was from the heart. I believe in Donald, despite Syria debacle.... I believe in him. Fact - NXIVM and Keith had been dodging law enforcement during Bush and Obama years, yet with Trump in office he gets nabbed. Coincidence?

               What is hard to understand about controlled opposition and kikeshilling?  The most OBVIOUS tactic is to nominate Satan herself and elect a false savior.  I don't care if Trump puts Hillary, Obama, and 1/3 of the government in prison.  We have a JEWISH problem; what do you think the pedo blackmail's PURPOSE is? To protect Israel and Jewish dominance of our media, brainwashing us into thinking it doesn't matter if white countries are on the road to quick extinction.  OP would even have you believe it is for CANNIBALISM, because she is a particularly silly woman.

            Now is the time we need to be on high alert.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all the shit that's breaking just within last week alone, the deep state is obviously going to be plotting a false flag to control the narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            That flag in the image is the new Antifa flag. Note the similarities between it and the Nazi flag. Some of Antifa's other flags resembled Ukranian fascist flags.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems the plot is for Antifa to do something violent and frame conservatives as Nazis.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can fight this thing. We just need some autists to do the following:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Where is Antifa deploying within the next two weeks?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Watch the ads for crisis actor deployments for the next two weeks.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Fun fact: Nazi idealogy is actual Authoritarian LEFT (ie National SOCIALISM) not right leaning (that false depiction is to frame conservatives). It is only more right leaning than communism, the extreme end of authoritarian left.

             Maybe they're getting ready to roll out the false flag to end all false flags. people need to watch this series and be worried, very worried.

             Well, at least David Hogg won't be involved. He's looking way too old to pass for a teen. Did you see his last photo op? Looked in his late 20s. Can't hide that kind of aging. Even the snowflakes would be suspicious. Wonder if Hogg ever starred in one of Ed Buck's films? The ones that went straight from cell phone onto the dark web pay-per-viiew?

             They gave us Parkland false flag but to their dismay they picked the worst crisis actor to date( David Hogg - who could not even stick to script. He changed his narrative 180 deg (Riding a bicycle vs being in a enivornmental class) Wonder why he vanished from the news?! But this time they are going to stick with adults - for teenagers don't make good actors. They give us one for sure. We know the narrative; White male, on psychotropic drugs.... random shooter (no motive), AR - 15.... we know the drift. PG is vindicated 100%. They know it's the begining of the end. They may coerce Trump into starting another war.
