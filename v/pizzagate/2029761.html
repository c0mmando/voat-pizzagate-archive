            Those glitching videos of Assange are real, but they use morph cuts to edit out filler words or pauses.

            It's a tool in After Effects. It's used all the time by youtubers and you'll see it a lot once you start looking for it. I thought it was faked at first too.

            Julian has been dead since his internet got cut last year. Research what happened those days and how fucking many months it took to "see" the guy next time. No fucking way that was possible.

            First interviews months after that, eyes flipping and wrinkles suddenly gone next day..

            Another thing that puzzles me is that now the Swedes have dropped the rape case, the only charge outstanding is that Assange skipped bail. There's no extradition request from the US, so why doesn't Assange leave the Ecuadorian embassy and go to court? Skipping bail is not such a big deal. I'm not sure what the logic is behind Assange continuing to seek refuge in the embassy.

             He doesn't know if the Australian government has revoked his passport as they won't confirm or deny. This is a common way for governments to operate where they have no jurisdiction. Revoke their (the citizen's) passport then get the local government to arrest for lack of proper documentation.

            As soon as Pammy rolled up, I had my suspicions about Assange. She also attends Marina Abramovic's 'art' parties where they dissect naked bodies made of cake, eat pizza and hot dogs and carry on in a very strange way... illuminati? ... all the signs are there plus Marina is big friends with the Podestas, so they're all part of the same circle.

            Yes and yes Cybernetics and ASolo. Watch Richard Hall's very interesting series of videos on Assange and his background. Part 1 is here:

            </a>
            Also Dave McGowan's essays on 'Laurel Canyon and the birth of the hippie generation' are really worth reading. So many leading musicians of that era had military backgrounds. It's a series of long essays that takes several hours to read, but they're very well written and thought-provoking.

             While every effort has been made by government to make "hippie" a hated reference there was a very real and valid movement of YOUTH in a revolution that stood against the MIC and it's war machinery and warmongering around the world -- especially in regard to Vietnam.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was also a very real and valid movement against consumerism - capitalism and its evils -- and the exploitation of nature and humans.  What was John Lennon's song "Imagine" other than an attack on organized patriarchal religions which underpin Elite patriotism?
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously, Charles Manson was a very
             <strong>
              unlikely
             </strong>
             "hippie" and he had spent most of his life in prisons
which made Manson very vulnerable to being used as a patsy.  As many others like him have been used.
Manson was also very well financed as the entire campaign was and where the cover up still continues on today in an effort to create FEAR in the mind of Americans as a basis for mind control by our CIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Helter Skelter" is still very important to Elites/MIC as they cannot afford to have another Youth Movement rise again.
            </p>
            <p>
             Especially with so many of the "false flag" operations have been revealed and examined -- and where they continue to be revealed and examined.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the original betrayal, look to the US Constitution where the Founders actually created an Elite patriarchy while proclaiming "all are equal" -- they endowed them with land grants and gave them immense influence over the people's government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our Founders saved and supported the system of Slavery for Elites which guaranteed the Civil War and further benefitted Elites by splitting the nation into two camps of hatred which continue to echo today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our Founders also committed genocide versus the native peoples here - 112 million of them -- by the most vile and brutal violence since the Inquisition set new precedents of violence -- and our corrupt government continues to war on native Americans still surviving here today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mae Brussel is also brilliant on having seen through the deaths of so many musicians and it's worth a review.

            Assange, as we all might have suspected by now, is a wholly controlled mk operative. I know that might sound naive' in the sense that there is evidence to support his involvement with the Australian/American cult The Family and that it is very apparent. However, to what faction, if any, is he controlled by and who does he work for is an enigma, that is, also, if anyone can even identify that there really are 'factions' at all, and not just a bunch of bastards all vying for control at different times and with different methods.
           </p>
           <p>
            I happen to believe the latter and if there are any good guys left they have been (officially) castrated of any power, subjugated and ineffective.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that in mind, and I hope some representative of wikileaks is reading and can convey to mr. assange while he's cozying up to his silicon love doll and spy Pammy, that I still believe you and your WikiLeaks organization
            <strong>

            on the American people.

           <p>
            Yes, thanks. You gave us a nice trail of breadcrumbs that got leaner as it progressed and now the pack of pigeons that, for what they thought was dutiful citizenship, have followed the trail down to the near end AND WHERE ARE YOU?
           </p>
           <p>
            You are a poor representation of freedom for your lack of follow-up.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's been approximately 10 months since you started the Pizzagate saga and still, between your death threats and soires with washed up baywatch 'babes' (what made you think you could ever 'measure up' to herpetown tommy lee anyway?) You do know that she most likely has top secret intelligence clearance like the laurel canyon mk sex kitten programmed marilyn monroe did at lookout mountain laboratory at 8935 wonderland ave right?
           </p>
           <p>
            The inquisitive public that could not sit by and listen to allegations of severe governmental corruption and decay 
that continues to erode every aspect of our daily lives have put themselves at grave risk to try and understand how deep the rabbit hole goes in these political influence rackets, AND WHERE ARE YOU?
           </p>
           <p>
            We have endured countless accusations of fake news and lunacy and blame. We have been told time and time  again through mainstream articles and primetime newscasts that pizzagate started out of a 4chan or reddit discussion and never the plain truth that it was started, BY YOU, WIKILEAKS...
           </p>
           <p>
            ...AND WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? Farting around with celebrities and playing james fucking bond. Fleming was a known pederast btw the bond movies are a farce, all the female leads should really be heb teen 'rent boys' stealing secrets from drug and alcohol addled MP's and other intelligent agencies).
           </p>
           <p>
            No Op Ed's detailing the links and giving direction to the implications.
           </p>
           <p>
            No clarification or explanation or even speculation.
           </p>
           <p>
            And you just leave the American people hanging. If Alefantis had ANY right for being mad that someone put him, his customers,  and his business in jeopardy it should be AT YOU, WIKILEAKS, and James seems to have enough intelligence to  have known that, but isn't it odd that he never mentioned wikileaks 'irresponsibility' in almost killing him and his customers by spreading such 'disinfo'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assange is part of the reveal, 'revelation of the method ', just giving a glimpse of the festering evil under the veil to help ease the buffer of truth that is going to wake those, without all the facts, into a world of confusion, anger and anarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             I believe you owe a bigger responsibility to the American people than obviously what you think you owe to us, and you need to be called out on it.

             Assange is Australian so what do you reckon his responsibility to the American people is?  Regardless of who is backing Assange, we have been given an eye-opening look at what goes on behind the scenes.  He owes us absolutely nothing.  This information appears to have been revealed to us at great personal risk by the WikiLeaks staff.  What we do with it is up to us.  Assange is under no obligation to hold our hands as we react to it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Philosophically, we are all part of the problem and part of the reveal.  Humanity is coming to terms with the horror that has been perpetuated why we stand by, slack-jawed and dumbfounded, refusing to take responsibility for creating a future and merely consuming the slop that our handlers serve up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Saying Assange has further responsiblity to us is just more of the same refusal to take responsibility that got us here.

               Are you calling my remarks pandering gibberish?  I think waiting with hat in hand for a crumb from someone you consider an intelligence asset is more toward the gibberish line.   If we continually look for a messiah, we will continue to be disappointed.  Then we construct great conspiracies (which may be true) to illustrate how it was a plot to lead us astray, when it is we who have let ourselves down.  All I am advocating is quit depending on others, quit looking to saviors and get on with it.
If I am pandering to anyone it is the DIY anarchist who thinks government is a confection of psychopaths.

              As Assange explains, this is about global action versus local action, and I agree in large part.
Until the entire global population unites as LABOR which we all are, we aren't going to get an anywhere.
We do not need the government's or a corporation's permission to unite as labor and follow our own agenda in battling Elitism, Organized patriarchal religion, nor Capitalist exploitation of nature and humans.
To truly understand those evils is to understand the need to mobilize and unite in movements.
             </p>
             <p>
              Where this thread is a reminder to always be cautious in regard where we put our trust -- especially 1000% of it - then it is positive.  Where it is an effort to undermine WikiLeaks by attacking Assange, it is a negative.

             Well said.I want to trust Assange with all my heart but this makes sense in light of all that has come to pass. How do we know the answer to the proverbial "who benefits" question. Interesting that you mention the tie in of celebrities to families high up in the military. When i first read about laurel Canyon quite a ways back--someone on educate-yourself had done a series---it was still kind of a blip on the publics' radar and  not much else. there is a lot more evidence of the connection among Hollywood, government, and media now more than ever and STILL----crickets.

              Presume that you are referring to the Sharon Tate "murders" as a military operation by government organized to destroy the Youth Revolution standing against capitalist wars and MIC?
             </p>
             <p>
              Mae Brussel's articles and radio programs (on YouTube) are brilliant at uncovering these operations.

                There is a lot of it at YouTube ... that is her radio programs.
And there is of course a list of her articles at her website.

                  I'd say from what I have read and listened to that she is still far ahead of us in her investigations.
When you listen to her reports often there is something you aren't familiar with even today.
Brussel's ability to see through the fakery was amazing and see it all from the highest perspective.

               i'm still wondering why the fuck charlie manson was interviewed on australian 60 minutes when i was 16. its like the cia was trying to promote him as somebody to be admired. lots of good close ups of those crazy eyes too. those were my stoner days and it stuck in my mind.

                If you've noticed, there's some TV programming which is kind of about famous murderers.
There's also talk about doing a movie on the Sharon Tate "murders."

               <p>
                Much of it is about creating FEAR in the public mind and we are seeing one after another
fake event to produce that fear.  When they run out of events, they like to bring back the old
ones to frighten us again.
               </p>
               <p>
                But those who have been investigating things like the Sharon Tate event are also
catching up with the truth about them.

                Some suggest that he isn't really even in jail -- just comes back for the parole hearings
and interviews.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wish Mae Brussel was still with us -- she predicted the use of "events" decades ago.

                And it was intended to attack the Youth Movement which was a threat to Elites/Capitalists and
their exploitation of Nature and humans.
