<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2753825">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2753825</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dean Corll:</strong> \'The Candy Man\' or \'The Pied Piper\', Corll raped and murdered at least 28 boys and young men in Houston between the years 1970-1973.  He was aided and abetted in his crimes by one Elmer Wayne Henley whom Corll first lured into his orbit with the promise that he could fence anything Henley brought him, including stolen goods, if Henley ever needed money.  Later, he told Henley that he was part of an organisation which sold boys to a sex slavery ring which operated out of Dallas (he also made this claim earlier to David Brooks, a 12 year old boy whom he paid in exchange for sexually assaulting the boy.  Young Brooks also told police that Corll claimed that his earliest murder victims were buried in California) and that he would pay Henley $200 dollars for every boy Henley brought him.  Corll would eventually be killed in turn by Henley in 1973 after he had murdered a number of Henley\'s friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that time, a paedophile by the name of John D. Norman, based in Dallas, was running the Odyssey Foundation, a homosexual paedophile ring with a reported 50,000 members nationwide who paid subscriptions to procure young boys for sex.  They would receive nude photographs of the boys, along with personal details.  Police found material from the Odyssey Foundation in Corll\'s home, so it seems all but certain that the Odyssey Foundation was the sex slavery ring which Corll had referred to.  Furthermore, a cache of child pornography was discovered by police during a routine investigation in March 1975.  11 of the boys depicted in the images were identified as being among Corll\'s victims, further substantiating his claims.  The discovery of this material in Houston also led to the arrest of 5 individuals in Santa Clara, California, lending weight to David Brooks\' statements.  No link between Corll and the individuals arrested in Santa Clara was ever established, nor to the murder victims Corll claimed were buried in California since Houston police refused to investigate further, stating the they felt the families of Corll\'s victims, &quot;...had suffered enough&quot;.  Indeed!</p>
<p>There were other indications of police complicity in protecting the Odyssey Foundation\'s many members.  Norman was arrested and jailed for his activities in 1973.  Police discovered that he had kept some 30,000 index cards with the names and addresses of the Foundation\'s subscribers, yet that list was &quot;inexplicably&quot; destroyed.  One possible explanation for this clumsiness is that the list contained, as the Chicago Tribune reported in 1977, &quot;Prominent people and a number of federal employees in Washington.&quot;  Norman also served only a few years in jail, after which he moved to Chicago, which brings us to our next serial killer: John Wayne Gacy.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>John Wayne Gacy:</strong> Not long after Norman relocated to Chicago, he was arrested and jailed for raping a 10 year old boy.  Whilst in jail for this offence, he established a new pederast ring dubbed the Delta Project (it has been speculated that the FBI recognised \'boy lover\' symbol may have originated with the Delta Project, as the Greek letter Delta is a triangle).  Norman was allowed to use the Cook County Jail\'s printing facilities to create and distribute the newsletter, <em>Hermes</em> (characters from Greek mythology seems to be a recurring theme among paedo-sodomites, it seems).</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the Killer Clown himself, Gacy allegedly raped and murdered 33 boys and young men and buried them under the floorboards of his home.  Whilst Gacy, a violent, sadistic pederast was undoubtedly responsible for some of the murders, it is highly unlikely that he committed all of the murders attributed to him.  Whilst he confessed to being a mass murderer, he had very little knowledge of the crimes to which he confessed.</p>
<p>For example, he claimed that all of the victims were strangled, but forensics evidence suggested that at least 13 of them had been suffocated.  He provided a map of the locations of the bodies under his house which contained numerous discrepancies.  He was only able to recall details of 5 of the murders; the other 28 he had no memory of at all (this would be consistent with his initial claim that most of the murders took place whilst he was out of town) and he initially claimed that the murders began in 1974, but later stated they began in January 1972.  When arrested, one of the first things Gacy said to police was, &quot;Who else do you have in the station?  There are others involved.&quot;  When asked if these other were directly or indirectly involved, Gacy responded, &quot;Directly.  They participated.&quot;  Asked who these others were, Gacy would only answer, &quot;My associates&quot;.  Indeed, at least 6 other people were known to have keys to Gacy\'s home.</p>
<p>So what manner of associates did John Wayne Gacy have?  He was a very well connected guy.  He served as lighting commissioner and as a Democratic Party Precinct Captain.  He claimed to have been an aide to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and was known to be on friendly terms with Illinois Attorney General William Scott.  He also claimed that local columnist Mike Royko and local TV anchorman Walter Jacobson were good friends of his.  He was an enthusiastic member of the Jaycees who would gain new recruits via hosting parties with pornographic movies and sex orgies.  He claimed to have done work for the Chicago outfit and to have been a cousin of mobster Tony \'Big Tuna\' Accardo.  And of course, he famously had his photo taken with then FLOTUS Rosalynn Carter.  In the photo, Gacy is wearing a Secret Service \'S\' lapel pin, indicating that he held a high level security clearance.  Another hint of his political connections was provided by one of his prosecutors, who observed that, &quot;Two items on (Gacy\'s) Chicago Police reports were blacked out, indicating they were FBI matters.&quot;  He also reportedly lived within a 2 mile radius of Hillary Clinton and John &amp; Tony Podesta.  Small world!</p>
<p>Gacy\'s connection to Norman and the Delta Project is to be found primarily via Philip Pakse, co-founder of the Delta Project and Norman\'s closest accomplice in Chicago.  Paske had worked for Gacy, as pay stubs demonstrate (3 cheques were also issued to Paske from Gacy\'s construction company for unknown services) and whilst in prison, Gacy wrote of Pakse that he was, &quot;...dangerous...pimps girls, boys for sex or movies.&quot;  Another connection is to be found via purported Gacy victim, 14 year old Michael Marino, who went missing in 1976.  Authorities claimed Michael as being among the 33 bodies buried under Gacy\'s floorboards, a claim his mother Sherry had always been suspicious of.  Sure enough, DNA testing confirmed that the body in her son\'s grave was not that of her son.  Michael was last seen alive a few blocks from where Norman was living in Chicago at the time.</p>
<p>As in Texas, Norman kept index cards (at least 5,000) with the names and addresses of the Delta Project\'s membership, as well as the boys Norman supplied to them. As in Texas, The Homewood Police Department (Homewood is a suburb of Chicago) seem to have &quot;lost&quot; the index cards.  The reason, I think, is obvious.  Both Corll and Gacy were procurers of young boys for Norman\'s nationwide pederast rings which most likely contained high ranking politicians, businessmen and senior police officers (celebrities and clergy too, probably).  They also appeared to have disposed of those for whom the ring had no further use, perhaps troublesome witnesses also.</p>

            Simply outstanding topic to highlight, Podge, as these cases NEVER receive the attention they deserve.
           </p>
           <p>
            The commutation by GW Bush of mass murderer Henry Lee Lucas certainly ranks amongst  the more curious and egregious of these types of affairs.
Lucas was the only murderer shown this treatment from the notoriously hard nosed Texas governor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Likewise, the arrest in 1983 of Brooklyn DA Eugene Gold for assaulting a 10 year old may directly tie in with the handling of the serial killer Son of Sam a few years earlier.
Berkowitz'  trial was moved to Brooklyn when the far larger number of slayings took place in the Bronx.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that numerous witnesses emphatically, consistently  identified multiple killers throughout the months'  long spree prompted widespread suspicion concerning a "Lone Killer" being quickly railroaded through a sham - read, NO substantive investigation - trial under the auspices of pedophile Gold.
           </p>
           <p>
            The subsequent fate of Sam Carr's kids (Sam being the source for the "Son of Sam" labellling), should also raise more than a few eyebrows.
           </p>

            Excellent work.

             I'm so glad someone brought up the Son of Sam issue.  Maury Terry's book Ultimate Evil is an excellent resource for understanding the Satanic elements of the cabal.  I know people who grew up in the town where Carr "committed suicide," and it seemed like lots of people understood that it had to do with his involvement in Satanic activity.  It was talked about openly in social circles.  Then there's the matter of the Minot Daily News man who died when his brakes failed during a road trip.  Didn't one of the Carr brothers die under similar circumstances?
