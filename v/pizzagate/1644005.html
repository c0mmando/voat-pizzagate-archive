Recently, Infowars released a video on The Alex Jones Channel on YouTube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS-8ylNdPcU">Commie Mob Annihilated By The Infowar</a> which discusses a mom and pop Pinata store in Austin that was razed by one F&amp;F Real Estate Ventures. This protest was in response to the woman who started her own business on the same plot of land the Pinata store was found, called the Blue Cat Café.</p>
<p>What caught my eye immediately were paintings on the in- and outside of the building depicting sinister looking cats with all-seeing eyes and, of course, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPEKuT0jzz6/?taken-by=thebluecatcafe_austin&amp;hl=en">pizza</a>. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPBMDwPhXl5/?taken-by=thebluecatcafe_austin&amp;hl=en">Here is a cat lovingly embracing a pizza slice</a> as well. And <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKyqAreB1OJ/?taken-by=thebluecatcafe_austin&amp;hl=en">here is a cat making out with a pizza slice</a>.</p>
<p>I have not delved much into this place just yet, but when I see pictures like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNw9yxoBwgB/?taken-by=thebluecatcafe_austin&amp;hl=en">this</a> I begin to worry. </p>
<p>The point of this cat café is to have a brick and mortar business for adopting out cats and allowing people to come inside and pet cats or otherwise surround themselves with cats. All food is sold through food trucks outside of the main building. This information I found on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thebluecatcafe/build-austin-a-blue-cat-cafe-with-rescued-and-adop">the kickstarter that funded this cafe\'s opening</a>. Interesting how the only food I see on any of the artwork is pizza.</p>
<p>Also interesting is this bit of information I found on the kickstarter page: &quot;The food is not in the cattery, but prepared in food trucks outside.  We will work to make it so food can be delivered to you inside. To enter the cattery, you\'ll have to <strong>sign off that you will respect the boundaries put in place</strong>. We will have a maximum number of people who can enter at a time.&quot; Sign off on boundaries? What? I\'ve gone to many a pet store in my day just to play with dogs and cats and never had to sign a single piece of paper to do so. </p>
<p>I think this is important to take a look at and make sure it either is or is not related to the investigation of Pizzagate. It\'s entirely possible this place is not related, but I\'d like to make sure of that. Below I am going to list a few links of interest.</p>

            It's unclear why this was of such interest to communists---there is plenty in this world those people could protest. It would have been interesting to get a friendly interview with somebody like the march organizer to find out if they were really more concerned about something creepier.

            First - Blue cat cafe has now taken their website down.  It is still listed on Google maps and Facebook but website is "parked" which means they just took it down - 99.9% sure it is because of this post.  That shows the impact of pizzagate investigation BUT...
As a 30-year Austin resident, I am compelled to say there is nothing here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Austin is full of murals on businesses - all of which are and always were weird but since the arrival of the hipsters...have gotten even weirder.  The Austin motto is "Keep Austin Weird" - which was originally painted on the side of a house to be seen from one of two major highways - as a protest against "Johnny Dallas" or new developers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason Alex covered it is because he is from Austin and he was ranting against a developer who illegally demolished a mexican trinket store - right in a mexican neighborhood - raising the ire of local anti-gentrification groups who are rabidly concerned about Johnny Dallas and the razing of East Austin which was largely black and hispanic but has been slowly taken over by McMansions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Originally, F&amp;F had a new renter to put there - it was going to be a parking lot for an events center.  Paid parking lot - which would make big money during SXSW, Rot Rally and other events.  Once the negative news hit - the events guys said...um, no - we arent renting there.  then F&amp;F offered it up as a "food truck" locale - and the food truck organization said....um, no.  Food truck group is same kind of anti-development people so no way they would take it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure how the cat people developed their business idea - but just like a lot of stuff, it is simply weird.  Cats are a big SJW issue...Humane society is huge and city shelter is often in news because they recently had to build a new one.  There are several "free" feral cat programs and low-cost spay/neuter groups which operate out of trucks.  Seriously obsessed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the founders of Blue Cat Cafe are SJW volunteers for city shelter - and were originally going to "invite" vegan food trucks to come park there....but the food trucks didn't come.  Partly because of the negative publicity but also because they only wanted Vegan food.  (this is how Austin goes off the rails)
           </p>
           <p>
            Inside of business is cat free-for-all.  Since the business is called a "cafe", they had to get their own food.  Food trucks are cheap to get into and really hip....but, you can't do much more than one kind of food.  In this case, they have a coffee shop food truck with VEGAN pastries and over-priced vegan sandwiches - mushrooms, shredded carrot patties, lots of sprouts and other vegan bullshit.  No pizza because....Vegan.  No meat, milk, eggs.....certainly glutein free. UGH.
The art is just that.  Not evil - just stupid and weird and whatever SJW nutjob painted it didn't get the whole "VEGAN" message so put pizza - which would normally be one type of food offered at a food truck location....but not.
           </p>
           <p>
            French and Fisher are jackass rich-dude hipsters, techies...from New York.  Oddly, their regular business is an image management company.  Jordan French got booted by partner Darius Fisher after the pinata store debacle.

            Point is....yes, Cats making out with Pizza is freakizoid weird but....Austin.  The neighborhood is major ethnic area and not "suitable" for child-trafficking or lots of kids.  Part of their "boundaries" include not having a bunch of kids there harassing the cats.  They can't say that but can say kids must be supervised, cats probably will bite and scratch, we care more about the cats than children....etc.  AND the neighborhood isn't really considered "safe".  Part of the F&amp;F excuse for booting the pinata family was "they are selling drugs"...they weren't - more like tons of Nitrous and curandera/mexican voodoo shit.

            One of their pics on Instagram includes a cat with the announcement of adoption days. The cat is featured with a heart inside a heart (pedo sign) and a comment that says "diablo (devil) finds a friend." I think you might be onto something. If you need assistance with archive.is, please message me. It took a little bit for me to get the hang of how to post concerns on here. Good work, OP!

            Well, I went through the instagram and finally had to stop there were so many.  I saw many pieces of pizzas either in that same pic as on the store front and also drawn in places plus hearts as well with one double heart that was a drawing.  There was one chicken and then a couple baskets of baby chicks.  I also saw the word Wonderland on a wall that reminded me of Alice in Wonderland which has meaning to pedos, trust me.  Then also the Wonderland Club was a CP global outfit that was raided in St. Charles Mo.  This was a BIG ring.  Global.  Don't know if this means anything, but I guess with one or two nothing, but possibly all together it could mean something.
Yes, the pizza on cats, highly suspicious.  Why would you have the pizza on the cats?  Strange to say the least.

             The only thing i've picked up is there's pizza in the murals and they don't have pizza on the menu. Only  "catdogs" their version of hotdogs.

              For me, the double heart that was drawn or painted, but the baby chicks and Wonderland seemed interesting.  I also was suspicious about the signing for petting the cats.  Is this how they get the names maybe of the children that come in?

            Since the only thing I see here is basically the mural art, I'd say to look into who the artist is. Hipsters have no idea what they're getting themselves into (or so some act like).

            Just a heads up, if you suspect a place of being linked to PG please don't link directly to the webpages eg. Instagram, their website, being that if they are in some way involved they will see where all the traffic is coming from and begin to erase anything suss, please archive the page with archive.is then copy the link to your post.

              No worries. It's easy, all you have to do is copy the webpage link to archive.is click archive and your done, then you just use the link for that instead of the actual webpage
