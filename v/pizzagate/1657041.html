<p>So we have:</p>
<p>Brian was told by Freud, that the Sony CEO Lynton is a &quot;ping pong&quot;-champ.
And Freud\'s preferred location is &quot;Bounce&quot; - What is bounce?
I think it had shown up already a few months ago.</p>
<p>I guess it is this one:

            I think the Podesta brothers might've been traumatized in childhood as well - especially after watching those leaked videos and reading about John's alter - ego Skippy. Their minds might've split as well into many different personalities. There's that video that you mentioned and then there's another one when "he" (if that indeed is JP) acts like a 6 year old. It's not that I have much sympathy for those monsters and what they do - but it does help in understanding WHY they do this, and that it's CIA that probably should take the blame as well for the results of their experiments.

            Brian Grazer! One of the biggest producers in Hollywood and based on this email he sent he is a charter member of the showbiz pedophile network! This is HUGE so I ask every person reading this  to send an email to Grazer at that imagine-entertainment address with a link to this page your subject should be "Hey Brian you Pedophile" if he gets enough emails from strangers he will start to freak out!

              Good point, which I missed. However, I went back and found it is an email account (from the looks of it) set up by Stratfor, exclusively (by the looks of it) for Stratfor in house usage:

              BTW - I believe the freud email in the Sony leaks is just a dead end - the coincidenses are odd (ping pong/pizza referred to in the same email). However, the date of the email matches the opening of Bounce and there are numerous photos of Matthew Freud at the opening of Bounce playing ping pong so I think it is not a lead, but search other aspects of this - don't come at it head on...

               The above email is an authentic Wikileaks email connecting ping pong, Freud and high level Hollywood using illogical language, but you claim it was a dead end, while you promote complete emails sent TO Stratfor as being emails coming FROM Stratfor...
Whoever pays you, should demand to get his money returned.

            Why do you keep associating pizzagate with Trump? Many of us didn't even vote for him. Pizzagate is non partisan. Anyway, why even post that here? We already know the truth, why not shill somewhere the idiot sheep can hear you?

             Knowing how gullible folks are to trends these days, an intense social media campaign and some well produced events can vault a business into the stratosphere.  The marketing on some of these places look straight up Madison Avenue.

            Gotta be honest... BOUNCE looks like fun and I can see how many people unaware of PG could stumble into there for the atmosphere and ping pong ( real ping pong ) and cocktails.  The food doesn't look bad, either.

              oh... I totally agree...  The email and the 3 people implicated are shady as F .  I'm just saying, not everybody who goes there is a pedo.  What they are is a huge lobby to say positive things about this place.  I'm sure most customers have no idea what goes down on the sly there.

            WOW! I was literally reading about this guy's dad, Clement Freud before I saw this post!! I can fill in some blanks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clement Freud was the grandson of Sigmund Freud the "great" child psychologist, who came up with the Oedipus complex
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex">
             https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Clement Freud died in 2009. After he died several woman came out, and said he sexual abused them then they were children.

             I found this but it may not be related at all but it might be worth looking into from other angles.  At the end of the article it says the abuse at this school is likely far more worse and widespread than we know

            Going to SnapChat...   Remember who else just went to work for Snapchat:  Jennifer Stout.   She is one of the infamous people called out by the FBI as the 7th floor Shadow Government that sorted through Hillary's email, cleansing it for the FOIA requests.

             Business Insider Article
            </a>
            She worked for Joe Biden in the late 90's.
            <br/>
            Also, remember what Snapchat is used for:   Teens to send nude pics to each other.    Wouldn't the CIA love to collect those!

              As someone already mentioned: we must be careful, this is pure speculation. The photo was uploaded around Halloween. Maybe it's just some kind of gag for a Halloween-party. To me the redlooks a bit bright compared to normal blood-plasma.
             </p>
             <p>
              But it's absolutely worth mentioning and keeping in mind!

            Wait, so Bounce, which is connected with Alefantis as I seem to recall, is owned by Matthew Freud? (Is it Matthew Freud or one of the other ones?) That would seem to make the Podesta-Clement Freud connection more plausible.

            Please note, the post with the blood IVs was made around Halloween. And the labels on them are identical and have no handwriting in pertinent areas. Thus, I think these are props and not actual blood "transfusions" nor contain real blood.

            Otherwise, good find! We know Pedowood and pedo politicians like to mingle, so looks pretty PG related to me.

             Not only do I think it's real,  in the original spiritcooking video people always described the object in the corner she was throwing blood on as a doll or an effigy.  I have always believed that it was real.  Proportions wrong?   Slightly bigger older baby body with a smaller younger baby's head.  There is a reason we see artwork of people holding severed heads.

             Yes.  It's probably fake blood. But good find OP.  These weirdos are up to no good with real blood too.  There's no doubt in my mind that they are harming children in more ways than one.  :(

              This is a very busy london social club/location, it makes sense they might sell a novelty cocktail on haloween, there hasnt been any solid links to this aside from some high up people meeting there, but I hope we do find if there is something nefarious going on here..

               Their Satanic religion is about drawing everyone in .. hiding in plain site.   If they do it even secretly they are gleeful because they are pulling a fast one by sharing the guilt since everyone is involved.

              <p>
               I absolutely believe pizza places use human meat and some of the semen urine mixture in their cheese.  Why wouldn't they? ? If we were sick fuck Satanists we would. These people are not a little evil they are totally evil. Plus they have a ton of bodies to get rid of.
              </p>
              <p>
               All pizza places?  I don't know.  They say this stuff is literally happening everywhere... Little towns and big.

               The Netflix people seem to be bad, but yeah house of Cards is based on the clintons. Although the Clinton's make the underwood seem like freaking saints.

             This is the black - pill realisation . Once you are in a position of influence, power and have access to seemingly unlimited money and resources as the CEOs and top tier players of these corporations have, you stop living in the same world as the rest of us. Their world revolves around evil and a different energy. The people below them become playthings and we are just pawns. They get off on our suffering because their positions of power represent their ability to exert complete control over human beings. This is translated into satanism which is the most narcissistic and self absorbed ideology on the planet. It's all about them. Enslaving , raping, torturing and murdering human beings is just the next step beyond financial freedom and societal influence. Where else do you go once you have all the money, possessions and time in the world?

             Ping pong is such a strange thing to focus on, for a business, or almost any entity. If you were serious about it, like a sport, you would call it "Table Tennis". A lot of places and people have ping pong tables, they aren't uncommon, so I do not whatsoever understand why they would ever be a point of focus for a business. I get that it is the gimmick of CPP in DC, but how far and wide can the ping pong gimmick truly go?

             Like many other things in the pedophile universe, it is a part of a large body of code words, signals, and little nods to a true belief system.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is what is required to be a pedophile, a belief system. It is so incomprehensible for us to imagine what people do with children, in sexual and violent ways. I've come to interpret it as an absolutely fanatic cult, with the most morally reprehensible practices, rituals, power systems, ever.
            </p>
            <p>
             The individuals who download this stuff over TOR, sitting at home alone, make up the base of the pyramid. They are probably the largest group and maybe even don't even understand their role in the grand scheme of things. They think every pedo is a loner in the basement hiding out, like them. What they may or may not fail to understand is that the infrastructure is massive. The crimes, somehow, unbelievably, more and more heinous the further up the power pyramid you go. They are unknowingly slaves in the empire, who, if discovered by higher ups, will live their lives with their pedo behavior over their heads. Slavery.
            </p>
            <p>
             And thus, like any empire the world has seen, this empire refuses to go on without leaving it's mark. Not only on the lives of millions of poor poor honest and innocent souls, but the physical marks they scatter around the world. Like the Masonic pillar, pyramids of egypt, satanic symbology throughout the world, they refuse to keep their symbology and belief system to themselves. It serves as a show of force and power, and it signifies to other believers that "You are safe here. You are one of us."

               You're right, and when I made the distinction I had in mind the owners of establishments. Or, the leaders of groups who communicate through symbols and hidden meanings - rather than children.

            Matthew Freud is the one who said Clement was in UK at the time Madeline disappeared. Well, Freud was definitely in Portugal right after since he befriended the McCanns. One is a TV presenter whatever that means, so there is a connection to the entertainment business.

            Nice find! If it's Matthew Freud, that's highly suspect. Freud Communications is like another CTR as far as I'm aware. They're basically paid shills, and have been caught editing Wikipedia pages. They are deeply intertwined with big players of media, and Clement Freud refers to the media as "our media" indicating that he had strong influence there too. That is highly suspect and I'm glad you managed to make the Bounce Ping Pong connection stronger. People who visited Bounce have also visited Comet.

            There are many stories about bad people taking over any kind of anti-trafficking organizations and essentially making them useless/pro-trafficking. It also seems like many of the same groups of people flock to major corporations and take them over. It seems like I've read about multiple people going to SNAP recently. Sheryl Sandberg was COO of Google and Facebook..... She also is involved in shady charities. I wish she would be looked into more.

            Lucian Freud died in 2011 and Clement Freud died in 2009. So neither could be the Freud referenced in this email.

             This is damning.  Chicken lover, blood drinks, butterflies, pic of  Obama hugging Biden (why them aside from millions of others) plus a favorite of Freud.  I searched the Sony emails and it had over 200 emails containing the word pizza and over 200 for chicken.  This is an entertainment company.  Yeah and some of the pizza emails were about a contest to win a spot on a Hillary Pizza Bus Party?  OOMPH!  This screams GREAT FIND.  THANKS OP.

              The Hillary Pizza Bus Party? Sounds like the stuff nightmares are made of! Combined with all the other stuff you found, simply vile.

               HELP!  I NEED someone to post this. Found pic of BILL &amp; HILLARY playing PING PONG  on the Boom Ping Pong BLOG site.  Here is the KIcker!  The pic was taken on the same day as Monica bought the Blue Dress.  This is all stated on their Blog.  It is taken in a room that looks like it is in the basement.  I wonder if it is in the WH or in their other home.  Maybe the PIng Pong stuff started a long time ago.  After all we just found out about it's connection recently.  Please someone take a look at it and post or let me know what you think.  OMG.

             Not everyone eating at these pizza places or playing ping pong at these ping pong joints are pedos.  Most are likely clueless and just enjoying pizza and ping pong.
            </p>
            <p>
             The parties hosted at comet ping pong in the boom boom room with the sick bands like majestic ape and that freak show Sasha lord don't seem innocent, however.
            </p>
            <p>
             But my point  is that not everyone that ate at a mafia restaurant knew that it was a front  for the Mafia.  Same with these trafficking places

               woman painted into a butterfly - butterflies are both used by the pedos and in MK ultra programming.

                  read my comments above - he's the 'artis' that created that graffiti with Monarch / Mk ultra/ pedo symbology so I jumped into his account to check more of his work and it kinda looks suspicious. It resembles the account of that american girl who also is supposedly 'an artist' - they both travel around the world a lot and work for different brands yet their works are very plain and tbh not good at all - but they to contain the symbols we're looking for (hot dogs in this case and the pyramid with an all seeing eye)

              Blood transfusions! So ping pong has a direct connection to parabiosis...
             </p>
             <p>
              So this is getting another meaning:

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Since its launch in 2012, the Bounce concept has been widely regarded by the industry as a game-changer in social entertainment venues, which combines three elements of hospitality: bar, restaurant and entertainment activity - all set against award-winning design and the highest standard of fit out. Bounce is the world’s leading concept to offer this immersive experience, taking the humble Ping Pong table from the back corner of a bar to become the main offering of the venue, while creating an intricately considered and currently unrivalled leisure experience.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bounce Farringdon, the flagship venue quickly established itself as one of London’s most iconic and most talked about venues and has hosted games for Elle Macpherson, Gwyneth Paltrow &amp; Kevin Spacey to name but a few.

            Sorry for the sensationalist headline. I hate them myselfes.

            Awesome. Yes, I ran across BOUNCE  a few weeks ago and was going to post about it. Highly suspicious place that deserves further investigation.

             I've been to Bounce in London, (There's one in Shoreditch, one in Farringdon, that I went to). It's a ping-pong bar. UV Lights, Top 40 Hits. ~$12 a Vodka Coke. Honestly can't say it was all that suspicious. Then again, after Pizzagate, a late night, underground, ping pong bar, who knows.

              I believe what you say. I also believe that people who frequent CP see nothing wrong and probably get a slice of pizza and go home. If there is an underbelly to establishments like these, the question is what is it and what do people do to gain access to it. Like CP's encrypted area, were all customers invited there? If so, who was invited? Who knew the password and how to log in? Who got to see and download those encrypted files? And, more importantly, what was going on? That's the central issue of pizzagate.

             This may be totally irrelevant and pointless, or it may end up being of relevance - I guess nobody knows until it's at least looked at thoroughly...
            </p>
            <p>
             And, though the London location of Bounce Ping Pong is the topic's focus - they also own a Bounce Ping Pong location in Chicago. And, since I live in Chicago, I'd be willing to at least go check the place out if anyone thinks is worth checking?
            </p>
            <p>
             As much as I feel it is likely irrelevant - there is still the fact of the handful of random PizzaGate things related to Chicago (Obama flying in $65K worth of "Hotdogs" and "Pizza" from Chicago, the fact that the Podestas are from Chicago, etc.) that give it a slim chance of ending up to be of some significance?

              As long as you're not harassing anyone and are a customer, why not? Depending on how comfortable you feel, I might through a code word or two around, or wear one of those color-coded handkerchiefs. See if someone does approach you that's supposed to. But if you're not good at schmoozing, stay low and don't harass anyone.

              Someone posted something about Susan Sarandon being a owner or something at Spin in a post I did about it. I posted a comment earlier on Reddit for an article about how Susan must be powerful if she can be the reason Hillary lost...I jokingly said maybe they are both high priestesses and Susan kicked Hillary's ass.....

               Susan S has been involved in weird Ping Pong clubs for years now. Naked Ping Pong was the big one.
              </p>
              <p>
               But she was off-message during the election, and I think a Bernie Bro then possibly even Pro-Trump. Definitely didn't like Hillary at all. So maybe she's more of a "useful idiot" for the Pedo Ping Pong brigade. A well meaning extrovert "artistic personality" who thinks it's all just a harmless laff. "Creative" people getting together and being eccentric and "fun". But she's never really around to witness the creepy stuff. Only there for the big PR events, between jobs out of town for months on end.
              </p>
              <p>
               But there comes a point where they need to wake the fuck up and stop painting everything with this "oh, he's just an artist being creative and out there" brush, which only serves to make themselves feel better and sleep at night if they do harbor suspicions on any level. Many of them would allow behavior from outsiders "Oh, he's European. They're different! They're less uptight!" which they wouldn't allow from someone originating from their own culture. This makes them prime targets to be conned into being the public face of these businesses, and sort of social "beards" for activities that regular people would otherwise cock their head at. "Oh, Susan Sarandon is a co-owner? Well, she's a bit weird. But she doesn't seem like a predator, so I guess this creepy ping pong shit is okay."
              </p>
              <p>
               Or she's a total mental case and knows exactly what's going on. But the Hillary antagonism was really interesting. She was one of a very small number of Hollywood and NYC luminati breaking from the narrative.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now's the time for her to come out against this shit if she's on the level. No one would blame her for being taken for a ride or allowing herself to be blinded to obvious creepy activities. But she has to step forward on her own and voice her concerns, rather than be caught out after the dam wall breaks on PG.

                I've been to her ping pong place when it first opened in nyc. I hope she isn't a part of all this, I freaking love her in Bull Durham.

                 They are all involved. .. directly enabling or covering it up.  No one is allowed to become rich famous or successful in media film govt sports music comedy etc unless they chose incrementally to sell their souls.

                She was a Bernie bro all the way but was also staunch anti-Hillary. I don't think she ever said who she ended up voting for or if she just didn't vote in the general.
               </p>
               <p>
                Edit: maybe she invested in the Spin place and then realized what was going on and is trying to stop it...who knows anymore.

                 She backed Jill Stein, and the media lost their shit over it - she really doesn't like Hillary, which makes me like her even more. I'm going with oblivious genuine ping pong fan on this
