            It is apparent that Allen W. Achilles and James Achilles from Kidzworld are not associated with James Alefantis.
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT Kidzworld has two links to the clinton foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any reasonable person, after looking through only a few pages of kidzworld could surmise that it is not a "safe place" for kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet - CommonSenseMedia wrote a glowing recommendation of the place:
            <a href="http://archive.is/efnhd">
             http://archive.is/efnhd
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            and Chelsea Clinton sits on the Advisory Board for CommonSenseMedia:
            <a href="http://archive.is/b93fP">
             http://archive.is/b93fP
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            not a strong connection - but at best, CSM is not paying attention to the sites it recommends, and should be held liable for false information, which would hold chelsea liable.  at worst, they are shilling and intentionally leading traffic there, making chelsea complicit.  either way, it's a link.
           </p>
           <p>
            edit:  i did some research on the reviewer.  she writes lots of reviews.  looooots.  no other job.  her husband used to work for deloitte, which is a company associated with the CF.  super weak connection, and i won't post names or addresses, but maybe it's something.
           </p>
           <p>
            the weaker connection is outlined in my post linked below - a Fax number used in the kidzworld URL registration is associated with an energy company registered in delaware at the same address as several clinton companies...but that's just a registering agent/shell company haven, so it's not definitive by any stretch.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that this operation is worth investigating on its own, and brought into the general Clinton investigation umbrella, but it is not quite possible to leap from this to PG, yet, or maybe ever.

            To put your mind at rest, there does seem to be an actual Allen Achilles in Vancouver, BC.

            There have been several threads about this site, and there's no evidence that it's James Alefantis. Only evidence that it's someone else. Still a very sketchy site though and probably a haven for predators.

            Vancouver is the home of Frank Giustra, Director of the Clinton Foundation and behind Elphida Home in Greece with the pedo logo etc + the 'Boys Club Network' in Canada. There are reasonable chance Alefantis works north of the border after all he's worked south in Haiti. Common denominator/connector again would be the Clintons.

            Can you find a picture of this president Allen W. Achilles? I was not able to find one picture of him. On all of his social profiles there is never a picture!? edit: search still going on, just one pixelated foto of him on a surfboard
           </p>
           <p>
            edit2: is this him`?

           </p>
           <p>
            edit3: wasnt able to find any other picture of the president of the biggest kids site in the world...
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice that he Mr.Achilles, according to info from their website
            <a href="http://kidz-world.wikia.com/wiki/Allen_Achilles">
             http://kidz-world.wikia.com/wiki/Allen_Achilles
            </a>
            earlier in his life was a boy scout leader, teens coach etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also notice that they say its the largest privately owned kids website in the world.

             It appears to be a dead end as far as connecting it to Alefantis:

            </p>
            <p>
             It does still look like a very dodgy site and at least something that should be flagged and investigated at some point.

            "PARENTS BEWARE!
Within 3 hours of being on that website for the first time, my daughter was contacted by at least 3 adults who asked for photos of her legs in stockings, a miniskirt, etc. The website is a haven for predators and should be shut down."
           </p>

            "Nope, never ever again
I let my 9 year old cousin try out this site 6 months ago. I set the privacy settings and everything. I let her chat, make friends, and told her if you see someone mean or inappropriate, report them or tell me. She agreed. A week or two later, I decided to be a bad cousin and look at her account. (I let her post 1 picture of herself which was a HUGE mistake.....) I saw all these comments on her profile saying "hey cutie" "wanna be my gf?" "lets have sex, meet at McDonalds?" I deleted all of these people, except for those she knew. Then I went on chat. Oh the chat! Language, sex talk, dating (these kids had "online" partners!), suicidal talk, and even more! I was starting to think these people LIED about their ages. A social network for kids 9-18? That's not safe at all. I wouldn't let my sisters, cousins, or future kids ever talk with someone online who's 17! Especially someone they do not know. If you are thinking of choosing Kidzworld, I highly recommend you do NOT.

            "Definitely NOT for Kids
This site is not good for socializing with other kids. It claims heavy moderation in the chat, etc...but there is a heavy lack of moderation. First, you do not need to verify your email address to participate in socializing. Kids begin their catfish style social life (pretending they are someone else) with a heavy access on the emo meter. Who knows what kind of creepy predators could be hanging out there. When my daughter was on there chatting with several other so called friends, who gave each other passwords, names, real ID's and pics. They then began skyping each other, using other non-moderated chat rooms, etc. There were a bunch of them on there, threatening to commit suicide or cut themselves if they didn't have her as a friend. It is apparently a hangout for very lonely kids with emotional problems. I can't even tell you how many comments I read where people were talking about cutting. I got into her account thanks to parental control software and changed her email (was using a bogus one) and her password. I reported several of the cutting, suicidal style comments and messages and requested her account be closed. Nothing happened, there was no reply to my emails. Her account was not closed and I found no way to close it. I send an email to their CEO - what a joke. I told him I was a parent and concerned about the lack of moderation, how the kids were talking to each other, etc... He emailed me back and all it said was "shame on you". Very very bad site for kids. What kind of response is that from a CEO. Stay away from Kidzworld!"
