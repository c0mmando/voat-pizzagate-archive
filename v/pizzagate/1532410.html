            best I can tell,Noble isn't ADVOCATING anything that's depicted in her art... which Marina, in fact, IS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Marina is DIRECTLY connected to the Pederasts Brothers, via email... Noble, ISN'T.
           </p>
           <p>
            Marina is PERSONAL FRIENDS, on the emails lists of, John and Tony and Alefantis... Kim Noble, ISN'T.
           </p>
           <p>
            Couldn't be clearer... Abramovic? likely, co-conspirator. 
Kim Noble? Not.

             HTH has the only upvoats on the thread you're saying he was schooled on. Seems sorta suspicious to me that you feel this way, wouldn't a schooling have more upvotes to the teachers than the students?

             So what you're saying is if there is initially no proof of a persons claims that you should not investigate. The fact is Cathy does have a lot of facts that fit other claims of the same thing. Sure there is no smoking gun here, however to ignore it would be very short sighted. The fact is her claims are exactly what this investigation are about and they predate it, that in it self adds a bit of credibility to her story. But ignoring it and calling it fake without proof is even more dangerous than accepting that she makes the claim and that it could be real.

               Ted L. Gunderson ex FBI Senior Special Agent in Charge LA was forced into early retirement for performing satanic ceremonies in his FBI offices 1979. He has publicly stated he is the only ex-FBI agent to be kicked out of the FBI retired agent’s alumni, this is why. FURTHER: Ted Gunderson worked in his early year of the FBI as a Cointelpro agent.

               In 1998 Ted L. Gunderson married the widow of Anton Lavey, Diana Rivalry, the founder of the Church of Satan in America, she kicked him out after 2-weeks because he could not perform in bed. The marriage was annulled in 2000 Las Vegas, Nevada. Why would Ted Gunderson marry a known satanic witch? Remember he claims to be an expert on Satanism, and out to save and rescue the CHILDREN in America from Satanists.

               In Feb 2000 Ted Gunderson was caught stealing from the trust of Mary Schiebe of Las Vegas, Nevada. (Public administrators records) To keep from going to jail for stealing $ 150,000.00, Ted Gunderson agreed to a plea bargain to allow the repayment to the trust of $ 1,500.00 per month from his early FBI retirement of $ 62,000.00 per year. Ted Gunderson continues to this day telling people he is broke to con--more little old ladies out of their life's savings. It was Ted Gunderson’s associate who keep him out of jail.

               According to 2 Retired Los Angeles Police Department Detectives, that when they were still with LAPD and Ted Gunderson was in charge of the Southern California FBI from 1977-1979, that Gunderson protected the Illegal CIA George Bush Sr. Narcotics for weapons smuggling into southern California. The Yacht was hauling Narcotics in from Costa Rico and transporting weapons out of the docks in Santa Monica, CA, were today Ted L. Gunderson's daughter Laurie Hern lives and Ted Gunderson spends months at a time there.

             The Detectives further state those young Girls from southern California were being kidnapped and put on that same Yacht to be sent to drug smuggler in Costa Rica, to be used as sex slaves. Ted Gunderson protected these kidnappers and drug for weapons smugglers while he was in charge of the LA-FBI. This location in Costa Rica was the same location owned by Carl Lindner-United Fruit-CIA front Co. (The Ohio Connection-The Bush Crime Family See: Stew Webb- Flow Chart

               Ted Gunderson after early forced FBI retirement, began working for George Bush Sr.-CIA-Shadow=Government-full time, dealing drugs and guns with Ollie North and General Singlaub, to Afghan Rebels, to Costa Rica the Iran/Contra affair and many other Illegal CIA drugs and guns operations. Ted Gunderson was partners with Michael Reconishuto (now in jail), Raymond Lavis-NSA, (now hiding out in Canada), and were stealing stinger missiles from the China Lakes Naval Facility in California. There base of operations was the Capison Indiana Reservation in Indio, California. (ABC-Reporter-Danny Casolaro got killed over Inslaw and His book The Octopus, Gunderson admitted to me, he spoke with Danny prior to his death.) They were further involved in espionage involving the Government of Canada by sliding the Inslaw software into the Canadian National Security Computers. (See

               Ted Gunderson was caught in the mid 1980's stealing from the estate of a dead nurse he worked with on the McMartin preschool case, the nurse suddenly developed cancer and was sent to a clinic in Mexico. (She knew Gunderson was there from Kroll Bros &amp; Assoc. NY part of Bush cover up PI‘s. Bush hires them, ex-spooks to go after remaining documents left behind or evidence that needs to be destroyed. Ted Gunderson was an affiliate of Kroll &amp; Assoc.) The Clinic was owned by Ted Gunderson’s Dr. friend who gives laetrile treatments. (Steve McQueen the Actor who died of cancer, was coned out of $50,000.00 by Ted Gunderson and Gunderson’s Dr. friend. At that time Gunderson was conning other people out of $5,000.00 for the same treatments.) Her body never left Mexico, Ted Gunderson began selling off the nurses property and belonging, and robbing her bank accounts. When he tried to sell her house this is when he was caught and did a plea to keep out of jail, with LA DA’s office. (Ted Gunderson is protected from prosecution by this same criminal cartel-The Bush Crime Family) He is allowed to steal from people and not be prosecuted. He gets a cut from his thefts and the rest go to the New World Order-Bush Crime Family's Empire-Anti-Christ.

               Ted L. Gunderson claims he investigates Satanism and Child Kidnapping this is a front to identify those victims of MK=Ultra, to identify and  eliminate those who know too much. Gunderson works with George Pender who ran Operation Brownstone, the Blackmail of Congressman and Senators using children as sex slaves in Washing DC. 1980-1990. (CIA George Pender and CIA Clint Murchison had direct ties to FBI-Homosexual-Hoover. Gunderson brags he was one of the last Hoover-Boy‘s, he further tries to say FBI-Hoover was not a Homosexual, I know people who state they saw Hoover committing these Homosexual Acts.)

            <p>
             Also read chapter 1, Carol interviewed Ted Gunderson before she found out his involvement with Michael Reconishuto and Ray Lavis these CIA Criminal-shadow Government boys, Ted‘s partners in crime. (Note: chapter 1, why was Ted Gunderson’s apartment full of KIDS TOYS? Ted’s kids were grown then. After CIA-Clint Murchison died Ted Gunderson lived in his house for over a year. If you remember Gunderson had a radio program on WWCR-Shortwave, and if you remember he stated he was doing his program from Dallas, Texas. This was his, at the time secret Dallas location. Anna May Newman who was a house-maid to CIA Clint Murchison now lives with Ted Gunderson in Las Vegas, and pays his rent out of her Social Security. She loaned Ted Gunderson her $ 68,000.00 retirement. Gunderson told her he had a client, (like her has other little old ladies) who was paying him $100,000.00, and that he had breaking news on kidnapped kids and needed the money now. She was foolish enough to give her retirement to him. He then got stuck with her after the estate attorneys kicked them out of the house off Northwest Highway in Dallas.

            <p>
             Patriots in Dallas have told me Gunderson was holding parties there for Gunderson could name take, identify the Patriots in Dallas. Gunderson helped destroy evidence and cover-up the Nebraska-Franklin Savings case. Rene a woman who paid Gunderson $10,000 to help her, suddenly found herself in jail and Gunderson keep her money and never helped her. She came to me in Feb 2001 through a Intel Source and she wanted to go on Radio with me, and tell everyone who Gunderson was, she Died 3 weeks later. The family would not do an autopsy, she left 2 children ages 15 and 17. Their mother is dead because of Gunderson. (Foot note: Do you really think that the Boy’s Town Orphanage was the only Orphanage in the Country that Children were taken on a tour of The White House? NO. NO. NO. I have lots of evidence. Therefore, if you were the CIA-Spin Dr. wouldn’t you limit the liability to just one Orphanage? And bring in the spin Dr.’s to focus the attention there, limit the testimonies, limit the flow of information, send in Ted Gunderson to destroy evidence, to identify victims, so they could be either killed or jailed?)

             <li>
              Ted L. Gunderson admitted to this Federal Whistleblower Stew Webb, that he Broke-up the Black Panther. He stated he sent love letters that turned Panthers on each other that resulted in Murder of one Panther. This makes Ted Gunderson a conspirator in Murder as a FBI agent in 1970. I talked to Bobby Seals the Panther at length about this, I now have copies of those letters. A Senate investigation of Ted Gunderson FBI-Coin-Tel-Pro resulted, for violating these American’s Constitutional Rights. The FBI was sanctioned by the Senate 1971-1972, the Gov. settled with members Seals and others for $3 1/2 Million, because the FBI-Gunderson team tried to frame 3 of them for this murder, they were not involved with. Does this sound like the current FBI- nothing changes with these criminal- FBI-element. Ted L. Gunderson should be in Jail for MURDER.

            As to your insinuation I'm a shill, read my posts.  Why does it devolve to "because you disagree with me = hmmm AGENDA!!!". No, read my posts they are valid, well sourced, and relevant. What I take issue with is precisely that, substance. You have none here but you do have a lot of unwarranted controversy that again, in no way relates at all to PG.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to your evidence, ok, where is this photo? It's online? Ok, where? Link?
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, the photo, so what? How does a scarred vagina prove Dick Cheney raped her or that Hillary Clinton practices witch craft and also raped her? I'll tell you how, it doesn't one bit and is ridiculous.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you suppose perception is irrelevant, then you are here to just masturbate. At some point, someone somewhere needs to make a solid persuasive case.
           </p>
           <p>
            This woman is claiming that Dick Cheney raped her. Let me ask you a question. If you were accused of rape, would you like an opportunity to confront your accuser? Would you benefit from being innocent until proven guilty? Why does this only apply to you and not people you think are bad? I think they're bad too, but proof or shut the fuck up. O'Brien has been in the public sphere for over 20 years, I think longer. WHERE IS THE PROOF.
           </p>
           <p>
            You talk about it. Show me or concede.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, I've said repeatedly I'm sympathetic to her. But you're a fucking idiot if you try to tell me her claims are not wild and unbelievable. They are the textbook definition. I DID NOT SAY THEY WERE UNTRUE. Read carefully. They are by any objective measure wild and unbelievable. You have a confirmation bias and an emotionally invested interest in your belief for some reason. What you don't have WRT O'Brien is any proof. Still waiting.

             Her claims have been proven by the fact that she named by name a lot of very powerful people. And not one single person brought against her a libel suit, even though she published a book, and video and sworn testimony, anyone that is even slightly powerful would have sued the shit out of her for making such false claims. The fact is the people that she made the claims about don't want to go down those roads. She does have a mutilated and tattoed vagina I believe so there is that evidence. And there are a few other people that make the same exact claims. Has she ever described their genitals? Of course it would require their cooperation.

            I'm suggesting that you nor anyone else on the planet can substantiate her sworn testimony with any evidence. I don't need to prove her testimony, she does. As to who is calling her testimony into question, do you honestly believe that someone who has accused Hillary Clinton, Senator Bryd, and Dick Cheney of SRA without the slightest shred of proof or evidence is going to win minds and change hearts?. Unless you have photographic, video, audio, or ANY PROOF WHATSOEVER, this is damaging to the perception that PG is a joke. I'm sympathetic to O'Brien but you're mistaken to cite her as a credible source and you'll be laughed at outside this echo chamber.

            "Reliable sources or it didn't happen" is exactly what I'm talking about. Cathy O'Brien is some woman on YouTube who makes a lot of incredible claims. None of which she can possibly ever back up, nor has she, nor can you.  She is not a reliable source by any stretch. Interesting sure, to some people. Other people find it to be conspiracy-porn and not very credible. If you have some secret stash of proof supporting her claim that she was raped by Dick Cheney, I'll be here.

            Her testimony has no credibility. You realize that, right? I wouldn't discourage reading it, but I'd be careful calling it a source or elevating it to anything but extremely suspicious and unproven.

            I think she's a victim, and as such, she gives voice to what these kids are going through, and she is evidence of the harm that pedophiles do to innocent children.

            OP couldn't be more correct. Why is it so fucking hard to use Google? Here, look, here is Sasha Lord's website with all the posters.

            Do you see Kim Noble? No? Do you see that one that everyone says OMG KIM NOBLE!!!!? Yes, ten down, four over. Do you notice how it's just original poster sized artwork, like all the other posters?. Do you notice Kim Noble is not photoshopped onto its right side?
           </p>

            Case closed. Everyone shut up and move on from this idiocy. Baseless, unsourced, "IM PRETTY SURE..." accusations are worthless and don't help anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, but... ITS HANGING IT PODESTAS SECRET OFFICE!!!! Ok, post links or shut up. There is zero proof and these are real people with nothing at all linking them to this disaster but you people. Just stop it.

            You can check the very early 8ch PG threads for when her art was pushed into the discussion. Steemrollered is a more accurate way to describe the way it happened. 
Her art was not on CPP walls nor Podesta's walls, neither was she mentioned in the WL emails. 
I and a few others tried to guide the convo back to the art that WAS mentioned in email (Marina) but a group of all-caps-multiple-exclamation-point posters kept posting it and it appeared on every damn infographic tweeted. Funny how that happened, similar to the way the e-fits with pics of the P's and Weiner were also plastered on the same infographics with outrageous claims. 
Maybe there is something there, maybe not, but to let shills run with stuff like this and make it so prominent that even honest investigators assume it's real, true and related is  ridiculous.

            It was a flier that was in the same vein of art as hers. Really does look a lot like her art. But there is no proof it was hers, it appears it may have been made by a fan of hers. Still her art is relevant because she is a survivor of the very project monarch programming we're connecting to pizzagate.

            Kim Noble's art has been discussed here before. I still don't find proof that Kim Noble's art was displayed at CPP, or used in CPP promotions. Nor proof that either of the Podestas own or display KN art. As I was looking, again, for this proof, I found this about the art at CPP, with mention of Kim Noble [Ria Pratt] "The Cage Inside Comet Ping Pong" I've excerpted a part that says a CPP poster with Ria Pratt art was faked.

            "One of Ria Pratt’s paintings was used by Sasha Lord to advertise a Comet Ping Pong "All Ages" music event with Teenage Aviation, Teen Mom and Title Tracks. I sourced this image from a recent Red Ice TV video discussion about Pizza Gate. EDIT: PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY A RELIABLE SOURCE THAT THE ALLEGED COMET PING PONG POSTER WITH THE RIA PRATT ARTWORK  I POSTED BELOW IS APPARENTLY A FALSE FAKE PASTE-UP!"

            Let's not say she isn't a part of it, when she was most likely a victim, that is most certainly a part. Some of her art appears to depict the exact rituals we are investigating. I agree that she isn't one of the bad guys probably but she is certainly a part.

             Marina's art should be on the infographs being tweeted rather than Nobles art. Funny how someone so deeply involved with these creeps has managed to fly under the radar yet the public assumes Noble is involved.

              She is a victim of the exact same kind of shit, this has been going on for decades. They have not stopped... if anything they have refined it. I'm not saying she should be bothered by our investigation or such but her story and information is relevant. If you feel it isn't then feel free to not discuss it and waste both of our time.

           </p>
           <p>
            "The violent themes in Serbian artist Biljana Đurđević’s works reflect her development as an artist during the horror-stricken 1990s – when violence in her country peaked following the collapse of the communist regime in Eastern Europe. The body of works featured in this exhibition represents a selection from several series created by Đurđević between 1999 and 2007, in which she gazes directly into the darkest abysses of the human soul."

            Excerpt: "Đurđević 's paintings are characterized by a cruel and dramatic narrative realism, which has been termed "necrophilic realism" due to the multiplication of dead bodies and the sterile atmosphere of the public showers, operating rooms or morgues that recur in these compositions. The terrifying human figures represented in these paintings offer no possibility of mercy. Although these figures appear real, the artist insists that they do not build upon a concrete reality."

             Her artwork is a direct reflection of severe child sexual abuse. Most art work in some ways is attempting to speak about what feels unspeakable. Especially for cases of people abused as children this is the most frequent way they tell their stories and they are usually very detailed. I say this because of experience and training. The fact that the Podestas choose to decorate their homes with victims of child sex%torture abuse also other horrible items, such as representation of cannibalism and replicate statues of serial killer Dahmer's victims (remember he cannabilized them also) this is all Disturbing and  glories these heinous crimes.

             Well it's true she did not do art for them, they have however done the own art that is very reminiscent of her art. If she is indeed a sex programmed slave as she admits the. She is certainly somehow related to all of this. It's a huge web of deceit that has been going on for over 50 years maybe more. Sure she does not make art for them but her art and her own life are very relevant.

            No one is accusing or labeling Kim Noble, but JA using her artwork on the walls of a kid-friendly family pizza place is very relevant. I'm sure she's sensitive (most artists are -- and especially given her background), so she should keep in mind that her artwork will appear for that reason. There is nothing personal attached to featuring it in memes. Portrayals of ritualistic abuse have no place on the walls of a kid-friendly family restaurant.

               Comet had an invite poster that was very very like her style of art. It wasn't her art that we know but appeared to be based on her style. The multiple handkerchief artwork she has done were not up at comet ping pong, but do appear to show the very type of torture we are investigating. She was a victim and has been through the mind control programming like Cathy obrien. It appears to have affected noble much more she now has many personalities.

                Yes, I notice she even distinguishes which personalty created the artwork. Well, that's horrible then. If she was misidentified, we should stop using her name in connection with this, but still her artwork might still figure into it for the reasons you stated. Sorry, Kim. You've been through enough.

                I don't think using artwork by someone who's undergone abuse to demonstrate what is done is disinfo. Perhaps it was reported that it was Ms. Noble's work on the walls and that picture was included to illustrate the practice of using handkerchiefs.

             Let me reiterate attempting to pull Cathy O'Brien into PG is a bad, misguided idea. For one, there is no actual connection. None, zero, zip. This investigation needs leads, leads to built a case, and even need historic background material that may not be directly related. Citing Nick Bryant's work related to the Franklin Case is an entirely legitimate example of providing historic background that is not directly related. That's because Nick Bryant has published an incredibly, meticulously researched work that is factually airtight with hundreds of references and first-hand evidence. Citing Cathy O'Brien is not a legitimate example of historic background. I would like to see any research anywhere that has corroborated her claims with any kind of proof, evidence, or even a solid case to support her claims. I'm actually sympathetic and interested in her story, but do not drag that shit in here. It's an outlandish and unsubstantiated story. Right now, the MSM is running with the narrative that PizzaGate = Hillary Clinton personally trafficking children and filming porn in Comet Pizza. How do you think bringing up a O'Brien is going to win minds and change hearts. It's idiotic and unhelpful. Stop it.

              The fact is Cathy has for years claimed he have been a product of mkultra mind control and that she was molestsed by the powerful, and has even seen Hillary and bill in the act of doing so. That is EXACTLY what we are investigating. So what you're saying is that while years ago she made the accusation, she couldn't possibly be related to it, that's just insane. So we should look for the tie ins, clearly she didn't make it up or the coincidences are just too much to be true.

             Related in that she is the product of the programming, but I think what the OP is getting at is that she isnt necessarily perpetuating it. This maybe isn't a popular view, but all the humans involved are victims of the sick society we live under. Pointing fingers too much can be dangerous. This isn't an attack, from what you said it is obvious you want this shit to stop. Just friendly advice.

              Notice... everyone saying that Kim and Cathy aren't related always dance around the MK Ultra/Monarch angle. ;)

             <p>
              Cathy talks about her dealings with Michael Aquino... he keeps coming up in PG stuff... but... lol

              It's kinda seeming like they're trying to separate the two things on purpose.

               Because those two victims have already been discredited publicly and so will only serve to bring this investigation to the tinfoil hat realm in the eyes of the general public. That's why it's counterproductive to include their story in this investigation. Also because no new facts regarding their situations are forthcoming so it's kind of jay a circle jerk to keep posting their shit in this forum.

                 Look it up dude, they were summarily dismissed when they came out with that stuff. O'brien because of mentioning shape shifting reptilians and noble due to have 12 personalities or whatever. I believe their stories (minus the lizard part - most likely mk ultra programming specifically to make them discredit themselves if they speak out), but they won't help our cause.

            Correct.  The relevant artwork is by Biljana Djurdjevic, who also is not involved in pizzagate, but her artwork is relevant because Tony Podesta collects it.

             Kim nobles are is VERY relevant even more relevant than djurdjevic. Noble appears to be a victim of the very monarch programming we're investigating and some of her artwork is indicative of that.
