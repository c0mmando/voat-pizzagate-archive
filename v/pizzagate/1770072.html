            Yep, first he shills for James Alefantis, denies there is any validity to pizaagte the night before the DC protest, and then he tries to insert himself into and take over our investigation, making it a total joke to any level headed person, further smearing us by association - which I see as yet more shilling for Alefantis (aka CIA?).

             I am thoroughly sick of both Alex Jones and esp. James Alefantis. I am not watching this interview. AJ is compromised. Have no clue why Cernovich bothered to go on there.

             They are trying to prepare the Americans for a war against some Islamic country. We will see which.

             I do think that circumcision is one of the most fucked up practices on Earth that was inserted into Islam by the Jews in the 10th century. It isn't even agreed if Muhammad was circumcised in the Quran. It is not mandated by the Quran. It is entirely Jewish.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's really the biggest qualm that I have with Islam. Now saying that, all religions are completely bastardized metaphors for something real. There is no God. There is just consciousness conscious of itself. That's the universe. It's a giant paradox. A mystery. There is no question to pose. Our language fails us.

              It's bigger than war with a single country, it goes to the heart of the civil state and the official religion of Rome - blood sacrifice in the name of public security, a betrayal of justice.

             <p>
              The covenant of circumcision is with the descendants of Isaac, it is not mandated by the Quran just as it wasn't wasn't mandated by the council of Jerusalem.

               There is no "creation of this universe by a greater power". It would leave him in the same position as us. The mystery is the answer. It's so simple.

            I would like to iterate that Alex Jonestein is paid by comedy central, just like Stephen Colbertchild. He answers directly to TPTB.

           <h2>
            9/11 makes it obvious:
           </h2>
           <p>
            It is likely that only first responders, and the 250,000 thousands people who got cancer from the nukes as a result, died, as it was necessary to get our intelligence agencies on board. The low nominal American death count was acceptable to the Israeli's.
           </p>
           <p>
            The goals of 9/11 were to
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             cover up the missing Pentagon dollars
            </li>
            <li>
             pit the population with the most guns and largest military on Earth, against Islam (simple unambiguous religion that poses threat to the usury-slave society)
            </li>
            <li>
             create mass surveillance on the populations of the globe in the name of "safety" from an enemy
            </li>
            <li>
             spark wars in order to create that "enemy"
            </li>
            <li>
             secure global opium trade, and increase production 10,000 fold
            </li>
            <li>
             carry out symbolic Freemasonic ritual commencing the rebirth of ISIS
            </li>
            <li>
             spark large waves of immigration to dilute the white populations of Europe and even America. These people were driven out of their homes, into Europe, by sheer terror:
            </li>
           </ul>

            This is a joint operation by all Jewish controlled states. People like Alex Jonestein are responsible for keeping the Westerner distracted with "muh (pretend) terrorism" while the Jew destroys his home.

            Think of it like this. The Jews know that some people are going to go looking for the truth, so they set up things called honey pots, and place a grain of truth where it can protect a mountain of truth from discovery. They mix a lot of bullshit with that grain, to muddy the air. These honeypots and controlled mouths are places of controlled discussion/monitoring, where the Jew can control the environment of those who seek the truth. Alex Jonestein has great emotional content on things that don't matter too much to the Jew, but at the core issues relating to National Socialist Germany, white genocide in the west, and the true nature of the Old Talmudic Jew (Synagogue of Satan/Vatican), he is silent.
           </p>
           <p>
            My biggest issues with Alex Jonestein:
           </p>
           <p>
            Jonestein pretends that any school shooting in the USA or Australia was not a false flag, usually with no real victims (

            )) TeamWakeEmUp covers the hoax shootings of everything except for Columbine.
Jonestein pretends that 9/11 was not a complete inside job with extensive planning
Jonestein doesn't address the true nature of "why Pizza":

            Jonestein sells merchandise. It's a (((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((brand))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) as in for "cattle", or Goyim. Like "brandings". It's a Jewish inside joke.
Jonestein pretends that a real terrorist attack has ever occured. Literally any terrorist attack outside of Afghanistan/Iraq/Syria has been completely faked. I mean completely faked.
Lastly, and most importantly, Jonestein has never mentioned the BLARING evidence that everything we have ever been told about regarding human history is bullshit. This, like 9/11, is a dead give away for a Jewish shill, in the world of conspiracy buffs. It is a gift, to determine the fake from the real. The shill from the heroes:
Speed of light: 299,792,458 meters per second
           </p>
           <p>
            Latitude of the Great Pyramid of Giza: 29.9792458 degrees north
           </p>
           <p>
            "Our" meter/second is not arbitrary with regards to the Egyptians:
           </p>
           <p>
            The meter can exactly define the Egyptian Royal Cubit used to build the pyramids: 3.1416 (pi in meters) - 2.6180 (golden ratio squared in meters) = 0.5236 (Egyptian royal cubit in meters)
           </p>
           <p>
            We "happen" to use the Egyptian division of time, including the second as 1/60th of 1/60th ("second" division of the hour into 60ths) of 1/24th of the 1/365th of the year.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact the Egyptians chose this division so that 86,400 seconds fit in a day, with 86,400*10 miles as the diameter as the sun. They like to tie time and space with measure.
           </p>
           <p>
            This basically should tell you: "hmmm... everything we know about human history is bullshit"
           </p>
           <p>
            The speed of light was only determined to the same degree of accuracy in 1985.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've just shown you direct proof for their "mountain of truth" which they hide. There was a cataclysmic event 12,000-13,000 years ago (a flood) which is recounted in the bible and religions of the world. This actually happened. A lot of the "gods from the sky" stuff is literal. They only point of contention for me: are these aliens from a separate tree of life, or just "us" from hundreds of thousands of years ago (our species is 2 to 4 million years old), who are also from Earth, but escaped long ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            You may get the feeling that I don't really mean "Egyptians" when I say that lol. It was a separate group of peoples with vast vast knowledge of our solar system and possibly galaxy (speed of our galaxy is encoded in pyramids).

            What's Cernovich's deal? I want to think the best cos he's clearly getting inside info but I read a bunch of gross tweets he wrote over the years about rape and he's apparently been accused of rape (although willing to believe it was an attempt by TPTB to undermine his credibility)
