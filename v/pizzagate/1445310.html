            No its actually refreshing I think for the first time in their lives a lot of game-boys raised by computer game have lifted their head and realized that something is not right about USA.

            CIA/MOSSAD released the info to destroy Clinton, but NOTE nobody is going drain-the-swamp,. winner takes all now RNC gets to fuck all those children and DNC gets nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Listen, THINK. Has Wikileaks ever released anything DAMNING on Israel? No its only been on the enemy of Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Julian has finished his mission, Netanyahu will knight him with a 1,000 little virgin boys in Tel-Aviv.
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA/MOSSAD arrested all the wiki-leak anon's all over the world mid October, the so called dead-mans switch was killed. Selectively only podesta leaks were release, they carefully avoided anything that would tie Epstein ( MOSSAD AGENT ) to Trump. They started pizzagate in July with the fbiANON posting on 4chan ( owned by US-NAVY-INTEL) one of the largest armys of super-soldiers and a bigger MK-ULTRA program than even the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Netanyahu won Trump is now in, and under Trump Palestine will be removed from the map, and millions will die, and nobody will care because TRUMP will call it "Draining the Swamp"
