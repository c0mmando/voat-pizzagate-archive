            One of the many propaganda pieces no doubt planted in the British gutter press by McCann spokesman/professional liar/suspected British intelligence asset Clarence Mitchell to prop up the McCanns' fake abduction narrative, I'm afraid.  There was no abduction (not a single piece of physical evidence nor any credible eyewitness evidence of an abduction was found), Madeleine died in the apartment (Martin Grime's sniffer dogs confirmed as much) and she was most likely was killed (accidentally I believe) either on Sunday 29 April or the early hours of Monday 30 April, at least 3 days before she was reported missing (no credible sighting of the child alive after Sunday afternoon).  The most probable scenario is that her parents were pimping her out to prominent paedophiles, quite possibly the Podestas and/or Clement Freud (the Gaspars' statement/withholding thereof from the Portuguese police by the British police for nearly 6 months, Gerry McCann's name popping up in the CATS child abuse registry and the obstruction of the Portuguese Judicial Police's investigation by British Police, MI5 and the British Government all strongly suggest the involvement of a high level paedophile ring which the McCanns and at least one of their friends were part of), Madeleine was killed accidentally by her would be rapist, necessitating a cover up, hence Robert Murat's impromptu flight to Portugal at 5am of Tuesday 1 May.
           </p>
           <p>
            I must emphasise that this is my purported theory of what happened and not a statement of legal fact (those who know anything about the ever litigious McCanns will understand what I mean!).

             Didn't know that about Murat. What's he got to do with anything? Wasn't everything against him dismissed. Accept that she probably died in the apartment but find the other part you say hard to believe.

              To be sure, Murat had nothing to do with Madeleine's death because he was still in England renovating a property which belonged to a member of his family at the time I believe Madeleine was killed, but his flight to Portugal at 5am on Tuesday 1 May having only booked the flight a few hours previous as well as abandoning the aforementioned renovation project suggests he summoned to Portugal on an errand of no small urgency (his excuse of rushing to Portugal on such short notice to speak to his girlfriend about getting his divorce finalised does not hold water imo, especially when one considers that she was still married at the time!).  Add to that that when he was named an arguido (suspect) by the PJ, Murat lied about his movements between his arrival in Portugal and Madeleine's reported disappearance no fewer than 17 times (mobile phone pings put him in locations other than where he said he was), DNA evidence put both he and 'Tapas 7' member Jane Tanner in the Solimar Apartments building in Burgau where early suspect/patsy Wojciech Krokowski and his partner were staying (Krokowski was very likely the template for both of the highly suspect 'Tannerman' and 'Smithman' sightings; I highly recommend Richard D. Hall's superb documentary on the McCann case, specifically Part 5: The Phantoms, for more on this
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL0-ePd3FCU&amp;t=2358s">

              </a>
              ).  When one also takes into account other matters such as Gerry McCann's refusal to answer reporters' questions on whether he knew Murat before he reported his daughter missing as well as the British Consulate (who were ordered by the British Government to exceed their authority if needs be to obstruct the PJ's investigation in furtherance of protecting the McCanns) securing Murat's position as translator for the PJ, I think Murat's part in this tale goes deeper than what is publicly known.  It is my belief that he was summoned to help with the clean up/cover up after Madeleine was killed and put in place as a translator for the PJ when Madeleine was reported missing to learn what he could about the PJ's investigation.  I also recommend Part 7 of Hall's documentary, specifically about Robert Murat:

                Neither could I at first.  I thought that an accident had occurred in the apartment, Maybe Madeleine woke up whilst they were out with their friends, fell and hit her head or even a possible accidental sedative overdose (I always found that one very unlikely though, as both Kate McCann &amp; Fiona Pane are qualified anaesthetists) and, fearing the possible legal consequences of leaving their kids unattended (careers/reputations destroyed, remaining children taken into care and even possible jail time) a difficult choice was made and the bogus abduction scenario created.  But when I learned of Kathrina Gaspar's statement about the extremely inappropriate conversation between Gerry McCann &amp; David Payne regarding Madeleine as well as Gerry McCann's name being in the CATS system, a much darker picture started to emerge.  Thing is, for that wee girl's sake, I want to be wrong!

              The article is dated 2008 and the multiple time references in the article date it as written in 2008. What did I miss? Is it a reprint?

               Wasn't the article new (upper right hand corner date), with a large image of an email dated 2008 that was just released? Maybe I read it wrong.

                I have checked over and over. The by lined article is 2008. The date references in the article date it to 2008. It is one of the many stories we have seen. And if you think about it and combine it with the evidence that points to Podesta's, in a way, the article well suggests then that Podesta's are the pedophile ring. Or am I reaching too far?
