Lyrics
This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight, ya dig
Let me slow down
(It\'s so incredible)</p>
<p>I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin\' with some rich niggas
We done lost symbols speakin\' cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom, valuable like gifts of gold</p>
<p>I embark on life; my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can\'t crack
I understand the folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won\'t fail, but a lot of men will
I\'m iconic in the field like Solomon\'s Seal</p>
<p>Uh, it\'s just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo</p>
<p>Free Mason
Free Lancer
Free Agents
We faster
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All-white mansion, I\'m the child of God
All-black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce--guess you made it nigga
All-white neighborhood; you they favourite nigga
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK
So, so I JFK
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
Right now I could rewrite history
I stopped writing so fuck it
I\'ll do it mentally</p>
<p>I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin\' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin\' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die</p>
<p>Niggas couldn\'t do nothing with me; they put the devil on me
I\'d have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer; I don\'t know who to trust
Whole world want my demise; turn my music up
Hear me clearly: if y\'all niggas fear me
Just say y\'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales
Go to hell; this is God engineering
This is Hail Mary pass; y\'all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y\'all look in the mirror, double check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I\'m a Mason
It\'s amazing that I made it though the maze that I was in
Lord, forgive me; I never would\'ve made it without sin
Holy water my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I\'m red hot; I\'m on my third six, but a devil I\'m not
My Jesus piece flooded, but thou shall not covet
Keep your eyes off my cupboard; I\'m a bad motherfucker
It\'s \'hov; hust say you love it</p>
<p>I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin\' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin\' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die</p>
<p>If I ever die, never let it be said I didn\'t win
Never, never say
Never say Legend didn\'t go in (I\'m-a go in)
I just wanna die on top of the world
Makin\' love to my favorite girl
Or makin\' beautiful music
We makin\' a movie
We knew we was born to do it</p>
<p>I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin\' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin\' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die</p>',

            This thread stays up, but documentary about the Catholic church and Crown molesting and murdering children in the 1000's gets banned from this forum. I was told to post something about Haiti and Silsby, or anything else except that documentary and subject. G, wonder what is earting the mods? They are only trying to help. Anyhow, yeah, Jay Z song and john Legend.

            "Free Mason"
(feat. Jay-Z, John Legend)
           </p>
           <p>
            This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight, ya dig?
 Let me slow down (it's so incredible)
           </p>
           <p>
            [Rick Ross:]
 I go in the grave before I be a bitch nigga
 Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
 We the lost symbols speak in cryptic code
 Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of Gold
 I embark on life, my path is all math
 I understand the codes these hackers can't crack
 I understand that folks expect me to fold
 Community control to violate parole
 I won't fail, but a lot of men will
 I'm iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal
 It's just the intro
 Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
 Free Mason, freelancer
 Free agents, we faster
 Big contracts, big contractors
 Built pyramids, period, we masters
 No Caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
 A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
 All white mansion, I'm the child of God
 All black diamonds, times were hard
 New Rolls Royce, guess you made it, nigga
 All-white neighborhood, you they favorite nigga
 My top back like JFK
 They wanna push my top back like JFK
 So, so I "JFK"
 Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
 Right now I could rewrite history
 I stopped writing, so fuck it I'll do it mentally
           </p>
           <p>
            [Rick Ross &amp; John Legend:]
 I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
 Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
 Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
 Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
 I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
 Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
 Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
 Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
           </p>
           <p>
            [Jay-Z:]
 Niggas couldn't do nothing with me
 They put the devil on me
 I would have preferred niggas squeeze the metal on me
 Rumors of Lucifer, I don't know who to trust
 Whole world want my demise; turn the music up
 Hear me clearly: if y'all niggas fear me just say y'all fear me
 Fuck all these fairy tales; go to Hell
 This is God engineering
 This is a Hail Mary pass, y'all interfering
 He without sin shall cast the first stone
 So y'all look in the mirror
 Double-check your appearance (parents)
 Bitch, I said I was amazing
 Not that I'm a Mason
 It's amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in
 Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
 Holy water, my face in the basin
 Diamonds in my Rosary shows he forgave him
 Bitch I'm red-hot, I'm on my 3rd 6, but a devil I'm not
 My Jesus-piece flooded, but thou shall not covet
 Keep your eyes off my cupboard, I'm a bad motherfucker
 It's Hov, just say you love it
           </p>
           <p>
            [Rick Ross &amp; John Legend:]
 I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga

           </p>
           <p>
            [John Legend:]
 If I ever die, never let it be said I didn't win
 Never, never say
 Never say Legend didn't go in (I'mma go in)
 I just wanna die on top of the world
 And making love to my favorite girl
 I'm making beautiful music, we making a movie
 We knew we was born to do it
           </p>

             (Rick Ross and Jay Z did NOT make this video, but it portrays the song best)

            <p>
             Not that I'm a Mason
It's amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows he forgave him
Bitch I'm red-hot, I'm on my 3rd 6, but a devil I'm not

             That is one of the lousiest songs ever.  What the heck is the matter with people nowadays.  Listening to stuff that makes no sense.  Words that you have to decipher that are like a maze, talking in rhymes.  Dumb and Stupid.  There is not any music anymore.  Alternative is off key and this is nasty language and talks in riddles.  What a waste of time.

            Wow, it’s so blatant.  Teach your children critical thinking and encourage a love of reading.  None of this would be uncovered otherwise.  Prepare the future
