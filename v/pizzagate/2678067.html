Spock was a mason and played his part for his masters, 322 skull and bones, he was a dark cabalist as are all the brethren at the top.

Listen to what occultist and Mason, Manly Palmer Hall, has to say:
&quot;When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mastery of his craft. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy. He must follow in the footsteps of his forefather, Tubal-Cain, who with the mighty strength of the war god hammered his sword into a ploughshare.\'\'
    There is also a sexual connotation associated with Vulcan and Tubal Cain. Former Mason, Bill Schnoebelen, explains:
&quot;For Masons who wish to conceal their membership from non-Masons, but still advertise it to their Lodge brothers, there is a special pin (or tie tack) they can wear. It looks like an upside down golf club with two balls near the top....Many people assume the person is a golfing enthusiast, but it is actually a visual Masonic pun.
&quot;This is called the \'Two Ball Cane,\' and is a pun on the secret password of a Master Mason, \'Tubalcain (sic).\'...It is also an all-too-obvious pun on the \'god\' of Masonry, the male reproductive organ. Nice, eh?...especially when many men wear these wretched things to church on Sunday!&quot;-- Masonic and Occult Symbols Illustrated, pp. 233-238. [2008] &quot;Peace&quot; Sign</p>

Notice the red shoes...and a dead spider. Spider weave webs to entrap their victims. Also a Masonic saying...
Under this photo is written

Gross.</p>
<p>WHO ARE THESE FREAKS ! ARE THEY JUST INNOCENT ARTISTS? idk for sure, but I suspect not.</p>
<p>Anyone else find this odd?</p>
<p>I haven\'t gone through the entire site but it\'s enough to question these &quot;art movements&quot; as highly suspicious at best and nefarious as the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>This needs to be looked into further.</p>',

           WHO ARE THESE FREAKS ! ARE THEY JUST INNOCENT ARTISTS? idk for sure, but I suspect not.

           Anyone else find this odd?

           I haven't gone through the entire site but it's enough to question these "art movements" as highly suspicious at best and nefarious as the worst case scenario.

           This needs to be looked into further.

            , please have a look at our submission rules in the sidebar (view desktop site if on mobile). All posts much explain how they are directly related to elite child sex abuse, and provide linked sources supporting those claims. I will give you the 24 Hour Grace flair to edit, otherwise we will need to remove this per Rule 1. Thanks. You are welcome to post as-is to our anything-goes sub,

             The Freemasons who are connected to the Rosicrucians protect the elite pedo rings....they are the gate keepers. That is why this history pertains directly to the pedo network....they are high ranking Freemasons. The worst perpetrators. I will post another on dutroux case. Look at the royal names, all royalty are Freemasons.

              Well you've linked a lot of stuff, here, but I don't see any evidence that is directly related to elite child sex trafficking. You're pulling stuff that is over five hundred years old. That's two zeros. I'm afraid this is speculative at best, and we have a subverse for that. Please repost to

             How true...if you've gone through high school...you sure probably suffering from Stockholm syndrome and are in immediate need of UN-educating yourself and then re-educate by doing it on ones own. Scary thought to most. I have to laugh as I feel you are jabbing our dear ole mod. Tee hee and a lol.

            Yes, inversion, is the best way I'd describe all this crap. Satan wants to take every single thing that God created &amp; twist it exactly to its opposite: to defile &amp; pervert all that is good, make down instead be up, the left is now right, embrace darkness over light, &amp; finally , to paint himself as the one to save us all.
The irony that so many of these discoveries lead to include the abuse, destruction, &amp; violation of children is NOT going unnoticed. I pray that each one of us receive anointing in reclaiming God's children! Thank you,

             Its about inversion. Its about turning everything backwards using the Golden Mean Ratio. If sanity ever returns to this sub I will teach it again, and not before.

            Many months ago, almost daily, I painstakingly took the time to attempt to teach what is in your OP. When Q hit the scene, I stopped. I commend you for taking the time to do this and I urge you to continue if you have the patience for it. Considering,
            <em>
             "casting pearls before swine"
            </em>
            and all that. Great job. Don't give up.

            That event you speak of in Kentucky, it reminds me of what the two women of the Hart Family used to take their adopted foster children to.  All kinds of Rainbow Stuff, Hippy People, Music and a Rainbow type Love In.  Kids wearing Rainbow Colors and Beads.  Here is an example from Tacoma Wash.

            . org/org/rainbow-center-1    They have all kinds of events.  non profit  that seems to me to be normalizing the lesbian and tran propaganda.   Look at the pics and see if they don't remind you of the Hart Fam. and children.   Especially the picture  of the girl.  Could be what your same event is pushing.

             I agree. It's perverting our kids and taking their innocence away.  Also take note that often the colours of the rainbow are inverted!

              I have noticed that sometimes.  Inverted.  That's how they see the world.  Upside down and how they want it.
