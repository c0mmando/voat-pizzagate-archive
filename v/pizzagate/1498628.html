            I hope, but will not feel satisfied unless some high level people not only get laid off, but are also punished for their crimes.  Podesta and family locked up, Hillary locked away, Alefantis and Brock locked up.  Obama probably should be.

            Also, here's a link to the full

             Alex Jones show
            </a>
            that this interview with Steve P. aired.  If you got to 2:24 minutes in AJ talks about pizzagate specifically but this time isn't back-pedaling.

            Pieczenic is misleading here. I see what he is doing. Most of what he is saying is outstanding. But remember, he is an ex spook. There are no ex spooks IMO. His role here, is to say we won, the fight is over, the new day is starting. There is no proof of this. He says the dollar Is strong and the stock market is great. I won't get into this here in detail, but Central Banks are buying 100's of billions in US stocks. Investors mostly left and it is a phony market that they will intentionally pull the plug on. He doesn't mention that the corporate elites and the globalist Masons still control the media, politicians, state police, intelligence agencies etc etc. This game of lies, deception and murder and possibly war and collapse are not stopped IMO. Steve would have you think Trump is in, they are out.  I don't buy it. Back to Pizzagate....

            Do not be overconfident at all. There are many people who don't know how to work through details about politics and simply must dedicate themselves to a direction. Others are too scared to follow the story. Some don't know where to go from the Democratic Party because they really never imagined all this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep working. Respect the challenge of good investigation and persuasion. Do not assume everyone who doesn't see it is an enemy. Do your best to reevaluate what you understand. Do your best.

            Dude, Pieczenik is not directly connected, but he's claiming to be representing the insiders.  That means the leakers and imo, FBIanon.  Trump's straight joking about trafficking in Haiti.  It's not exactly concrete documented connections, but it is what it is.  And it's the kind of nonsense that has kept this entire thing going throughout the election and into now.  Denying that at this point is silly.
           </p>
           <p>
            When some anon promised big things at 11am back at the end of October, 2 things actually happened that day between 11 and 12.  One was the FBI vault Twitter account which verified their 4chan awareness and shouted out to Trump, then dropped the CF documents and old cases.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other was Pieczenik claiming the insider coup and predicting the election dynamic.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a small stretch, but I think Pieczenik deserves a permanent pass if only for political context.  I suppose it fits a bit better in TD, but i believe this sub will regret barring Pieczeniks insanity when everything's said and done.  We are getting most of the evidence on a platter at someone's discretion.  I hate to admit it, but he's the most credible representative.  Even though he's a Kissinger era CFR fuck.

            I think some of the weirdness around his behavior is a deliberate kind of assassination insurance. As long as the mainstream can successfully portray Jones as unhinged, then there's no reason for him to ever be suicided even if he somehow gets 100% of his news right because he can easily be portrayed as crazy to normals.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Jones mellowed out and developed a calmer temperament and worked on his mainstream appeal then he might actually be taken out somehow.
           </p>

            Infowars isn't perfect, but it's a lot closer to the truth than the traditional media.

             This is probably right-on... I met him years ago (when he was showing "9/11: The Road To Tyranny" in Katy, TX)  and he was super-rational, calm, and collected. A very nice guy actually. And then you see him flipping out on TV, and it's like, who is this other person? The idea of it being a deliberate act seems certain, but I never thought of that as a reason... makes sense really. I think Jones is on the right track for the most part.

            This guy appears to know what he is talking about. My concern, he is not an elected person. Is democracy going to be restored? Free speech?  There is an important place for an independent media. Reverse on protesting restrictions?  What about extensive Clinton Foundation crimes &amp;  #pizzagate atrocities?  Will this just be a different sort of oppression?

             There won't be need to censor. Why censor? Even when it's right in front of people they can't figure it out. He did imply the people behind all this, he described them,  were pissed over the 9/11, which BTW was an occult ritual.

              The disinfo thru MSM is criminal if what is reported in alt media is true (9/11, moon landing, Sandy Hook, etc).  We can't assume until there are official investigations and findings reported.  All we know now is that we don't know what really happened. Need to censer would happen if Trump retaliates against unfavorably reporting news companies. It would be abuse of his power and wrong, but could happen.

               You don't need the State News to approve what you think or know. Yes, they are big perps. It's already proved right in front of anyone who bothers to look . Any one with a computer and the ability to read, has no excuse. And in this case, the public also colludes. "We don't know what really happened" just is not true. Write for yourself.

               They use persuasion and mind control They study hypnosis and NLP. All those things go into why no one will accept the evidence.. And has to be told what is true by the Propaganda authority.

                An independent media is exactly *not state news. Investigative reporters have certain professional standards for reporting that public can trust is true. Like 2 corroborating sources. Sure I can read on line amateur reports but cannot trust them entirely. Esp. when rest of country still zombies!

                 I see. But all investigative reporters that I know of, who are paid professionals. are corrupt. And also, they will be the first to tell you "Investigative Journalism is dead." That is why the amateurs have taken over the field. There is a vacuum, filled by something we experience here "Crowd Sourced Investigation';" and other amateurs. The main problem for researchers is not the research itself, but it is the fact, if you have good research, you are banned from all the Forums.

              The fact that MSM outlets are owned by about 6 corporations is not going to change. Trump has been somewhat antagonistic against news sources that weren't favorable. Is he going to control the media too?  Is he going to break up the media monopolies?  Not clear how he will respect free speech.

                Well he sure has that right, but he does not have right to do what HC did-- censoring of all data that would be unfavorable to her. He can sue for libel, etc.  but I think I read he was refusing access to certain publications that had been unfavorable.

               They need to have their licenses revoked. New people can come forward to get licenses. But Dr. P said what we now call the "Alt Media" would become the Media.

             Some people think it is some disinfo strategy so the people who get interviewed can't talk. Honestly I think he is legit. He is totally ADD and can't control all the simultaneous thoughts he has going on at once so he blurts them out and interrupts. I do the same thing accidentally. It is just part of my personality. I know people like to hate on him because he is getting so popular but he has gotten popular because of his accuracy.

              Yeah I get the impression he's genuine, he is just way too riled up and passionate to not actually believe in what he's saying. I just don't think a person could go on some of the long, red-faced rants he goes on if there wasn't real rage in there.

              I think so too.  He's being positioned by Big Media and by his guests as THE guy in the alt-media.  It's certainly the case that he's put a ton of time and energy into putting himself into that position, but I don't trust him at all.

             Stop interrupting. "Jones" is so annoying. He's worse than Amy Goodman (not that she interrupts but that she holds the floor and talks so slow you lose the sense before you fall asleep - another technique to water - down info rather than deliver it].﻿
I can't stand how "Jones" keeps interrupting him . It's not about you "Jones" Learn to take an interview. What an egoist. Everyone knows what you say because you repeat and you are a bombast.. This is the man sent out to give a report on WTFIGO so let him talk. Damn﻿

             He's trying to put on a show, and make himself look good. That's his whole gameplan, drop SOME of the truth (but not all of it), and put on a clown show so new people find it "funny" to look up "conspiracy theories."

              I listened to him in the early 2000s.  I followed up on some of his "documented" claims and found him mischaracterizing the wording in government documents and realized he was just sensationalizing to promote fear and draw people towards him.  Once he had managed that, he had an enterprise to protect which kept him from going in certain directions.

              All these guys have one major flaw, they become married to their theories.  They make the mistake of tying up their credibility and ego into the integrity of their theory and will guard it all costs.  At that point every new bit of information has to pass through the filter of that theory.  In other words; they continue, but remain myopic and never come to a complete understanding, and neither do their audience.

              If you ever want to see Alex pushed beyond his capabilities into collapse, check his interview with David Duke.  Alex has some strong points, but a lightning quick intellect and verbal IQ aren't among them.

               On the other hand, he has been saying that our government is being run by pedosatanists before it was cool to say that our government is being run by pedosatanists.  Just reminded me..need to buy a water filter and freeze dried food.

               but he's still benefitting us on the whole. He might not be perfect and some of the stuff he does is ridiculous but even if he has secretive owners or whatever he still draws the right crowd and feeds them the right things to get them rallied behind the greater good. I wouldnt complain.

                Quantitatively, I agree with you.  He has brought about a general awareness with much more success than anyone before him, or since.  I'm not sure about the quality of the following, but I see Infowars stickers on bumpers from time to time.

                On the other hand, his over-the-top frothing doesn't appeal to the crowd who can actually make a difference.  Storing food and putting your family in debt over firearm purchases does little to change government and society in general.  Pro Tip:  That arsenal, when barricaded in your home, is worthless against a few well-placed molotov cocktails.

                I don't think Jones is compromised in any real way short of the self-censoring he does to protect his brand.  I'm not really complaining, just wish someone else would arise that appealed to the more educated.  His buffoonery is his own undoing.

                   Well I stand my point, if AJ is controlled opposition it is the worst attempt of controlling your opposition ever. Cause no one I know helped growing the opposition more then him.

                     ok let me clarify, i know no one that woke up more people form MSM dream, giving alternative viewpoints on contemporary history, while always educating people to do their own research, not to trust him.

                     The  "Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion" do not disprove my claim. If you think they do, please elaborate.
