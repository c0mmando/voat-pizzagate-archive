<p>What I haven\'t seen thus far: 
The kitchen/prep area, which is located adjacent to the pizza oven. (big round thing in the middle of the restaurant)
The kitchen area should include a walk-in freezer and liquor storage.

            Nice work. This whole basement meme seems like it came out of nowhere recently and I even heard it mentioned by one the reporters covering the Welch incident. I wouldn't be surprised if there are certain DC media personnel on here trolling and trying to make ridiculous posts as fodder for their hit pieces.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who knows, maybe they have a basement, but this is further evidence that this is not the case. And I don't even see how it's relevant at all to begin with. So what if they do have a basement? Does that somehow lend credibility to everything else that has been uncovered? And so what if they don't? Does pizzagate suddenly collapse?
           </p>
           <p>
            Sounds to me like another pointless rabbit hole to dilute investigative efforts and cause people to focus on an irrelevant detail.

            I archived the TripAdvisor link:

            Here's the metro article that keeps getting posted about this:
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            The Metro article was published April 16, 2015. And the instagram photo you linked says it was 97 weeks old. 97 weeks from the beginning of this November would have been late December of 2014. So whatever they were working on may have been finished.

             I think it's okay to at least determine what basements the buildings on the Saudi-owned block do have.
            </p>
            <p>
             If they have them, and they are somehow hidden, then we might be able to find forensic evidence of abuse.
