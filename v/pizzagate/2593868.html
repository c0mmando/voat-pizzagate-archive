<p>Like most plot points on HBO’s Silicon Valley, a recent episode in which tech oligarch Gavin Belson receives blood transfusions from a “blood boy” to help keep him young is actually rooted in reality—just ask Peter Thiel. “I’m looking into parabiosis stuff, which I think is really interesting. This is where they did the young blood into older mice and they found that had a massive rejuvenating effect,” the tech billionaire and Trump adviser told Inc. magazine. “I think there are a lot of these things that have been strangely under-explored.”</p>
<p>Jesse Karmazin agrees. His start-up, Ambrosia, is charging about $8,000 a pop for blood transfusions from people under 25, Karmazin said at Code Conference on Wednesday. Ambrosia, which buys its blood from blood banks, now has about 100 paying customers. Some are Silicon Valley technologists, like Thiel, though Karmazin stressed that tech types aren’t Ambrosia’s only clients, and that anyone over 35 is eligible for its transfusions.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say the word panacea, but here’s something about teenagers,” Karmazin told New Scientist. “Whatever is in young blood is causing changes that appear to make the aging process reverse.”</p>

<p>So this guy wants young people\'s blood for his company. He was going to be in Trump\'s administration.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley billionaire investor Peter Thiel is joining President-elect Donald Trump’s team transition team.</p>
<p>Trump’s camp confirmed the decision on Friday after news had leaked out the day before in a report by former Fortune editor Dan Primack.</p>
<p>Thiel was a rare voice in Silicon Valley who publicly supported Trump during his presidential race, including speaking at the Republican National Convention and donating $1.25 million to Trump’s campaign. Many fellow technologists attacked Thiel for his Trump endorsement, which he later defended by saying he disagreed with Trump on some of his most inflammatory comments but agreed with his overall vision.</p>
<p>Thiel, who will serve on the Trump transition executive committee alongside Trump’s children, Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr., stands to gain from possible policy decisions by the Trump administration. For example, he’s an investor in ride-hailing company Lyft, which is subject to regulatory scrutiny for its challenge to the taxi industry, and co-founder of data crunching company Palantir, which is a government contractor.</p>
<p>When Trump was elected however he completely changed his tune and ignored Peter.</p>
<p>&quot;Trump reportedly told Peter Thiel they\'d be friends for life — and then ghosted him&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Peter Thiel was the only major Silicon Valley mogul to publicly back Donald Trump\'s presidential campaign.
Trump showered Thiel with praise but failed to return his calls after he was elected president, according to Michael Wolff\'s &quot;Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.&quot;</p>

<p>Interesting. If true, I wonder why the POTUS cut all contact with him? Also I made a typo in the heading by mistake. Meant *teenagers.</p>',

            Trump is too busy with his Rothschild and Goldman staff. Never acknowledges PG, pushes agenda 21, the Palantir predictive crime program. What is it you tools think he has done for you or is doing? They are in full control and he isn't helping you. Grow up, wise up.

            A pilot project for a new libertarian floating city will have 300 homes, its own government, and its own cryptocurrency
           </p>
           <p>
            Nearly a decade ago, PETER THIEL co-founded  a non profit called Seasteading Institute and contributed seed funding toward what could become the world's first FLOATING CITY.   WHAT???!!!

           <p>
            You will have to click on the link to read the rest, It would not allow me to copy.  Believe me it is a Real Eye Opener in that they will have their own cryptocurrency.  Another island to park their money and it says when the sea level rises across the world they will be saved.  At least that is how I see it.

            Every emotion, addiction and bodily function puts a neural peptide in the blood stream. That peptide flows to all of the cells. The blood of a person, regardless of blood type, will carry their habits, nutrition, state of arousal, general mood, physical growth hormones (puberty, menopause, lactation, etc.), and up-to-the-minute emotional state... all kinds of stuff... mirroring the old adage: “the life is in the blood”.

             Peter Thiel's CIA-Backed Data Mining Company Wins Court ...
Palantir, a big-data mining behemoth, just got its foot in the door to a lucrative U.S. military contract following a months-long court battle with the Army.
Search domain theintercept.comhttps://theintercept.com/2016/10/31/peter-thiels-cia-back In cities across the USA drug addicts are selling their blood after drug binges to pay rent, or for more drugs. This blood can end up in the veins of a beloved family member. This blood can be extremely contaminated with virus, parasite, heavy metals, and other. Apple a day.

            Yesterday was World Blood Donor Day -  Let's hope their not selling what they took from our Country's Citizen to Thiel.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Every year on 14 June, countries around the world celebrate World Blood Donor Day (WBDD). The event, established in 2004, serves to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products, and to thank blood donors for their voluntary, life-saving gifts of blood.
           </p>
           <p>
            World Blood Donor Day is one of eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO), along with World Health Day, World Tuberculosis Day, World Immunization Week, World Malaria Day, World No Tobacco Day, World Hepatitis Day, and World AIDS Day.[1]
           </p>
           <p>
            The host country of the World blood donor day 2016 is The Netherlands.[9] Williem-Alexander -the king of the Netherlands- opened the ceremony by thanking donors.[10]
           </p>
           <p>
            The WHO and the Netherlands have sponsored and hosted Blood Donor Day.  I am sure they have nothing but good intentions.  Hmm.

             I agree. He probably really enjoyed yesterday. Thiel's lust for "young blood" seems evident.  I'm sure the WHO cares about the worlds children...as platters of blood, body part meat machines for the elites to do whatever they like. Psychopathic monsters.

              Good description.  Psychopaths.  Psychopathic Zombies.  Something not human.  We should do memes of them with them getting their blood, needles and tubes sticking out.  We have to start making fun of them in a macabre way.  Something like Nick Nolte DUI Style. Should also do memes for #kidstoo.  Maybe pictures of kid stars that committed suicide with #kidstoo on them. Time is a waisting.

                Who would have thought.  I still get scared of watching Bela Lugosi the Vampire, and that's when I thought they were just in the movies.  Then not long ago the treated us to the Vampire Movies.  They always show us Who They Really Are.  YES!!
Real Vampires.  All the time we thought it was only in the movies.  Someone should start a Stake Business.

                  And I am not kidding!  It would get them really scared.  Imagine every voat member and lurker buying a stake to drive into a vampire's heart.  How about all those people doing the Memes?  There are thousands I think that would buy a stake.

              <p>
               Palantir is VOAT's competition, LOL.! It attempts to do what thousands of citizens organically posting their research and analysis on specific topics do. Palantir "clients" have access to huge amounts of digitally collected info, but human analysts need help making info associations and identifying patterns to make good use of it.

                Thanks.  The Intercept used to be one of my favorites.  I will read it.  He and others like him have way too much money.  I have nothing against capitalism, never did, until now.  It has gotten way out of hand.  This is how they have been able to wield their power.  People like him need to be locked up.  A law should be passed ASAP against this buying of blood from young people and selling it at a Huge Profit.

                 Zombies are Old School. Now it's VAMPIRES. Is this what Twilight was really pushing?
Who controls the nation's blood supply? Why, it's the RED CROSS.

                  While I agree that these people literally are the modern vampires, and sick psychopaths, I don't believe at all zombie and vampire films are normalizing. I run a whole YouTube channel that's based on zombie/monster horror fiction and am still 100 percent committed to stopping Pizzagate.

                  IHG - Red Cross  organ harvesting too.  I have thought about Twilight being one of those normalizing films.  They really pushed them hard.  I was not into seeing any of it and I was so sick of hearing about it.  I think you and I both know what they were trying to do.  The Red Cross has been in PR since the Storm.
