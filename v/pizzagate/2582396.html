<p>There\'s another thread on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> that is explicitly taking the side of a serial killer.</p>
<p>Now that more facts have come out, let\'s take a look at what we know.</p>
<p>Dwight Lamon Jones met his wife when she was med student. When she became a doctor and the primary breadwinner, he stayed home with their son.</p>
<p>His wife filed for divorce in 2009 after 21 years of marriage.</p>
<p>One source of tension in the marriage was that when the child was older, she wanted him to go work. He refused.</p>
<p>She also claimed she abused her and belittled their son.</p>
<p>She said he once fractured her sternum. Another time he attacked her in front of her son and after this threatened she would found at the bottom of their pool.</p>
<p>He assaulted members of his son\'s school, and they took out orders of protection on him.</p>
<p>The wife soon placed tape recorders around the house and she recorded an incident where he was verbally abusing his son and the boy had an asthma attack. She stepped and he attacked her and threatened to kill her again.</p>
<p>She called 911 during this incident and the cops came. There was a standoff with the cops with him inside still with his son. After an hour he finally surrendered.</p>
<p>This is when she filed for divorce and got an order protection from him.</p>
<p>He was then arrested for disorderly conduct and had to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
<p>&quot;In November 2010, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Pamela Gates granted the divorce, and awarded full custody to the mother, citing the father’s violent and abusive behavior and his untreated mental illness.&quot;</p>
<p>So this guy is a total piece of work with a documented history behind him. This is not just he said/she said. There\'s independent evidence of the above.</p>
<p>So jump to this year. Cops have connected him and they say there\'s DNA evidence from the bullet casings to six different murders over several. 4 of those murders are connected to the divorce in one way or another.</p>
<p>The first to die was a forensic psychiatrist who testified on his wife\'s behalf</p>
<p>Pitt testified in September 2010, during the couple’s divorce hearing that Jones had an anxiety disorder, mood disorder and features of antisocial, narcissistic and paranoid personality.</p>
<p>“Dr. Pitt also testified that Father poses a high risk to perpetuate violence toward mother and child and/ or himself’,” Gates wrote.</p>
<p>Another doctor agreed.</p>
<p>Dr. Paulette Selmi, meanwhile, wrote that Jones was in need of psychiatric help and “is going to continue to unravel … he will become increasingly paranoid, likely psychotic and pose an even greater threat.”</p>
<p>The Judge &quot;ordered Jones to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in 2010 but four years later, he still hadn’t done so.&quot;</p>
<p>So 8 years after two doctors says he was seriously ill and would unravel, it seems like he did unravel. Law enforcement calls killers like these grudge collectors. This guy seems like a classic case of it. Remember that ex-LA cop who killed cops and their family members not long ago? This guy seems just like him. None of this was his fault.</p>
<p>He posted some youtube videos right before the killings where he named his victims and laid out his grudge. He said the judge was paid off, his wife was the one abusing his son, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>So either we have a righteous guy who just had plan and kill six people in cold blood because of they were all working against him</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>We have a POS husband and father with a documented history of violence, who abused his family, was mentally ill and untreated, harboring grudges and planning revenge.</p>
<p>I beg you to look at this logically. What\'s more likely one violent and mentally ill man did this? Or a chunk of the legal/psychiatric community decided to go after one guy and that one guy was justified in the murder of 6 people.</p>
<p>Tell me, we haven\'t reached the point of serial killers being given the not just the benefit of the doubt, an empathetic hearing as they lay out the reasons, their victims had to die. Tell me somebody ranting on youtube doesn\'t cause you to damn his victims and take his side.</p>
<p>Let\'s rethink this one.</p>

            Semantics of the term ‘serial killer’ are entirely irrelevant imo. However, to the other posters point - Yes - this terminology has been used historically to frame events such as this in an effort to make the accused appear guilty beyond reproach.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with OPs assessment of this particular incident. There may very well be more to it in terms of his battle with CPS but based on briefly looking into it I personally think this guy was just pushed too far.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether or not deserving of how he was treated for the alleged situations leading up to his actions; I really do think he targeted relatively ‘innocent’ individuals and it had more to do with him feeling scorned rather than ‘justified’ as a result of a weaponized CPS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless of your thoughts on these events I’d just say keep looking at the information critically. Nice compilation of info OP but clearly you’ve taken a very confirmed stance on the details of this event. Confirmation bias always goes both ways.

            Everything in this post is loaded and fallacious.
Based on what I have seen its either a psyop or some "beef" and he went Punisher on them
"serial killer" is a misnomer, shows a lack of your understanding of that false label which our "gov" has used to cover up occult killings done by organizations of people for decades.

             According the FBI definition of a serial killer, this is not a misnomer. From wikipedia
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for example, defines serial killing as "a series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone"
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I agree that this killings are different from an ordinary serial killer.   This is more like a revenge spree of the type of serial killer
             <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/spycatcher/201304/wound-collectors">
              analysts call a 'wound collector."
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Wound collecting is the conscious and systematic collection and preservation of transgressions, violations, social wrongs, grievances, injustice, unfair treatment, or slights of self and others, for the purpose of  nourishing, fortifying, or justifying a malignant ideology, furthering hatred, satisfying a pathology, or for exacting revenge.
             </p>
             <p>
              What kind of people meet this criteria?
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone who, because of a personality disorder or character traits (e.g., insecurities, paranoia, fear, xenophobia, or due to emotional instability), inflexibly seeks to collect wounds and slights for a purpose that usually has negative social consequences or is self serving. This can be anyone from a spouse, to a terrorist, to a mass killer.

              Thje FBI is not a legitimate source for information, I posted the evidence. You refuse to self educate good luck. Most of these "serial killers"
were part of larger organizations and were janitors/fall guys. The FBI "definition" btw is a joke. You know of a pedophile ring and you covertly take them down targeted wise
is not "muh serial killer". I know a guy that killed the person who molested his son, hands down he did it, found him, Judge gave him 3rd degree assault time served this was back before fake "crimes" were invented to smear people. Also that (((FBI))) definition is telling, coming from the group that covers up real crimes, helped blow up OKC, WTC 93, and 9/11. The FBI has no credibility. In addition murder is the intentional killing of innocent human life. Copy and pasting FBI stuff LMAO

               Highly Agree.  I believe one of those cases that used a fall guy was the Green River Murders.  It is sad that we have another 3 letter org. that is following the pattern of the CIA.  Making stuff up is their game.  Another psyop imo.  Amen.

                 All I am saying is yes, this could be another one of their concocted stories.  The first half is possibly true, and then the made up the second half to fit the scenario and yeah, another False Flag.  That guys eyes look really strange.

                     Dirty is a word I have used quite often lately.  It's sad, because we visited there about 20 yrs ago and thought of moving there which is really a Pipe Dream because my parents still live, and I would never leave them.  We have had many reasons or chances to leave but I never could.  So I guess now I am glad we are not in that Dirty Dirty Place.  I am sure you are right, that there are some who are good, and do what they can without getting fired.  It must be hard being good when so many around you are bad.
