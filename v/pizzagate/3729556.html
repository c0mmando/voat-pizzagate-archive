<p>That\'s a 200 subscriber increase in just the past week, and 684 since February 9. We haven\'t grown at that pace since the fire at Comet Ping Pong. Well done, guys! Let\'s keep it up! </p>
<h2 id="md-its-a-glorious-target-rich-environment-out-there-right-now">It\'s a glorious target-rich environment out there right now</h2>
<p>Here\'s what I\'ve been doing, in case you want to do something similar:</p>
<p>When I see a story like <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3725005">this one</a> about Alec Baldwin hosting Ellen\'s show with a montage of kids grabbing the junk of Disney characters, I go to SearchVoat to see what other dirt we\'ve got on him, and then reply to the tweet with a series of compelling morsels of our research, giving each one a brief summary, like <a href="https://twitter.com/Vindic8tr/status/1242547680909262848">this thread of several tweets</a>. (Over <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/6lap4r.png">11,000 twitizens saw that one</a>.)</p>
<p>Depending on the quality and clarity of the submissions, I either link an archive of the Voat submission itself if it\'s good, or I link to the underlying linked support source material (Hooray for Rule 2!). I link to an archive of the Voat post so that users can see the research without having to create a Voat account initially.</p>
<p>I\'ve also been linking the urls to SearchVoat searches of our research stockpile on various topics in reply to people\'s twitter threads. With celebrities losing their minds, and many pizzagate organizations like the World Health Organization, the Gates Foundation etc. in the news, just sharing the SearchVoat link to the key words with a message like &quot;Citizen investigators have compiled tons of research on this over the past three years. Check it out&quot; works wonders.</p>
<p>Replying #PizzagateIsReal or #Pizzagate when retweeting others\' tweets helps keep the hashtag live.</p>
<p>Finally, I also <a href="https://twitter.com/Vindic8tr/status/1241239084938326017">pinned a link to the &quot;Pizzagate is three&quot; sticky, which contains an index to SearchVoat searches of our research by topic to the top of my Twitter timeline</a>. I encourage everyone to get a Twitter account and join in! It\'s my only other social media besides Voat, so I can\'t advise on the best way to share our material on Instagram, Facebook or elsewhere. Please post your ideas on that below. :-)</p>
<p>Keep up the good work, folks!</p>',

              Given the number of new TTT accounts is relatively low, I would say that most of the new subscribers are genuine. Give it a couple of weeks, let's see how that goes.

                I might have the subscriber count archived, but not those active/inactive status.

            Hello,
           </p>
           <p>
            I am one of the new ones on Voat and this pizzagate subverse. I am not new to the topic though. This week the HBO docu on fake news was promoted by a msm journalist over here in the Netherlands. He runs a blog on new documentaries and wrote on this one as well, highlighting pizzagate. He said: "Illustrative is the account of James Alefantis", and thats when my old knowledge on the pizzagate scandel popped in my head. I asked him for a -&gt; dialogue &lt;- on the subject, but he refused to -&gt; debate &lt;- the topic because of his lack of knowledge… Sigh…
           </p>
           <p>
            So i decided to write an article about this on my (long forgotten) blog. But while gathering info to debunk the HBO docu i got overwhelmed by the mass of new info on the topic. Well, not realy new info, but new videos i found, i never saw before, and it did have new info in it for me… From there on in one video i got pointed to Voat, but could not read it, so i decided to register yesterday. First thing I checked were the videos of Sean Speaks, and have not completed watching them yet since it is 6 parts. So i just started to go check out more on Voat on the subject and now I am here. :-) And I am impresses by the loads and loads of topics, so it will take me a while to comb through them, if I will ever manage... But it feels goor to be on the Pizzagate-train again. It is a topic that needs the attention so much more than many other topics... But to get it mainstream is a hard task… It got me banned from Twitter years ago… I felt disillusioned for a while, no feeling the energy to start up a new account. I had lots of followers and great sources to follow, but in a flash it was all gone... I do have a new Twitter now for a long time, and i will start following you (OP), but I do not spent time up there like I used to. Bu i do hope to frequentlt visit the forum here and contribute where ever I can.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the best,

             ! We are glad to have you. :-)  I'm sorry to hear about your Twitter experience. So many here have had the same thing happen. The thing to do is archive your follower page and then send a message out to a few of them with followers of their own to tell them what happened. We're all in this together, and we try to back each other up that way.

             recently lost a whole YouTube channel with years of stuff on it. It's very discouraging. I like to chalk it up to evidence we're doing damage. :-)

             Voat makes new users earn a certain amount of Comment Contribution Points before allowing link posting in order to slow down the spammers. However, you can get around it simply by adding a couple spaces in the middle of the link, breaking it. However, if you get involved in discussion, it shouldn't take you long at all to earn plenty of CCP.

               Just go to your follower page and make an archive.is copy of it from time to time. Then it will be there, even if your account gets scrubbed.

             Hey man, thanks so much for the info, and welcome back to the train. I believe your blogpost is:
             <a href="https://degrijzeduif.blogspot.com/2019/">

             The disillusional feeling is quite relatable, many of us work full-time and find it hard just keeping updated.

              Thank you as well. It feels nice to get a response on a forum when you are new. :-)

              The blog you link to is indeed my blog. As you can see it was a year ago since i updated it, and even then it was not that much i did… Same the years before… In the time Pizzagate was there I was pretty active though, and you can find a few posts about this on the blog. I even made a few videos in that period. I have to go drive the car now, so I will re-listen to my own work on pizzagate hahahahaha.

            So, the day starts w/ that vampire Madonna (who obviously is about to get coronavirus and or die very soon) and circles around ROSE PETALS &amp; FLOWERS

             Yeah, Twitter is a much easier platform to use than Voat. Much easier to post there. I try to repost the best stuff here that I see there, but when things are moving quickly like they are now, I don't always get to it. I do always retweet it, though, so lurking my Twitter timeline is a good way to see the latest pizzagate-related stuff.

              So what do you think? I initially thought that madanas video in the bathtub was more than one thing because of all the symbolism, but I quickly realized the desperation. Ellen Degenerate reaching out to Tom Hanks, everyone talking about flowers. Did you see the Maria Shriver video? Whackadoodle station!

            As a long time seeker in these dark realms, I know I was impressed and relieved when I found this last bastion of truth. The skeptical yet open minds, thorough researchers, historical knowledge, and selfless persistence, makes Pizzagate a worthy subscribe for anyone wishing to lend their mind to saving children and our world.
           </p>

                   Racine is America's Bellwether - the key predictor for the nation, where the most powerful Boy Scout in Congress reigned.
Paul Ryan is part of a cycle of abuse and global criminal coverups linked through the political and economic engine of America and The World.
Paul Ryan was involved in the Tarmac meeting, and the pilot was also murdered.
I-94 is a major trafficking route, and Racine exposes the real agenda and true definition of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
The Global Chain of Command is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons.
They have unlimited resources and will stop at nothing to eliminate any opposition.
They and the other most powerful families in America and around the world meet at Wingspread.
The Clintons, Bushes, Podestas, Emanuels, and even Trump all work for the same Masters with wealth beyond what you can imagine.
Warren Buffett, Epstein, Branson, Ron Burkle, Guy Oseary, Peter Thiel and many others manage various investments in the chain.
Through their networks, they control every industry, and infiltrate every community to know every angle imaginable.
The Hotel and Technology industries in particular are targeted to ensure full surveillance and control across every community.
Education and labor reform are keys to their global programs, as they monitor every aspect of life possible.
Everything is compartmentalized, however some people find out too much.
There was a long series that targeted

                     Eh...it's all designed to discourage people and waste their time. Otherwise, actual research would be posted.

                    <p>
                     But I agree...the fact that someone is paying for these bots to be programmed, is scanning our content to generate plausible related comments, and tweaking responses to disguise the artificial intelligence a bit IS encouraging. That shit can't be cheap. This group creates sometimes a dozen new accounts a day, and doesn't even stick with one until it gets banned like a real person would. They literally make a comment or two and then create a new account and generate more cryptic useless comment spam with that one, and then move to the next. Although I've removed dozens, there are undoubtedly dozens more I've missed.

                     <p>
                      They and many others have found a great deal of Truth along the way - this is not a waste of time. Argosciv does not know anything about Racine, and the nonsense they wrote about Racine is not time well spent, but even they found a few Truths, and they can Repent and be accepted by Jesus Christ whenever ready. We believe in message over messenger.

                     <p>
                      If Trump and Q are really running 5D chess and using this global crisis and pandemic to really drain the swamp of global criminal corruption - you will know very soon. We will be the first to high five them publicly. What if you are wrong and they are the ones wasting your time. They have the power. You have the magic ban stick. You know accounts are limited and you use that as an argument claiming there are no links. Look in the comments above - there are broken links there - did you follow any of them to find The Truth for yourself?
