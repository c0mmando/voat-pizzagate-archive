<p>The Amendment, proposed by Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK), would have blocked the sale of Viagra-type drugs to convicted sex offenders for recreational use. This bill was an attempt by the republicans to stall Obamacare, as changes to the bill would have resulted in the House of Representatives voting on it again. The democrats voted it down, viewing it as only a political tactic. Democrat Senator Max Baucus (MT) was quoted as saying, </p>
<p>&quot;This is a serious bill. This is a serious debate. The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of the Senate, the debate and the American people. It is not a serious amendment. It is a crass political stunt aimed at making 30-second commercials, not public policy,&quot;</p>
<p>I can understand the Democrats blocking this bill in order to pass Obamacare. What I think is suspicious is that they didn\'t revisit the issue. Not passing this amendment could have had serious political backlash for them. They could have easily passed a new law afterward that prevented sex offenders from obtaining Viagra through Obamacare or any other government program. The vote would have been 100-0. The fact that they didn\'t shows that either this wasn\'t that big of an issue to them or that they wanted sex offenders to be able to purchase Viagra through Obamacare. Oddly enough, Republicans didn\'t propose a law to this effect afterward either. Perhaps they thought it would get vetoed by President Obama; or perhaps it didn\'t matter to them once there were no more political points to be won. At any rate, the fact that politicians are okay with letting pedophiles obtain erectile drugs should be cause for concern to us all.</p>

            there are a lot of pedophiles who need their penis drugs, and this is a big market for big pharma.  Obamacare is a gift to big pharma and the insurance industry.
