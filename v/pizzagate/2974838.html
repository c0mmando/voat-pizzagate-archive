  'formattedContent' => '<p>The state of Arizona, which has the infamous reputation of removing the highest percentage of children in the U.S. from their homes and families through Child Protective Services, has now also been exposed as having a very corrupt foster care network that includes pedophile rings where young children are imprisoned in state-approved foster homes and trafficked to pedophiles.</p>
<p>In a developing story based out of the military town of Sierra Vista, Arizona, the home of Fort Huachuca, David Frodsham, a former commander with the Department of Defense in Afghanistan who was discharged from duty due to “sexual harassment” behavior and an assessment by the military that he had an unalterable personality disorder, has been arrested and convicted of operating a pornographic pedophile ring based out of his state-approved foster home.</p>
<p>the charges brought against David Frodsham and his wife who were state-approved foster parents last year (2017) with the story of the young child Devani, who was seized from her family just days before her second birthday and placed into the Frodshams’ state-approved foster home where she was allegedly raped repeatedly and trafficked as part of an organized pornographic pedophile ring. After David Frodsham was arrested due to a federal investigation, Devani was placed into another state-approved foster home where 80% of her body was burned by scalding water, forcing the amputation of her toes</p>
<p>Now, another foster child who was adopted by the Frodshams and put into their pornographic pedophile ring has turned 18 and come forward to reveal details of years of horrible torture and sexual trafficking while suing the state of Arizona for damages of $15 million</p>
<p>John Doe is a victim of the State of Arizona’s failed child protection practices and policies.</p>
<p>John Doe, who is now 18 years old, suffered over 12 years of shocking physical and sexual abuse because of the State’s refusal to protect him.</p>
<p>John Doe was born in September of 1999 and before his fourth birthday was placed in foster care. The Frodshams were approved by the State to have John Doe in their home in 2004 and John Doe was subsequently adopted by David and Barbara Frodsham in 2012.</p>
<p>The Frodshams were licensed foster parents with the State of Arizona from 2002 to January 2015. The Frodsham license was not suspended until David Frodsham was arrested at the DES office for felony drunk driving with toddlers in the vehicle.</p>
<p>The State and its employees ignored actual notice of the abuse of John Doe and numerous warning signs that the Frodsham home was dangerous.</p>
<p>The State did not remove John Doe until ICE, a federal agency within the Department of Homeland Security, arrested David Frodsham for operating a pornographic pedophile ring based in the home. ICE identified John Doe as a victim of Frodsham’s pedophilia.</p>
<p>John Doe suffered sexual, physical and emotional abuse for over 12 years in this home, despite numerous red flags of abuse and neglect. This abuse was no secret to CPS/DCS and well documented yet no investigations were undertaken. </p>
<p>David Frodsham utilized the State of Arizona and the foster care system to funnel innocent, vulnerable children into his home, so he could run a pedophile ring.</p>
<p>John Doe was sexually and physically abused by David Frodsham countless times both inside and outside the home while Frodsham’s wife, Barbara witnessed this abuse, and physically abused John Doe herself.</p>
<p>Mr. Frodsham also acted as John Doe’s pimp, prostituting John Doe to other men, for their sexual enjoyment, and for money for himself.</p>
<p>Frodsham often participated in these sexual meetups. Frodsham helped enable a network of pedophiles in the Sierra Vista area and these men participated in further sexual abuse against John Doe.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, David Frodsham never should have been approved as a foster parent, as his deviant sexual behavior was well documented, and caused him to be released from duty in Afghanistan, where he served as a deputy commander with the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>parents today can lose their children to the state for a variety of reasons under the blanket term of “neglect” and not abuse, such as disagreeing with doctors, refusing vaccines, not feeding their children according to USDA dietary guidelines, having a dirty house, allowing children to go outside without shoes, etc.</p>
<p>But foster parents who are bringing in federal funds to the state get away with REAL abuse, and this poor foster child highlights this same injustice in the system in the lawsuit:</p>
<p>Is the Federal Investigation into the Frodsham Arizona Pornographic Pedophile Ring Part of a Federal Investigation of Pedophiles in the Military?</p>
<p>just-released report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which was commissioned under the Obama administration, and was considered so explosive that it was originally marked “Secret/No Foreign,” with the recommendation that it remain classified until June 9, 2042.</p>
<p>A heavily redacted version was released to the public in January (2018).</p>
<p>Someone is apparently putting pressure on the military to expose the widespread practice of bacha bazi, or “boy play,” in which some Afghan commanders keep underage boys as sex slaves.</p>
<p>Arizona DCS Knew About Abuses and Torture but Did Nothing</p>
<p>The State had access to over thirty-eight police reports from the Frodsham household, from 2002 to early 2016, (all prior to the arrest of David Frodsham for sex abuse). The State should have reviewed these as part of their licensing process of the foster/adoptive parent program.</p>
<p>John Doe complained to CPS/DPS over sixteen times and nothing was done. Even more shocking, there were at least 10 abuse and neglect complaints documented by CPS/DCS between 2002 to 2015.</p>
<p>Arizona Child Sex Trafficking: How Can this be Allowed to Continue to Happen in the U.S.?</p>
<p>in 
2014, due to the sheer volume of parents who were contacting us explaining how their children were medically kidnapped, often for simply disagreeing with a doctor, or wanting to seek a second opinion.</p>
<p>Most of the early stories we covered were all coming out of Arizona, and it was clear to us early on that something was not right in Arizona. </p>
<p>However, one of the worst reasons we were hearing about as to why so many children were being taken away from loving families and put into foster care was because the U.S. pedophile child sex trafficking business is so lucrative, that it allegedly makes more money than the illegal drug trade, and illegal arms trade, combined.</p>
<p>But we quickly learned that this topic was off limits to the media, as no one was willing to come forward and expose it, due to fear of reprisal, as the whole child sex trafficking allegedly extends to the very wealthy and powerful forces in the U.S. politics.</p>

            Back-to-back claims: Kids were abused in foster care, and DCS dropped the ball
           </p>
           <p>
            In May 2016, a 7-year-old girl was sexually abused while in foster care
           </p>
           <p>
            The man who assaulted her, known to her as "Papa Joe," was convicted last year of sexual conduct with a minor and sentenced to 20 years in prison
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, her attorney is seeking $22 million from the state for the failure of the state Department of Child Safety to properly vet her foster-home placement and keep her from harm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Foster child, sex offender lived in same home 
A new notice of claim — a precursor to a lawsuit — filed with the state Wednesday describes that harm in graphic detail. Attorney Robert Pastor says DCS officials knew or should have known that the child was living in a home west of Phoenix where Jose Egurrola, a registered sex offender, was living.
           </p>
           <p>
            " In fact, the State of Arizona did know because the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicle (sic) and the Arizona Department of Public Safety documented that Jose Angel Egurrola was a convicted sex offender, living with the foster mother," the claim reads."

             DCFS/CPS and the RCC/Vatican - are they vying for 1st Place in the sexual abuse of Our Children?  Medical Kidnap just had a story about a 2 day old baby snatched from her Mother in the hospital. This was in Canada. Seems this is a growing problem and not just here. MSM has no soul.
