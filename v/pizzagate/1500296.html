            No mention of number of shell casings found... Fundamental. Initial reports were long gun and no shots. Became shots into the floor. Shooting into the door lock without bring able to open the door. Ridiculous.

            Another hole in the story... 'shooter' begins this bout of brilliance in investigative journalism with guns (a real life DOOHDOOH7) at approx. 3:00 pm. The next time we see a time is 3:24. We're supposed to believe this guy stayed in there for 20 min... just walking around guns falling all over the people that were still running out for 20 minutes as the report says... 20 fucking minutes people were running out of there and the last of 'em finally ran out just as the first responders were getting there... exaggerating a bit, but for real. Even if they had set up a perimeter at 3:15 ( a full 15 minutes for him to perform urban justice) and coaxed him out for 9 minutes (to make 3:24) that's still a stretch and that still suggests that the D.C. cops were there in less than 8 - 10 minutes, tops (3:00, allow a few minutes for D.C.'s finest to be notified 3: 04, en route and arrival 3:14, setup 1 minute Barny Fife perimeter 3:15, convince Mr. Pillar of Logic to come out of one of the worst realistic blunders (or best crisis acting performances) of his life)... another 20% of my recommended daily allowance of bullshit.

            '...entered the restaurant carrying the AR-15 across his chest, in a manner that instilled fear in everyone who saw him.' -- obviously this guy is using basic level suggestion in his speech to paint the picture of a menacing concerned citizen. Fear, fear, fear. This should be quite obvious to anyone that the 'shooter' is a patsy and this is a smear. No one, I mean
            <strong>

              no one

            </strong>
            , would go self-investigate by shooting the place up... even completely disregarding all of the discrepancies in the reporters' stories with the weapons and how many shots fired, etc. it would still look staged simply from the angle of self-investigating requiring at least a more subtle approach than loud shots from a gun. Just walking up in the place and slapping someone would look more realistically believable than this 'shooter.' Staged Event. Crisis Actor.

             I'm a right wing nut job that drives a Prius. Despite the stereotype, more conservatives drive these types of cars than you think. I have to drive about 100 miles a day, and save big money on gas. Yes, I'd rather drive a pickup, that much is true.

            Mr Agent man meticulously describes how many bullets were in the AR-15, how many bullets were in the magazine of the AR-15, and how many bullets were in the handgun.

            Somehow he never mentions how many shell casings were found. Then he goes on to claim that multiple shots were fired, well before any ballistic tests could have been performed to prove that the uncounted shells on the ground were fired by the gun in question.
