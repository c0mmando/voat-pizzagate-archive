            Anyone ever read about the woman who was married to a MLB'er and how I think it was LaSorda who'd reward the team for winning with women and children (including the person I'm talking about). I'll try to find it and post a link for you guys; it's just that it was several years ago when I came across it.

            On Monday, Craig Calcaterra of NBC Sports provided details of the statement and noted the alleged act, which occurred in the 1970s, would be considered statutory rape, though the statute of limitations has passed. The report notes Rose "acknowledges" the relationship but said he thought she was 16. WHAT?  He thought she was 16?  Evidently he does not know where the cut off is.

             I think that comment about being sixteen is really an admission of guilt. This is why the statute of limitations laws are flawed. A guy just admitted to raping a girl but see no jail time because of the amount of time that has passed.

              I just listened to the report on the news.  No mention of the 12 - 14 yr old girls.  He admitted it and it could be because his thinking is not too clear at the age of 70.  I hope many more come forward.  Limitations may have passed but it will take him down, which he deserves if many more come out.  I also agree that the laws should be rectified.

            I have had an argument with my husband for years about Pete Rose.  When he was charged with the gambling in baseball I had a suspicion that he probably might do other things as well.  I knew someone that worked in a baseball team office and he said thee were rumors then about young girls.  I said well a lot of them do that.  He said, No, Really young girls.  That is all he would say.  My husband of course being a fan said I really had no proof.  And he was right.  I never thought he should have been accepted into the Hall of Fame.
