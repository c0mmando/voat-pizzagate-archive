To understand what is going on here, let\'s look at some some of the <a href="[https://hangthebankers.com/clinton-corruption-10-facts-clinton-foundation/](https://hangthebankers.com/clinton-corruption-10-facts-clinton-foundation/)">corruption</a> coming out of the Clinton Foundation. You have donations to the Foundation being accepted in exchange for policy concessions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Among recent secretaries of state, Hillary Clinton was one of the most aggressive global cheerleaders for American companies, pushing governments to sign deals and change policies to the advantage of corporate giants such as General Electric Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Boeing Co.” (James V. Grimaldi and Rebecca Ballhaus, “Hillary Clinton’s Complex Corporate Ties,” The Wall Street Journal, 2/19/15)</p>
<p>“At the same time, those companies were among the many that gave to the Clinton family’s global foundation set up by her husband, former President Bill Clinton.” (James V. Grimaldi and Rebecca Ballhaus, “Hillary Clinton’s Complex Corporate Ties,” The Wall Street Journal, 2/19/15)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There is money from foreign governments and wealthy foreign donors, which are barred from donating directly to US political campaigns, using the Clinton Foundation as a way to get around these prohibitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rarely, if ever, has a potential commander in chief been so closely associated with an organization that has solicited financial support from foreign governments. Clinton formally joined the foundation in 2013 after leaving the State Department, and the organization was renamed the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation.” (Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger, “Foreign Governments Gave Millions To Foundation While Clinton Was At State Dept.,” The Washington Post, 2/25/15)
“More than 40 percent of the top donors to the Clinton Foundation are based in foreign countries, according to an analysis by McClatchy.” (Anita Kumar, “Clinton Foundation Limits Foreign Donations,” McClatchy, 4/15/15)</p>
<p>“Former President Bill Clinton promised the Obama administration the foundation wouldn’t accept most foreign-government donations while his wife was secretary of state. The agreement didn’t place limits on donations from foreign individuals or corporations.” (James Grimaldi and Rebecca Ballhaus, “Clinton Charity Tapped Foreign Friends,” The Wall Street Journal, 3/19/15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also being used to hide speaking fees. Anyone familiar with speaking fees knows that they are a common way to bribe politicians. The politician does you a favor, and you pay them a million dollars to come talk for an hour about some boring topic no one cares about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Clinton Foundation reported Thursday that it has received as much as $26.4 million in previously undisclosed payments from major corporations, universities, foreign sources and other groups … The money was paid as fees for speeches by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Foundation officials said the funds were tallied internally as “revenue” rather than donations, which is why they had not been included in the public listings of its contributors published as part of the 2008 agreement.” (Rosalind Helderman and Tom Hamburger, “Clinton Foundation Reveals Up To $26 Million In Additional Payments,” The Washington Post, 5/21/15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people now realize the Clinton Foundation is a money laundering scheme:</p>

<p>The question is: what money is being laundered?

            I wonder if part of the investigation includes a team that will undo all the corrupted policy implementation. Please please! It would understanably take a long time to unwind all thebullshit and also replace with good law, or whatever that can be codified effective immidiately and benefits the free people once again. That, plus the public executions of all the worst offenders of treason and sedition to this country.

            Never forget 9/11, It's what brought me here, never forgive, never forget....

            Robert Mueller played a hugely significant role in covering up the Saudi/British role in the murders of almost 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001, and the wholesale destruction of the United States Constitution which followed in its wake—a role which, if thoroughly examined, constitutes obstruction of justice, among other crimes. It is a trail of prosecutorial misconduct, including what former Senator Bob Graham calls “aggressive deception” of the U.S. Congress and the public concerning the events of September 11, 2001, and includes a major role in the creation of the post-9/11 surveillance state which has eviscerated and destroyed the Fourth Amendment and the rest of our Constitution’s Bill of Rights. Those who work inside our modern Leviathan can surely point to other malfeasance, and we invite you pile on—please, expose it. You owe no less to your oath to the Constitution of the United States.

            Thanks for the info. I like listening to Larry Nichols speak about the CF. He was their money launderer for 18 years before he became a whistleblower. YouTube has a lot of his talks.

            The Apotex murders are related to the Clinton Foundation
           </p>
           <p>
            Through the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) the Clinton's conspired with drug manufacturers to create a legal rat-line for expired aids (and other) drugs to India and Africa
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically different countries have different expiration guidelines for drugs. As the drugs get older, they lose potency.
           </p>
           <p>
            So first world countries get the good drugs, and then send them back after expiration. The pharma companies then sell these ineffective drugs to 2nd and 3rd world countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's truly evil. And that's just one tendril.
