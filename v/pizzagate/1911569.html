<p>The &quot;Crazy Days and Nights&quot; website is a long running online institution said to be run by a disaffected Hollywood insider who gets it right pretty much every time.  Sometimes the site has blind items - gossip without naming the parties, and sometimes it has &quot;blind items - revealed&quot; - at the stage where the gossip is pretty undeniable because of physical proof.  .Even under the &quot;blind items&quot;, his readers are so attuned to his clues that they generally guess quite correctly and a lot may be gleaned by reading the comments underneath an item of interest.  
</p>
<p>Most of his info is minutiae about the drug habits and sex scandals of minor celebs, but Prince Andrew was one of the principle actors in the Epstein &quot;Lolita Express&quot; bust and court case - photographs surfaced publicly of him partying at Epstein\'s island house with &quot;Virginia&quot; the young woman who sued Epstein as a sex slave. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11330601/Prince-Andrew-and-the-picture-that-speaks-a-thousand-damning-words.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11330601/Prince-Andrew-and-the-picture-that-speaks-a-thousand-damning-words.html</a>  This tidbit seems to refer to him buying his way out of that one, but not surprisingly facing ongoing blackmail for plenty of other photos.

<p>What would be interesting to know would be - who are &quot;yacht owners&quot;?   Any prominent yachts connected to Epstein and/or his island?  Ghislane Maxwell?</p>',

            Similar story here. You gotta watch this Bill Maloney put the heat on a pedophile politician. Maloney is a hero! I wish there were more people like him.

            It's an upside down world when you suddenly realize that Randy Quaid's story about "Hollywood Star Whackers” may have been true and possibly he and his wife aren't so bonkers after all.

              Yacht Owner may mean something else. One becomes part of the "system" once they buy a boat. Once you buy a boat you enter into another club of people and with each assemblage of boat size or anchor point you travel in different circles. What happens on the yacht stays on the yacht. The most embarrassing thing that can happen to someone who plays the boat game is to downsize the yacht or the crew. Or, have your yacht towed or seized (This gives me the best feeling of Schadenfreude but it doesn't happen very often) So someone who talks about Yacht Owners may refer to a class of people who all know each other: People who own the top 30% of yachts (by proce tag and length). And yes... it's a penis thing.

              Well known that young Hollywood ingénues and supermodels all whore on the side. All the usual names, the Lohans and Hiltons and Hadids of this world. Mostly takes places in Cannes but I'm sure a bunch of them have stopped by St James.

            I'd like to point out something else - I now notice more keenly the opening line - "
            <strong>
             This always has been and always will be screwed up
            </strong>
            ."
           </p>
           <p>
            As in -
            <em>
             we know this has been going on for ages, and will not be stopped in the foreseeable future as it is woven into our governing systems at the highest levels.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            I weep for this attitude, and I respect and love anyone here who has ever really tried to cast their lot in with fighting against this.  A change in the outlook that this is inevitable has to happen first and we are the vanguard -  even your personal opinion really counts.  If you do nothing else, don't believe it is inevitable and never give in to it as such.

            It does not matter if the yacht owner has pics, Prince Andrew and I truly believe at least 90% of the Royal family going back generations and expands all over the globe are pedos. I think they are into the hunting kids parties. So so so Evil!
Obama the bunghole banger Pedo was said to have meet with Prince Harry this week or last week.

            First of all its a proven tactic with ample historical precedent. Jared Kushners dad bought a hooker for his own sisters husband for that purpose!

            If you think about it wanting to have sex with little boys is so unthinkable that it must be pure ritual.  In PNG some tribe drank elders' ejaculate, which at least makes some intuitive sense, and we are talking about LITERALLY the most intelligent race vs. the least.  What a fucking world.

              About 30 years ago a group of my friends and I was parting on an old beach close to a dam. A few 100 yards or so from this was this old tool shed that was completely filled with old copies of the NG. 
I should have used all those Evil damn things for our school's big yearly bon fire!😕

              I actually still get Nat'l Geo, holdover subscription gift from elders never seems to get stopped.  Anyway right you are, it has devolved into literally a poster child for globalist, elite agenda programming, especially a lot of transhumanism.  They had an article recently promoting putting computers in public spots in India that young children could use but their parents couldn't access or monitor in any way!  Literally opening children up to predators online with no protection.  Once in awhile a great archeology find still sneaks its way in.

               That's mostly because the US fills the world with garbage media which becomes available online anywhere in the world, turning people into garbage and breaking up traditional matriarchal family/tribe structures. However, the concept of internet kiosks for slums seems to produce interesting results. What I find suspect is that people who come up with these grassroots projects and begin to make headway are "awarded" and moved by int'l NGOs away from their country of origin and get distracted by the process of becoming ordinary Western subburb dwellers and NWO puppets.

                REALLY pisses me off to see that agenda pushed, and nice middle class America just gobbles it up.  "Oh we are such good people to get kids access to computers without their parents choice or input.  'Cause they are poor and lucky to get it!"    Disgust.

               Yeah, funny how they won't stop sending the mag. But then I guess it's that way w/ others too. Grossed me out 20 years ago when on the cover was a young African boy bathing in the urine of a cow. It was their culture of course.

               John Paton from Scotland was an early missionary to New Guinea (then called the New Hebrides after the Scottish Islands) and wrote about his experiences w/ the cannibals there. Chilling. Good book. And yes, another connection (Paton) to Trump's mum's church in Scotland.

                  it goes into great detail about PNG - more than the wiki seems to indicate.

                  a bit about Judyth but I'll read up - creation of virulent viruses by CIA to control populations is no stretch for me at all.  They were caught even recently handing out fake/unneeded vaccines to kids in order to zero in on Bin Laden.

                    Not sure how this actually got exposed but it's just a little tiny drop in the ocean.  Can find much more in this operation with google - CIA, vaccine, Bin Laden
