<p>&quot;David Hill had done what I had originally done. He had asked questions and began to dig into who pulled the strings in this country. Both David and I discovered the names of some of the more obvious powerful families. For instance, in David\'s notes he writes, &quot;Yes, it is a fact: the Mellon\' s, Carnegies, Rothschild\'s, Rockefellers, Dukes, Astor\'s, Dorrance\'s, Reynoldses, Stiliman\'s, Bakers, Pyne\'s, Cullman\'s, Watson\'s, Tukes, Kleinwort\'s, DuPont\'s, Warburg\'s, Phippses, Graces, Guggenheims, **MILNER\'s, **Drexel\'s, Winthrop\'s, Vanderbilt\'s, Whitney\'s, Harknesses and other super rich Illuminated families generally get along quite well with Communists, who supposedly want to take away the wealth of these men and give it to the people.&quot;</p>

             Simon Milner graduated in 1985 from Oxford. Bill was out in the late 70's, so there may not be a link. We do KNOW that Oxford is a hotbed for these types. We also know that Simons grandfather /great grandfather (not sure yet) went to oxford and was involved in some serious NWO shit. It woudl follow to me that he could also be some kind of asset. If we can prove it, think of the possiblities in relation to what is going on right now with CP and FB worldwide.

            wow. Milner's trick comes back to bite in a big way. how great is that! the easy suggestion is to say, quick, get this over to the BBC, but jfc, they're just going to want to hope this story dies on the vine given prior complicities. surprised they took the story on in the first place. glad they did.  Terrific work.
