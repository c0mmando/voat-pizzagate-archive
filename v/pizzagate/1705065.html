Simon Milner - Facebook and Instagram safety Facebook users are bound by rules- most importantly cannot harm others but offence and causing offence is more difficult to police as is highly subjective. Real name policy -have to be yourself- “more safe” than others including anonymous like ask fm. Is this the case though? Children and young people are willing to lie to deceive Facebook to gain access. Help centre Reporting can be done here- not the only place- can be reported from anywhere on the site (mobile and desktop) Every single report is looked at by an individual Reports are prioritised by age or harm or immediacy eg. Suicide
Social reporting ability to report someone outside of Facebook helpful in school community- could be sent to safeguarding group in the context. All that is needed is an email address and can then send a copy of the whole report- even blocked Facebook institutions can use this feature. Global safety advisory board Eradicating CEI from Facebook- proactive in removing this material photo DNA- scans photos on Facebook against a database- although the software cannot spot new images- which is a problem in Sexting Sextortion cases as images so quickly appear and disappear and are saved elsewhere. Also Facebook is working to tackle grooming by trying to look at patterns and language and users Instagram is easiest to change privacy settings can make posts private and chose followers etc and able to block unwanted followers No nudity allowed on Instagram which is safer than other social network platforms. Simon dealt with a barrage of questions following his presentation that ranged from very technical questions regarding privacy (which we have dealt with in our previous blog post “protecting your digital footprint”) to questions about the ‘real name’ policy which fails to stop underage users signing up- which seemed to be the biggest concern of the conference audience.</p>

<p>&quot;David Hill had done what I had originally done. He had asked questions and began to dig into who pulled the strings in this country. Both David and I discovered the names of some of the more obvious powerful families. For instance, in David\'s notes he writes, &quot;Yes, it is a fact: the Mellon\' s, Carnegies, Rothschild\'s, Rockefellers, Dukes, Astor\'s, Dorrance\'s, Reynoldses, Stiliman\'s, Bakers, Pyne\'s, Cullman\'s, Watson\'s, Tukes, Kleinwort\'s, DuPont\'s, Warburg\'s, Phippses, Graces, Guggenheims, **MILNER\'s, **Drexel\'s, Winthrop\'s, Vanderbilt\'s, Whitney\'s, Harknesses and other super rich Illuminated families generally get along quite well with Communists, who supposedly want to take away the wealth of these men and give it to the people.&quot;</p>

<p>OXFORD CONNECTION: The Fabian Socialists dominated the staff at Oxford when the Rhodes Scholars began arriving.

<p>From the same article regarding Bill Clintons Ties to Oxford and his CIA connection Clinton\'s ties with the C.I. A. began when he studied at Oxford. Clinton\'s reign as President has been noted for numerous scandals, including the unexplained deaths of more than 50 of his associates by means of bullets and plane crashes.</p>

             Simon Milner graduated in 1985 from Oxford. Bill was out in the late 70's, so there may not be a link. We do KNOW that Oxford is a hotbed for these types. We also know that Simons grandfather /great grandfather (not sure yet) went to oxford and was involved in some serious NWO shit. It woudl follow to me that he could also be some kind of asset. If we can prove it, think of the possiblities in relation to what is going on right now with CP and FB worldwide.

            wow. Milner's trick comes back to bite in a big way. how great is that! the easy suggestion is to say, quick, get this over to the BBC, but jfc, they're just going to want to hope this story dies on the vine given prior complicities. surprised they took the story on in the first place. glad they did.  Terrific work.
