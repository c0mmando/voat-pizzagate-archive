<p>Here is the google maps view of the villa in Luz portugal I am looking for</p>
<p>I think I found the address Google says is near R. José da Conceição Conde 3, Luz, Portugal</p>
<p>Allot of people think the podestas lived there in May 2007 around the time Madeline Mccann went missing near there in Praia De Luz but nobody can confirm it. The villa belonged to Clement Freud in 2007 but he wasnt there in May of that year at least he wasn\'t there before Maddie went missing. He returned after that happened later on that year. Clement Freud is now known to be a pedophile and molester who abused young teenage girls in the 50s and 70s, the abuse took place two decades apart. Maddie\'s mother recently said in an interview that when she was in Portugal after her daughter went missing she had dinner with Clement Freud at his villa in Portugal after being invited by him while they were stil in luz searching for her. Some believe that the house was rented out to the Podestas who were friends of Clement Freud at the time of Maddie\'s disappearance. Perhaps he just allowed them stay because they were friends. This is all speculation and it would be great if we could prove this.</p>
<p>Can someone find out who was living there in May 2007? Were the Podestas renting it or living in it? That\'s what I would like to know.</p>

            There has been information on one of the Chan boards that stated John and Tony Podesta were staying T their friend "Clem's" villa on the day Madeline went missing. Additionally a scratch of a third suspect that was possibly involved matched the description of Ghilsine Maxwell the known recruiter for sex slaves for the elite on Jeffrey Epstein Island. The FBIANON asked to demand the passports of the Podestsas. Also curiously John'S emails appear to have been wiped the weekend McCann went missing.

            I was there a week ago, search my posts for info. If podestas were there they didnt leave the villa (which has a garage). Doubt anything provable will come of this perhaps false lead

             What we really need to look for are documents from around 2006 or 2007, some sort of record of residence. What do you mean they couldn't have left the house? Did the police have credit card records of everyone in luz or something? I know there was actually one sketch that looks remarkably like John Podesta so if someone saw a guy who looks like him maybe there is something to this?

              I mean its literally too small to not be noticed or remembered. I.e. they couldn't even have bought a pack of smokes. Anyway the most reliable eyewitnesses said the father carried her out. Maybe Madeleine was sold to be sacrificed. The efits and Weiner sketch are too perfect, I think they're just a bread crumb for investigators.
