<p>I don\'t know HOW we missed it in the first place, but there seems to be a whole lot more to <strong>Kaya Jones</strong> and her claims that she was basically in a <em>prostitution ring that fronted as a working band</em>.</p>
<p>After just two years as a member, Jones in 2005 quit the group, which was assembled by choreographer Robin Antin under a deal with <strong>Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records</strong>. </p>
<p>Yep, David Geffen... <strong><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2180525">The Motherlode</a></strong></p>
<p>(THIS, dear mods, is the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2180525">premise</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2189519">pretext</a> for this thread remaining on the main pizzzgate board, duh) <strong>Kaya Jones is another cryptic and possibly well-timed snub at  Geffen, Weinstein, Clinton and the entire Pizzzgate cast.</strong></p>
<p>Initially I found that she was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_Jones">\'discovered\'</a> by R. Kelly at the age of 13! Immediate red flags.</p>
<p>Then, not only did I find out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Kelly">R. Kelly</a> has been being bankrolled by Geffen, I found out that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Antin">Pussycat Dolls</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girlicious">other ventures</a> are more of the same.</p>
<p>Kaya has had an interesting life, I wonder if all the \'Dolls\' were culled from similar circles and circumstances?</p>
<p><em>At the age of  <strong>13</strong>, Jones was discovered by <strong>R. Kelly</strong> and signed to his record label for development as an emerging talent. By age 16, she signed with Capitol Records, and in 2003 she auditioned and was selected to the Pussycat Dolls. After being inducted into the girl group, she went under the tutelage of famed music producer Jimmy Iovine. She quit the group in 2005, claiming that it was no longer fun to be in the band. She told Yahoo! Singapore, &quot;When everyone is not on the same page it affects the group so that I think was the worst part and I decided to leave. It was not because I wanted to be solo and I didn\'t want to be in a group anymore, I left because it stopped being enjoyable, it stopped being fun.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Jones was born in <strong>Toronto</strong> (hub of worldwide child sex trafficking) to a Native American father and a Jamaican mother and is American. She spent the first <strong>several years of her life living throughout the Caribbean (another hub)</strong> before moving to the United States and growing up in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>\'We were all abused\': Former member of Pussycat Dolls Kaya Jones says the band was a front for a \'prostitution ring\' and the singers were \'passed around\' and \'abused\' by industry executives</strong></p>

<p>-Kaya Jones, 33, has spoken out with stunning accusations about Pussycat Dolls</p>
<p>-Jones joined the girl group as a teenager in 2003 and quit two years later</p>
<p>-She says members were \'passed around\' by music industry executives</p>
<p>-<strong>Group\'s founder claps back calling claims \'disgusting, ridiculous lies\'</strong></p>
<p>-Jones spoke out after attending the Las Vegas concert where 58 were shot dead </p>
<p>-Allegations come as Weinstein sex harassment claims implode Hollywood</p>
<p><em>In an interview over the weekend, she said that she had <strong>decided to come forward because she was deeply affected by the Las Vegas concert massacre</strong>, which took place <strong>shortly after she had left the venue</strong> for a friend\'s bar nearby.</em></p>
<p>Wow. Ok. Well that doesn\'t seem too unusual because the Pussycat Dolls are a Las Vegas based group and she did grow up there. But, just, wow, bizarre that she was there and now here connecting all this...  You Just Can\'t Make This Stuff Up</p>
<p>Anyway, I was intrigued as to who the groups founder was:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Antin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Antin</a></p>
<p>She seems to be very fond of Las Vegas venues.</p>
<p>...and then I saw this:</p>
<p>millennial_vulcan 1 points (+1|-0) 2 days ago  (edited 2 days ago)
Remember when <strong>Robin Antin</strong>, Founder of the Pussycat Dolls encouraged 10 year old Kylie Jenner to pole dance...?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsVdjPDQrHIYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsVdjPDQrHIYouTube</a></p>
<p>So I decided to look into <strong>Miss Antin</strong>, and it seems she has quite a history with not only <strong>Interscope Records</strong> since they fund all her projects, but <strong>David Geffen</strong> personally, <strong>through her brother</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Steve Antin</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Antin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Antin</a></p>
<p>Steven Howard &quot;Steve&quot; Antin (born April 19, 1958) is an American actor, stunt man, screenwriter, producer, and director, probably most known for his performance in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_American_Virgin">The Last American Virgin</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, WE ALL KNOW HIM:</strong></p>
<p>Antin is remembered as <strong>Troy</strong>, the <strong>bad-guy preppie jock</strong> in Richard Donner\'s <strong><em>The Goonies</em></strong>, with Corey Feldman. </p>
<p>Also from Steven\'s wikipedia page:</p>
<p><strong>Antin</strong> is openly gay, and was once the boyfriend of <strong>David Geffen</strong>. They were together for a little more than one year.[3]</p>
<p>So, the questions begin mounting:</p>
<p><strong>What IS this intimate little network between R.Kelly, Robin Antin, her brother and David Geffen?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other fun facts:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_American_Virgin">The Last American Virgin</a> a 1982 American <strong>coming-of-age film</strong> written and directed by <strong>Boaz</strong> Davidson, an Israeli film director.</p>
<p><strong>Kaya Jones</strong> was also featured on the 2016 <strong>Corey Feldman</strong> album <strong>Angelic 2 the Core</strong>, on the track &quot;4bidden Attraction&quot;.</p>',

            RKelly story is all over the liberal media outlets, he may be next to go down.  Remember seeing videos of young girls dressed like tramps brought onto his stage at concerts that was pedo.  Follow RKelly's boss and owner.  We have a musical industry Titan involved.  This links the movie industry with the music industry, another cultural influence monopoly.

            Geffen was a major bankroller for the DNC and pays a lot of major anti-trumpers voices we hear today like Snoop and RKelly.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The music mogul reportedly had a falling-out with the Clintons in 2001, when Bill controversially pardoned businessman Marc Rich but not Leonard Peltier, whom Geffen had requested be pardoned. Geffen told the Times‘ Dowd that the incident represented “yet another time when the Clintons were unwilling to stand for the things that they genuinely believe in.”

             It's been claimed by industry insiders Weinstein Co is one of the few in Hollywood that champions Indies and foreign films with widespread US appeal. That means Art Houses and various film festivals continue to exist. Otherwise you'd have nothing but re-treads, re-dos, re-makes, and a few semi-original comic book character driven films with lots of special effects. Oh, and the usual slate of downbeat, dystopian movies designed to sell Satanic themed music.
