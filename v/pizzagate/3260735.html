<p>Naasón Joaquín García, who heads La Luz del Mundo (The Light of the World) church, was detained at Los Angeles airport, California prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Mr García, known as &quot;the Apostle&quot; among his followers, and his three female co-defendants are facing 26 charges.</p>
<p>The organisation, which has headquarters in Mexico, says it has baptised more than five million people around the globe.</p>
<p>It claims to have at least 1.8 million followers in Mexico alone. However, only 188,326 people stated their religion as being Luz del Mundo, says Mexico\'s official census (in Spanish) carried out in 2010.</p>
<p>In recent years the church\'s influence has spread to the US, particularly in parts of California with large Hispanic populations.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Tuesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Mr García, a Mexican national, and the three women allegedly committed 26 felonies in southern California between 2015 and 2018.</p>
<p>These included human trafficking, production of child sex abuse images and forcible rape of a minor</p>
<p>The defendants are accused of coercing underage girls into performing sex acts. The girls were reportedly told that if they went against the wishes of &quot;the Apostle&quot; they would be going against God.</p>
<p>Mr García\'s co-defendants have been named as Alondra Ocampo, Azalea Rangel Meléndez and Susana Medina Oaxaca. They are all affiliated with La Luz del Mundo.</p>
<p>Among them only Ms Meléndez remains at large.</p>

            All our churches are totally demon possessed so there is going to be a lot of demonic devil stuff going on in the churches. They all do child sacrifices, child sacrifices happen in all our churches. It happens differently than people think. The way it works is that since everyone who attends church is possessed the demonic presence in churches are so strong that the demons just target children and kill them anyway they want to. It is not done in basements with people that have robes on. The sacrifice can literally happen at any time of the day. The demons also use accidents, illnesses, miscarriages, birth defects, abductions, murder to kill the children. This is fact. It happens in every church across our nation and has been going on for decades. There are many more sacrifices done in churches than the abortions we have had in the USA. Imagine every church sacrificing in America and the number of churches we have and this has gone on for centuries. It is generational.

              The only thing I can think of is THEIR longevity. Research for prolonging THEIR own lives. They are that egocentric and so vain. Jimmy Carter survived brain cancer and look at Alex Trebbeck. He is beating 4 stage cancer. Look at the old cow Bush before he died? He always cane out of the cure for cancer was found decades ago. Just not for us. the hospital somehow.  Still don’t believe he’s really dead. Her either. One thing I always told my husband before he passed away was that

              I dont see his church as completely fulfilling the blind, because he's not in northern Az or dealing in white women
             </p>
             <p>
              but I do think AZ has multiple competing/cooperating pedo rings
             </p>
             <p>
              In particular I am 100% confident that the Assemblies of God, Mormon Church, and FLDS are running pedophile rings in that state.

                mutual blackmail allows two competing rings to maintain each other's silence.
