            The pic on twitter link doesn't look like Ghislaine (not saying it isn't).  It looks like an event where people who may have not arrived together are seated next to each other (the first row in a fashion show for instance).

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Maria Farmer is one of Jeffrey Epstein's victims. Her account proves that Ivana did not only meet Ghislaine Maxwell at parties, but actively sought her company.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Your link doesn't support that specific claim, so there's no way to know if it's true based on what you've provided.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maria Farmer said Ivana visited once. It appears that Maria Farmer mentioned Ivan Trump to use her name as a segue to say "I was given a special invite to ride in the car with "people like Ivana---powerful" people, but then in private after returning Ghislaine treated me with disdain. Keep in mind that Maria was offered help with her art career, selling her paintings of nudes as young as 12 and being hired to help Epstein acquire art, so giving her access to meet rich powerful people 'like Ivana' would go with the territory of her job.

            Note the report that
            <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2019/04/maria-farmer/">
             Maria Farmer Was 26 Years Old at the Time of the Alleged Abuse
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Within her affidavit, Farmer says that she was the first person to report Epstein’s behavior to the FBI. The Miami Herald reports that FBI documents do show Farmer was interviewed in 2006 or 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
             Farmer, now 49 years old, was 26 years at the time of the alleged abuse. Per The Miami Herald, Farmer said she was employed by Epstein, and that she and her then-15-year-old sister were molested by Epstein and his “companion,” Ghislaine Maxwell. This allegedly took place in 1996.

            This next NYT
            <a href="http://archive.is/DBTf4">
             link
            </a>
            has likely been posted already but it is a detailed account of the Farmer sisters stories.  Note that this account mentions Annie Farmer as being 16 when she met Epstein, in the former account above,  Maria was quoted as saying that her sister was 15 when Epstein rubbed Annie inappropriately in a movie theater.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Ms. (Maria) Farmer had mentioned to them that her sister  was looking to go to college. Mr. Epstein offered to help, and brought Annie, then 16 years old and living in Arizona, to visit New York.
            </p>
            <p>
             Annie Farmer said she recalled Mr. Epstein as kind and casual, wearing sweatpants, pouring champagne and talking about her college plans. During the trip, they all went to see a movie. As the film progressed, Mr. Epstein began rubbing Annie’s hand, and then her lower leg, she said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It was one of those things that just gave me a weird feeling but wasn’t that weird + probably normal,” Ms. Farmer wrote in a diary entry dated Jan. 25, 1996. “The one thing that kind of weirded me out about it was he let go of my hand when he was talking to Maria.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The account goes on to describe her being sent to Thailand with the permission of her mother who didn't know there wouldn't be other students going.  Annie alleges that Ghislaine massaged her chest under the auspices of getting a normal massage.  Epstein was not part of that incident, but Annie believes he was around (unseen) watching.  Prior to that he laid in her bed in an attempt to "cuddle".   Clearly all of their actions with Annie were grooming her for sexual encounters.

            Regarding Ivana Trump, I don't know the context of this photo (as in how briefly or not her hand appears to be touching/cupping young Ivanka's chest/breast) but it looks creepy.

            Met Wexner once about 30 yrs. ago. Very charming. Remember pedos are groomers. Rich monsters know how to shmooze when necessary. I’m sure Ivana does too. Why was she in the book? Men women or younger. That’s my question. I met Marla too.
