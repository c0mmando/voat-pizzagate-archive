<p>I found <a href="https://faithallen.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/are-cults-really-covers-for-kiddie-porn-and-prostitution-rings/">another relatively unknown but useful ritual abuse victim\'s blog</a>, with posts and comments that string together a narrative from all the circumstantial evidence we\'ve gathered. I feel like victim testimonies really unscramble the weirdness of all the connections and the story these connections seem to suggest. The deeply disturbing stories Faith shares on her blog are reminiscent of X\'s testimony from Dutroux. Ritual abuse and organized child abuse rings have been all but blatantly confirmed over and over....</p>
<p>As much as I don\'t want to doubt a victim\'s story, the earlier known survivors of the cult/pedo/CIA trifecta of child abuse like Cathy O\'Brien were just too difficult to believe, back when I started researching MK ULTRA in 2009. I believed something had happened to them, but it all seemed so bizarre. So I have always been interested in digging further and finding more corroborating stories. </p>
<p>The blog itself has many heartbreaking but informative posts from the survivor OP, and the comments are mostly from other victims so there are multiple testimonies to similar tactics. Some comments I\'d like to point out here are:</p>
<p>From September 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most survivors of RA recall having a job “in the cult”. That job was held by another dissociated self. Just as they were able to create a dissociated aspect of children for a job in the cult, they were able to create dissociated aspects to particiate in kiddie porn; be a courier of illegal items such as drugs, jewels; and, later in life, work in companies with sensitive information where a dissociated identity could copy files or relay information by phone or email.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes me think, it\'s possible our government puppet criminals are MK\'d. Is &quot;Skippy&quot; an alter? DarkMath loves to talk about the &quot;Boston accent&quot;; they say accents can be modified for specific alters.
It also makes me think of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_euND7Acs"> video &quot;I NO LUV&quot; from Heavy Breathing</a>. Creating pedophile alters? idk.</p>
<p>Another comment, written in June 2010<a href="https://faithallen.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/faith-allen%E2%80%99s-story-%E2%80%93-forced-to-%E2%80%9Ckill%E2%80%9D/"> in this other blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was the behavioral science race much like the space race. Many universities were involved and a lot of funding. The prize going to the scientist that could control a human being.</p>
<p>Dr. Cameron who was the president of both the International and US Association of Psychiatry did much work in Canada. Some victims have been compensated.</p>
<p>The concept of the part of the program I was involved in was that I would be a sleeper, in control of the cult in case I was needed by the US.</p>
<p>It was found that the cults had much more expertise in mind control than the behavioral scientist. The cults for a fee would supply children that were already traumatized. The more traumatized the better.</p>
<p>If the behavioral scientist determined that more trauma was needed than they would subcontract this to the cults.</p>
<p>The cults took methods from the behavioral scientists and it is reasonable to assume they are using those methods today.</p>
<p>MKULTRA is often referred to as experimental. By the 60’s it was operational. Most of their success was that they only took those children that tested very high in all areas. The program was highly competitively and if you could not preform you were dropped. This was called being thrown off the train and was not a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of what this comment gives us isn\'t anything you don\'t already know when researching MK, but it does confirm our suspicions that cults and pedo rings are involved in supplying and traumatizing children, and that the government protects the cults and rings in order to keep a supply of traumatized children for their mind control research and ....whatever sick shit rich people do for &quot;fun.&quot; </p>
<p>This also lends evidence to my theory that the &quot;rambling schizophrenic&quot; people you see in the streets are traumatized, some even from MK ULTRA possibly. I was once on a train and a rambling schizo lady was yelling at me for what sounded like a hallucination that I was having repeated abortions in front of her (?? yes i know) and telling me to &quot;close my legs then&quot; if I don\'t want them. It sounds like a ritual abuse flashback hallucination double whammy...poor fucking lady.</p>
<p>Lastly, it mentions that MK ULTRA has been  &quot;operational&quot; for a while now. Just think of how far they\'ve come in secret. Operational. Hence the need for steady flows of kids. Hence the relatively stable (in appearances at least) government people, who may be mk\'d CIA kids with blackmailable alters, bred for the purpose...etc etc. The rabbit hole is a fractal. </p>
<p>People are so arrogant. &quot;Where are the victims?&quot; they say smugly, as if the corporate owned media is going to spoonfeed them this too. Just a bit of searching brings me to unsettling numbers of survivors.</p>',

            You are on to something.  Good work!  I just posted a podcast from Kevin Annet of ITTCS.   His guest was a victim, and his story falls directly in line with all the other testimonials.
