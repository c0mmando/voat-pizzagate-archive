<p>Ben Sasse and the rest of the GOP elite claim Trump is a menace who must be stopped “on principle.” Sasse and others have criticized Trump for not disavowing racists quickly enough (even though Trump disavowed racists repeatedly). </p>
<p>Sasse has a bigger problem – he supported a pedophile. 
Some suspect he used his position of authority to enable abuse. </p>
<p>Ben Sasse was in charge of supervising underage boys, who were later abused by members of Congress. </p>
<p>Ben Sasse was a tutor in the Congressional page program from 1996 to 1998. The Congressional page program brings underage boys to Congress to run errands for Congressmen. These young boys would run errands for Congressmen, and often sexual relationships would develop between the underage boys and members of Congress. </p>
<p>The Congressional page program was shut down in 2011 after numerous sex scandals occurred, including the Mark Foley sex scandal.</p>
<p>Pedophiles like Dennis Hastert fought earlier efforts to close down the page program: </p>
<p>On October 2, 2006, Representative Ray LaHood (R-IL) called for the page program to be temporarily suspended. He stated that “this is a flawed program. The fact that a member of Congress is sending e-mails to a page and that he can get away with it [shows that] obviously there are problems.” Two more Representatives, Jon Porter (R-NV) and Kay Granger (R-TX) also supported LaHood’s recommendation to suspend the page program until an outside team could evaluate its security protocol. Dennis Hastert announced on October 5, 2006 that he was launching an investigation to evaluate and make improvements to the page program.[151] </p>
<p>Many suspected that the page program served as nothing more than a sex trafficking ring bringing pedophiles like Dennis Hastert naive young targets year after year. </p>
<p>Sasse has never disavowed Hastert, despite claiming that refusing to disavow is an admission of support.</p>
<p>One of Sasse’s supporters, Tom Delay, recently defended Hastert in court. Writing a letter to the judge asking for leniency, Delay wrote, “Hastert doesn’t deserve what he is going through.” </p>
<p>Tom Delay, who again is part of Sasse’s base of support, wrote a letter to a judge saying an admitted pedophile “doesn’t deserve what he is going through.”</p>
<p>All evidence and experience shows that pedophiles do not stop. Hastert has confessed to molesting multiple boys as a high school teacher. He was and is a child molester, and no doubt abuse congressional pages under Sasse’s watch. </p>
<p>Some may call that harsh, to which I reply: Where are the disavowals? </p>
<p>Sasse has refused to say a harsh word about pedophile Dennis Hastert. Meanwhile Tom Delay of #NeverTrump has said, “Dennis Hastert does not deserve what he is going through,” and Speaker Paul Ryan took hush money from Hastert for years. </p>
<p>If Sasse and the rest of #NeverTrump are going to demand that Trump disavow what his claimed supporters do, then it’s time to take a stand. </p>
<p>Disavow Hastert! </p>
<p>One might wonder if there’s a reason Sasse is being careful. He did work among underage boys himself. He ran the page program under Hastert’s watchful eye. </p>
<p>What did Sasse know and when did he know it?</p>',
