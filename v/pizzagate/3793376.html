             Yes, this proves that pizzagate is real in the same way as when I'm going out of my way to tell flat earthers that they're dumb proves that the earth is flat.

              You may as well go out and tell people that believe in God that God doesn't exist...over and over and over. Go on, do that. Stand outside the churches, mosques, temples and synagogues instead. But yet here you are, taking the time to post on a forum about Pizzagate. Why does it bother you so? Why is it so important to you that people believe what you think, huh?

               Because irrationality and obvious falsehoods bother me in general and pizzagate was the most absurdly irrational and stupid phenomenon that I've ever witnessed in my life.

               It isn't. This posts are mostly meant to ridicule and annoy you. I know you pizzagaters can't be reached by facts and reason.

                Well, as for point one, that depends on which line you followed regarding pizzagate. The media always fanned the flames of "Hillary Clinton has child sex slaves in the Comet pizza basement". I don't many here think that that is what has been going on, and if they do, they're obviously mistaken. But did it never make you think, not once, why this guy, Alefantis - the owner of two restaurants and a board member of an art gallery - was listed as one of DC's most powerful people? Does that not seem odd to you? Does it not seem odd how he ever got to take over Buck's in the first place when all he'd been before was a manager of another restaurant? Does it not seem odd that he's got multiple properties including another place in Berlin, and who knows how many others? I'll stop there, but there are many oddities and connections in this that don't justify immediate dismissal. Something was/is going on and maybe one day we'll find out exactly what, or maybe we won't. But if people want to investigate such things then that's their choice, not yours or mine or anyone elses.

                 Based on things like lies about "FBI discovered pedophile codewords" found in Podeta's e-mails, taking cherry picked instagram pictures out of context and interpreting them in deranged ways, distoring facts, photoshoping pictures etc. with no real evidence of a crime whatsoever,
                </p>
                <p>
                 Pizzagaters claimed that they uncovered the existence of an elite satanic child sex ring responsible for mass abducting raping and murdering children in places like the CPP pizzeria, involving Hillary, Obama, Podesta, Alefantis, CPP staff and bands that played there etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The fact that some pizzagaters, when pressed about it, they immediately backpedal and sweep under the rug all the absurd accusations for which people like Alefantis, CPP staff and bands that played there were threatened and harassed, and move the goal posts to make pizzagate just about child abuse in DC or in general, or just about a suspicion, shows the total lack of integrity of pizzagaters and the quality of "evidence" behind the pizzagate conspiracy theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No one can score a goal against you if when the ball is headed to your goalpost you simply keep moving it all over the place.
                </p>
                <p>
                 By doing that you simply admit that pizzagate is not real.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The "Executive Summary of Pizzagate Evidence" here states that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  "We have found considerable evidence that Comet is a front for child sex trafficking."
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Not that "We have found evidence that Alefantis is an odd individual", which isn't a crime by the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How does mentioning that Alefantis was present on a list from GQ magazine of 50 most powerful people in Washington which also includes people like baseball players, proves that he is raping and murdering children and that CPP is a front for child sex trafficking? It doesn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In regards to the things that people like Alefantis, Podesta, Marina Abramovic, CPP staff and bands that played there were threatened and harassed, every piece of pizzagate "evidence" is a non sequitur.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Based on the same backwards logic, I can make up an absurd conspiracy theory about Trump and his associates raping and murdering children inside the Trump Tower, call it Towergate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then I would cherry pick pictures like these:

                </p>
                <p>
                 Add in facts like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   He said that if Ivanka weren't his daughter perhaps he would be dating her; that he kisses her every chance he gets; that if he weren't happily married and "ya know, her father".
                  </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   He walked into the dressing room of beauty pageants while contestants some as young as 15 were changing. He even bragged about it.
                  </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   Has been accused of rape or attempted rape multiple times.
                  </p>
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 His connection with Epstein:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   Trump himself has said that Epstein is “a lot of fun to be with,” adding that he admired the sex offender's affinity for beautiful women “on the younger side.”
                  </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   Epstein admitted to knowing Trump under oath, and pleaded the fifth amendment when asked if he ever socialized with Trump in the presence of underage girls.
                  </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <p>
                   Both Trump and Epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an underage girl.
                  </p>
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 Gather all kinds of information like that, frame them to make Trump look as worse as possible, then use them as evidence that Towergate is real.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then I would follow the same non sequitur-esc pattern of thinking that pizzagate follows, because although those facts and cherry picked pictures framed like that make Trump look bad, they do not prove that Towergate is real in any way shape or form.
