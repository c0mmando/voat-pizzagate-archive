            I still haven't figured it out but keeping tabs on it. I don't think it will work for my macbook. I think I need to get a Linux system which is nervewracking to think about. I got links to getting a Bank of the Future account for my first foray into crypto-coin if I can do this. But when push comes to shove I will jump. Decentralized web will be the only Safe way to internetwork and what a trusted authority Nick &amp; co are!

            Aside from that privacy and security issue... With this database having children, perp and state; it seems to me forensic accounting is the big dig. How much did States give, how much did they get, and follow the money. There's Colorado, a wealthy State with 10's of thousands of children; Tennessee a poor State with a nominal number of kids. Then there's Arkansas with the mega Walmart financial momentum in the state, with more than miny miny miny. Whereas Maryland even fewer than Tennessee, a blue collar yet prosperous place. While Virginia which has so much diversity and government workers more like Alaska, off the charts numbers. This is a yuge money transfer, a subBlackmarket of government? An entire economy in and of itself if all charted. Somebody who knows Charles Ortel

            might ask him to recommend who would have time to map it. For volunteered time. I wonder if Catherine Austin Fitts knows about this banking.

             I have not looked into the data yet, but I am from a family with two sides of multigenerational serious abuse and neglect, with one side of my family approaching "elite" status. CPS was called to my home when I was growing up so many times I couldn't begin to count. They would contact the adults in my house well beforehand, tell them they were coming, and tell them what they would be looking for. This enabled the adults to "pass inspection" every time. It is clear that VA CPS does not want to find or help abuse victims. I couldn't tell you why.
            </p>
            <p>
             Periodically, there are news stories about this or that local CPS or similar child protective/adoptive service here unveiled with massive fraud and mismanagement. Kids dying on their watch, kids placed with sexual predators, etc. Again, I don't know why.

             &lt;-- This is probably the best place for information about missing and murdered people in VA. Warning- it's a deep, deep rabbit hole.

            Upvoating..some amazing stats in here..5% of total child population is abused..and those are just the ones on the radar.  50% of abusers are women.  50% of abuse on children 1 year or less...sad stuff...but great find.  I might also use these stats to do what Anon5 was discussing and map cases to hubs to distribution.  Interestingly some states do not do reporting thru CPS as you will see...also WHY is NCMEC not SCREAMING these numbers??? Staggering as they are and not including the murdered or unreported...5% of total population is an EPIDEMIC!

            Is there any way we can put this data into a website where we can create custom graphs and querys and then link them to other people?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also good work, big compiled datasets from reputable sources is how we can show and back up our claims leading to more potent blue pills.

            Also don't forget to backup the data too, as they will likely tighten up the backdoor

             This is terrible, yes, but it's also a useful statistic. According to the same reports, there are about 74 million children (under 18) in the U.S. Of these, about 58,100 were reported sexually abused. That's 0.8 per thousand, per year. That's your official, government-approved baseline of how often children are likely to be sexually abused.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, what we're trying to do, is spot anomalies. Here's one that I am quite interested in. There are about 430,000 kids in foster care in America right now (it varies a lot, the official estimate could be 500,000 next year, and that's a problem as we shall see). Some are with relatives, some are with non-related foster parents. The total number of cases of kids being abused in any way by a foster parent in 2015 was 1,424. That is 3.3 per thousand, or less if the total is 500,000. This is a little under one-third of the rate of reported abuse for kids in general. Sexual abuse by foster parents is not broken out separately. I've checked the numbers going back ten years, and these figures are actually somewhat lower than they were in 2005-2009 time period, but they have always been well below the national average.
            </p>
            <p>
             But guess what? Those numbers are pure crap. Sexual abuse by foster parents is a HUGE problem. See these links for details:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=6703">
              A legal resource center says sexual abuse in foster care is 4x national average.
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/somatic-psychology/201201/the-foster-care-system-and-its-victims-part-2">
              A Psychology Today study says the majority of kids in foster care are abused by their foster parents.
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/major-study-reveals-true-scale-of-abuse-of-children-living-in-care-9587244.html">
              The Independent reports similar problems in the UK
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The most important takeaway here is this: Despite all this independent evidence that there are major problems with foster abuse, these detailed official reports show nothing and SAY nothing about the issue, and so far as I can see, never have. Sexual abuse in foster care is not broken out separately. The total abuse numbers are absurdly low. We don't have good data for how many kids are in foster care to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
             So hats off, Psychanaut, you haven't just found a huge pile of data ... this is part of the cover-up.
