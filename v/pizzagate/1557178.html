            I think Hillary being implicated would be the smoking gun to get people to actually believe the WHOLE gov. Once she can be believed to be a part of it ANYONE can. However, I agree that until there's truly something damning on her that she is dead weight

            Someone tweeted or posted, (I saw if somewhere), about the fact that when the WhiteHouse changes hands, it will be time for "the night of the long knives". HRC or Podesta o someone will probably kill off all the underlings because they know that is all about to hit the fan. I really look for JA to turn states witness on the 18th or 19th. Look for a few people to turn witnesses then. thats my hope anyway!

            The only hope for pizzagate I think, is if there was something found by the NYPD on Anthony Weiner's computer about the Haitian trafficking and it can't be covered up. I think that's pretty flimsy though, because anything can be covered up. At this point, I think we need to go into damage control and make sure we don't allow ourselves to be painted as "fake news" by making false claims.

            Please calm down a little, and be patient. Its so Terrible people are retreating every way they can to turn off the truth, reality. This is a normal process to TRUTH, and very dark sick truth at that. People are waking up, its never at the speed we want or need, but the awakening is happening. Keep doing your research, dont burn yourself out, truth will make its way up...they are fighting with all the force they have.

            HRC herself doesn't have a lot to do with the Alefantis angle of this investigation, but the Clinton Foundation in general is highly relevant to what this is all about. I think that the media has been too focused on making the pizzagate narrative all about claims regarding "Hillary eating children at a pizza place" but I honestly haven't encountered anyone on here really pushing that angle. The real story the the trafficking as it relates to the Foundation, and potential blackmail and foreign influences that are connected.

             They push that fake narrative to alienate people and make the whole thing sound ridiculous. I think we should keep Hillary out of the conversation for a while until we get this whole Alefantis thing figured out.

            KEEP DOING WHAT YOUR DOING!
            <br/>
            Look, I was posting this shit on my facebook page when it first broke.
            <br/>
            I know my 800 friends thought I was a cuck.  I didnt and still dont care. 
So then I got to thinking.... how can I make this more real.
            <br/>
            How can I show friends that all of this is possible.... so I went on a search and I found a plethora of arrests and convictions of Government employees including police, military officers, judges, day care workers and so on..
           </p>
           <p>
            When you click on the scroll down 3rd paragraph from the bottom.
            <br/>
            <a href="http://data4justice.org/">
             http://data4justice.org/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I clicked on government officials (below) but there are more... 
then I took each name and INDIVIDUALLY posted 104 different times 104 different convicted TAXPAYER, GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I proceeded to copy, paste and post each individual person/conviction on my fb page.
            <br/>
            Every day, I post more past facts and cases and many are coming around now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Feed your other social media platforms with facts and statistics along with the above. 
Some are really, really bad, such as parents have sex with their toddler and filming it to sell. etc...  I posted graphic warnings too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a suggestion.  Don't let them get to you.

            The moment they took reddit from us was the time they killed the meme-magic potential. If

            YES. Someone has to speak for these children, because obviously the pedophiles have

            We already know what we know (especially my generation of 45+ yrs old) who look at life from outside the programmed box.
           </p>
           <p>
            What most people are waiting for now is validation from authorities and that........won't happen!! It will never be served on a silver platter like the everyday scuttlebutt of the Kardashians and likes.

            Truth is never told.
 It can ONLY be realized!

            I understand your frustration, but if you start yelling this before we get solid leads you'll discredit yourself and the movement. What you can do is plant doubt in their minds with questions like "why does the saudi's own all properties surrounding the park? What is the Pegasus museum? Etc" Plant the seed and people will naturally be curious.

             We have an entire sticky full of solid leads. Law enforcement in any other similar case would have sprung to attention a long time ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hell, Scotland Yard asked the public to look out for and report on people resembling the e-fits. Well we did and we found a striking resemblance to someone who has proven contacts in the area and no proof of whereabouts at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing. Do not rely on 'solid leads' or law enforcement acting on them. They haven't and likely won't. Because the people who decide have known this for a long long time.

            Get celebrities to tweet videos about it by telling them it's for supporting a charity for child victims of trafficking, just don't put pizzgate anywhere, celebrities will endorse/tweet anything if they think it makes them look good. If you tweet enough celebrities asking them to retweet this video about how to help victims of child trafficking, some will retweet it to millions of people, and if people watch it, it will hopefully be the best and most convincing film about pizza gate, without mentioning the word Pizzagate until the very end, when they are shocked and crying at the horrible truth, and it will remind them how much they've been lied to.

            You have to trick people into it. I was tricked into watching Loose Change the 9/11 conspiracy film, because it was disguised as an episode of something I'd downloaded. It had a really gripping start to it though, so I actually watched it all the way through. Basically, you need a way of getting the evidence in front of people, because they haven't seen it yet, they still think it's just some instagram pictures and code words. So it's about finding the best way to get their eyes on that by whatever means necessary.

             Hollywood can be red-pilled I believe. I came across his article yesterday. In it, it says Hollywood actors are doing their own investigating to try to reveal which A-lister raped Corey Haim.

             If we're gonna throw this out to celebrities, we should probably do it in the next 2 hrs or so. Today is #HumanTrafickingAwareness day. If you click on the hashtag on twitter, of course there's no mention of Pizzagate. There
             <em>
              is
             </em>
             a guy talking about the Podesta brothers. We shouldn't mention Pizzagate by name.

               Yes, but it has Pizzagate in the title.  I think an ideal one would be a video that drops a bunch of truth bombs, but was a little more innocuous on the surface.

             Probably photoshop. Get some upset looking mothers and slap some official looking text on them. Quickest way to make it a thing is with a Twitter hashtag. #MAP #MothersAgainstPedophilia

               I suggest making a thread where you ask people to 
1. create 5 dummy accounts on twitter. Make the usernames and bios as real people who are committed to stopping child abuse
2. Post some of these infographics, with a dramatic text saying "child sex trafficking out of control, we need to take action right now! Pls RT"  or whatever
Also if you are reading this please archive these links i dont know how to do it.

                 Follow prominent human rights activists Retweet them first over a few days, hold your fire. Then tweet at them and ask for retweets. Ask them direct questions so they have to reply "This is shocking and awful - you are the expert, what do you think of this info? #stopchildabuse "

               Tweet at these people and say you are concerned about the welfare of children, ask for their help in getting this investigated by law enforcement
              </p>
              <p>
               Other activities
              </p>
              <p>
               We should also be emailing the organisations who care about this and start to bring their attention to it. This has been a citizen investigation and we must enlist more citizens. Remember that a brownstone operation only needs 6-8 members in order to dominate an entire organization. It is only a very small percentage. Most people are good and honest and true, certainly when it comes to this kind of depravity. They are right there and want to help, they just don't know. Not yet. So reach out to organizations and ask politely if they have seen this, you are disturbed by it and felt a responsibility to bring their attention to it and ask what they think is going on here.
              </p>
              <p>
               Contact child welfare and protection organizations:

            There is no proof that Podesta is a pedophile besides the strange codes in the emails. Publicizing that he is a pedophile with no proof would confirm Pizzagate as fake news. Same with Alefantis' instagram pics. Stick to the truth people!

             I'd say using known code words for pedophilia and being connected to a shady pizza joint that is even more embedded with proof of links to a pedo trafficking organization is enough to call him a pedophile.

              I would still use "suspected" or "alleged". Because it's all just circumstantial and conjecture at this point.

                Except it's worth so much money and most of it can be justified artistically. The stuff that he collects is what sells and worth $$$. It's not proof that he's a pedophile. Is someone who owns a Disney dvd a pedophile? Because some of that stuff is just as creepy. My point is if pedophilia is in all of culture, how can it be proof of anything but the culture?

                  Wow, it's disturbing art that probably sells for millions of dollars a piece. Put that in context. Is it Satanic, pedophillic? Maybe. Is it art that is taken seriously in the art world? Apparently it is.

             I'm fully with you that Podesta and co are involved in nefarious shit, but that Hotard pic has to be retired. It's been established now that Jimmy Comet was more than likely directing that comment at
