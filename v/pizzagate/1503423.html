<p>As you may remember, many were wondering if what he uncovered was genuine, or a false lead...</p>
<p>I myself had been unsure about the authenticity of his leaks..</p>
<p>Well, today i was watching a video, explaining how pizzagate researchers were being threatened. And, at one point in the video I had noticed that one of the people in the video had received a threat from a person named Sye Phan....</p>
<p>I thought that was VERY strange, but i also thought maybe it was just someone using his name..</p>
<p>So i tried to leave a comment on the video explaining pretty much what i said in this post..in less words of course.</p>
<p>But first...</p>
<p>Let me rewind a bit..the past week i have noticed alot of my youtube comments have been getting censored from the public view whenever I try to speak on something, or someone who I feel is important, or relevant to pizzagate...or satanism..or pedo circles. Basically it feels like i\'m being monitored...by someone. Sounds crazy, i know...</p>
<p>I\'ve learned that I have to sign out of my account after EACH post, then go back to the video to see if my comment is visible to the public. 
I\'ve noticed that the only posts that seem to make it though, are the ones where i don\'t really say anything remotely important.</p>
<p>Now... This morning when i saw Sye\'s name in the video, I just had to leave a comment telling them about this. 
I basically said that Sye Phan was the hacker who hacked the members only section and, and it was strange how they received a threat from them..but maybe it is because Sye is actually not working for us? </p>
<p>Sure enough it was censored from public view, multiples times, even when i tried to word it differently..I even tried typing a few random comments to see if maybe ALL my comments were getting censored...but they went through just fine. The only comments it wont let me post are the ones regarding Sye being a disinfo agent...</p>
<p>Also it should be noted that whenever i try to post a link to this video in a comment, it also gets censored everytime</p>

<p>Not entirely sure what to make of this...but i thought it was worth sharing</p>',
