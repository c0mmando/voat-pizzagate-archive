            , Why then hasn't he emailed me back, why then can't you provide proof. It seems easy enough for him to come on here and post one comment. I WON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING UNTIL THERE'S PROOF. That simple. I downloaded his whole site. I'm not a shill far from it, but I'm not believing a screenshot. Especially considering after his three website removals ALL of the archives were deleted.

            NOPE, don't believe you. Especially, MK mod who supports pedophiles. No link to what site this was from, just a screenshot that could of been photoshopped. Why did it all take you se long to post this, he people were asking for a month? He says he's getting back into the swing of thing, yet bo sign in a month still. Why the redacted portion on a screenshot. PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS SHIT. It isn't proof.

            . MF posted it for me because I was varnishing a boat and only had my phone with me. He also said the domain registration lapsed. I invited him to come to the threads talking about this and get whatever help he needed from us all, but he so far has not done so.

             Weird. I think he was threatened. First off, this isn't proof to me. He hasn't written back to me via email, yet MK posts a screenshot that could easily be photoshopped, with a resacted portion. This isn't proof, and this was a month ago. If he says he is getting back into the SWING of THINGS, why hasn't he? Why let his domain name LAPSE, when he frequented this place and posted in steemit all the time. His wiki website was up for like 6 months, and he just decides, whatever. Not believeable.

              He didn't decide "whatever". His personal life blew up -- including financial issues -- and he has temporarily lost the ability to renew the domain registration until he gets everything settled. I can't post all that, because it was personal info. Believe it or don't if you don't want to birthdaysuit11, but why the hell would I lie? Right before his stuff blew up, I invited him to help the mod team by being our Developer, which he was interested in doing. Then the crap hit the fan for him. I very much hope he will be back, but honestly, if I had too much real life crap on my plate I probably wouldn't answer these concern-trolling comment pings, either. Why would you believe him if he got on here and said exactly what I've told you? You wouldn't. You'd say "he's being silenced." He can't win.
