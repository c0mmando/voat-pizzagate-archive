            Evil is embodied in real, individual, totally sinful beings, spiritual beings who hate humanity and hate God.  Evil was not created, but resulted from the free will of these created beings. The expression of that manifests as evil as we see it in the world, but it also is a spiritual reality and men who cease to recognize the influence of spiritual evil can become like spiritual zombies, wandering in states of blind consumption, existing in perpetual pursuit of satisfying obsessive appetites.
           </p>
           <p>
            Orthodox Christianity view on Evil.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "The greatest of all satanic deception is that he does not exist and therefore there is no evil or hell or sin or spiritual death."
            </p>
            <p>
             It is imperative to understand that without this recognition--and still more-the experience of this reality of the cosmic spiritual struggle (God and Satan, the good Angels and the evil angels), one cannot truly be called an Orthodox Christian who sees and lives according to the deepest realities of life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once again, however, it must be clearly noted that the devil is not a "red-suited being" nor any other type of grossly-physical tempter. He is a subtle, intelligent spirit who acts mostly by deceit and hidden actions, having as his greatest victory man's disbelief (atheism, skepticism, denial, rationalism etc.) in his existence and power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thus, the devil attacks "head-on" only those whom he can deceive in no other way: Jesus and the greatest of the Saints. For the greatest part of his warfare he is only too satisfied to remain concealed and to act by indirect methods and means.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            "For Christians above all men are forbidden to correct the stumblings of sinners by force...it is necessary to make a man better not by force but by persuasion. We neither have authority granted us by law to restrain sinners, nor, if it were, should we know how to use it, since God gives the crown to those who are kept from evil, not by force, but by choice." St. John Chrysostom (347-407)
           </p>
           <p>
            The human condition as we know it, demonstrates the presence of a barrier between God and humanity.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Eastern Orthodox belief shares the western idea of original sin. In the Orthodox view, all of creation, living and dead, visible and invisible, is holistically connected. What affects one creature affects all creatures. Therefore, the suffering and mortality imposed on Adam and Eve as punishment for their sin is shared by all of creation.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, the
             <strong>
              Orthodox tradition does not share the Augustinian idea of original guilt
             </strong>
             . While all of creation suffers the consequences of the first humans' sin, (Many Christians believe the account literally, while Eastern Orthodoxy interprets it symbolically, meaning that while it did not literally happen, it is full of religious truth), no other creature is guilty of that sin.
            </p>
            <p>
             All share, however, in the legacy of the fall from paradise. We all suffer disease and death, and we are all compelled by our own wills and desires, rather than God's. But we don't inherit Adam's guilt. So, for example, the Orthodox tradition does not teach that unbaptized infants will be sent to eternal fire and damnation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that nothing is greater than God, including evil.
            </p>

              I believe that is from the controversial Latin Vulgate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't have to get into it but here's a brief comment I found to that question..
             </p>
             <p>
              Dear Edward,
             </p>
             <p>
              Just to clarify the linguistic side of the issue. The Hebrew word "Ra" has quite a number of meanings in the Bible, according to BDB Biblical Hebrew Dictionary:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               evil (Gn.6.5)
              </li>
              <li>
               unpleasant, giving pain, misery (like in Gn.47.9 "days of trial and hardship", or Pr.15.15)
              </li>
              <li>
               distess, misery, calamity (Nu.11.1, Ex.5.19, Gn.48,16)
              </li>
              <li>
               sad, unhappy (Pr.25.20)
              </li>
              <li>
               vicious, unkind (Pr.26.23)
              </li>
              <li>
               wicked (Ec.12.14) 
etc., etc
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              So the translation of Isaiah 45:7 really depends on exegesis and, like Fr. Raphael said, should be based on the Church tradition of interpretation of the Scriptures. Traditionally in the Eastern Church it was interpreted as "calamity" (this is how it was translated in Russian Sinodal Translation of the Bible). Interesting to note that the Latin Vulgate translation as "evil" later caused a Catholic theologian Meister Eckhart to claim that God is indeed the creator of evil, and this was one of his erroneous claims for which he was pronounced a heretic by Roman Pontificat.

              In Christ,

               It's the KJV translation of the Masoretic. The variation you've shown from the BDB is due in part to the fact that Hebrew doesn't translate well into English and in part from the doctrinal bias of the translators. Exegesis shouldn't introduce arbitrary differences in translation like that. Tradition is not a valid basis for exegesis because it's typically an expression of the appeal to authority fallacy. Meister Eckhart was right, the Roman concept of God can't account for the sometimes adversarial nature of deity or the older text which supports the KJV translation.

                  This is an Orthodox Christian article on the topic of English translations of the Bible for anyone interested in reading it.

                  A couple excerpts to your point:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   The Hebrew Text that has served as the basis for most translations of the Old Testament into English is based almost entirely on the Leningrad Codex, which dates from 1008 A.D. In comparison to the textual evidence that we have for the New Testament Greek text, this is a very late manuscript. It is an example of the Masoretic recension which is usually dated to have been shaped between the 6th and 10th centuries A.D. This is well after the Septuagint was translated (3rd century before Christ), the Peshitta (1st and 2nd Centuries A.D.), or the Vulgate (4th Century A.D.). According to Christian tradition, the non-Christian Jews began making changes in the Old Testament text to undercut the Christian use of Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming of Christ. In any case, the Hebrew Text that we now have was preserved outside the Church. The Septuagint and Peshitta texts were preserved within the Church, and so the Church believes that the text of the Old Testament was been authoritatively preserved in these textual traditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Furthermore, it is clear that the text that Christ and the Apostles used matches the Septuagint rather than the Masoretic text...
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  They had this to say regarding KJV:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   The most accurate translations available in English are the King James (or Authorized) Version (KJV or AV), the New King James Version (NKJV), and The English Standard Version (ESV), and to a lesser extent the Revised Standard Version (RSV), and the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)—though all but the first two have problems that will be discussed under the other factors that we must consider. The King James is in fact generally so accurate that one could reconstruct the original text with a high degree of accuracy by translating the text back into Hebrew and Greek, though unlike many translations that are so woodenly literal they actually distort the meaning of the text, it is also a beautiful translation.
                  </p>

                   The oldest known copy of Isaiah is from the Dead Sea Scrolls, and it has the same phrase describing the creation of evil as the Masoretic does.

            Evil is the opposite of peace, evil creates war and imbalance. At an individual level evil is associated with narcissism, a self focus which prevents someone from considering the adverse effects of their actions or from empathizing with someone who suffers because of their selfishness. Taken to its extreme, evil inflicts suffering on the innocent without remorse. Collectively, evil is expressed as empire, as the expression of domination, exploitation, and oppression.

               Dead-on. Jews place material possessions and earthly things above all else. And they want to brainwash the masses to do the same thing. They're doing quite a good job of it, too.
              </p>
              <p>
               But always remember, kids, if you say anything bad about the Jews, ever, you're worse than Hitler and Goebbels combined.
