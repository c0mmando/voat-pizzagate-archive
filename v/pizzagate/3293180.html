            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Sheriff Paul Babeu, of Pinal County, AZ, is one of the most recognized faces of American anti-immigration sentiment. He's been a FOX News regular. He appeared in a John McCain campaign ad calling for a border fence. In January, Babeu announced his run for the United States Congress in a macho press release headed "It's Time For a New Sheriff In Washington," in which he decried the "400,000 illegal crossings into our state every year."
              <strong>
               Well. According to a story broken this week in the Phoenix New Times, Babeu spent much of the last decade in a long-term gay relationship with an undocumented immigrant named Jose, whom Babeu threatened with deportation after their relationship ended.
              </strong>
              From The Phoenix New Times::
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               He says [Babeu's] lawyer Chris DeRose demanded he sign an agreement that he would never breathe a word about the affair. But Jose (New Times is withholding his last name because Babeu and his attorney have challenged his legal status) refused.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The 34-year-old from central Mexico charges that the sheriff's lawyer warned against mentioning the affair with Babeu. DeRose said gossip about Babeu would focus attention on Jose, attention that could result in his deportation, Jose says.
            </p>
            <p>
             .&gt;&gt;.. Babeu didn't respond to requests for comment by publication time for this article, but his attorney, DeRose, says the dispute between Jose and the sheriff concerned Jose's work on Babeu's websites. He says Jose was a former volunteer who hacked into a campaign website.

            Hi gamepwn. Are you saying the two of them were bringing kids to the restaurant to be abused by other people? Do we have anything to support this theory? I am happy to leave this up for 24 Hours,  to see if anyone can dig up additional evidence of some connection to a ring. Otherwise, we will have to remove per Rule 1.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if the guy has been tried yet, and whether the trail documents are available?

             That's what I believe yes, just suspicious all the way around. I spoke with someone from Orlando and that Chick-Fil-A actually had shut down and been remodeled and there has been talk it was because of the PR nightmare. I appreciate that at least.

              He's being a faggot. Just search the daycare and look for pics of spirals and other obvious shit.
              <br/>
              This guy's clearly an optics cuck. If it don't got spirals he'll flake on systemic on-going organized abuse in daycare being somehow unimportant, and not being supporting evidence of a (((culture))) of non-enforcement of regulations surround childcare.

             Hang in there. Slowly but surely they are finally being locked away, however with transgenderism and spiderman shit type on youtube, I would guess that they are manufacturing them as quick as we can swipe them up. Have faith, it is too unnatural an in godly to survive.

             <p>
              I've been preparing for years, was given several dreams &amp; visions of what's coming starting around 2000. I imagine that's why I'm just mentally worn out because I've been watching &amp; expecting what's coming for a long time &amp; that has been a HEAVY burden. It became even heavier with the birth &amp; adoption of my granddaughter because now I have another pony in the race to sweat about.... have almost everything my family will need but still working on the 55gal drums. Thanks for the advice

              This is the most under rated advice.  White people are better than other races because we used to prepare for the unknown.  We took our futures into our own hands and built up stires for survival and celebrated the harvest seasons, etc.  Now we have too much convenience and have lost that which makes us who we are.  Dont get caught fighting over a poptart in walmart when the shit hits the fan, BE PREPARED!

               White AMERICANS are better because AMERICANS come from people that left the old world to find a harder life that was free, unlike most immigrants after the 50s who came to find an easier life.

               Im a mutt brother, colonials on the brown and white side, but its the tribals and European thinking thats fucking up america. I know the jungle pygmygs have been coming up in droves, but there are a lot of us brown Americans that were just colonials who settled in sunny lands.

               You'd enjoy alexis de'tocqueville. 1840s french philosopher that coined "american exceptionalism". He was a contemporary of marx, (like within 5 years) and he identifies the same shit as marx, but shows that American thinking is what solves those issues.
