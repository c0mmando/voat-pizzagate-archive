            I agree with you.  I never thought the street preachers were paid protesters.  I think I've seen this group in my town before, same kind of signs and a loudspeaker.  It was annoying that they gave them ammo by harping on the gay subject the nights before.  Last night the preachers predominately talked about pedophilia though.  The reaction of the crowd was incredibly strange.  Pay attention to their reactions....That's not how normal people act when accused of pedophilia.

            I also think Comet had some LGBT protesters come out there.  They're trying to flip this to be a gay rights thing and it's going to backfire on them eventually.  I do wish everyone would've been quiet and left Comet alone until the investigation was finished.  I try not to worry about the media anymore.  We can't control them and they are going to spin stories regardless of what we do or don't do.

            Very likely, FBI and CIA have a history of infiltrating groups and leading them to sabotage themselves, Donald degrees, militia groups, I'd be certain BLM was infiltrated if not just created entirely

            Yeah, no. Not sure who is backing the idiots outside CP, but there's nothing to protest. We're involved in presenting evidence, collecting evidence, and disseminating evidence that will cause authorities to move and investigate. That's the end game. That the rightful, lawful agencies and officiating bodies take over the investigation and see what is really going on. If they find wrongdoing, they will bring the appropriate charges. Since there are no charges and no official investigation that I know of (yeah, I know David Seaman got that tip, but I don't personally know that's true), JA is innocent and free to run his business. I do recognize that that business had a seamy private section that no one can apparently decipher, but that's why there are authorities. They'll have the magic key to demand he turn over the evidence. No protests. It would only make us look desperate. Might as well have a Snowflake March in Washington if we're going to do that.

             A lot of groups have collected, presented and disseminated evidence for decades to no avail.  9/11 researchers come to mind.  They all had high hopes of causing authorities to investigate.  Unfortunately, with 9/11 and this case, the perpetrators and authorities are too closely linked to ever hope for a real investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only solution as I see it is to attack the funding that supports this kind of behavior.  And to publicly shame people or groups that engage in or support these activities.  Think about it...there are several publications that have lauded the artwork in Mr. Podesta's house.  These are people that went in looked it over and said 'my audience would love to see this and hear about how great it is'.  These publications have advertiser's/funders.  These funder's said: i like what your doing, here's some money; put my companies name on it.  These companies should have known better and need to be held responsible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember those cakes that looked almost identical to dead female bodies.  Remember celebs cutting into them and eating?  Those cakes were made with the help of Dunkin' Donuts and Kool Aide.  Dunkin' Donuts and Kool Aide thought....this seems cool.   Please put our names on this.  They should have thought...we have a great name....let's be careful what we support.  Actor's and celebs in attendance should have looked around and said...I have a good image...maybe I shouldn't be seen at an event like this.  Instead they smiled for pictures.  These actors all have projects, with more sponsors.  They should hear that we do not support this.
            </p>
            <p>
             The money is the only thing that matters to these people.  Reputations don't even matter any more.  Going after the funding is the true endgame.

              9/11 didn't have an email dump. And we still don't know what evidence is being withheld by Assange.

              What you're talking about is a long-range strategy, but I haven't given up hope on this working. This is a unique case, so don't bring up other cases to compare. Take Elizabeth Smart. The dad didn't go, "You know ... children being kidnapped have a zero chance of being returned so I'm going to go by statistics and figure she's dead." No, he had a sketch made, hired a GOOD private detective, and FORCED the police to take action. Think that police force isn't run by pedos? I mean, come on!!! Even with the photo, an eyewitness sighting, and proof of where this Emmanuel was, the police refused to even ASK Emmanuel some questions. Really? That should be looked into and people fired left and right.

               I agree and that is exactly my point.  No one will look into it.  No one will get fired.

               I feel our movement losing steam, instead of gaining it.  I don't see any good coming from this.  I actually see only negatives: more money and power for those involved, more censorship and worse of all abuse will continue to happen to children as these groups go back underground.
              </p>
              <p>
               With all of that said, I hope I am wrong.  But from experience I am afraid I won't be. I hope that something happens...it was sad seeing the periscope footage from Comet and seeing just how packed that place still is.  I would love to see him go out of business.  I would love to see those who are guilty brought to justice.

                No, the movement is not losing steam, definitely not. As for it being packed, really, if this had happened a couple of years ago, I doubt I would have believed it. I just wouldn't. I wouldn't have read the Wikileaks memos. I would have let them be interpreted by the propagandist news and everything would have been different. So just dig, dig, dig and control what you can. Lots of people are getting in on this and Alefantis is cracking. Him going after Ryan was really telling so let's put up the good fight.

            That is what they want. I'm really convinced of that. They are trying to provoke us to join their shitshow. Some have even come here to push a protest idea, imo.
            <br/>
            Just, leave comet alone. A protest would accomplish nothing. It would be, "oh, that poor man, those conspiracy assholes won't leave him alone." Even if we had all the best intentions and persuasive info in the word, people would remember "the shooting," and see it as further proof that "fake news is dangerous."

             Agreed, discretion is the better part of valor.  We get loud, protest, etc. it doesn't matter our intention.  We won't be able to control the narrative once a story like that breaks.  I say continue to collect data, push the argument that there are things worth investigating, and continue to strive for presenting legitimacy and credibility surrounding the larger issues.  We should think about how we post titles and words like 'proven' 'smoking gun' 'confirmed' and so on through the eyes of a skeptic coming to see what all the fuss is about.  We already know we're on to something important.  We want others to consider that as well.
