I tried searching Epsteins flight logs to see if there were any references to C.N or Jim Buckmaster, so far nothing, but not finished looking. I can\'t remember if Podesta made any mention of a Craig (I think i remember him referencing the name - can\'t remember), or Buckmaster. If you remember, there was a significant uprising with the Craigslist Killer and protitution going on openly through the Craigslist pages, and they simply renamed the page, and then ultimately shut it down, but I believe they privatized the page and made it membership. I have to research the page more carefully. This is all speculation for now...I\'m looking for that smoking gun that ties him in. But I\'m convinced Craigslist is the facilitator.</p>',
