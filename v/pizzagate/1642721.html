<p>The relevance of this thread to Pizzagate is to discuss how the investigation will continue after arrests start happening. Here are some thoughts. Hopefully, this discussion will help better prepare us on how to continue forward once elite pedos start getting rounded up.</p>
<p>I\'m making (a lot) assumptions here that most/all of the primary suspects (HRC, WJC, TP, JP, JA, CS etc.) will be arrested on corruption, human trafficking, and other heinous charges. I wouldn\'t hold your breath for murder unless there are snuff films on Weiner\'s computer with identifiable suspects.</p>
<p>If/when the hard left/MSM/NWO goes bananas, which I think they will, we may see a lot of things happen:</p>
<pre><code>Attack us and Voat directly. Anyone associated with Pizzagate, especially here on this sub, may become targeted online and/or in real life. Be prepared - maintain good OPSEC; archive and backup research; don\'t let your guard down; be careful (Alefantis Freaks Out: [https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1541627))](https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1541627)))

The MSM is going to pretend nothing is happening at first, then they will do a massive, and I mean MASSIVE, disinformation game. I would expect to see all sorts of false flags, fake news, and wild accusatory stories not pertaining to Pizzagate. As it stands right now watching Fox vs. CNN/MSNBC/etc. is like watching alternate reality : (

Retribution against conservatives, or those vocal about Pizzagate will become more common. Be prepared for this, as I have seen it happen. If you work with (Orig. lefties/liberals) anti-Pizzagateers (for lack of a better term), be very careful about engaging in even an innocuous water cooler conversation about this topic. Mark my word - they will go after you if you are vociferous. Stay on the DL for a while.

Be prepared for full on freakouts from &lt;s&gt;the left&lt;/s&gt; many of the vociferous public, seen daily on television. And don\'t forget, family, friends, and coworkers may &quot;come out of the closet&quot; on this issue as well - no one is exempt.  While most may be laughable, some may be far more violent. Stay alert and look for warning signs. (Orig. Liberal) Non-Trump supporters freakout: [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/liberals-on-the-edge-of-a-nervous-breakdown-214727);;)](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/liberals-on-the-edge-of-a-nervous-breakdown-214727);;))

Suicide/Depression - I\'m going out on a limb here, but it won\'t surprise me one bit to see &quot;mini-Jonestown&quot; suicides occur (Google &quot;koolaid jonestown&quot; if you don\'t know what I\'m talking about). With regards to depression, neither right or left have the market cornered, but I do believe it is more prevalent in those on the left (this is what happens when emotions rule your thought process). If what happens the way I think it will, there are going to be people who have no coping skills and cannot wrap their heads around what is actually Pizzagate. If this is someone close, provide moral support for those with hope. (Orig. If it is a lefty, just give them a throwaway .38 (just kidding)). Seriously though, this may be a serious issue, especially if my suspicions regarding mass MK-type programming through media are true.

The last gasp to hang on by the left may come in the form of well-funded, persistent civil unrest. Obviously this presents quite a problem if you have to go in and out of the city for work. Or, if you are in a highly suburban area - i.e. Ferguson. There certainly isn\'t much one can do to avoid this, but be prepared to protect and take care of family and self. If you are in an area which may be subject to civil unrest, or random violence: stock water, food, cash, batteries, fire extinguishers, medical, etc. I\'m not getting into a prepping lesson here - most are smart enough to figure it out. And I\'ll leave the topic of self-defense for another day.

<p>Edit 2: Based on comments that I attempted to make this a left/right issue, that was not my intent. My intent was to underscore certain facts I have ascertained over many, many years of analysis:</p>
<pre><code>All of the civil unrest in today\'s cities is being caused by the radical left;
All publicized &quot;Freakouts&quot; of personalities like Madonna, Judd, etc., etc. are all by leftists;
The bulk of mass shootings are inexplicably tied to...get this, those on the left;
To the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any PG actors who associate with the right, other than the (so far) tenuous allegations of Bush and Kissinger. And if they are implicated - GOOD.

            Thanks, it a nice scenario and I hope it comes true quite soon. 
I fear that it could must probably get lethally ugly, these people are the creatures who control us all and will do anything to keep their deeds in the dark. I hope and pray that quite soon that which was hidden will be bought to light, it will turn the world upside down and inside out, that's for sure.

            What seems to be the case is that Flynn talked to a Russian diplomat and made it clear that Trump was not going to continue Obama's hostility. Until the NSA shows PROOF of Russia hacking, I don't believe that it ever happened. You have proof in the Podesta emails of business with Russia, through the company "Joule" and the transfer of uranium mining rights (movie Clinton Cash), so actually, there is more evidence of an improper Russia relationship with Podesta and Clintons, than with Trump.

            Sorry for the formatting.  I tried to fix it.  No joy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am trying to be so open-minded about this topic - the left/right thing.  I've been involved in politically charged environments for a long time and I have a very well-entrenched opinion which I can back with facts.  Unfortunately, most of it needs to be kept within my household 90% of the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of us on the right feel especially pissed and vindictive towards those from the hard left (which now includes CNN) and the vile attacks we have withstood for well over a decade in every way shape and form.  You may want to try and understand how many of us view those on the left and try and be more empathetic to our viewpoints and try not to get so bent out of shape when someone makes a partisan comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, my partner was very hard left when we met and has since become 95% politically aligned with my views after a decade+ of being with me. So please don't accuse me of living in an echo chamber.

            I'm a bit confused how Trump's admin is super cozy with Russia other than that Obama was overtly working to antagonize Russia into a war just prior to leaving office and Trump (through Flynn) diverted this. These same agencies never provided clear cut evidence of Russia hacking in spite of having the capability to do so, and the alleged dossier smacks of being fabricated a little too convenient and a lot too late (why was this not release during the campaigning?). Clearly the syria/turkey/russia situation is ongoing but that doesn't implicate Trump meddling. Trump hasn't been directing foreign policy.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anything, the only logical conclusion about what is going on is that the intelligence agencies are working to hide and suppress evidence and information that proves Obama, Clinton, or their own wrongdoing, otherwise why not share the information. They claim that Trump is too dangerous to trust with intelligence, but really, who is that danger for???  Trump has already shown that he doesn't want war (with Russia at least) and massively criticized Bush and HRC for the Iraq war so claiming that Trump is dangerous seems unfounded. I'm not saying I like Trump yet, but really, how many times did Clapper lie to congress?

            It is obviously lost on you that I modified my position. I opted to maintain journalistic and investigative integrity, by leaving in the original post comments in parentheses.
           </p>
           <p>
            So to be clear, you are attacking me based on a retracted position?

            So if the NSA and related defense/security intelligence agencies refuse to provide intelligence to the executive office (which is the commander in chief of the military after all) how can they justify their existence? And what are they doing? They are basically announcing that they are operating rouge? How isn't this treason? Shouldn't congress be cutting off their funding? What am I missing here? If they can't do their job in good conscience, isn't the protocol to quit?

             The people who fall for larpers are doing it for the rush of paranoia, not for the truth.

            <p>
             If you want the truth, you use logic. You don't just go for the most fantastical possibility every time. I think it's drug use or some kind of mental illness that makes people believe whatever theory or rumor titillates them without questioning it.

             What about Robert Boyce of the NYPD? He saw the emails on Podesta's laptop and said there's evidence of human trafficking, money laundering etc etc. Boyce confirmed pretty much everything that's been discussed here.

              I think it's far more complicated to bring down one powerful, well connected person than any of us imagine. And far more complicated and difficult than that to bring down an entire system.
