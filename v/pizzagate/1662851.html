            I have been so disturbed by the Milo character assassination - I don't know if he meant that he has been abusing young teens, or if he is only referencing his own abuse, but I am sad that we are losing a valuable asset in our fight. I know the press conference is at 3:00, but I think there is only one way he can further the movement and redeem himself: he must "turn himself in." If he offers himself up to a full investigation, and demands an investigation of anyone else accused of pedophilia, he can dramatically shed a lot of light on our cause. If he has nothing to hide, AND knows the names of those who do, then he could become our number 1 martyr. His gig at Breitbart has to end, his book deal is squashed; he has nothing to lose. This is the Hail Mary we've been looking for.

            As a victim of sexual abuse, I can say that many things become disorganized in the mind.  Most people can't and don't fully explain, but TL;DR is clear that ANY abuse victim can have conflicting love/hate relationship with abuser.
           </p>
           <p>
            With a young, gay person,  who may have experienced rejection from other sources...an older male who pays attention to him would be attractive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Milo was very inarticulate but he was really talking about his own experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has also pretty well clarified in apology that had mistakenly believed his experience as a victim, combined with his platform would allow him to say outrageous things on that subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have had hundreds of hours of therapy, partly on sexual abuse.  Each victim is encouraged to talk about their abuse...if the public were to hear many of those things from a normal victim, they would both cry and applaud.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have not experienced sexual abuse,  you cannot possibly understand.  If you have been a victim and fail to understand, you have not admitted the full truth about WHY sexual abuse is so damaging.  How it changes your brain and damages your soul.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why sexual conditioning is part of mind control.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is actually an opportunity here for every victim if we can find the right angle.  The left, full of SJW psychologists, queers, and other damaged people, has not even considered the 13 year old boy who was a victim.  That is normally called victim blaming but in child sexual abuse, they have a long history of protecting predators.

            And Milo gets "activated" and he is british so his job would be to deflect from the british Tavistock fuckers.  I wouldnt doubt if Milo came from a test tube at a Tavistock institute.

            Milo's Facebook post corrected their record for me, gallows humor is a common way to cope for survivors. If you joke about it, you make it your bitch.  I know from personal experience. My sense of humor is fucking dark.  Now, imagine you were molested by a pedophile as a child, and then CALLED one as an adult.  Investigate him, by all means, but as far as I know he's helped put away 3 pedos, and been accused 0 times.

            Nothing we can do really, but continue the research and don't focus on one person. MSM doesn't care about pedos or sex trafficking unless it fits their agenda. We took notice on all the traffick busts meanwhile the media was silent. Trump signed an EO fighting against the cartels and that included sex trafficking. Media was silent on the order mostly. This current witchhunt will backfire on them if we double down on outing these pedophile elite and calling them out for trying to normalize it. We have evidence of them doing it via Salon article and others.

            Milo is on Facebook quite literally condemning pedophiles and pointing out he's exposed at least three of them in print. Something's wrong with your interpretation methinks.

             Watch the video and judge for yourself. This one is on Milo. He fucked up, and gave them the rope to hang him with at least. And his comments are creepy as hell. His whole "I loved being molested by my priest" is very sick, even that is probably across the line, but to claim man-boy love is a way for boys to having loving and caring coming of age experiences??!?!?!

            milo's word were disgusting, but the fact these fucks want to run with it so badly while the UK police chief confirmed what we all knew about this shit when he dropped the bomb that he's 120% sure their prime minister in 70's murdered 16 children in a satanic pedophilia ring. Why isn't Jake Tapper tweeting about that and the whole UK gov't covering it all up? Fuck Jake Tapper and all these CIA fakes.

            I think Milo should start publically going over the Franklin cover up, a person with his audience, peoples minds wud be blown, Franklin was absolutely shocking, and undeniable even to skeptics and will involve at least by association the corrupt shill GOP'ers who are hypocritically politically assassinating Milo. Myself Im not a huge fan of Milo, and what he said was ridiculous and shameful. However I think he was 1. speaking from experience, I think he was abused and 2. Don't think he is, or advocates for pedophilia. IMO, I think he's just a loudmouth degenerate fuck, but not a pedo.

            Ive watched the interview. Also totally aware of the lack of humor here. Also aware Rogan is lying. 15yr old girls do not look 15 anymore and lots of men are looking at them in ways they shouldn't without even knowing their age.

            This isn't about Milo, if you feel he is/has/will hurt children and he is connected to the upper levels of our government then investigate and post your findings.  MSM have singled him out as a pizzagate spokesman and are going to pedo smear him.  Thats awesome!  The MSM is actually going after a suspected pedo!

            this is 4d, they're getting the pedo stuff out in the lime light, to get people to get on milo for this controversial stuff, then BAM, they will unleash the beast and arrest all the real pedos in high levels of government, right up against the back drop of this public outcry over this controversial borderline pedophile topic.

            Hwy, we can't let all this outside noise distract us from our goal! We're here risking quite a lot, to help the poor kids being used, abused, and killed by the elite pedos, and their followers. Milo's just a distraction!! We can deal with the is he, or isn't he later! Get Back To Work!!

            I'm not suggesting anyone defend Milo, pleae treat him like any other suspect, he has said enough to warrant that, and I happen to have my own suspicions of his motives in the larger culture war.  I'm only saying keep your eyes on the prize!  The Cabal is bigger than Milo, and I'm sure they'd love it to become all about just him, or just Alefantis, easy fall guys.  That's the only reason I think the Milo thing is a distraction, not because I think he's innocent but because his sudden exposure reeks of a deliberate act.  When the MSM are suddenly on it, that looks suspicious as fuck.
           </p>
           <p>
            I ask you to consider again - thousands of arrests and almost zero MSM coverage.  Milo is now a PG suspect and suddenly the Guardian covers it.  They don't get to have their cake and eat it.

            This is not even the first time he has done this too. All pedos should be outed, even Milo. Anyo e who paid attention to GG should already know that Milo was controlled opposition. He popped up to distract when /pol/ found out that following the rabbit hole lead to the DoD. People need to stop this Eceleb worship, no pedophile should be safe.

              </a>
              After this thread and a migration to fullchan, only /pol/ really kept digging into the connections due to what happened next. Right after this dozens of Ecelebs, Milo included, came out of nowhere to say that GG was only about ethics in video game journalism. Then GamerGate became split in half, with neither side really mentioning how deep this rabbit hole went. After that it was mostly just drama between the GG factions while also poking fun at SJWs.

               It looks like the gaming industry as a whole is controlled by ABC agencies and is just meant to socially engineer us and keep us "entertained" and asleep.  From Gamer Gate every single gaming website was in on this deception and coverup.

            Just because this asshole is for Trump doesn't mean we should be defending him. He deserves the criticism that he is receiving after what he said on the Joe Rogan podcast and he has no one to blame but himself. Saying that an attack on Milo is an attack on all pedogate investigations is retarded and screams of hive-mind thinking.

             Milo said on that same Joe Rogan podcast he didn't actually want Trump in the white house. Milo just wants fame, and will ride the coattails of any group he can to get it. He even rode the coattails of pizzagate before. He claimed he was going to talk about pizzagate then decided not to at the last minute.

            This crap makes me laugh alot.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the techniques used to dismantle a movement is to make it about specific individuals.
            <br/>
            Calls for leaders to be selected, or finding prominent media figures and using them to cause division etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Milo is a distraction, a puppet for whomever will fund his need for attention.
            <br/>
            It doesn't matter what he says or does, he will be used as a means to undermine the foundations of the silent majority.
           </p>
           <p>
            Focusing, discussing, attacking or defending a singular individual means less effort to 'the cause' and this thread (and the ones like it) are exactly what 'the enemy' wants.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best solution to all this is to simply not put energy into the system.
            <br/>
            Don't vote or comment when this tactic is in play, just focus on the digging, puzzle matching and sharing of sourced information this community has as it's main strength.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a term in spook circles for whats happening; distraction of the week
            <br/>
            And this whole subverse has fallen for it

            Forget Milo for now, he isn't under the spotlight as a Pizzagate suspect and this should remain the focus.  I'm convinced he's part of COINTELPRO and his role is to distract, obfuscate and redirect and this is exactly what's happening.  He is a very bright and articulate and what he espouses appeals to the sensibilities of most of the people on this board and that is why he's being directed to get his hands dirty, so to speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            Monitor, counter and exploit his involvement to the benefit of the investigation which is to collate enough incriminating evidence to bring the criminals to justice but do not stare into the lights for too long, this is part of their sorcery.

             Milo isn't dividing anyone. This entire thing doesn't change a thing for investigating PG. what is does do is tell us who their target is, which should make us all question why. Is it just bc he has a powerful following or something else? Trust me. They don't attack like this without reason.

            This has been an extremely significant movement from the Cabal in this civil war of information, they just fully moved the Overton Window to pedophilia. Same strategy as with the fake news stuff, they first launched that narrative but in that case it partially backfired. Will see what happens here. The Cabal just provoked Trump to really launch the pedogate high level detentions and after Milo's movement the media can now the play victim card and Trump is Hitler narratives when Trump starts the real drain. Shit is getting real folks.

            Care to defend this video of Milo defending pedophilia?

           <p>
            <strong>

           <p>
            <em>
             Many, after viewing the video, are suggesting that Yiannopoulos is defending pedophilia. In the video, he says:

           <p>
            <em>
             In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men — the sort of ‘coming of age’ relationship — those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can’t speak to their parents

            <em>
             An off-screen voice (possibly that of an interviewer) is heard commenting, “It sounds like molestation to me. It sounds like Catholic priest molestation to me.” Yiannopoulos is quick to reply, “But you know what? I’m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn’t give nearly such good head if it wasn’t for him.”

            They are sporting the pizza symbology pretty clear here, analogous to how celebrities sport their Illuminati ownership the same way. I don't trust Milo not one bit anymore. Whose who and sides don't matter anymore. Just truth and justice is the only thing that matters now.

            Some clarity on the statements from Milo. They did the same thing with Pew Die Pie  where they cut his videos up and played context from different topics as if they were one.

              Just trying to look at it objectively. I'm neutral on Milo I didn't even know who he was a couple months ago but this has the same characteristics as all the other false flag smear campaigns being run on online figures, who have independent thinking audiences who draw their own conclusions from facts and evidence after doing their own research.

              Its obviously the SAME exact group of people. Their tactics are a joke, honestly seems like the same group behind the false flags.... they are building false flag strawmen for people who have millions of listeners and strong followings of independent thinkers (whether or not whatever they are saying is right or wrong is irrelevant its the independent thinking that threatens their regime). I don't even like David Seaman but they did it to him too, Alex jones, pewdiepie, now Milo, heck they did it with the Trump audio tapes too, Most likely the reason Ben Swann went dark so he didn't fall under these attacks too. There were a couple others I can't remember right now too

            Good if they smear Milo they are only bringing the general truth about this issue into the general light. They can only destroy themselves speaking about it. I think Milo is guilty and I no longer trust him. But watch, he's gonna get a bunch of attention from this and do his talk anyways. People are going to start waking up. Obviously, we cannot tolerate satanic pedophile kid torturers being the bearers of law and justice in our society.

             It's a New World Order media tactic.  Howard Dean was politician who was using internet meetup groups to rally support for the Dem party nomination in 1999.  Until he spoke about the massive media mergers going on being bad. The next campaign stop they edited out the extremely loud  croud noise and isolated his horse voice to make him sound nuts.  It worked.  After New Hampshire it was NWO Gore.

             Exactly. Having listened to Milo in many different settings, I'd say what he said on the Joe Rogan show was his poor attempt at being outrageous for laughs while also covering up for his own abuse through laughter. I do not think he is a pedo, but def stuck his foot in his mouth with how this came across.
However, it is completely clear what the tactics are here and they are to destroy and isolate someone with a powerful voice. Rumors are now saying he'll be out with Breitbart and that his book is in danger of getting pulled or something. Seeing how a lot of people are now familiar with the smear tactics and obvious double standards (Bill Clinton), I'd be willing to guess that if he's forced to go it on his own he'll be just fine and in fact, have a bigger following. Seems like now would be a great time for him to say what he knows about PG too.

              I hope that does not happen. Meanwhile the two brothers whose pictures appeared in a police sketch an with pizza-related mapping handkerchiefs in their pockets have had what sanctions against them? Then there's JA and his happy group of apes .. what's happened to him? Oh, that's right ... nothing! Nothing except the community coming out an supporting his use of creepy terminology coupled with pictures and then there's that magazine.

             I remember this coming up a couple of times already be doesn't defend paedophilia at all he just says he wasn't traumatized by what he did with a priest when he was 14, believe it or not it's okay not to be fucked in the head for life from 'statutory rape'.  There were two teachers in my high school that were amazing I'd have donated a kidney for 10 minutes in the sack with either of them and I very much doubt I would have been traumatized by it.

             He also says to Rogan 'c'mon have you never been attracted to a 15 year old.  No.1 the age of consent in Britain is 16, no.2 there's a big difference between being attracted to a 15 year old and having sex with one. No.3 attraction is instinctive and some 15 year olds look older just as some 20 somethings look really young, finding out a super hot chick is underage makes them immediately unattractive to most people but that doesn't change the initial response. He's not exactly advocating sex with 10 year-olds this is a complete red herring.

              Yeah and how he gives such good head now because of that priest or whatever. I don't get why he was ever looked at in a positive way in the first place. He's rude, attention seeking and certainly not a good influence or role model. He has said the meanest things to people.

               Exactly his arguments are deliberately frank to shock, he uses controversy to get his points across which is probably why he has so many fans, people are so cynical these days.  Just look at t.v. nowadays it seems like shows now have to be needlessly graphic to get any attention especially since game of thrones and breaking bad etc.

                Yeah that's what I never liked because to me it's just vulgar. I've heard of him being mean and calling people fat and the N words. It seems to me like he's considered one of the positive voices for Trump and I've never seen him as a person to look up to. He's not a role model. Maybe for some college aged kids but I would hope mine wouldn't look up to someone like him.

               Oh yeah he did say that I forgot about that bit lol.  But then Corey Feldman talked about those same parties that he himself was abused at and didn't name anyone I admit he could have denounced these things a bit more strongly but it seems like it might be suicidal to name these fuckers.  Still think this is being blown out of proportion a bit.

            Ok guys,
            <strong>
             this is important
            </strong>
            , regardless of which side of the fence you see Milo,
            <strong>
             do not let that distract you
            </strong>
            .  The way the powerful break up movements is to sow internal dissent.  If you believe Milo is a pedo, fine, go ahead, investigate him, treat him like any other suspect, nobody should be discouraged from that.  Or don't, that's your prerogative.  What isn't productive and is the deliberate aim of the people doing this, is for us to be calling each other out on partisan issues and forming sides.  They want to
            <strong>
             splinter and distract
            </strong>
            the movement, we can't let them do that.
           </p>

             100% agree, Milo is going to be a controversial figure - the reason we all know who he is is because he is skilled in courting controversy, he literally thrives on it (financially and seems to thoroughly enjoy it) &amp; he is unlikely to stop being controversial. Milo should not be central to anything pizza gate related, he's going to pick an angle that is very divisive because I believe that is in his nature &amp; public-persona style to do so. Pizzagate is about collecting evidence &amp; connecting criminals to criminal networks and crimes, not about people's various definitions of a healthy relationship.

             TIme to Double Down. Andrew Breitbart always took the first swing. He understood how the left works. This should be expected. If you need any inspiration about this great man and his battle for truth, here is a good link. It's long, but it is inspiring and will enrage you as you see why he was killed.

             I think Milo speaks in a very confused way.  From the conference call, he could have been mis-interpreted.  But I think that anyone that seeks out people under the age of 16 in Canada, or 18 in the US, is by definition a Statutory rapist.  If he wants to argue about the science of puberty, and at what age we should set that, then fine, but we have the age limit where it's at because it ENSURES the child has entered and completed most of puberty by the age of 18.  Personally, I can understand how someone could be confused with a 17 on the edge of 18-year old, but anyone looking at 13, 14, 15  year old kids for a sexual relationship, IS A FUCKING PEDO.

              ....and the statutory laws are only for nonmarital sex.  In a lot of states, a 16 year old can get married if they have parental consent...some at 14....one as low as 12.  Oddly, Mississippi still requires a male to get patent signature until 21.

              Age of consent in Canada is 16. But in the USA, consent laws are state laws. It's 18 in only 11 states:

              I haven't watched all of the videos that implicate him, but I watched the video where he responds, and he says he's talking about what happened to him when he was 17. Not that he was dating a 17 year old, he WAS the 17 year old. People are allowed to have opinions about what happened to themselves. Anyways, consent age is 16 in the UK (where he grew up). Again, I haven't watched the vids, so maybe he said some bad stuff, I don't know. Or maybe stuff was edited to make it sound bad, I don't know.

                It grosses me out too. But on the other hand, I don't think 16 year old having sex with a 14 year old is a criminal. Nor an 18 year old having sex with 16 year old. Maybe there's more to the laws? Romeo/Juliet laws? I really have no idea. But regardless of the LAW, older men should not be having sex with children under 18, just my opinion.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyway, I don't know why I bring it up. I just wanted to point out the different state laws, and have managed to gross myself out. And here we are wasting time on this crap, which is just what they wanted...  Sorry man.
               </p>
               <p>
                Everything is so fucking disturbing lately. I really do sometimes envy my friends who are clueless to it all. Tho I admit I will relish it when they are red-pilled...

               Here we go again..It doesn't matter. It's drama. Get it? We don't need drama, we certainly don't need heroes (aka, idols).

              i agree.  We need to get back to posting news and investigating and researching and sharing with others doing the same.  I am not for against him I just want to keep doing the work that we have all done to get to where we are now.  In Their Face!  And They Are Hating It.

            Milo is getting hit with DARVO.  They know he knows too much.  Hell, they know he was a victim of an institutional pedophile.  Now they're reversing the roles to poison the well against high profile exposure threats.

             ya, isn't this standard victim shaming from the left? they have no proof Milo is actually a pedo and if he's a been a victim of pedophilia he might be a tad bit fucked in the head. we all know Milo is more than a tad bit fucked in the head though. He'll tell you that himself.

              Milo is a victim? He claims to have enjoyed, and seems proud of, the fact that "father Michael" taught him to suck dick.

              The whole problem was his argument for that in the conference chat video.

              He triggers SJW's and feminists. That's why he's my hero. If he's a pedo though, i'll have to drop my respect for him.

               Right he entertains the troups so to speak. I can't personally view his defaming as a great loss. Low value / useful idiot in the grand scheme of things. Twitter will have to hire another actor to market their safe space. Big fukn deal.

            I think Milo is working for Soros or Obama to flip the narrative towards the right. He's on their payroll for sure to insite protests and conflict at these colleges. Now he's being used as a tool to discredit pedogate. We need to dig up more on this guy and expose he's a fraud.
