<p>Now I will show that Pizzagate connection of James Alefantis to Laura Silsby is highly dubious.<br />
From the Executive Summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laura Silsby was got off the hook by Jorge Puello, who was later convicted of sex trafficking, and was wanted on charges of sex trafficking in four countries.  Izette Folger, a close friend of James Alefantis,... is the daughter of Michael Maccoby, who coaches leaders of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos, or NPH, a large organization that runs orphanages all over the world. His son, Max Maccoby, is on the Boards of Directors of an NPH orphanage called Friends of the Orphans, which ... happens to be the orphanage from which Silsby was caught trafficking children. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This begins with a falsehood as Silsby was not got off the hook. She was convicted of a lesser charge and served time. And Jorge Puello certainly didn\'t do it. He was not even her lawyer at trial. He was already exposed as a con man and a fraud months before her trial even started. </p>
<p>Feb 15  Puello facing charges

<p>May 13 Silsby\'s trial starts
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/05/13/haiti-prosecutors-seek-months-prison-woman-tried-remove-kids-quake-1947670658.html">http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/05/13/haiti-prosecutors-seek-months-prison-woman-tried-remove-kids-quake-1947670658.html</a></p>
<p>I plan to prove this statement is false and demonstrate there is no connection between Silsby and Alefantis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Max Maccoby, is on the Boards of Directors of an NPH orphanage called Friends of the Orphans, which ... happens to be the orphanage from which Silsby was caught trafficking children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Silsby got her kids from an orphanage that Max Maccoby helps run?  The summary links to 
this interview

<blockquote>
<p>VAN SUSTEREN: Where did they find these 33 children? How did they get these children?
PUELLO: There was an orphanage that collapsed in Haiti. It was called friends of the orphans of Haiti. And there was somebody over there that told them that the orphans had no place, no room to place them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here\'s the issues with this.</p>
<p>A.  Puello is the only source of this.  If Puello is telling the truth, we would be able to find evidence of an evidence called Friends of the Orphans that collapsed.</p>
<p>B.  Puello is not exactly a reliable source. We know he is a liar and a con man and anything he says needs to be backed up from other sources.  
</p>
<p>C.  Where did the children come from?  The AP severely undermines Puello\'s claim because they tracked where Silsby got everyone of the 33 children.  
</p>
<p>D.  There is no orphanage called Friends of the Orphans in Haiti.  It\'s a US based organization.</p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at each of these.</p>
<h1>Puello\'s claim and reputation.  (A + B)</h1>
<p>If you do a Google search for the first 6 months of 2010, for silsby  and the exact phrase &quot;friends of the orphans&quot; you get no results for the exact phrase.
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=silsby+%22friends+of+the+orphans%22&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS746US747&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=591&amp;tbas=0&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2010%2Ccd_max%3A6%2F1%2F2010&amp;tbm=">https://www.google.com/search?q=silsby+%22friends+of+the+orphans%22&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS746US747&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=591&amp;tbas=0&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2010%2Ccd_max%3A6%2F1%2F2010&amp;tbm=</a></p>
<p>So Puello\'s claim looks dubious.  This is not surprising as Puello was revealed to be a conman and not a licensed lawyer.  Several warrants were out for his arrest included for sex trafficking and in 2011 he was sentenced to three years in prison
<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-man-who-conned-the-missionaries">http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-man-who-conned-the-missionaries</a>

<p>So nothing can stand on Jorge Puello\'s word alone.</p>
<h1>Do we know where the 33 children did come from?  (C)</h1>
<p>We do.  The AP went and found out exactly where all 33 children came from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although a U.S. Baptist group said it was trying to rescue 33 &quot;orphans&quot; by taking them out of earthquake-ravaged Haiti, all the children have close family still alive, The Associated Press has found.</p>
<p>A reporter\'s visit Saturday to the rubble-strewn Citron slum, where 13 of the children lived, led to their parents, all of whom said they turned their youngsters over to the missionary group voluntarily in hopes of getting them to safety.</p>
<p>Similar explanations were given by parents in the mountain town of Callabas, outside Port-au-Prince, who told the AP on Feb. 3 that desperation and blind faith led them to hand over 20 children to the Baptist group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know who the people who helped her were.  The AP says she was helped by an American nondemennational pastor associated with the Haiti Sharing Jesus Ministry, not &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot; not &quot;Nuestros Pequeno Hermanos.&quot;  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was led to Citron by Pastor Jean Sainvil, an Atlanta, Georgia-based Haitian minister who recruited the 13 children in the slum. ....Sainvil, a former orphan who says his nondenominational Haiti Sharing Jesus Ministry has 25 churches in the countryside, </p>

<p>She was also helped by an orphanage worker in Haiti</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Haitian parents told The Associated Press they surrendered their children on Jan. 28, two days after a local orphanage worker acting on behalf of the Baptists convened nearly the entire village of about 500 people on a dirt soccer pitch to present the Americans\' offer.</p>
<p>The orphanage worker, Issac Adrien, The orphanage worker, Issac Adrien, said he told the villagers their children would be educated at a home in the Dominican Republic so that they might eventually return to take care of their families.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What orphanage did he work at?
<a href="http://www.theledger.com/news/20100205/lake-wales-missionary-wrongly-linked-to-haiti-orphan-drama">http://www.theledger.com/news/20100205/lake-wales-missionary-wrongly-linked-to-haiti-orphan-drama</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that the Baptist Americans, led by Laura Silsby of Meridian, Idaho, met Isaac Adrien in Port-au-Prince on Jan. 26. Adrien was raised in the House of Blessings orphanage and now is coordinator for a program called Children of Promise, Murphy said. Silsby said her group wanted to take orphaned and homeless children to an orphanage in the Dominican Republic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adrien took Silsby’s group to House of Blessings, which houses about 20 children, but the director, Joana Jean Marie Desir, turned them away, Murphy said.</p>
<p>None of the 33 children came from &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot; or &quot;Nuestro Pequenos Hermanos.&quot;</p>
<h1>There is no orphanage called Friends of the Orphans in Haiti. (D)</h1>
<p>Max Maccoby, is NOT on the Boards of Directors of &quot;an orphanage.&quot;  Friends of Orphans is a US based group that raises funds.  They DO NOT RUN orphanages in Haiti or any place else.  They are affiliated with Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos that does run orphanages, but they are a legally distinct organization.  They don\'t have a say over how NPH runs it orphanages.</p>
<p>For proof that Friends of Orphans is legally distinct from NPH, you can check their tax forms. 
When you check their 990 form, you see that they have no expenses in Haiti or any foreign country.
<a href="https://www.nphusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2012_Form-990.pdf">https://www.nphusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2012_Form-990.pdf</a></p>
<p>The distinction that Friends of the Orphans from NPH is listed on page 2 of the 2012 990. They spell out how they achieve their mission &quot;THROUGH SUPPORT OF NUESTROS PEQUENOS HERMANOS.&quot;  You can also see on page 2 that almost all of their revenue is giving out in grants meaning, they are not paying for maintaining and staffing an orphanage and housing and clothing orphans.  They simply don\'t do that.  .  
</p>
<p>If you go to the Schedule I of the 990, you can see what they do  do.  Friends of the Orphans provided cash grants of $8.5 million and noncash grants of $5.5 million to NPH.  If you go the next page, in section IV, you can see what exactly the relationship was.  They had an affiliation agreement and the CFO of Friends of the Orphans sits on the NPH Finance Committee to review how grant monies are spent.  Otherwise they have separate boards.  An affiliation agreement is used in the nonprofit world to spell out how independent organi</p>
<p>The point of all this is Friends of the Orphans is a US based organization fundraising organization. They have no buildings in Haiti.  They raised funds for Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos, which runs orphanages and of course, Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos DOES NOT translate to Friends of the Orphans. The local chapter of NPH is Haiti is known by their French Name, Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs which also does not translate to Friends of the Orphans.</p>
<p>To confuse matters Friends of the Orphans changed its name to NPH-USA.  (They explain the reason for the change here <a href="https://www.nphusa.org/timeline/">https://www.nphusa.org/timeline/)</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2013 Friends of the Orphans changes name to NPH USA in order to create a global brand with consistency to our donors, to more closely align the brand with our mission and the children we serve, and to expand the focus to both the children and programs that we support.)  NOTE: If you look at the recent 990 tax forms it\'s clear that they are still a separate legal entity.</p>

            The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that the Baptist Americans, led by Laura Silsby of Meridian, Idaho, met Isaac Adrien in Port-au-Prince on Jan. 26. Adrien was raised in the House of Blessings orphanage and now is coordinator for a program called Children of Promise, Murphy said. Silsby said her group wanted to take orphaned and homeless children to an orphanage in the Dominican Republic.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Adrien took Silsby’s group to House of Blessings, which houses about 20 children, but the director, Joana Jean Marie Desir, turned them away, Murphy said.
          </p>
          <p>
           None of the 33 children came from "Friends of the Orphans" or "Nuestro Pequenos Hermanos."

          <h1>
           There is no orphanage called Friends of the Orphans in Haiti. (D)
          </h1>
          <p>
           Max Maccoby, is NOT on the Boards of Directors of "an orphanage."  Friends of Orphans is a US based group that raises funds.  They DO NOT RUN orphanages in Haiti or any place else.  They are affiliated with Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos that does run orphanages, but they are a legally distinct organization.  They don't have a say over how NPH runs it orphanages.
          </p>
          <p>
           For proof that Friends of Orphans is legally distinct from NPH, you can check their tax forms. 
When you check their 990 form, you see that they have no expenses in Haiti or any foreign country.
           <a href="https://www.nphusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2012_Form-990.pdf">
            https://www.nphusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2012_Form-990.pdf
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           The distinction that Friends of the Orphans from NPH is listed on page 2 of the 2012 990. They spell out how they achieve their mission "THROUGH SUPPORT OF NUESTROS PEQUENOS HERMANOS."  You can also see on page 2 that almost all of their revenue is giving out in grants meaning, they are not paying for maintaining and staffing an orphanage and housing and clothing orphans.  They simply don't do that.  .
          </p>
          <p>
           If you go to the Schedule I of the 990, you can see what they do  do.  Friends of the Orphans provided cash grants of $8.5 million and noncash grants of $5.5 million to NPH.  If you go the next page, in section IV, you can see what exactly the relationship was.  They had an affiliation agreement and the CFO of Friends of the Orphans sits on the NPH Finance Committee to review how grant monies are spent.  Otherwise they have separate boards.  An affiliation agreement is used in the nonprofit world to spell out how independent organi
          </p>
          <p>
           The point of all this is Friends of the Orphans is a US based organization fundraising organization. They have no buildings in Haiti.  They raised funds for Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos, which runs orphanages and of course, Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos DOES NOT translate to Friends of the Orphans. The local chapter of NPH is Haiti is known by their French Name, Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs which also does not translate to Friends of the Orphans.
          </p>
          <p>
           To confuse matters Friends of the Orphans changed its name to NPH-USA.  (They explain the reason for the change here
           <a href="https://www.nphusa.org/timeline/">
            https://www.nphusa.org/timeline/)
           </a>
           )
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            2013 Friends of the Orphans changes name to NPH USA in order to create a global brand with consistency to our donors, to more closely align the brand with our mission and the children we serve, and to expand the focus to both the children and programs that we support.)  NOTE: If you look at the recent 990 tax forms it's clear that they are still a separate legal entity.

            Jaccoby's organization's name just stumbled out of Jorge's mouth. Why? Why did he drop everything to do this, especially for free? Was he sent by someone at the behest of someone else, someone he had not met, only knowing that it all had something to do with Friends of the Orphans, blurting it out when he unexpectedly had the spotlight on himself?
Because all we have are crowd sourced links in the public domain our ability to put the pieces together is not perfect for sure. But this affair is just one more weird coincidence in this matter, circumstantial. Weird thing about circumstantial evidence is that it is the hardest to falsify.

            I am not defending anyone here, but OP provided sourced material and explained the connection he/she was trying to make with it.
            <strong>
             Whether it is ACCURATE or TRUE is another argument.
            </strong>
            That requires a thorough evaluation of the links and facts therein.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because there is dissension on the accuracy of what is being said does not make saying it wrong. Rather than jumping to "shill-calling" take each and every point made and refute it with counter facts.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is how you win an argument. Not through endless commentary...

             The thing with RWeSure is that via his post history, its blatently obvious that he is a shill. Therefore the accuracy and truthfullness of his claims is questionable at best.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also has 3+ accounts, which is damning evidence he is a shill.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has never once made a single post to help expose pedophilia and human trafficking by elites.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of his posts can be summarized as "defend liberal elites.
            </p>
            <p>
             You gotta make shills feel as unwelcome around these parts as psychologically possible for they are our ENEMIES not "loyal dissenters" and need to be treated like the scum they are.

              =) Far from new...And well aware of which users are here to steer the ship in the wrong direction. It takes a lot of restraint not to respond to every falsehood presented here.
             </p>
             <p>
              My point, however, is that the general populous sees those who "believe" the evidence we claim as true in the same way we see shills on this site -- crazy and deranged, hopelessly regurgitating fake news to further their ridiculous agenda. Rather than responding to them (which is what they want), my approach is simply to let them finish their rant, then look the other way or present contradictory evidence that refutes the former. A simple down-vote would suffice as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Calling someone out for being a shill does not stop them. It does not identify them as the enemy either. It merely floods the comment sections of legit posts with personalized attacks that clutter and distract from the truth -- again, what they ultimately want.

              This is a game, a war of words. And the only way to win against them is to never play at all. Just my .02.

            Due to this thread's OP being a known shill who has no interest in exposing pedophilia and human trafficking by elites, only in defending leftist elites, requesting "Possible Disinformation" or "Accuracy in Question". flares. Title is also misleading, so axing under rule 3 is recommended. The "evidence" being used is the group in question's own word of mouth and groups own website. Questionable evidence at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            Him having 3+ accounts in his own words "make more commemts" aka shill more is just further evidence that he's a shill, therefore anything he says is inherently untrustworthy.

             I agree he is most likely a shill, but Voat is very protective of free speech.  Unless he is clearly and incontrovertibly misrepresenting facts, we must allow him to lay out his argument.  I haven't thoroughly read the post, though, so if you find any violations of Rule 2, please let me know.  The title is not violating Rule 3, because it is stating the position that his post attempts to support.

              None of his links make any mention of James Alefantis. Nothing in his post even mentions James Alefantis. Its all about Silsby. His title is misleading.

             <p>
              His sources are the websites of the suspects in question, so they're inherently untrustworthy. Like taking a murderer's testimony as being honest.

             <p>
              The agenda of the shill is to censor people who disagree with "the official narrative", so him trying to use free speech as his justification to censor us is hypocritical.

               The alleged connection goes Alefantis to Maccoby family to Friends of the Orphans to Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos to Silsby.

              <p>
               The only evidence for this last connection is Silsby's activities in Haiti.  I focus on Silsby  because I can prove she never dealt with NPH/NPFS and thus has no connection  with the Maccobys and thus no connection with Alefantis

               Suspects?   Here you show yourself in unconcerned with the truth.  The whole point of my post is the entire story of how the "suspicion"  came  about is the unsupported word of a conman.  And I cite   contemporaneous sources.  From years before this now debunked theory came about.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your point about censorship is ridiculous.  I am arguing about the facts of tbe matter.  Either Silsby went to an NPH/NPFS facility and was given children or she did not.  You seem to be jumping to censorship because the facts of the matter are against you.

                We don't trust you or the truthfullness of your claims because what your motive is already known to be. Therefore any post you make or link you send has an intrinsic ulterior motive.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you are not a shill, then how come you have not made a SINGLE thread or comment to help expose pedophila or human trafficking by ELITES. Everything you do is to defend the elites. If you were truly not a shill, then you would be helping expose these things. You don't therefore nobody trusts you.
               </p>
               <p>
                The fact that you use 3+ accounts in the first place is further evidence that you are untrustworthy. You claim its because you get downvoated thus have reducef comment ability.
                <em>
                 cough
                </em>
                reduced ability to shill. If you are truly honest, then delete all accounts except ONE. Then show photo proof you actually did it. If you don't do this, then anything you say cannot be trusted on the grounds of being a shill.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is you who are not interested in the truth, only in covering it up.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now you're moving on from "msm is the gospel for truth" to "the suspects word of mouth is the offical truth". Given the level of deceit by lefist elites and their underlings, everything they say upfront is suspect of being double speak.

                 Truth does not depend on my motive.  That's the beauty of it.  You can take a look at all of my research and see whether it stands up or not completely independent of me.  You don't even have to think of me while you do it.  You should try it.  Engage my argument instead of me.

                 Because I think this is a terrible way to view the issue. I think it distorts reality.  We see this every time child pornographers or human traffickers are arrested and people get UPSET about it because it's not the elites. It's a distortion makes several errors.  It's a mistake to view the ELITES as one harmonious group with one agenda.  The people who do the most to fight human trafficking are also the ELITES.   It's basically a pre-exisiting, free-floating conspiracy theory of "They're all out to get us" that was foisted on 2016 circumstances.  It's a mistake to view criminals who commit the same crime as working together in a common conspiracy.  It's a way of avoiding determining who is innocent and who is guilty and prefers to just sweep them all together.  It's a flight from the truth.

                  I really wish people here would understand what you say: a factual and well-sourced argument stands up as true regardless of who writes it. Honestly, I'm incredibly weary of the elite pedophilia investigation focusing so intensely on Comet Ping Pong, Laura Silsby, any and all occurrences of the word "pizza", etc. There are too many sensational and false claims being spread around concerning those topics. Many well-documented cases, like the Franklin scandal and Dutroux affair, are worth researching without resorting to mud-slinging that happens to be almost exclusively against Democrats.

                   I also found a lot evidence that story that the Clintons intervened in any way is not supported by the reporting at the time.  There was a report in the British press that Bill Clinton went down there on a diplomatic mission, but nothing in the US press and nothing from Haiti.  There are no State Department emails to this effect. Bill Cinton went down there as a UN envoy for earthquake relief.

                   In fact, the Baptists were still in jail when Bill Clinton returned to the US, they couldn't even get bail.  Soon after he got back he underwent surgery on a clogged artery, none of the new media reported anything about a diplomatic mission in Haiti.

Clinton's husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, now a special U.N. envoy for Haiti relief, met with President Rene Preval in Port-au-Prince on Friday, but said his visit had nothing to do with the detained Americans.
Later, Clinton said the U.S. and Haitian governments should try to resolve the issue quickly.
"I think what's important now is that the government of Haiti and the government of the United States to get together and go through this because the government of Haiti, as I understand it, is not looking for a fight. They just want to protect children," he said during a visit to an AIDS clinic.

                    Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will not get directly involved in the case of the 10 Americans detained in Haiti on child abduction charges, a State Department spokesman said Tuesday.
"It would be highly unusual for the secretary of state to intervene in a case involving the judicial process of another country," spokesman P.J. Crowley said in an off-camera question-and-answer session.
Reginald Brown -- the Washington lawyer who represents one of the detained Americans -- sent a letter to Clinton on Tuesday asking her to personally intervene with Haitian authorities.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    He asked Clinton to make "a personal request" to Haitian authorities to allow Allen to speak to his wife and her lawyers and to have fresh supplies.
"As far as I can tell, the one thing our detained American citizens have been able to do is communicate with just about anybody who wants to talk with them," Crowley said at the State Department. "If family members wish to talk to them, I think that is something that can be easily facilitated through our embassy in Port-au-Prince or through the Haitian government."
The State Department continues carefully to defer to Haitian authorities.
"We have had regular consular access and meetings with the 10 American citizens," Crowley said. "I believe we have facilitated getting medicine or other needs to our citizens.
                    <strong>
                     We are doing exactly what we would do with detained Americans anywhere in the world.
                    </strong>
                    "As to intervening directly in the case, we are very respectful of the Haitian government and of Haitian law."
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    "This is a Haitian legal process. The matters right now involve whether these individuals have broken Haitian law. We have talked to Haitian officials in general terms about their ability to conduct this procedure. If they want to explore alternative avenues with us, we will be happy to have that conversation," he said.
The State Department also has ruled out any special role for former President Bill Clinton in a possible release of the Americans.
**"It is unnecessary for former President Bill Clinton to play the role of intermediary as he did in North Korea in the case of the journalists being held," **Crowley told CNN on Monday. "The situation in North Korea and the situation in Haiti are dramatically different. In Haiti there is a functioning government with which we have diplomatic relations and established channels to monitor and deal with bilateral issues. North Korea is an opaque society with which we have no diplomatic relations."
Crowley said there are other Americans in custody in Haiti, in addition to the 10 Americans, but he provided no details of their identity or circumstances. Some are believed to be held on drug charges.
"There are other Americans in custody. I don't know what their charges are. ... I think there were some in custody before the earthquake," he said.

            The nail in the coffin of NPH/NFPS giving kids away, is they are so well funded or organized, they ended up starting new programs in other parts of HAITI, that is they grew and cared for more kids and NPH does do adoption.   Let me repeat that,  THEIR KIDS ARE NEVER AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION.

              Children at NPH homes are not available for adoption.
             </strong>
             Instead they are welcomed with their brothers and sisters and become a part of the larger, stable NPH family environment that gives them a chance to focus on education and personal growth, knowing that a loving support system will always be in place for them. The children grow and learn in their culture and language and become contributing citizens in their own countries. Our homes are located in Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru.
            </p>

            The intention is that they are given education and support and graduate out of the NPH programs.

             A reporter's visit Saturday to the rubble-strewn Citron slum, where 13 of the children lived, led to their parents, all of whom said they turned their youngsters over to the missionary group voluntarily in hopes of getting them to safety.
Similar explanations were given by parents in the mountain town of Callabas, outside Port-au-Prince, who told the AP on Feb. 3 that desperation and blind faith led them to hand over 20 children to the Baptist group

            (Again, the Fr. Wasson Center is an Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos/Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs building, not a Friends of the Orphans building because Friends of the Orphans have no buildings in Haiti.)  Put that aside.  Did NPH/NPFS have a building that collapsed in Petionville, Haiti?

            So NPH did have a collapsed orphanage in Haiti?
           </p>
           <p>
            No.  Evidence below.
           </p>
           <p>
            First let's look at the claim that "the exchange took place in Petitionville. "  Here's the link given for support
            <a href="https://archive.is/lMmHp#selection-1093.0-1093.168">
             https://archive.is/lMmHp#selection-1093.0-1093.168
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            However, this link does not says Silsby was given children from FOHO or NPH/NPFS.  In fact, it says nothing about an exchange at all.  It says they were on the bus with children.  It doesn't say anything about where the children got on the bus.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The officer said he discovered Silsby and the nine other Americans on a bus in Port-au-Prince's Pétionville neighborhood after receiving a tip from a concerned citizen.
He stopped the group and ordered the children to get off the bus. He then directed Silsby to the Dominican Embassy.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Obviously, when they were driving around through different parts of Haiti, the children were still on the bus with them. It's about a two hour drive to the Domincan border.  So this tells us nothing about where the children got on the bus.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is circumstantial evidence, but it is being stretched to support a conclusion that it cannot.  Why not?

            NPH/NPFS did NOT have an orphanage collapse in Haiti.
           </h1>
           <p>
            We can say this definitively.  NPH/NPFS DID NOT have an orphange collapse in Haiti.  In fact, their orphanage did not sustain damage.
           </p>
           <p>
            To understand this and to clear up confusion, you have to understand where NPH/NFPS was located and how they operated at the time of the Earthquake.  You can't simply look on their website now because since the earthquake they have expanded and opened more sites.  To figure out what buildings they had in Jan 2010.  I went to their annual reports

            "NPFS has three distinct locations with numerous programs. Kenscoff, Tabarre in Port Au Prince and Petitionville. Within these three locations, they had multiple programs."

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            People on VOAT were wondering how an orphanage could collapse and no orphanges be killed. It's because they building that collapsed was NOT an orphanage.  It was an office building.  The school Kay Elaine was a day school and the children/adults went back to their families.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again the NPH/NPFS orphanage did not suffer Earthquake damage.  They are also a large and well funded organization.  There would be no need to send orphans to another place.  If any orphans were displaced at the Father Wasson Center, they could have simply moved them to St. Helene's their main orphanage.
           </p>
           <h1>
            3 The orphans were housed in a FOTO building called St. Helene in Kenscoff, where 100 children disappeared after the earthquake
           </h1>
           <p>
            We can now see this is ludicrous.  The claim is that a building with no orphans collapsed in Petitionville, so Silsby was given 100 orphans (!!!!) from a different building in a different town that suffered no damage at all.  This makes no sense whatsoever.  At no point did anyone claim Silsbys group had 100 children with them.  (Their bus would not have accomodated them.)
           </p>
           <p>
            100 kids disappeared?   Wow.  What's the support of that.  That would have been pretty big news.

           <p>
            Reading this, it's clear the point of the article is about how the orphanage is doing, not a full count of the children.  Rather than assuming 100 children disappeared, what about other less shocking assumptions? 
Something as simple, as the reporter meant to type 450 or misheard what they were told or that Jennifer Rayno misspoke.  Unless, you're claiming this woman is part of the conspiracy, she is clearly saying all orphans are OK.  This is why I say, this evidence is presented to support a premade conclusion.  Also note, the reporter talking to people in the US.  The dateline of the article is in Chicago.  Friends of the Orphans is a US based organization.  They are not on the ground in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            More evidence of the premade conclusion is the fact whoever ever posted this had EVIDENCE the Fr. Wasson Center WAS NOT AN ORPHANAGE.  It's literally in the paragraph before their screenshot.
           </p>

According to Jennifer Rayno, Director of Haiti initiative for Friends of the Orphans, all 350 children at the St. Helene orphanage in Kenscoff, 11 miles east of the epicenter, are safe and have sustained no injuries, and the complex is intact.

           <p>
            A couple of other points regarding the numbers.  A.  They are not static.  You can't cite a 2011 report to support the numbers that were there pre Earthquake.  As the kids get older they go from the St. Helene orphanage to the St. Bosco school where they live with different families.   B.  Their August 2010 report gives the figures of 400 at St. Helen and 200 at St. Bosco, probably rounded.  C.  Their Jan 2011 report gives 382 at St. Helene and 255 at Don Bosco.  They also opened more facilities after the earthquake.
