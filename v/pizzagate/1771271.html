<p>Alex Jones interviews a lawyer claiming to have been an eye witness to the shooting:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrf7qYRdKRw&amp;sns=em">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrf7qYRdKRw&amp;sns=em</a></p>
<p>At around 6:00 he describes the scene. Alex later says \'we should never go after the little guys, like Alefantis, nor businesses\'.</p>
<p>Check comments on the YouTube video. Not one of them found the guy to be credible. Here is an example::</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This guy stinks of fraud.\'\'did you see him carrying a shot gun?\'\' Answer \'\'No\'\' \'\'Did you hear shots fired?\'\' answer \'\'No\' \'\'my understanding is he shot a lock\'\' But he is a witness! And supposedly a lawyer,yet he makes this statement,after having said that he himself heard no shots, so how can he say that his understanding is that he shot a lock? He also says that he saw the guy in his peripheral vision, so he did NOT see him directly, and from his peripheral vision he says that \'\'we could see that he was carrying a concealed weapon,i can confirm that.\'\' Wait a minute,so from his peripheral vision,which means out of his direct line of sight,he can see a CONCEALED weapon and confirm it???? Take all the waffle and blah,blah out of this,and what he is actually saying is \'\'I saw a guy walk into a pizza parlor\'\' and thats it!﻿</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the most fake interviews I\'ve ever seen. This is also a perfect example of why many people don\'t like or trust Alex Jones.As you know, a few days ago we had the Comet Ping Pong gunman false flag. Here is a quick recap: An actor from North Carolina drove to Washington DC to investigate the Pizzagate allegations tied to Comet Ping Pong. He walked in with an AR15 in the open, maybe fired one shot at a lock on a door, the police were called and he was arrested in minutes without incident. The police report indicated only one worker and 3 customers fled the building. If you think about it, it\'s utter bs. </p>

<p>And from <a href="https://tobefree.wordpress.com/2017/03/25/kurt-haskells-statement-on-alex-jones-video-denying-pizzagate-this-video-is-the-smoking-gun-that-alex-jones-is-more-than-willing-to-continually-lie-and-deceive-his-audience-in-order-to/">Kurt Haskell’s Statement on Alex Jones’ Video Denying PizzaGate</a> — “This video is the smoking gun that Alex Jones is more than willing to continually lie and deceive his audience in order to protect his wallet”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few comments on this video. First of all, it’s pathetic that in today’s U.S., an obvious pedophile can threaten a news source like Infowars with a defamation lawsuit over the truth. Alefantis should be in prison for life.
What also is pathetic is that Alex Jones is not sticking to the Pizzagate story and forcing Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong to go to court. During those hearings, all of the sordid details of Alefantis would be brought out in court and the media. Further unwanted pressure would be brought upon Alefantis. I seriously doubt this pedophile would have the guts to bring such a lawsuit. We will never know because once again, Alex Jones chooses to protect his pocket book instead of doing what is right.</p>
<p>...Also, I wrote a few months ago about how the “eyewitness” to the Comet Ping Pong false flag hard drive shooting was really an attorney for Comet Ping Pong. Remember, this guy, who Alex Jones told us was only an eyewitness, went on his show trashing Alex Jones and defending Comet Ping Pong. Now we have Alex Jones admitting in this video that he offered to make any kind of statement Comet Ping Pong wanted on air. Here is the quote, “In a recent broadcast, I invited Mr. Alefantis on our program to state what he wanted to, and I again do so here.” I stated before, he already did this but it was disguised as an eyewitness to the false flag. It was yet another deceitful act by both Alex Jones and Comet Ping Pong. The fact is, this attorney/eyewitness was just playing a role in a false flag and getting paid to do it like we have seen many times before. Alex Jones cooperated and most likely SUGGESTED the manner of deceit.</p>

            That means you can't say he's full of shit after 1 example. You don't have the luxury of finding one thing he got wrong and concluding he has no credibility.

           <p>
            There's plenty of other damming evidence that Halbig lists in that video.

            Yeah I realized that as soon as I wrote it but didn't change it because Wolfgang Halbig has spent the past 4 years researching everything and has been to the town and had videos and interviews and countless example of him being there to validate what evidence is real and what isn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            You on the other hand did a five minute search on Google. /facepalm
           </p>
           <p>
            Those aren't in the same ballpark. They're not even in the same state.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you've got one more chance to prove you can be objective. Will you watch the Wolfgang Halbig video going over the facts of the case?

            You are here researching pizzagate which is also investigating horrendous crimes committed against children. You obviously are skeptical of the party line. I was too UNTIL I WATCHED THAT VIDEO OVER THE WEEKEND.

            No it's not. You searched TODAY. Sandy Hook was four years ago. It's possible those people were asked to move back to town. Also that page isn't proof enough. You're essentially believing what someone told you on the Interwebs.

            But the Wolfgang Halbig video goes over uncontested facts like it took an hour to get the first kid to the hospital 14 miles away. No helicopter medivac was used but there was plenty of open space for it to land.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's the fact no ambulance if drove up to the school. And it's odd 3 hours after the "shooting" a truck pulled up with porta potties. I didn't now going to the bathroom was just as important as saving children with gun shot wounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again I was like you up until this weekend. Last week I would be brow beating you by now. Will you watch that entire Wolfgang Halbig talk going over the facts? Here it is again:

            Please send a link proving that. I highly doubt it. At the time of this video by Wolfgang Halbig was made none lived there. In case you haven't seen it:

            They're tons of sketchy circumstantial evidence proving it was a hoax. And trust me I thought it was real from the day it happened. Not anymore, there are too many lawyers at this meeting asking for the maintenance history of the school:

            One of the biggest holes in this 'story' I always felt, was the fact that Welch allegedly pointed the gun at the only remaining Comet employee that was out back, after everyone else had high-tailed it out of there, and after he heard the gunshot, and that was classed as assault with a deadly weapon. Do you not need witnesses to such a thing to charge someone with that?

            Hey guys, I'm a lurker from day one and definitely not a researcher (chemical engineer actually) but I redpilled about 7 years ago. That red pill fucked me up for almost 5 years but I got myself together for a while now. The fact that people you thought were open minded and well educated refused to even look at facts that prove there is very very sick shit going on knocked me down big time. Some even think you are mad. Good to see more and more people waking up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know this is not the place to post this but maybe someone can repost this in a proper way. What do you guys think about this video? It's a kid/young man climbing/falling out of the window of the palace in London. If real this is some mad sick shit.

           <p>
            Word goes in the comments that there is a news article somewhere mentioning a "drunk" guy that injured himself on the lawn. I don't have time to look into that now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just delete this post mod but if there is any chance this is real we might discuss it in a properly reposted version.
           </p>
           <p>
            No intention to fuck with the rules and mess stuff up. Keep up the good work guys.

            Below is a video produced by Infowars Jon Bowne, uploaded December 4, which in conjunction with the one just furnished by V___Z dated Dec 5 proves four things. Those four things are:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Up until around the time Joe Biggs went public with his maimed child torture menu supposedly secreted away from Comet Ping Pong, which made Jones culpable, Jones and his staff at Infowars were
              <strong>
               all over
              </strong>
              the Pizzagate story.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The four month old video cited by V____Z shows Jones saying "there's strange things going on that need to be investigated" multiple times, while the guest, a CPP shooting witness who happens to be a lawyer, postures Jones on record for culpability, which Alex clues into in short order.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              V____Z is on a mission to prove Jones is a pedophile cover upperer, to borrow a term from Breitbart, and hopes no one will actually parse Jones's language in the video he provided, or listen closely to the language in the video I provided.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Jones is not and never will be a cover man for pedophiles. Jones was put in the cross-hairs as a proxy for all PG researchers not just by Alefantis, but by the six biggest media conglomerations on the planet through three near simultaneous false flag operations, the fake menu of children for sale proffered by an Infowars reporter, the gunman entering CPP, and the lawyer witness leading Jones down culpability lane in a live interview, and has done the
              <strong>
               only
              </strong>
              thing he could do, which is walk back on Alefantis, and move forward on any and every other child sex torture/slavery front that he can, because he is not a CIA assest covering for pedophiles as V____Z states.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Ie6AG4VGE">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Ie6AG4VGE
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Comet Ping Pong part starts at 2:50. This video is devastating evidence of V____Z's fraud and solid tangible evidence that this incredibly complex angle of PG played out as I describe.
           </p>
           <p>
            I made an offer to V____Z here:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1770139/8671671/10#8671671">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1770139/8671671/10#8671671
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It says: Name one other media outlet the size of Infowars that is committing a similar amount of time to covering stories of child kidnapping, child sex slavery, and pedophile rings in the U.S. right now, and I'll let you run your Jones is CIA/pedophile cover upperer program unhindered. Now that's an offer you can't refuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            The offer stands, and is being extended to all VOAT members. Submit the answer, or expect push-back everywhere until the end of time.

             National security. Classified. Active operations. Things like that and probably other reasons. CIA did the same thing with Osama bin Laden's porn stash. Both Brobible and Judicial Watch tried to FOIA it. Same judge actually on the Judicial Watch porn case as on the pizzagate shooter case. Must be some serious national security implications to pizzagate. Obama had the judge on his SCOTUS short list.

             The drag queen's name is Shea Van Horn and he is a DJ / Drag queen . He is quite popular amongst the DC demented crowd in his own right and I wondered if anyone did any digging into his background also since he was the one singing and dancing around with pedo symbols. All of D.C. is sick and demented

               I started looking into him last night but have not been sleeping well lately so everything was " fuzzy " thanks to all of this. The nightmares are whats getting to me and I feel like no one even looks at the stuff I send them or they just don't care. I just can't believe how many of these disgusting people there are.

                There's a religious saying, "let the dead bury the dead".  I'm don't trying to wake people up. So much info is on the web, if someone isn't at least curious they are being willfully ignorant. Never before in human history has so much info been available about this currier system. Enough to end the planetary ruling class, and people aren't interested. But you have 10ams of thousands of brothers and sisters here so we all good. Don't get lost in the rabbit hole, things will sort themselves out.

                 I disagree with you. There is so much disinformation on the Internet that we need to be talking with people one on one to get them to see the truth.

                  No problem. People believe what they want to believe until it comes from a source they trust.
I've been at this 15 yrs, it's personally exhausting. If people come to me I'll red pill.  I don't lie or carry water and pretend just to keep the peace about certain things. To each their own.

            This hoax is starting to look like the Foias requested for Sandy Hook data which bee tee dubs I thought was 100% real as of last week. It only took two videos over the weekend to destroy the idea Sandy Hook was real.
           </p>

           </p>

            2)
            <a href="https://youtu.be/CXeRPtj-tEU">
             Requesting a school's maintenance records shouldn't draw this many attorneys

           </p>
           <p>
            Before any sheeple start brow beating me about Sandy Hook go watch video 1). The whole town took part and it took 2 YEARS to prepare for. It was a Fema "Capstone Exercise". Each
            <s>
             crisis actor
            </s>
            parent of a child that "lost" their life was given $281,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you take away one thing it's NO ONE DIED at Sandy Hook. Any interview you see is with a crisis actor. Don't try looking up any of the parents either. None live in town anymore which is odd since every parent effected moving to another town has never happened before. There's always some but never all. ALL THE PARENTS of a child that was "killed" have left town. If you see an interview recently with a
            <s>
             crisis actor
            </s>
            parent will please consider the possibility they may have signed a contract whereby blowing the whistle means they'll have to pay back the money.
           </p>

            Now you know.

             @AreWeSure
            </a>
            has to say. If AreWeSure is legit (cough  preferred pronouns) it will give me a grievous chastisement for being such a deplorable shit lord as to think the U.S. government is capable of this much evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we don't see AreWeSure issue a verbal beat down upon my ass then you should suspect AreWeSure is a shill and knows Sandy Hook never happened because it's working for the same people who planned it.

             There was a  thread on reddit years ago if I remember right that had info about several of the parents winning the state lottery after Sandy Hook. I don't remember if it was debunked or not, but it was theorized that this is a way to make payments to the "families" for all their hardwork. It struck me as so screwed up that there is probably some truth to it.

              Yeah I saw that too but it looked sketchy at the time and to be honest looks sketchy now even though I just now figured out Sandy Hook was well orchestrated hoax to get more stringent gun laws banning assault weapons.

              Winning a lottery produces a pretty big audit trail, often winners are bought off based on the present value of their future lottery income and that's not an easy thing to do.

               Those are great points and probably why it could be bullshit. It did open my eyes to how they could funnel payments covertly using ways I hadn't even considered.

             The other possibility is that all of these 'parents' were given a child that needed to be adopted for a few weeks so they moved to Sandy Hook for a short period.  After the 'crisis' the children were taken to CPP and the actors went back to acting.

              I know sarcasm when I see it. Is that for real? Or are you just trying to be funny. I hope the latter. Taking the Sandy Hook children "to CPP" is making fun of us deplorable shit lords.

               I cannot remember the police officer's name who said was going to speak about the OKC bombing.  He had made inferences as to seeing children leaving the building before it was blown up.  He was suicided before he could make official statements.

                I understand your point now. It's all good. I highly doubt they would do something like that but it IS possible given TPTB don't mind selling crack to black people in the 80s, importing mango-flavored heroin, stealing organs from black people, and finally stealing 92% of relief money meant to go to black people.
               </p>
               <p>
                Boy TPTB sure hate black people. It's almost as if somebody dusted off Hitler's old eugenics research.

             Sandy Hook took place during a drill on a supposedly cold day. Their breath would have shown in the pictures, but the photos of the day showed it was actually warm. Hoaxes happen.

              Yep. I remember a couple of weeks ago Barbara Boxer was interviewed by the press after she'd attended a secure briefing with an intelligence committee. She looked like she had just seen a ghost. She had trouble finding the right words to say. It was very unusual. Up until then many of the Democrats brow beating us had a lot more game than they have now.

              might have noticed a change as well?
             </p>
             <p>
              I've noticed a palpable change in the Democrats since then. I think Barbara Boxer looked like she'd seen a ghost because she's been told how this thing will be brought down. I bet she's been told who will be arrested and what part of this monolithic clown fraud is going to be exposed first. I'm thinking it might be Sandy Hook as it's the most recent of these infamous "conspiracy theory" events.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the truth comes out on Sandy Hook then Barack Obama will be arrested within 24 hours and charged with treason. I'm at about 90% sure at this point. Last week I didn't think Sandy Hook was a hoax. I was 100% sure it was a real tragedy.

               Considering the recent Susan rice story (surveillancegate) it could also have been about that, I think big names will down for this too. Obama just happens to be untouchable, his CIA handlers have him in French Poynesia right now.

             Comet Ping Pong was a false flag, most likely by the Russians... They managed to go back in time and plant years worth of circumstantial evidence.

            This FOIA will never go anywhere unfortunately.  Does anyone else remember that the Washington D.C. Metro cameras looking at CPP were moved the day before the "Shooting"?  The entire community was saying "be prepared for a false flag attack", and shockingly the next day it happened..... There was a whole thread about it, which I can't find using the search bar...
