            She is literally a puppet master.  Also why doesn't anyone ever ask her why she abandoned young Julian to a cult funded by the CIA?  If you look at old film you can tell he was there for years, not the alleged three months or whatever.

            Not a Q'er but this was posted in comments, and has a great timeline for those politically confused. Worthy of it's own post.

            My gut says psyop/disinfo on some level. To tweet, then delete, days prior to an article naming Donna Brazille &amp; DC mayor in e.r. where Seth Rich is brought after being shot?? I don't know enough about Assange's mother, but regardless, it could also be someone else tweeting from her account.

            I remember this was discussed quite a bit on reddit and researched.  I remember that his Mother had to move Julian around to protect him from a cult that his mother's boyfriend belonged to. He belonged the The Family Cult.  Possibly this is where the story mushroomed into what we have been told by the MSM.  Here are two links regarding the bf of the mother belonging to a cult and Julian intimating the same thing.  This is what we had discovered on reddit after researching.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/growing-up-with-the-family-inside-anne-hamilton-byrnes-sinister-cult">
             https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/growing-up-with-the-family-inside-anne-hamilton-byrnes-sinister-cult
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            A few years ago speculation emerged that Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had grown up in The Family. His hair colour didn’t help nor, possibly, his personality. Assange admitted that a man who was his mother’s boyfriend in the late 1970s had been a member of the cult. The man had been “a sinister presence” who sought to have “a certain psychological power” over his family, Assange said, and they eventually went on the run from him. But he said he never met Hamilton-Byrne or had any direct contact with the group as a whole.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/07/no-secrets">
             https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/07/no-secrets
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            When Assange was eight, Claire left her husband and began seeing a musician, with whom she had another child, a boy. The relationship was tempestuous; the musician became abusive, she says, and they separated. A fight ensued over the custody of Assange’s half brother, and Claire felt threatened, fearing that the musician would take away her son. Assange recalled her saying, “Now we need to disappear,” and he lived on the run with her from the age of eleven to sixteen. When I asked him about the experience, he told me that there was evidence that the man belonged to a powerful cult called the Family—its motto was “Unseen, Unknown, and Unheard.” Some members were doctors who persuaded mothers to give up their newborn children to the cult’s leader, Anne Hamilton-Byrne. The cult had moles in government, Assange suspected, who provided the musician with leads on Claire’s whereabouts. In fact, Claire often told friends where she had gone, or hid in places where she had lived before.
           </p>
           <p>
            HERE is something in this article that I found extremely interesting about Claire, Julian's mother,  that I never knew.   She was amazingly resourceful.  She burned her school books and lived a kind of Tom Sawyer life when young.  "I had my own horse.  I built my own raft.  I went fishing. I was going down mine shafts and tunnels"
           </p>
           <p>
            Also From The Article:      Assange’s mother believed that formal education would inculcate an unhealthy respect for authority in her children and dampen their will to learn. “I didn’t want their spirits broken,” she told me. In any event, the family had moved thirty-seven times by the time Assange was fourteen, making consistent education impossible. He was homeschooled, sometimes, and he took correspondence classes and studied informally with university professors. But mostly he read on his own, voraciously. He was drawn to science. “I spent a lot of time in libraries going from one thing to another, looking closely at the books I found in citations, and followed that trail,” he recalled. He absorbed a large vocabulary, but only later did he learn how to pronounce all the words that he learned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Claire sounds to me to be the type of Mother that was extremely courageous and protected her children at all costs.

             Agree, I have two issues with this but I reserve the right to get excited at later point.
            </p>

              <p>
               Julian Assange's mother was in a cult "the family" which was on face value state sponsored and supported. Julian was only a child so didn't have a choice but she was a willing and informed member. So credibility from the get go is thin.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Julian has been under 24 hour surveillance since the day that happened and before, so what did he ring his mum to tell her about his exciting leak?
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             She probably just has eyes and a functioning brain and put the pieces together herself, Julian has spelled it out on numerous occasions just falling short of actually naming Seth.

              Yeah, agreed on the first. nowadays however she runs a puppeteering workshop and has been well known for a long time for that, and she is very talented. Assange himself rebelling from the cult life was a good part of what led him to do what he did.

              Wouldnt assume his mum is dumb by any means, theres just no indicator from her that shes got any more involvement than being his mum.

              I have no insider information or anything like that, this is just my impression of them. As far as im fucking concerned the Australian government who often demands self admitted drug smugglers are given special treatment in indonesia and not executed needs to grow some fucking balls and demand their innocent citizen that embarrassed the fuck out of them what, 20 years ago now, is allowed to come home safely.

              Hows this for a weird co-inkidink a couple of years back - Im managing an apartment block of some 500 residential flats. I befriend one of the female residents who it turns out is - one of 'the family' children, and one of my bosses? Yeah he was once one of the cops that was chasing Assange....

               Very interesting I was not aware that his mother is currently known in the public sphere, I will be honest and its an opinion I get brutalised for often on voat but thats fine too. I REALLY do not trust WL at all or Assange, leaks all good and accurate but the motivations and intentions are so questionable, the sheer number of promised leaks that never materialised makes me concerned also, I digress.

               I think I would have moved state if that happened to me, I would have gotten a serious blast of paranoia! How many of the tennants are from cults or programs and am I helping manage these assets. What if I see something im not supposed to? Bail !
