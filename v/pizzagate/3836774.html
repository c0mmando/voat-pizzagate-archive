<blockquote>
<p>ALTOONA, Wis. (AP) — A school superintendent in western Wisconsin was arrested Thursday on federal charges of the sex trafficking of a minor and production of child pornography.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury indicted Altoona school Superintendent Daniel Peggs last week, and the indictment was unsealed after Peggs’ arrest, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin, Scott Blader, and Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said Thursday.</p>
<p>Peggs, 32, was arrested about 7 a.m. Thursday on his way to school, Altoona school board President Robin Elvig told the Leader-Telegram.</p>
<p>“Utter shock is an understatement,” Elvig said. “I’m still in shock.”</p>
<p>The Altoona school board chose Peggs as its new superintendent in February 2019 and he began serving in that position in July. Before that, he had been Altoona’s middle-school principal since 2016.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges that between October 2015 through May 2016, Peggs recruited an underage female for a commercial sex act and used an iPhone to produce a video of child pornography in December 2015.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does somebody this young become a principal or school superintendent? When Peggs was hired into his job as superintendent, he promised to &quot;build trust&quot; after a controversy with the previous superintendent, who had &quot;created an abrasive and fearful work environment&quot;, leading to many staff members resigning.</p>
<p>Peggs was <a href="https://archive.is/vfl42">released from custody almost immediately</a> and is under house arrest. Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie Pfluger did not object to Peggs\' release.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/iHEtC">Although he appears to have been fired in March</a>, School Board President Robin Elvig said at a news conference on the day of his arrest that when Peggs is released from custody, the district will <strong>place him on administrative leave.</strong> Apparently Peggs is entitled (by law) to the remainder of his accumulated vacation time. Peggs is the <a href="https://archive.is/95oMO"><em>third Wisconsin educator to be federally charged with sex crimes this year</em></a>. He was arrested in <em>February.</em></p>
<p>His arrest resulted in <a href="https://archive.is/17K6A">his wife receiving over $22,000 in &quot;donations&quot; within a week</a> from a drive set up by mental health counselor Melissa M. Jenneman. His wife, <a href="https://archive.is/FMGwv">Ashley Peggs, was also part of the Altoona school district.</a> She is a former second grade teacher and is now a stay-at-home mom of her four girls. She is also a Children’s Museum of Eau Claire Ambassador.</p>',

            Hello New here I am searching for anyone else who was a victim or even acquaintance of Jeffrey Epstein at Interlochen Music Camp in Michigan. Anytime, but particularly early 90s or late 80s. My name is Joy, I auditioned for Interlochen Music Camp in Jr high, as a dancer and singer. After reading all the Epstein news stories, I am trying to make sense of the abuse I went through and who all was involved. I don't think I should name names but I remember my 5 fellows and we were all from Oakland County Michigan, same as Sarah Ruth Ashcraft, who said she was abused by Tom Hanks. I know I am not alone in this. We auditioned ensemble for voice, piano, cello, violin or viola and maybe more. And we were recorded. I am looking so hard to find those other Jr high or other students I auditioned with, question, as I sure some or all of you remember what happened. Please contact me so we can put this puzzle together and even press charges. Please contact me even if you do not want to press charges. I hope you have healed and I want to be in this together for justice. I hope to connect with the others from ensemble and audition. I appreciate any help.

            pizzagate is THE conspiracy not A conspiracy, i believe most if not all recent world events are a direct resault of this pedo mafia.from trying to protect themselves, to being blackmailed by who knows how many people all  pulling them in different directions.All the while this political crime mafia is desprately tring to stay on the high wire they walk. it seems in their desperation hubrus and down right stupidity has them attempting anything to escape judgement. Even if it means destroying the whole world in what they see as a sacrafice. May what ever Gods exsist , help us.
