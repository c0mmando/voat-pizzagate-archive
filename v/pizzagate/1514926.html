<p>The case was prosecuted behind closed doors, with no defence mounted (evidence was overwhelming). Beau Biden thought the case so significant to prosecute he publicly announced he wasn\'t running for the Senate seat in order to handle this.</p>
<p><strong>A story about Rehoboth:</strong></p>
<p>Rehoboth beach has a population of 1,398, with many temporary tourist residents and holiday homes. Joe Biden visits, he was there for a birthday weekend of 20th Nov 2016 for example. David Brock lived there for a decade before dating Alefantis.</p>
<p>Chip Hearn of Rehoboth beach, owner of the Peppers Hot Sauce shop and Ice Cream Store (Joe Biden\'s photo is on the menu page) posted a YouTube video Nov 21st 2016 titled &quot;Housing video&quot;, where he silently presents a facility of tiny empty rooms for 50 seconds.</p>
<p>There is a Grotto Pizza with a \'Swirl Club\', and a Ledo\'s Pizza, within 0.3 miles of Chip Hearn\'s Peppers hot sauce shop in Rehoboth beach. Warehouse nearby in wider Lewes, location unknown, recent forklift job-listing confirms it exists.</p>

            I would like to point out that B. Biden was in charge of the prosecution of the DuPont case. If you don't know of it in Delaware research. The Dupont's are one of the wealthier families ever. One of their own was caught as a horrid perpetrator who raped his 3 year old daughter. Biden allowed no jail time. He walked free. That is the real story.
