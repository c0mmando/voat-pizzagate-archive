<p>There is much negativity on the web surrounding this man, and the jury is still out as far as I am concerned, but one thing is for certain - he has dedicated decades of his life fighting for others and presents himself as an intelligent, well-educated, kind, and rational individual who has stood his ground no matter what. Annette has been called every name in the book, yet perseveres. Negative criticism about him far outweighs accolades. This post serves to provide more substantive info about this man than what has previously been reported on this forum.

<p>Kevin Annett comes across as a sincere man on a spiritual mission to correct the grave injustices in the world - particularly the abuse of the weak, namely children. His drive and mission go way beyond the legal aspect. He is primarily involved in accelerating an awareness process - by pointing out rights that people naturally have, averse to authority or hierarchy, and by encouraging people to reclaim these rights.</p>
<p>Annett, 62- years old and a Canadian, graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BS in anthropology and political science. He then graduated from the Vancouver School of Theology with a Master of Divinity and was ordained. From early in his ministry, he was puzzled by total absence of indigenous people from church and set out to discover why this should be. Going down this road proved disastrous. His marriage and family were torn apart which rendered him destitute.</p>
<p>A few of the stories that Annett circulated about the indigenous: Back in the 1930\'s, a team of German doctors arrived at the Kuper Island residential school and began conducting strange medical experiments on children by injecting them with some sort of toxin. Several children were killed as a result. In the 1950\'s and 1960\'s, aboriginal children at a Vancouver Island medical research facility were tortured with electrodes implanted in their skulls. At the Hobbema and Saddle Lake Indian residential schools in Alberta, children were incinerated in furnaces. At St. Anne\'s Indian residential school in Ontario, children were executed in an electric chair. At McGill University in Montreal, there is a mass grave containing the bodies of aboriginal children killed in experiments undertaken by CIA\'s MK-Ultra program. <a href="https://shar.es/1LtaEn">https://shar.es/1LtaEn</a> <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Kevin_Annett">https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Kevin_Annett</a> <a href="https://thetyee.ca/Views/2008/04/30/TruthAndAbuse">https://thetyee.ca/Views/2008/04/30/TruthAndAbuse</a></p>
<p>Here is an article refuting Annett\'s stories and allegations
<a href="http://www.jlsreport.com/2016/01/07/the-truth-about-kevin-annett-and-aboriginal-abuse/">http://www.jlsreport.com/2016/01/07/the-truth-about-kevin-annett-and-aboriginal-abuse/</a></p>
<p>Welcome to The International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State (ITCCS), founded by Kevin Annette on June 15, 2010. Their mandate is: (1) To lawfully prosecute those people and institutions responsible for the exploitation, trafficking, torture, and murder of children, past and present, and (2) To stop these and other criminal actions by Church and State, including the disestablishment of those said institutions.</p>
<p>On April 15, 2018, Annett has announced that a global campaign will commence to halt child trafficking and other genocidal actions by the Vatican, other churches, governments, and corporations.</p>
<p>The ITCCS website reveals it was founded with a twofold purpose: to unite across borders all those who have been harmed by church and state and to stop the crimes of these institutions, especially those inflicted on children, human liberties, and planet Earth.</p>
<p>Annett claims the ITCCS arose from among survivors of those crimes with the understanding gained from bitter experience that a new international ethos and legal system is required to confront and expatriate crimes committed by institutions of church and state, especially those historically immune from prosecution, like the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>Resulting from the above, The International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ) was founded as a lawful Citizens\' Tribunal of Conscience on September 15, 2012 in Brussels. The ICLCJ was established as the legal and judicial arm of the ITCCS with the help of legal experts, judges, and survivors of church terror and imperial genocide in more than a dozen countries.</p>
<p>The first case on the docket of the ICLCJ comnenced on November 6, 2012 and addressed deliberate genocide of indigenous children in Canada by the Vatican, the Crown of England and other parties. In a final verdict on February 25, 2013, the Court and it\'s 58 sworn citizen jurors successfully indicted and prosecuted 30 defendants for perpetrating or concealing this genocide. Those defendants included then Pope Benedict, Joseph Ratzwinger, former Cardinal Tarcissio Bertone, Elizabeth Windsor, &quot;Queen of England,&quot; and Prime Minister Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>After an &quot;exhaustive&quot; presentation of evidence and a refusal by defendants to respond or refute the evidence, all of the defendants were found guilty of criminal conspiracy and genocide and were sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison and the forfeit of all the wealth and property of their estates and institutions. Citizen arrest warrants were issued and on August 4, 2013, the Vatican and the Crown of England were declared to be transnational Criminal bodies under international law and were lawfully disestablished.</p>
<p>Crazy, huh? But you cannot deny the passion and perseverance behind it! <a href="http://itccs.org">http://itccs.org</a> <a href="http://www.ellaster.nl/2016/08/06/the-emergence-kevin-annett-and-the-itccs-and-the-plan-to-bring-him-down/">http://www.ellaster.nl/2016/08/06/the-emergence-kevin-annett-and-the-itccs-and-the-plan-to-bring-him-down/</a></p>
<p>Kevin Annett became discredited through Alfred L. Webre, who is a controversial figure himself who wears many hats (lawyer, space activist, peaced activist, futurist, founder of Exopolitcs, etc.). Annett had a steady platform to share his findings on a regular basis. Through frequent interviews, he was able to publicize the progress the ITCCS made, however, by the end of 2014, Alfred Webre dropped Kevin like a rock. Alfred accused him that the ITCCS court had never existed and that the alleged lawsuit against the Vatican and British government had never taken place. Furthermore, he insinuated that Annette operated alone like a Wizard of Oz while pretending to be part of a large organization. Annett denied Alfred the names of the involved judges, prosecutors, and jury members. He was concerned they would lose their anonymity. Webre broke all ties with Annett, smeared his reputation, and discredited the entire ITCCS.

<p>It seems unlikely that Annett has operated solely all this time. He had been the victim of a smear and slander campaign for years. It appears that the break with Webre was the final blow. An interesting fact is that Webre revealed he had a Jesuit background but had broken from them and that a family member of his held a high position with the Vatican.</p>
<p>The break and smear campaign created doubt and caused people to turn away.  Many goals of the ITCCS remain on the shelf, and indictments and investigations against new suspects were held off.  Despite all, Kevin Annett simply has carried on with his work to bring the crimes committed by church and state to the surface.

            If he IS legit, then I may owe an apology. For now, I stand on my previous judgement that he is dangerous to our work. I can’t tell if he is nuts/lark/disinformation/psyop. If he is legit then where are his real accomplishments. I do respect his research on the historical abuses in Canada.... 
if he is real, he is a champion of pizzagate, others researchers, investigators and victims should respect him. He should not have any connections to suspicious orgs or pizzagate suspects.

               No.  I never heard of Kevin Annett before 2 days ago. Have not read the book but have visually scanned and read several segments.  It's impressive.

             Synopsis
            </p>
            <p>
             An organized system of abduction, exploitation, torture and murder of large numbers of women and children appears to exist on Canada ’s west coast, and is operated and protected in part by sectors of the RCMP, the Vancouver Police Department (VPD), the judiciary, and members of the British Columbia government and federal government of Canada , including the Canadian military.
            </p>
            <p>
             This system is highly funded and linked to criminal organizations including the Hell’s Angels, the Hong Kong Triad, and unnamed individual “free lance” mobsters from Vancouver and the USA. It is funded in part by a massive drug trade, with which it is intimately connected.
            </p>
            <p>
             This system is decades-old and has been supplied for many years with women and children from aboriginal reserves and residential schools, with the paid collusion of lawyers, clergy and officials of the Roman Catholic, Anglican and United Church of Canada, along with state-funded aboriginal leaders and officials of the Department of Indian Affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
             This system is international in scope, Vancouver being one spoke in a wheel of pedophilia, sex slavery, human organ black markets, “snuff” films and violent child pornography that has outlets throughout the Pacific Rim world, particularly in China and Thailand .
            </p>
            <p>
             This system relies upon a network of complicity extending to the highest levels of power in Canada and other nations, involving coroners, judges, doctors, clergy, politicians and social workers, as well as the media. It also relies upon a network of “body dumping grounds” and mass graves, located in remote rural areas or on aboriginal reserves and both church and Crown land, where human remains are regularly disposed of by RCMP officers.
            </p>
            <p>
             This system is kept in place because of a practice and philosophy of unofficial tolerance and protection by the established police, judicial, military, church and governmental institutions in Canada and elsewhere. The crimes committed by individual officers of the police, churches, court and government against women and children caught in this system are known and tolerated by these institutions.

            Hi 13Buddha, I am very glad you have made this post. I've been hoping for months someone would do a deep dive to determine whether this guy was nuts, a disinfo agent, or what. I have to give you the 24 Hour flair, though, because you need links supporting each of the major elements you've included here. It seems you have more here than the first version that you deleted, but could you give the timestamped spots in the videos that pertain to each of the parts of your post? An maybe connect the links more specifically to the elements of your thread?
           </p>
           <p>
            We need the link to Webre's supposed compromised background supporting your characterization of his disassociating himself from Annett as a "smear".
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully some others can help dig up more information about Annett. Due to his disingenuous practices (running multiple websites that appear independent to comment on his activities and buttress his claims, posing as a legal authority, etc.) I fear he is exploiting victims for the purpose of advancing the deep state psyop that citizen child advocates are all loons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do reply to this comment and let me know when you've added all the links to where you got this information, and I will promptly remove the flair. :-)
