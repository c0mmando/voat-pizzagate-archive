            Lemme throw something out here to consider and debate:
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is it only the last 10 years or so where we have seen an absolute flood of what could generally be considered "hot teachers" sleeping with their male students?
           </p>
           <p>
            Now let me first say, I personally don't believe that a female can "rape" a male.  There is a lot of physiology which goes into "rape" or "sexual assault", and having been a teenager once, I'm pretty confident that once a 16 yo boy gets horned up, there is no stopping him.  Or stopping him from telling his friends.  OR stopping any of his friends from attempting a turn at it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is causing this recent uptick in teachers screwing male students? Is this some side effect of social media?  Is it "ambient MKU" - pharma, TV, internet-based mind control related programs?  Is this "social engineering" in action? What happens when you add all of these environmental factors, plus the constant feed of sexual-related themes in all forms, at all ages - Elsa, Disney, TV, YT, Internet, sex education, teaching grade schoolers about homosexual gangbangs, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something is wrong with millennials and younger - society, entertainment, prescription drugs, etc. is having an effect on young women (who likely have manchildren has husbands).  Houston we have a problem...

             Of course you can be raped if you are a male.  Involuntary body responses like getting a hard on does not mean you're enjoying it.  What a load of utter bollocks, how dare you.

              There is no "how dare you" to my statement.  This is obviously a very abbreviated manner to debate this (or any) topic.  There should be no ambiguity of my position on the matter of abuse of children.  I think my record stands.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, I am talking about something very specific - adult women teacher and 15+ yo male students.  No, they shouldn't be fooling around with them under any circumstances.  But I CHALLENGE you to find one, normal (not confused homosexual, abused, or other "not normal"), teenage boy who would nail a hot teacher in NY minute, given half the chance.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have you been a teenage boy before (with a sex drive)?

               No, but I've been a teenage girl with a high sex drive. Lol, shit, I wanted to bang some of my hot male teachers. But like, I didn't because a) I was a kid and sex is for adults and b) I was a kid and they were adults.  They knew that and I knew that.  If the male teacher got done for screwing 15 year old me, would you say that was wrong?  Of course it is...the teacher should have known I can't consent in the eyes of the law and he could get in trouble.  So why is it any different because it's a hot female teacher?  Let's not normalise any sort of pedophilia here, please

                I'll give you two thumbs up for an honest retort from a female perspective.  There has always been a double standard.  If anything, that is a feminist's point of view.  It does exist.
               </p>
               <p>
                Males are always going to be stronger and more imposing than a woman.  Any one of those boys could've walked out if they had wanted to.  I don't believe the choice would have been as easy for girls in a similar circumstance.

                 Thanks...still not getting how you're not seeing it tho. The female teacher is a perv, she abuses her position of power and sleeps with a young school boy because that's what turns her on...it's wrong, it's predatory, no??? Even if those boys could've walked out, I'm thinking wtf is wrong with her in the first place, and also she is still a pedo. I don't think that is a feminist perspective, I don't personally use that label, for me what I'm saying is just...normal...even if you were once a horny teenage boy

                  Different viewpoints, but I think we are all here for the same reason.  I'll say again - there isn't one of those boys who isn't going to brag about that story at some point in their life.  There isn't one girl who will be boast of what she's "done".

                   So what if  they boast? You're missing the point again. The teacher is a pedo. That's why it's wrong. It doesn't matter if I slept with my 30 year old teacher at 13 and loved it, because he is a pedo by definition, and should have known better. Do you get it a bit now? The gloating means nothing because it was at the hands of a pedo. It's against the law. It's so simple.

             Social engineering.

            <p>
             And a woman not being to rape a male is not true. In the case of an "older" woman raping a child, it's even more doable. I think you're getting the word "rape" confused with "force". It's what Whoopie postulated with her Polanski defense of his rape not being "rape-rape". A teacher, coach, therapist are in unique positions. The child is "forced" to be in their territory and has to interact. The fact that the teacher probably groomed hm by inviting him back to her home for drinks ... being cool ... grooming him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The law is there to protect sixteen-year-olds from being put in that position, but nonetheless, it happens. Look at the revelations about the U.S. gymnastic doctor that molested all those young girls. So t's not "rape" because he didn't force them down, pin them to the ground and rape them? Yeah, it is! And what you brought up is exactly why the law is in place. Adult women have no business grooming young boys. As for your question, I think it's partly social engineering and partly that The Cannibal Elite made it acceptable. It's only going to get worse if we allow these laws to change. They're trying everything they can and Jerry Brown &amp; the sickos out there did "modernize" the Sex Offender Registry laws by allowing adult men and women convicted of possesssing child porn to BE DROPPED FROM THE REGISTRY AFTER 10 YEARS!!! In this case, they made up the bogus excuse it was interfering with police from finding REAL sex offenders. Excuse me Californication: THEY ARE REAL SEX OFFENDERS!!!

              It's a very grey area.  I'm not advocating or condoning.  All I am saying is that there is a bit of a double standard when it comes to female-on-male "sex crimes" within a reasonable age range.  I'm talking about boys who 70 years ago would have gone off to war.
             </p>
             <p>
              All that being said, I don't think the 'bar" needs to be lowered, because that's how it starts.  First 18 was the bar, then 16, then...  I get it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not saying that what any of the teachers did was right, as they had the power to shut it down and say "no" at any point.  I am saying by the time the contact was physical, most teenage boys would need to be hit with a firehose to stand down.

               I hear you, but that's no excuse for an adult to target a minor.

              <p>
               We don't really know anything about this story. When she met, how she groomed him, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on the "slippery slope" argument. We don't need to be lowering the age limit. Let me put it this way, it's there to protect the child IF grooming, alcohol, drugs, or force was used, and children should be protected.

                Yeah, we are seeing more or less, eye-to-eye.  Things get a lot more complex, and damning, when you add intoxicants to the mix.  Then it becomes pretty apparent that an adult is making an attempt to take advantage of a child.

                 Absolutely. I just made a comment about the "twink parties" thrown by Singer on another thread. It's what these teachers do. Invite a bunch of kids over and use liquor, etc. to drop their guard. The other thing is that these pedos are PREDATORS. Predators are well-practiced manipulators. They've done it before and will again. It's not like going out to a baseball game and meeting someone you think is attractive. This more like going to be baseball game and meeting SATAN!!! They know how to use psychology, flip the script, and get the victim to do what they want.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's not the same as regular attraction. It just isn't.

                  It's the behavior of a sociopath.  I am very well acquainted with their traits  Professional liars.  More lies.  Tell you whatever you want to hear.  Masters of blame everyone else.  It's your fault not theirs.  Master of the circuitous argument.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Again...all I am saying is that if there is a hot 28 year old teacher (who is a predator), who invites a pair of 16 yo boys over to her house to party and make her airtight, I can assure you that the boys are generally very willing participants, unless there is something else - grades, blackmail, innuendo, etc - used to coerce.  The predatory teacher knows this is the behavior of teenage boys and uses it to her advantage or to satifisy desires or feed her psychoses.

                  I'd like to think people can be more open minded than that if you explain things in a way they can understand it.

                  We need "snowflakes" normies, etc to understand what's going on. I don't think of them as my enemy, but I felt betrayed by them as a young child and I feel disappointed in them now. I totally understand why you'd talk about them this way.

                   There's a Harvard-trained psychologist that was talking "assassination", until I told her to STFU. She told me she was only quoting an article she read and I told her that I wouldn't sit there and listen to anyone talking violence. Then I was in the doctor's office. A f*cking idiot came into the cubicle of the phlebotomist. The phlebotomist said that she finally got through to relatives in Puerto Rico. The idiot asked, "And?" The phlebotomist said they were fine and had food and water to drink. I was thinking the idiot should say, "Thank God, the stories aren't true!" But she said, "Trump is such a moron! He can't do anything right!" The phlebotomist (also an idiot) agreed and they went on a ten minute rant about how stupid he was! He's stupid when there was nothing wrong? How does that work? Then there's the legalization of teenage sex in California, and the legalization of people who know they have AIDS giving blood! I posted about it and was barraged with comments like, "It's not legal ... it's decriminalized." LEGAL MEANS DECRIMINALIZED. Abortion is legal/decriminalized. Then there's the dropping of people possessing child porn from the Sex Offender Registry after 10 years. The term used there was "modernizing"! In our city which is run by a terrorist dem mayor, we have drugs, prostitution, crime, and homeless roaming the streets like zombies. But you know what the Snowflakes say? That none of that is his fault!!!! Really? Whose fault is it? The Easter bunny? Even with the Biden video where he's CLEARLY molesting children, they don't see anything. NOTHING!!!! They deny what's in front of their own eyes!

It's why people are being attacked for wearing a MAGA hat, statues are being vandalized, and fucking football players that haven't the brain it takes to get out of banking dog fighting and other illicit activities are taking a knee to protest their success! Whatever. We disagree. So be it.

               It's harder for boys and men to come forward about sexual abuse. They're "supposed" to want sex no matter what. It's bullshit.

              <p>
               I think there is probably the same amount of female pedophiles as there are male ones. In my experience, female ones are a little more manipulative and make it seem like they're being nurturing. Like a sneaky mother figure.

                So much BS out there really.  People need to get over what other people say.  Ugh.  Sneaky yes, and fake nurturing.  Yes, and men get into Boy Scouts and Sports to get near the Boys.  Terrible on both sides.   Either way it is disgusting  and so are they.  It could be that the statistics about there being more men may be a sneaky tactic by them so parents warn their kids about men and to trust the women.  We should just teach kids that no adult is allowed to touch them in  those places.  Men nor Women.

               You're right. They hope they're more sympathetic, but not to me.

               It's like parents that torture or kill their children. Could care less if it's a mother or father that did it. They're going to jail!
