            Yes I laughed about it all too at first. Maybe you can take solace in the fact that the other three were caught off guard by it all, and were really traumatized by what they went through. There's a few good radio interviews on youtube about the subject btw. But the book Billy's Back is what convinced me. It has to be Paul (Faul).

            Sorry for the long comment. Yes it is mind-blowing, and I hated this conspiracy because I was raised on the Beatles. But I never gave up looking into it, and I finally had to accept it as true. The documentary The Winged Beatle (it keeps getting taken down on youtube but I believe you can find it) is extravagantly produced and privy to much inside and rare info and believed to be done by Sir Paul himself. (He is chomping at the bit to be recognized for the songs he wrote, before he dies, his name is William (Bill) Shepard, a talented Scottish studio musician.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Voat won't let me give the link to amazon, so just google it :)
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the link for the condensed book (amazon link) "Billy's Back" (read the reviews), and the complete book should be right there alongside that one, it is The Memoirs of Billy Shears. You will never listen to any (post 1966) Beatles song the same again. Why, indeed, did she "come in through the bathroom window"? And what does "one and one and one is three" mean? And from Wings, "the undertaker drew a heavy sigh as he fell into the sun ... and the first one said to the second one there, I hope you're having fun."
           </p>
           <p>
            I am so verbose when it comes to this. sigh

            I think Polanski gave her quaaludes.

Didn't he also seduce the 15yr old Nastassia Kinski?

            Whoopi Goldberg..... Not impressed. Useless celebrity(most are). I don't dislike her as a person though. She is pretty average... Doesn't deserve the platform and influence she has.

            Actually though I really did use to hear that, and it may be true.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is pretty much undeniable now, that McCartney really did die and was replaced. (Crazy I know.) The new guy (Faul) was/is a bit of a narcissist, and it was through him that the Beatles were infiltrated by nefarious forces. The others hated him which led to the break-up. This is when and why their music changed and became spooky.
           </p>
           <p>
            The remaining three were devastated by it. So I think they were pretty much caught off guard and ended up traumatized. Read The Memoirs of Billy Shears, or the condensed version Billy's Back. I believe it is the truth, and Sir Paul (Faul) is personally writing through a ghostwriter and a pseudonym. It explains everything, and this is why Heather Mills is so freaked and scared for her life. Lennon lost so many friends and it went deep, but losing his childhood mate was the worst. (As even Faul admits in the book.)

            At the 34 second mark you hear John say some have gone (and you see the old Paul), and then he says "and some remain," and you see the new Paul (Faul, as in false Paul).

             At the 56 mark Lennon says he's "loved them all," but the following photos focus on all but Paul, but esp. Harrison.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the 1:30 mark we see all his long dead buddies and friends (including manager Epstein), they all died young, one of them good friend Stu Stutcliffe - but we see Paul last - singled out, as he was the most special to Lennon. And interestingly, at the 2:14 mark, the video is closed w/ the infamous clip of the Beatles all wearing red carnations except for Paul (Faul) who is wearing black.

            That's what I always heard. But a google search just brings up his advances toward Mia (so I didn't mention it). Maybe you have a source. There are other reports that the fallout was because Yogi didn't like their drug use, but I don't believe that, as Lennon was so bitter, and for other reasons. Manson called one of his girls Sexy Sadie.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Dear Prudence song was about Prudence Farrow, about how she wouldn't socialize during the trip (too busy meditating) and in a Rolling Stone article she states confusion about the fallout and has nothing bad to say about Yogi.
           </p>
           <p>
            "John and George left the retreat without them finishing the course. It's been widely reported that there was a schism between them and the Maharishi. What is your take on what happened?
I was sad that they left because it was very, very sudden. They had been doing eight hours a day of meditation for two months. It was sad and disturbing to see. I can't speak on what went on — I sort of know, but I don't want to speculate on things that I don't really know. I was there when John was saying to Maharishi that he had to leave." - Prudence interview

            Very important...Penelope Cruz, whose name is on the petition, denies signing it and stated she has no idea how her name got on there. Hearing that made me wonder about all the other names on the list.  Thoughts?

            Family exposing her to drugs/cocaine obviously set her off on a sad path, but was even sadder to hear that she had suffered sexual abuse by her father.  MacKensie is a fine actress despite all of it.

            Whoopi is the most arrogant obnoxious limousine liberal in the world. I hate her so much. I want to send her back in time to the 1700's so she can be kept as a slave on a cotton plantation in Alabama made to suffer in the hot sun it's what she deserves. She is disgusting and she's a vile racist to boot.

            Yeah and there are three different threads on the front page now about celebs who support polanski, but the fake mods and shills aren't making that a reality. Ignore George Webb's findings, ignore the economic angle, everyone pay attention to some conspiracy hysteria that furthers no investigation whatsoever.

             Whoopie was almost married to a man who wore blackface to her roast. She's not known for her moral compass. But if you want to insist this means she's in on something, knock yourselves the fuck out. Retards.

            Downvote me and act butthurt all you want. Milo is relevant bc he's contemporary, as is what's happening to him. Again, I don't disagree Woody Allen is disgusting, and i'm not an apologist for Polanski, no matter how much you want to pretend that this is pedogate related. I just don't get how bringing up long-established cases of Hollywood's sketchy "morality" re: it's icons conduct furthers the investigation. I'm merely saying that this ought not to be a front page topic, it merely dilutes and distracts from the current investigations. Considering how repeatedly you keep downvoting me and acting like i'm the one being obtuse, i'm going to conclude you're a shill. You should have posted this as a comment to support some investigative researcher's conclusions, not insisted this was in any way constitutes some finding, which is my beef.

              You're the authority on what they teach in shill school, being the shill. Hey everyone, go check out my comment history. tell me whether you don't believe i'm well-intentioned and honest. Then go read awarenessadventurer and tell me you believe it's not her job to fuck up our boards. You're welcome everyone, oh and thank you shill for trying to assassinate my character in unrelated threads because I called you out in yours. Classy, they must teach that in shill school.

            And speaking of the pedophile Woody Allen, I can't believe the amount of Hollywood support that he has.  Any actor that agrees to be in his films has no self-respect and is a fucking hypocrite.

            Maybe because you're on a pizzagate forum posting long-standing well-known public information like it in any ways furthers the investigation. I'm not trying to make light of the culture of pedophilia alive and well in hollywood, i'm pointing out that this is a drop in the bucket and really seemingly off-topic. Statutory rape is not pedogate.

             The Holocaust wasn't murder.  It was Labor camps...  51 cremation ovens don't cremate 4,000 bodies a day to account for what they claim happened at Auschwitz.  Hitler was a Zionist who worked with the Jews to help them get a state....  ok ok ... I will leave it alone, but you need to check this out.  It was a hoax for real.  The jews got lifetime welfare checks for being alive during ww2 and their own country.

              2.5 hours is about what it takes in a modern oven.  The disruption of supply lines lead to the photos of starving folks at the end of the war and the pictures of bodies pushed by bulldozers was from the Allies who were providing burial for the diseased dead that they found upon arrival.   Not they were not able to wisk them into a cremator either...

               They had a swimming pool, a theater, and camp money they earned form labor that they could spend at the camp.   The gates read "work shall set you free" on the bars when they entered and the piles and piles of hair and zicom b was from the attempts to control the lice.   The area that was said to be the gas chamber had the chimneys put in after the war that they claim the cans were tossed into.  Ariel photography during the war did not show this.

                There was also a septic drain in the room and a wall that was removed.  The doors opened out not in so the claim that they would push up against the door and close their selves in was also false.  Hitler needed their labor to sustain the war effort LOL.  The evidence goes on and on and on and on....

                 ~2 mill before the war in census 6 mill claimed to have been killed and around 3 mill survived????  Really  it sounds reasonable to me that the greater of the German population would not unite to ethnically cleanse the nation of Jews.  They were predominantly a Christian Nation... Hence they kept the Priest on the longest who wrote that poem "and then they came..."

                   David Cole did a documentary where he filmed his visit.  There is a good Montel Williams show from back in the day lol..  It's worth the watch.  I like the one the guy puts the comment boxes up to explain who the shills are its just funny.  Then there is a 3 for 1 Talmud, Judaism, Holocaust expose that is super packed with info and contrast with the Bible to attack the Zionism in the modern Christian Church.  It even goes over Albert Pike and Freemasonry in America and mentions the Rothschild's.  Super worth the watch, ties a lot together.

            Whoopi actually said that? What a fuckin idiot. It may not have been violent rape, but you don't get a girl drunk and drugged up and say it's consensual. Way different than what Bill Maher and Milo said.

            Here is a summary:  A young couple move into an apartment, only to be surrounded by peculiar neighbors and occurrences. When the wife becomes mysteriously pregnant, paranoia over the safety of her unborn child begins to control her life.

             I hate how that movie is SO good. And his other two amazing movies (which I fucking hate to admit) are about the after effects of sexual abuse on women. What the fucking fuck? I loved his stuff and it really messed me up learning about what a monster he is, especially when I had thought his movies were coming from a pro-survivor perspective.

             Yeah, starring Mia Farrow who accompanied the Beatles to see Maharishi Yogi who (debatable) made advances towards her which spawned the song Sexy Sadie by an angry Lennon. "Sexy Sadie what have you done, you've made a fool of everyone." Don't know the whole story.

            Yes, I read her book, one of the most fascinating things I've ever read. Mick Jagger did wrong too w/ Mackenzie. Papa John was an incredible mess. The book is unbelievable. It was sad the way she was treated by everyone.

            Hypocritical Scum. Wasn't there a high suspicion that Polanski was involved with the Anton Le vey's church of Satan , and it was alledged that Polanski ,Manson ,were making snuff movies . And it was a strong possibility that Sharon Tate was murdered at Polanski's request ,in order to get rid of her . A lot of allegations I know , but it is not hard to imagine that it is connected .

            Moral and cultural relativism is en vogue in Hollywood, or did you not notice? Amongst most celebrities, reasoning and principles are passe, unless only applied in lip service to superficial bandwagon causes for good PR.

               He didn't know the intent of administering the drug (That he had no understanding of/experience with and didn't bother to research enough to safely use) might have caused his fingers to fall into her vagina once she passed out after a near double lethal dose. Perhaps the intent was they'd take a non consenting nap where one thing let to another.

            And more degrees. Manson is buds w/ the Beach Boys who are friends w/ record producer Terry Melcher son of Doris Day who owned the home, Melcher was buds w/ Papa John who was visited by Faul McCartney just before the Monterrey Pop Festival which was LSD-spiked by the CIA ... whose (Beatle) lyrics from the White Album were scrawled on the Melcher walls in blood before the White Album was even released.

             From early on in PG, I had all kinds of notes (that I misplaced) while looking into Clement Freud... I had read he was on the cover of a Beatles Album (Band On The Run, 1973) but at the time I mistakenly assumed it was the Sgt. Peppers album.  Started looking into that deep rabbit hole and found some very interesting stuff!!  Started working to retrace my steps but now that you bring it up, I'm going to look diligently for the notes.  Given the Kinsey files and his influence of mainstreaming pedophilia (his statistics were skewed; paid some pedos to take notes, he also used detailed info from an a Nazi SS pedo rapist and likely murderer) it's no wonder our culture has lethal social cancer. Kinsey was a SM who reportedly circumcised himself in the bathtub, and somehow hung himself by the balls.  Or maybe it was for 'science' who knows, anyhow he was obsessed with A. Crowley and went to England to try to get his journal.  I'm only including this from memory to say that the British/German pedo invasion is related IMO, to our country's sexual revolution (so called).
             <br/>
             So from memory and a quick search, Marjorie Cameron, artist/occultist led to Jack Parsons...
"One of JPL’s founders, Jack Parsons, would come to be known as the “father of rocketry.” Unfortunately, much of his controversial personal life, mired in occultism, group sexual orgies, black magic, and a close friendship with L. Ron Hubbard, before he created Scientology, would eventually obscure his scientific accomplishments."
Following the Jack Parsons story eventually lead to Michael Aquino/Church of Satan...and a hole rabbit hole unto himself.  Anyway, it's an area I had just started revisiting and thought I'd mention is on this thread (It was shocking to be redpilled that far back but the Kinsey files brought everything together) Sidenote, the UK radio/BBC/artists, rabbit hole aka Saville, Clement Freud as two examples, plus the organization to normalize pedos in the UK, seemed to come here as well, or at any rate, resonated in the US and likely help sow the seeds for what we have today, Hollywood MK Ultra/pedo universe/satanic hellhole. Harry Hay also wanted to normalize pedos but I think he was rejected by many in the gay community at that time. Also, There's a lot of early "horror" films that surfaced as well from while digging into connections,Christopher Lee, was also on the Beatles album cover with C. Freud and he jokingly recalls the UK orgy scene (He says he did not participate), with people who act like they are Satanists.  He said he would leave the movie set when people started taking off their clothes.  His quote (don't have time now to cite) reminded me of quote of the character in the 9th Gate movie, the woman in the wheelchair who poo pooed the Satanist/occultists, saying they weren't the real deal but that they just wanted an excuse to have orgies, but the statement wasn't meant to indicate that there didn't exist "a real deal".  That's the impression that the quote of Christopher Lee gave me...and for some other trivia, I believe he is also a descendent of Charlemagne.
(BTW, pretty sure the PG fake shooter was in a couple movies, or his dad was a director...The Mill?" 
It occurred to me that the Kinsey influence of recommending incest/pedophilia as healthy for the child/babies is part of the great sick left/right agenda, to normalize sexual rights from birth. Back in the day, Catholic would be priests were sent to the Kinsey Institute to learn about the theories, and conservative applicants were rooted out, and only those who were willing to agree with the theory (or worse) were acceptable be ordained.  This seems IMO, as part of the reason we had the whole Catholic priest epidemic!  Kinsey recommend that parents purposely "sexually" stimulate their babies from birth (is this why there are now examples of grown men who are sexual over wearing diapers?  WTF!!
             <em>
              cringe
             </em>
             Also he considered incest as healthy for the sexual development at a pretty young age. Is there any wonder that Hollywood pedos love Islamists?  Is this why Qatar has a Satanist artist on staff at their museum (another rabbit hole as we saw with the well executed diagram Clinton Foundation/Podesta ties to the art world, Qatar, and supposedly protecting children.
If only the snowflakes really knew the origins, the process, and the end goals of who they support...the progressive brainwashing has been effective enough however, that they don't stop yelling RESIST RESIST to ever come down from the adrenal rush of left wing hate.

              There is nothing whatsoever "left wing" about sexual abuse of children/minors which is a crime.

              Liberals seek to protect children -- women and children -- if they are in fact liberals.

               What I should of said is "pedo-elitist agenda-left&amp;right" which is what I really meant. instead of "left/right" which is to broad.  I was on  rant, and didn't edit enough, sorry about that.  I've started to try to only use the term liberal in a positive sense in order to differentiate liberal democrats I know to be very caring for women and children, from the hard progressive globalist left who has profited on scamming people into believing they do. It's easy to slip up and blame 'liberals' for things that are really progressive hard left driven.  I absolutely agree with you that sexual abuse of kids or anyone, is not restricted to one party and we know now that elites within both wings have helped cover each other's crimes, or if not helped, then had enough blackmail on each other to minimize the fallout.

                I think you're getting there, but what you're describing about still isn't liberals -- even if they are labeled "Democrats" or "liberals."  The only way you can judge them is by their actions -- and that's right wing.
HRC and Podesta may be wearing "Dem" labels, but they are right wing fascists as are all who are engaged in trafficking of humans for any purpose -- whether sexual, as drug runners, as prostitutes -- whatever.

                  Fascism is authoritarianism -- an effort to control others -- to dominate others -- to force their will on others ...
all usually by violence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As I've often said, there is only one way the right wing can rise and that's by violence - assassinations, blackmail, threats, stolen elections.
That has long been true, it is still true today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Actually, if you begin with the Papal States -- 
Christianity invented capitalism when Feudalism was no longer sufficient to run the Papal States.
At about that time, fascism is seen rising in Northern Italy.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Consider that capitalism is suicidal in its exploitation of nature.
And that unregulated capitalism is merely organized crime.

                 A bit confused..are you saying that Democrats or Liberals are incapable of trafficking humans or profiting off of it for any purpose?
If so, are Democrats and Liberals also incapable of pedophilia in your opinion?
Or are you saying that anyone who commits these crimes is a right wing fascist?

                  Human trafficking is not an activity that can be considered to be "liberal."
It is FASCIST activity -- i.e., right wing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Trafficking is kidnapping -- where might you think that could be interpreted as liberal behavior?
Look up the meaning of liberal.

                   Don't have time to read the speech now either but did find this relevant quote  “We are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence — on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day”
 “It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations”

                    Yes, there were "moderate conservatives" at one time in the US Congress who were actually liberals.
"Conservatives" destroyed the value of that label with their dirty doings -- but at one time "conservatives" were respected for care of the environment,
for protecting wild life, nature, national parks. 
Again -- ignore the label.  Watch the behavior.

              Glad you put that up -- and did find some of Mae Brussels' writing on the "Manson Murders" as a false flag event -- one of the earliest ones -- with purpose of destroying positive images of anti-Vietnam War protesters and Hippies.  There's a much longer MB article somewhere but haven't found it yet.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               FACT  4    There is more to the creation of the Manson Family, and their direction than has yet been exposed.
    There is more to the making of the movie Gimme Shelter than has been explained.
    This saga has inter-connecting links to all the beautiful people Robert Hall was associated with.
    The Manson Family and the Hell's Angels were instruments by which enemy forces could attack and discredit hippies and critical American youth who had dropped out of the establishment.
    The violence came down from Neo-Nazi racists, adorned with Swastikas both in L.A. and in the Bay Area at Altamont.
    The blame was placed on persons not even associated with the causes of death at all.
    When it was all over, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were the icing on this cake, this presentation, to rub musicians into a racist, neo-nazi plot.
    By rearranging the facts, cutting here and there, distorting evidence, neighbors and family feared their own youth wandering through the communities.
    Charles Manson made the cover of Life, with those wide eyes, like Rasputin.
    Charles Watson didn't make the cover. Why not? He participated in all the killings. Manson wasn't inside the house. Because Manson played a guitar and made records. Watson didn't.
    Charles Watson was too busy taking care of matters, at the lawyer's office prior to the killings, or with officials of the Young Republicans.
    What were Watson's protections in Texas, where he remained until his separate trial prevented him from being psychologically linked to all the deaths he actually committed?
    "Pigs" was written in Sharon Tate's house in blood. Was this to make blacks become targets and suspects for stalking white territory?
    Credit cards of the La Bianca family were purposely deposited in the black ghetto after their massacre. The intention was to stir racial fears and hatred.
    Who wrote the first article, "Did Hate Kill Tate?", blaming the Black Panthers for the murders? Army intelligence agent Ed Butler, Lee Harvey Oswald's old pal from New Orleans. They made a record together so that Oswald could pass himself off as a Marxist. Another deception.
    Glasses were left on the floor of Sharon Tate's home the day of the murder. They were never identified.
    Who moved all the bodies after the killers left and before the police arrived?
    The Spahn ranch wasn't a hippie commune. It bordered the Krupp ranch, and has now been combined and incorporated to make a German Bavarian beer garden. Howard Hughes knew George Spahn. He went to this ranch daily while making The Outlaw.
    Howard Hughes bought the 516 acres of Krupp property in Nevada after he moved into that territory. What about Altamont? What distortions and untruths forced that movie?
    Why did Mick Jagger order "the concert must go on"?
    There was a demand the filmmakers be allowed to catch this concert. It couldn't have happened the same in any other state.
    The Hell's Angels had a long working relationship with some of the law enforcement, particularly in the Oakland area.
    They became heroes of the S. F. Chronicle and other papers when they physically assaulted the dirty anti-war hippies protesting the shipment of arms to Vietnam.

                Agree -- and some of it could be dated, though I usually find that MB is way ahead of everyone.
The longer article I've referred to I still haven't come across and it's much more detailed.
I'm passing this along as simply of interest.  Often we don't know until later what info can be depended upon
when other things link up.  Wise.  :)
Presume you didn't send me the Miles Mathis.com link?
A lot of info there, as well ---- IF you are interested.

               Wish I was smart enough to understand his critiques of physics.  Could be he's completely wrong on that, I'm just not qualified to assess if that's true or not.  He does a hell of a job de-constructing a lot of Matrix programming though.  That I can follow.

              Thanks. Is the PDF safe? I've heard some of this I just don't know how deep it all goes. I have problems not believing that some of the hippie music and movement and Laurel Canyon weren't surely somewhat organic. But who knows? I happen to believe in a literal (spiritual) devil, Satan. Do you accept that the P.I.D. theory is real? I do know people who were at Haight Ashbury and said it was pretty grungy, def not what was/is depicted, a lot of druggies.

                 Funny you should mention that.  MilesMathis.com did a good job of convincing me that Paul was a twin.  He's got a lot of research on his site but somewhere there is an analysis of the Beatles being an Intel project.  It's a very deep rabbit hole, lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So no, Paul didn't die, he just got swapped out again and again with his twin.  The guy you see now as Paul is not the original Paul.  He's the twin.
