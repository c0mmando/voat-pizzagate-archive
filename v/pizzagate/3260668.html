<p>A former Arkansas state senator reportedly was found shot dead inside her home Tuesday, prompting police to launch a homicide investigation.</p>
<p>The body of Linda Collins-Smith, a Republican, was discovered Tuesday night at her home in Pocahontas, about 130 miles northeast of Little Rock, her former press secretary, Ken Yang, told KATV. Yang said the death is being investigated as a murder and that neighbors reported hearing gunshots a day or two before the body was found.</p>
<p>There is no mention of a motive, but I would think her digging into DHS\'/CPS missing funds is a pretty good reason. Add in The Clinton Foundation and you have the list of people who are digging into the financial records turning up dead growing. Here\'s the Twitter announncement: ...</p>
<p>She originally was a member of the state’s Democratic Party before switching over to the Republican side in 2011. ...</p>
<p>“She believes in limited government, lower taxes, and ending burdensome regulations. She stands for a child’s right to life from conception, for religious freedom, for our Second Amendment rights, for individual liberty, and for greater personal responsibility,” it said.</p>
<p>Collins-Smith also was active on Twitter, last posting May 27.</p>

<p>As Collins spoke, a QAnon post was displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Above it, viewer comments scrolled by, many thanking Collins for appearing on the show. Collins did not speak directly about QAnon, but rather discussed legislation to prevent Arkansas municipalities from adopting the “sanctuary cities” model regarding undocumented immigrants. Collins said she recently met with Arkansas Sens. Tom Cotton and John Boozman to speak about legislation that she believes would combat undocumented immigration.</p>

<p>I\'ll try to dig into this a little more. Just wanted to share because of its importance.\\</p>
<h1 id="md-section">======================</h1>
<p>EDIT: Okay, here we go! VALIDATION! Yes, she was involved in an investigation that leads to the Clintons. It involves Medicaid ($500,000)/Obamacare/and shell bills. It points to her being involved in an investigation,. By this blog\'s description, it\'s a \'\'HUGE\'\'\' one. It\'s EXPLOSIVE!!! </p>

<h1 id="md-suspicious-unattended-death-investigation-ongoing-involving-former-state-senator">Suspicious unattended death investigation ongoing involving former State Senator</h1>
<p>Her name rang a bell to me. I am certainly not stating that her murder, God rest her soul, had anything to do with this, but Linda was one of the legislators calling for former Jeremy Hutchinson\'s resignation. </p>
<p>Jeremy Hutchinson was involved in the Preferred Family Healthcare scandal I reported on last year. It\'s a HUGE investigation involving former senators, lobbyists, etc. He has since been indicted
. 
There are two links given in this article. The first is this that affirms she was involved in the Jeremy Hutchinson scandal. </p>

<h1 id="md-another-call-for-a-hutchinson-resignation-democrat-seeks-more-from-governor-on-ethics">Another call for a Hutchinson resignation; Democrat seeks more from governor on ethics</h1>
<p>Add lame-duck Sen. Linda Collins-Smith to the list of legislators (now four) that have called for Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson’s resignation. And the Democratic gubernatorial candidate calls for more from the senator’s uncle, Gov. Asa Hutchinson. ...</p>
<p>Conduit for Action, whose opposition to Obamacare led them to fight Hutchinson and attempt to unseat candidates who support him, has a pretty good rundown of the flaws in ethical regulation and shortcomings in existing rules. It notes Collins-Smith was defeated in a bill attempting to prevent lawyers from representing clients in the legislature. It also notes Bryan King’s unsuccessful effort to require disclosure by those with ties to organizations receiving Medicaid money.</p>
<p>Uncle Asa has limited his commentary to saying any legislator who is INDICTED should resign.</p>
<p>And they drag our POTUS in the midst of things:</p>
<p>UPDATE: KATV’s Glisovic Tweets this retort from Nephew Hutchinson’s criminal defense attorney, Tim Dudley:</p>
<p>“If accusations were sufficient to call for resignation, then I expect Sen. Collins Smith and Sen. Rice to call on President Trump to resign because Pres. Trump has endured more accusations than anyone in American political history </p>
<p>Cute. But while there may be a legal dispute about how to characterize what Nephew Jeremy did, there’s no dispute that he took $500,000 from a Medicaid funds  recipient and repeatedly advocated for his employer in the legislature without making a public disclosure of that role. It’s shameful and, now exposed, he should hang it up.</p>

<h1 id="md-arkansas-swamp-bleeds-as-clintons-circle-the-drain">Arkansas Swamp Bleeds as Clintons Circle The Drain</h1>
<p>Many have read sprinkles of press releases from the justice department regarding arrests and indictments coming out of Arkansas, but few have observed the magnitude of this swamp creature and all its tentacles. … </p>
<p>Remember the plane full of documents in Little Rock? Everyone was speculating as to who/what it could be about, and hoping it had to do with the Clinton Foundation investigations. Is it possibly connected to this ongoing investigation into legislator fraud? In August 2018, Deputy Attorney General Lloyd Warford, said that investigators have at least 4 million documents in a vault and another 200 gigabytes of information they have collected from the Department of Human Services. Warford also confirmed that more lawmakers are under investigation by the state, in cooperation with the federal investigation. They have already convicted over a dozen individuals in one case alone, several of which are former or current legislators, one former senator has already begun his 18-year prison sentence, and there are a slew of other individuals listed in indictments. It is quite an extensive list below. ..</p>

            State Senator, Linda Collins Smith, of Arkansas was shot and killed tonight at 7:15 PM EDT.
           </p>
           <p>
            • She was working with DHS insider to expose the missing $27M from DHS/Child Protective Services.
           </p>
           <p>
            • These funds are being placed into trade, and the dividends are being filtered back to the Clinton Foundation or owned shell companies, belonging to the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            • The missing $27M was discovered when it was revealed that that DHS in Arkansas had two separate sets of books.
           </p>
           <p>
            • It’s connected to a Federal Grant that requires a specific number of children be removed from their families to meet the required quota so that they’re able to renew the grant again each year.

            Suspicious unattended death investigation ongoing involving former State Senator

           <p>
            Her name rang a bell to me. I am certainly not stating that her murder, God rest her soul, had anything to do with this, but Linda was one of the legislators calling for former Jeremy Hutchinson's resignation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeremy Hutchinson was involved in the Preferred Family Healthcare scandal I reported on last year. It's a HUGE investigation involving former senators, lobbyists, etc. He has since been indicted
. 
There are two links given in this article. The first is this that affirms she was involved in the Jeremy Hutchinson scandal.

            Another call for a Hutchinson resignation; Democrat seeks more from governor on ethics
           </h1>
           <p>
            Add lame-duck Sen. Linda Collins-Smith to the list of legislators (now four) that have called for Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson’s resignation. And the Democratic gubernatorial candidate calls for more from the senator’s uncle, Gov. Asa Hutchinson. ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Conduit for Action, whose opposition to Obamacare led them to fight Hutchinson and attempt to unseat candidates who support him, has a pretty good rundown of the flaws in ethical regulation and shortcomings in existing rules. It notes Collins-Smith was defeated in a bill attempting to prevent lawyers from representing clients in the legislature. It also notes Bryan King’s unsuccessful effort to require disclosure by those with ties to organizations receiving Medicaid money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Uncle Asa has limited his commentary to saying any legislator who is INDICTED should resign.
           </p>
           <p>
            And they drag our POTUS in the midst of things:
           </p>
           <p>
            UPDATE: KATV’s Glisovic Tweets this retort from Nephew Hutchinson’s criminal defense attorney, Tim Dudley:
           </p>
           <p>
            “If accusations were sufficient to call for resignation, then I expect Sen. Collins Smith and Sen. Rice to call on President Trump to resign because Pres. Trump has endured more accusations than anyone in American political history
           </p>
           <p>
            Cute. But while there may be a legal dispute about how to characterize what Nephew Jeremy did, there’s no dispute that he took $500,000 from a Medicaid funds  recipient and repeatedly advocated for his employer in the legislature without making a public disclosure of that role. It’s shameful and, now exposed, he should hang it up.

           <p>
            Remember the plane full of documents in Little Rock? Everyone was speculating as to who/what it could be about, and hoping it had to do with the Clinton Foundation investigations. Is it possibly connected to this ongoing investigation into legislator fraud? In August 2018, Deputy Attorney General Lloyd Warford, said that investigators have at least 4 million documents in a vault and another 200 gigabytes of information they have collected from the Department of Human Services. Warford also confirmed that more lawmakers are under investigation by the state, in cooperation with the federal investigation. They have already convicted over a dozen individuals in one case alone, several of which are former or current legislators, one former senator has already begun his 18-year prison sentence, and there are a slew of other individuals listed in indictments. It is quite an extensive list below. ..

Hawley announced yesterday that he would be introducing a bill that would make it unlawful for video-hosting platforms like YouTube to recommend videos that feature minors. Recommendation systems are under particular scrutiny after the Times report, which showed YouTube’s recommendation algorithm suggesting videos of younger and younger women and girls if a user starts off watching erotic videos."

             Well put! Yes, ''calling cards.'' That's exactly what they're like.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, it has their dirty fingerprints all of it and I'm sick of them getting away with it. It has to stop and I'm hoping soon.

              Arkansas judge seals police records in killing of former senator Linda Collins-Smith
             </p>
             <p>
              LITTLE ROCK (KATV) — A judge has sealed investigative files in the killing of former Arkansas senator Linda Collins-Smith.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Randolph County prosecuting attorney's office announced Wednesday that Circuit Judge Harold Erwin had sealed documents and statements obtained by police.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Randolph County sheriff's office said it will issue a "brief statement" on the case Wednesday. They did not answer
             </p>
             <p>
              The order comes after Collins-Smith was found dead from a gunshot wound at her home in Pocahontas on Tuesday. Ken Yang, her former press secretary, has said her death is being investigated as a homicide.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The judge did so almost immediately with no reason given. According to the reports, they identification of the body was delayed to decomposition so they were sealing records for someone they couldn't even identify. At least, that's the way it reads. I doubt this is usual. By that I mean, the police never give away crucial details of the investigation, but sealing records? Think it's reserved for Arkancides.

             Yeah, being a white hat can get you killed. I haven't had time to dig into Nichols yet. I decided to do a little more on Linda Collins-Smith and found out something interesting about her and her husband. I just don't believe in things like coincidences anymore.

             It ties in with something I found last night. To my way of thinking, it couldn't have been a coincidence and it ties in with drugs.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mormons have long been recruited into top positions in government agencies and multinational corporations. They are prominent in such institutions as the
             <strong>
              CIA, FBI and the national nuclear weapons laboratories,
             </strong>
             giving the church a sphere of influence unlike any other American religion in the top echelons of government.
            </p>
            <p>
             Romney, like his father before him who voluntarily tithed an unparalleled 19 percent of his personal fortune, is among the church’s wealthiest members. And like his father, grandfather and great-grandfathers before him, Mitt Romney was groomed for a prominent position in the church, which he manifested first as a missionary, then as a bishop, and then as a stake president, becoming the highest-ranking Mormon leader in Boston — the equivalent of a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.
            </p>
            <p>
             Called a “militant millennial movement” by renowned Mormon historian David L. Bigler, Mormonism’s founding theology was based upon a literal takeover of the U.S. government. In light of the theology and divine prophecies of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, unamended by the LDS hierarchy, it would seem that the office of the American presidency is the ultimate ecclesiastical position to which a Mormon leader might aspire.

              Stephen Alan Wynn (né Weinberg; born January 27, 1942) is an American real estate businessman and art collector. He is known for his involvement in the American luxury casino and hotel industry
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2018, Wynn was accused by dozens of people of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to forcible assault to coercing a female employee into sex; he denies the allegations.[9] Wynn stepped down as CEO of Wynn Resorts on February 6, 2018 because of these allegations.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wynn is known for amassing a large collection of fine art, often placing the pieces in his various casinos and hotels. In 2004, Wynn purchased Vermeer's A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals at a Sotheby's auction for $30 million. With the purchase, he became the first art collector to purchase a Vermeer painting in over 80 years.[44] It would be one of only two Vermeers still in private hands (the other is owned by Queen Elizabeth II). Wynn later sold the painting to the Leiden Collection owned by Thomas Kaplan for the same price....Under the direction of Steve Wynn, Wynn Resorts acquired Jeff Koons's Tulips at auction in November 2012 for approximately $33.6 million.[48] In May 2014

             This is weird stuff. Something definitely is going on. I wasn't a Q follower, but I'm starting to believe. He said there would be a lot of deaths. All I can think of is that the NYPD was involved with the handling of Weiner's computer, but NY is on the water and has three major airports. It makes for a lot of trafficking and shipping. Were they in on something? Did a deal sour or were they victims of knowing too much?

             Thanks for this. Never had been looking at that angle. I did find something weird about the Collins-Smith death. I'm trying to get a little bit more before I post. Might be a possible reasons -- or not. Who knows? Arkansas is so corrupt.

             <p>
              In 2007, a 10-year-old girl from Fort Smith named Ivy Brake became the responsibility of the state. Her mother, Ivy recalled, was loving, sweet and unstable. She struggled with substance abuse and chronic health issues for most of Ivy's childhood. She periodically got clean — once for a year — until, when Ivy was 10, an old boyfriend returned, and her mother started using again. Ivy and her 12-year-old sister, Kristin, left to stay with a relative, but soon after they arrived, the police showed up, asking questions about their life at home.

             </p>
             <p>
              Relatives told Ivy that her grandmother, who lived nearby, and an aunt in Texas both tried to get custody of the sisters but were told that they didn't have sufficient space and that "that wasn't what was best for our lives." Instead, Ivy began a long chain of placements in foster homes and group residential facilities:..

                The sensational Carroll Foundation Trust and parallel Gerald 6th Duke of Sutherland Trust multi-billion dollar corporate identity theft offshore tax fraud bribery scandal which is encircling the HSBC Holdings Plc Chairman Mark Tucker has disclosed that the Dentons international law firm has been named in this case of international importance.
               </p>
               <p>
                Scotland Yard leaked sources have said that the Dentons law firm “sponsored” UK Companies House “registered” Urban Finance Ltd group structures were effectively utilised as a diversionary corporate smokescreen for the embezzlement of two hundred million dollars of Gerald Carroll’s huge treasury investment holdings which were held at the Queen’s bankers Coutts &amp; Co and Barclays Bank City of London branches.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Carroll Foundation Trust files are held within a complete lockdown at the FBI Washington DC field office and the Metropolitan Police Scotland Yard London under the supervision of the Commissioner Cressida Dick QPM who is known to have an intimate knowledge of this case which stretches the globe over a staggering sixteen years.

                ..Former Sidley Austin partner Matthew Cahill, who was accused of tax offences, has had all charges against him dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admitted to ‘wholesale failures’ in its disclosure process. Meanwhile, a Dentons partner accused of sexual harassment has left the firm following an internal investigation.

             ''My heart aches today" caught my eye. That's how I'm reacting now when I read story after story of this kind of corruption and abuse. Before it was intellectually disturbing, but today it's getting hold of my emotions. It's so sad. Just sad. Sad that this affected so many children's lives. Sad that nobody can do anything about this. Sad that when a brave man or woman steps forward, they wind up dead. A statistic. A number on a tag that proves they couldn't succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
             We've got to get together on this. Forget everything else and clean up your state. Back people trying to do good any way  you can. Volunteer, make phone calls, hand out flyers, attend rallies, donate, and VOTE!
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks, again.

               I'm sure their scummy little network is global. I did find something weird re: the Collins-Smith murder. I need to do a little more research on it, but there is something global I've been meaning to post. It's just incredibly detailed and dates way back through several presidencies. Because it's so extensive, I just haven't had the time to sit down and really go through all the info I've accumulated ... it's a lot!

                Don't forget Jenny Moore...died in Prince Georges County and reportedly went to ICE in DC to talk about trafficking and evidence of Bill Clinton molesting a kid on a boat off Long Island (or there about). If you saw her vids on Youtube you could tell she was scared as shit...and she's a former Tracy, CA cop. This boy Clinton molested was and the info behind it, was corroborated by George Webb (

            This is the audio interview with the woman with the info. It's brutal listening to 100's of umm um umm's, but after the 20/30 minute mark, you realize she has important info. She needs help. It's definitely cf, Arkansas crony corruption. Linda was set to testify in court. The evidence of corruption is credible. Don't hear anything tie directly to the murder but its compelling info. Jmho.
           </p>

             Although Washington is where the propagandists would have us believe the story is breaking, it's really in Arkansas. It's why I thought nothing was being done, but it has been all this time. In any other point in history, the papers would have been all over this, but now?
             <em>
              crickets

             They don't mention a single word of the corruption and evil that has taken hold in Arkansas. Thanks again and with God's will we can end this destruction of our country.

             I still don't know why they don't back up the evidence they have. Assange and WikiLeaks would be good for that. They could be trusted with confidential material and used to make sure it got disseminated in case of an ''accident'' or ''murder.''

             It's the same thing and isn't that a shame? I hope she backed up any evidence she knew ... and entrusted the right person with it.

Seems that's what they're going for anyway what with the indoctrination and letting pedos run free.

             To buttress the fact that this level of wickedess (destroying families for money) occurs, one need only look at the 2 Pennsylvania judges who sent kids to incarceration facilities for their own monetary gain.

            <p>
             New York Post article estimates thousands of troubled teens were damaged.

            <p>
             "Kids For Cash" scandal even has it's own Wikipedia listing.

             These people truly are evil.

              It is something that EVERY decent human being, REGARDLESS of political leanings, has the pressing responsibility to stop!!

              Whether or not that the ultimate sacrifice given by Ms. Collins-Smith, Nancy Schaefer,  and SO many others will be in vain will directly relate to the amount of effort YOU put forth in bringing an end to these abominations.

               Yes, it is everyone's responsibility. Don't throw your votes away. Don't get sidetracked by one issue that may have normally torpedoed you voting for a candidate. Get down to what's important and protecting our children is crucial. Stopping the pedos in their tracks is another. Look at how they're perverting our society and it only took eight years. At the beginning of The Manchurian Candidate's term, he was still firm on no illegal immigration. But in two terms, if you oppose illegal immigration, you're called a racist and a Nazi.

               Let's align to get rid of the scum. After the scum is gone we can argue other things, but we can't afford divisiveness now. The cabal elite is too well-supported by the damaged of the world. And the irony is that they damaged them.

               Yes, it's so sad this has been allowed to build to this kind of perfunctory disposal system.

               But I had no idea of the massive investigation that has been launched! It accounts for the level of hysteria being demonstrated by the left. Did you read that article? There are plane loads of documents and hundreds of thousands of gigabytes of records. And it goes back to Sessions appointing Huber. That's a long time to keep things undercover, but our propagandists have been busy filling the hearts and minds of citizens with nonsense.

            . I'm going to give this our "Accuracy in Question" flair for now, due to the sketchy nature of the blog you've linked as the source for the claims about her investigating DHS and CPS corruption. It's got all the markers of a fake news site. We're probably being trolled, like we were with the Asian attorney that was shot in Atlanta a couple years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's very suspicious they do not link to any verifiable source for the claims about the grant or that she was investigating it. And here's what you find when you go to the "About" section of the site:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In an effort to effect change, the SPEAK PROJECT team has done our best to expose the errors in the psyops by revealing the entire story behind the intel. We’ve created messages that resonate with everyone and tweeted them out to the masses. We’ve written articles to teach people and raise the vibration of the planet, hoping to break out from this dome under which we’ve all been living.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I am happy to remove the flair if we can corroborate the claims from the first link via more reliable sources.

             Holy Christ did I find validation! It's explosive. She actually was in on an investigation that involved Medicaid/Obamacare/Healthcare money and all this leads to the Clinton Foundation. It also leads to uncovering the war being waged that I didn't know anything about. It goes back to Sessions, his appointing Huber, planefuls of documents (remember Assange's PAPER PLANES?), and gigabytes of information.

              Great work! I've changed the flair to "Potential Lead" because I think folks ought to do more digging on her to see what additional threads can be teased out.
             </p>
             <p>
              She was originally elected as a Democrat, but switched parties. Makes me wonder if she found out something.

              <p>
               Or it could mean she was privy to a lot of stuff. The fact that she switched soon after being elected made me think it was that possibility  rather than others.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you read what she supported, it's everything the Dems don't support. Like Righ to Life, etc. I'm also wondering if something can be gleaned from the election she lost. Was she targeted? She could have done even more good had she been in office. Then there's another avenue that I haven't opened up yet. It might be fruitful.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks for the Potential Lead flair. I really do hope people dig into this because there are some really good diggers on this forum.

                 Everything is tied together, and her not backing down on the resignation when senator probably got her targeted for her Senate seat first. But, like Nancy 
Schaefer, she wouldn't stop. With the DOJ coming down hard, probably didn't want any loose ends ... or maybe she knew something. Could also be they thought she was vulnerable to blackmail or coercion? When she wouldn't buckle ... blanket... gun....

             I wanted to put everything out there that was being said. It seems like I heard a rumor before about this ... and now it's coming up again. And the woman is dead. Dead is always a clue that someone within the cabal needed to go (like Vince Foster), or someone is doing something that might expose it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I definitely am going to try to find out more about this. Like I said, I saw it and felt it needed posting. Reminds me of Nancy Schaefer.

               That I believe is confirmed. She even tweeted about it and I did post the tweet.

              Now we have fox news reporting this.  There was a similar case before.  Sen. Nancy Schaefer and husband found dead.

             </p>
             <p>
              They of course found it to be a murder suicide.  Sen. Schaefer was investigating the same program of placing Children into foster homes to make more money for CPS/DCFS.  This reeks imo.  I totally believe this happened.  The article does not say that it is in question.  This makes me sick.  I follow Medical Kidnap and get their emails in my inbox.  Sen. Schaefer was going all over the country talking about the law that was signed under Bill Clinton.  The message is don't bite the hand that feeds you or else.  Not even when trying to Save Our Children.  Morbidly Wrong.

               Yup, I was struck by the same similarity and parallels. It sounds like the same kind of deal.

               In doing the digging, it really did seem like Linda Collins-Smith was trying to get help for those children and to bring down the cabal by bringing down the Clintons. But the scope of the investigation is massive and I'm stunned that I didn't know anything about this. It means there are lots of patriots willing to sacrifice their lives to get this done. And it will. They have everything they need. I just have to believe that.

                It gives me hope and faith in our people.  There are some that will give their lives to help Our Children.  With so much hatred in the country this is somewhat refreshing except of course for her horrible death.  This must not get buried and forgotten.
