<p>The prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is not known,[13][30] but is estimated to be lower than 5% among adult men.[13] Less is known about the prevalence of pedophilia in women, but there are case reports of women with strong sexual fantasies and urges towards children.[14] Most sexual offenders against children are male. Females may account for 0.4% to 4% of convicted sexual offenders, and one study estimates a 10 to 1 ratio of male-to-female child molesters.[16] </p>
<p>...There are motives for child sexual abuse that are unrelated to pedophilia,[76] such as stress, marital problems, the unavailability of an adult partner,[98] general anti-social tendencies, high sex drive, or alcohol use.[99] As child sexual abuse is not automatically an indicator that its perpetrator is a pedophile, offenders can be separated into two types: pedophilic and non-pedophilic[100] (or preferential and situational[8]). Estimates for the rate of pedophilia in detected child molesters generally range between 25% and 50%.[101] A 2006 study found that 35% of its sample of child molesters were pedophilic.[102] Pedophilia appears to be less common in incest offenders,[103] especially fathers and step-fathers.[104] According to a U.S. study on 2429 adult male sex offenders who were categorized as &quot;pedophiles&quot;, only 7% identified themselves as exclusive; indicating that many or most child sexual abusers may fall into the non-exclusive category.[9]</p>

            All they did in Wikipedia is to limit pedophilia so completely that many pedophilic acts and behaviors get redefined . Weird.

            So, the question is do pedophiles like to advertise their illness?   I.e., pedo symbols, handkercheifs, etc?   Like some sort of trophy?
