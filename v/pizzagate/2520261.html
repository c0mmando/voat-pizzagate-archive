<p>Relevance: More on NXIVM. Extremely detailed article on the cult that confirms the grooming of underage girl. It also explains how the group kept evolving and changing its name and modus operandi to evade leaving a trail for authorities to follow.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret">https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret</a></p>
<p>NEW - NXIVM cult leader\'s former girlfriend still skeptical about suicide being the actual cause of death, after her brother’s years of battling the group. “The last time I saw Keith in person, he said he would either see me next dead or in prison.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this article gives a clear understanding of how innocents got suckered in in the beginning. It started out as offering discount priced goods to members. The more they recruited, the bigger the commissions. The group was evolving and changed over time. It sold healthcare products, skincare, executive training, etc.  
</p>
<p>Also in the article, Toni Natalie, girlfriend of Raniere,  confirms the grooming of minors and that Raniere did read L. Ron Hubbard\'s book on Scientology. There\'s also the suspicious suicide death of her brother. You know how they go. I would like to know more about that though. </p>

<p>Not many women can say they were the live-in love of a cult leader for eight years.  Certainly not a charismatic leader who began a multilevel marketing company that would give rise to an unexpected subsidiary, a sexual slavery sorority fronting as an exclusive women’s empowerment group.  Toni Natalie is unique in that sense.  She is the ex-girlfriend of NXIVM’s Keith Raniere.  Pronounced like “the purple pill” for heartburn, NXIVM (Nexium) began as an Albany, New York based company devoted to professional and personal development.  In recent years, the group offered courses similar to what one can expect at the Scientology Center in Los Angeles.  It is alleged that Richard Branson was among the celebrities to take some of those courses.  At its outset in the early 1990s, the group was called Consumers Buyline – offering discounts on goods and services for paying members.  Similar to an MLM like Amway, Consumers Buyline members received commission for amassing new members.</p>
<p>Natalie says the name of the group would keep changing in an effort to throw off the media....</p>
<p>...When Natalie first met Raniere in the early 1990s, she was hesitant about getting involved with another MLM company following a prior negative experience with one that went bust.  However, her husband convinced her that Keith Raniere was a genius with a 240 IQ and this time things would be different.</p>
<p>“It was a calling card that stands out,” Natalie told me about the much buzzed about IQ score.  Only later would she hear that the method of how Raniere had obtained that score was dubious.  She would also learn that Raniere had maintained a notably low grade point average in school. ...</p>
<p>...In the early days of her business involvements, Natalie was in charge of marketing a skincare division of the company with quality products developed by holistic wellness and beauty guru Susan Ciminelli.</p>
<p>“It was very successful,” she recalls, “Later on when Keith was asked by federal agencies to make changes to Consumers Buyline, he refused and the company crumbled as quickly as it had taken off. What happens with Keith is that it’s like he tries on a new, different skin. In the early days, he was this boy genius and would continually revamp what the business was and come up with a new way to position it. </p>
<h1>What he was apparently doing in the background was grooming underage girls. When the company evolved into a different company, he was grooming new girls.”</h1>
<p>Natalie said Raniere’s ability to hypnotize was magical.  After he spotted her smoking a cigarette in their initial meeting, he offered to rid her of the nicotine addiction.  She then spent two hours with him that felt like fifteen minutes and never touched a cigarette again.  She jokes that that was the one good thing to come from Raniere who would ruin her life over the next two decades (following their eventual breakup) through “terrorism by litigation.” ...</p>
<p>... It is often advised that bedfellows avoid becoming business partners. In the case of the manipulative, mind-controlling Raniere and the insecure Natalie – who had been molested years before – this arrangement would prove disastrous.  Natalie believed that Raniere was focused on professional development and self-actualization and that his high intellect would lead to great changes.  Only later on would she fully acknowledge his alone time with young women as suspect.  
</p>
<h1>As their relationship became tenuous, Natalie resisted intimacy and Raniere began to rape her while making justifications for the assault.</h1>
<p>At this point, she sent her son to live with his father.  When the breakup eventually happened, it was far from the end.  Raniere would send his associates to ransack Natalie’s home, break into her mailbox and cancel her credit cards, all tactics to ensure she felt threatened and appear as if she was going mad. </p>
<p>Having read L. Ron Hubbard’s Dianetics, he wrote Natalie letters calling her a “suppressive” and also quoted Paradise Lost. “There are so many parallels to Scientology,” Natalie confirms. ...</p>
<p>Notoriously litigious with his foes including members of the press, Raniere – with the help of the Bronfman sisters – repeatedly found ways to bring Natalie to court.  Her brother attempted to intervene in order to “negotiate her release” and her mother would later incur the legal wrath of the group. Her brother would meet a tragic end – “suicide” according to the autopsy.  Natalie is still skeptical about suicide being the actual cause of death after her brother’s years of battling the group.</p>

            Funny story, I knew this punk a long time ago and when I visited his mother many years later, her boyfriend told me that he conned her out of 30,000$. I had to ask. He said he got ahold of some scientology book and gave his mom some kind of spiel convincing her it was going to change everyone's lives. He smoked it in crack form.

             Yeah, they're a weird bunch, but if you're planning to scam your Mom our of her hard-earned savings, then, yeah, sure! Read the book and learn how to prey on her compassionate nature and pluck those heartstrings.

              Yeah, but the other part I left out was the boy friend still stuck with the mom and works his butt off to try to save the farm. She is still blinded by love for her only son and would easily give him the keys to the crack safe again for another fairy tale. She was a waitress her entire life. I met that punks dad, he was a POS. That is but one fragile home still not on the market in economic terms.

               These sorts of sad stories abound. I'm sure the kid didn't  get that way on his own, but it's no excuse for selling out your family.

              <p>
               I'm glad Mom did better in picking a stand-up type of guy and that the boyfriend is doing right by her. Who knows? Maybe she'll get red-pilled and wake up to the fact it doesn't help to be delusional. Hope the son gets the help he needs.

                Doubt he will ever be a useful person and his mom is a bird brain because she grew up next to Ringling Art School since the late 60's. That cancer has stricken the neighborhood past the dregs of societal chaos. Ground zero for youth exploitation in my town. Right next to the opera and the art museum for the elites to observe.

                 Man, in eight short years they've made huge strides in destroying our country. Same here. Homeless and drug addicts wandering around. It's just so lovely. And you see them juxtapositioned to new moms taking out their babies in carriages/strollers. It's disgusting.

 Insightful. Have been studying pizzagate several years.
Had NEVER heard of NXIVM until last week.

             It is. Journalist did a nice job in making what went on a bit more understandable in terms of how the cult was presented and it's MO in keeping one step ahead of the law.
            </p>
            <p>
             What has not been uncovered or examined is why the story was dropped. First reported in 2007 by major news outlets, there wasn't a peep until now. I'd like to know who put the cap on it? I know they were litigation happy, but a cult watch site wouldn't back down and major news outlets have much deeper pockets, so who put the lid on? Was it analogous to the kyboshed stories on Weinstein?

              Am taking a guess. But not without some thinking. 
NXIVM..I study Q.  He said voat was shut down because
pg researchers got 'over the target.'  Could this 'organization'
be the tip of an iceberg?  In that case my feeling is International cartels were covering
for it.  It may promptly lead to top 'masters' like the Rockefeller Family.  And Rothchilds. ?

              Thinking Mack's arrest may be downplayed but thinking it is really significant.

               As mentioned above, the Weinstein story shut down. Also there might be a very weak money trail because of the way people ''invest'' in movies. This ''investing'' and profitability may be a way to funnel money that is hard to track. But in the case of Raniere, there's a clear trail that leads to individuals who wish to remain anonymous. They're the puppet masters that the DOJ is really after ... not that the pond scum floating on to the surface isn't important to arrest ... pond scum like Mack ... and the Bronfmans. Which brings me to a different point.

               There's a different set of investigating officers because of the charges. The NYPD is investigating Weinstein and the LAPD in other cases of alleged rapes. But in NXIVM? The feds have it and Sessions is in charge. HUGE difference. Sessions can rightly order feds to follow the money trail where the NYPD and LAPD would have to have the case taken over by federal authorities to do that.

             Yes, I've read other sources that stated that NXIVM did have seminars/parties on the island. Branson has insisted that he only knew that Bronfman had rented the space. Since Branson has been involved with other individuals that feature strongly in the investigation of pizzagate, I'm skeptical of this claim.

               As for Oxenberg, I'm glad she's involved. She was the one that made that final push. I keep thinking without her tenacity, this would have gone on being buried by the ''news'' outlets.
