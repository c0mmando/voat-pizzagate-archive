            When you click on the thread it becomes apparent that this company has the blessing of our federal government to keep doing what it's doing and help maintain the DS status quo/narrative. The owner is former military and seems to be tied to the Feds. This is linked to pizzagate because of the bait and switch nature of the distraction. Mockingbird uses these actors to amplify their story across the waves while literal assassins are after Epstein. The judge presiding the case was waiting for it to be memory-holed. The timing of all of this is too coincidental. It's worth noting all the DS games. This post may or may not belong here.

            Hi there Rockman. Please add a brief explanation per Rule 1 about how this is related to child abuse by the global elite. Just a sentence or two about false flag attacks which were used to deplatform 8chan, where QAnon and Q researchers are exposing the pedo Cabal. Thanks. I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair.

             Do we know this for sure? wouldn't RR need to provide links for this claim as well?

              A great deal of pizzagate research is first posted to 8chan before making it's way here. Many more researchers there than here. Deplatforming 8chan is deplatforming pizzagate researchers.

               I am refering to this. Has this been proven? If so I am unaware.  All I've seen is a bunch of theories that this is what happened, if it was verified, i lost it in all the noise. sorry

                 What does that have to do with your claim that a false flag attack was used to deplatform 8ch? Was it? This SOB obviously posted this for no good reason or they would have edited it to remain in compliance with the rules. Please leave me alone.

            "BACKGROUND: On Aug. 5-8, the Ohio National Guard and the Ohio Emergency Management Agency are hosting VG19, an exercise cosponsored by U.S. Northern Command and National Guard Bureau. It will test the state’s disaster and emergency response capabilities with a simulated cyberattack event that subsequently causes utility failures and disruptions. Emergency response to hazardous material accidents, civil disturbances, and radiological incidents will also be tested.
           </p>
           <p>
            Exercise activities will take place in Athens, Clark, Columbiana, Franklin, Greene, Guernsey, Hamilton, Knox, Licking, Portage, and Washington counties.
           </p>
           <p>
            The public may notice a heavier than usual presence of military personnel, aircraft and equipment, first responders, and emergency vehicles. VG19 will also have civilian volunteers serving as mock accident victims. Emergency responders will exercise search and rescue, medical trauma treatment, and first aid application."

            <p>
             “[The airmen] were not directly injured in the shooting, however they were treated for minor injuries sustained during the mass evacuation of the area,” Col. Thomas Sherman, commander of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the 88th Air Base Wing, said Monday in a statement."

            <p>
             "Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is located about 12 miles from the area where the shooting took place. The base is home to Air Force Materiel Command and about 27,000 servicemembers, civilians and contractors work on the installation, according to the base website."

             </p>
             <p>
              The analysis revealed that further research was required before remote viewing (RV) could become an effective tool. As a result, FTD began to explore areas that would have a direct bearing on improving the application of RV to include the effects of feedback and effectiveness over distance. In addition, FTD focused on the former Soviet Union [FSU] and initiated attempts to replicate foreign experiments.

              "Today, as in the early 1900s, Wright-Patterson is where weapons systems are tested and modified. Missions range from logistics management, research and development, education, flight operations, and many other defense related activities. Wright-Patterson AFB is the home to the Air Force Institute of Technology, an educational institution that supports the Air Force and the Department of Defense. It also contains the USAF's high-security National Air &amp; Space Intelligence Center, where in the cold-war era captured Soviet MIGs were brought to what was then known as the Foreign Technology Division for disassembly and testing. Wright Field is also home to a zero-time nuclear reactor, built during the Cold War, but never taken critical."

              "The Dale Graff Interview
             </p>
             <p>
              Dale Graff is currently retired, but actively working with a research group on consciousness studies and "dreams."  I contacted Dale on Sept 9, 2007 via email, and a few days later I received a polite and cordial response from Dale that he would be more than happy to discuss topics for a possible interview with us.
             </p>
             <p>
              Upon calling Dale, I was struck by his soft-spoken nature, his enormous insight and intelligence, and his open willingness to talk about the phenomenon of psychic ability and the ufo phenomenon.He is very knowledgable about the entire paranormal field, including both the psychic phenomenon and the UFO phenomenon.  Dale had the pleasure of working under Tony (Anthony) Cacciopo, so Dale enjoyed access to many of the Blue Book investigations, and for a short period sat in the room where the "red phone" was while waiting for his clearances to pass for the remote viewing research.
             </p>
             <p>
              During this phonecall, we spoke for about an hour regarding the history of the Remote Viewing program, and his part in it.  We discussed his hypothesis regarding the source of the psychic phenomenon, the success rates that were realized during the remote viewing program, and the subsequent fall-out toward the end of the Remote Viewing program related to his reasons for retiring. Dale now conducts his own private research in the area of psychic phenomenon as related to dreams, and more recently short-term precognition studies, which we hope to report on here at RU in the near future, if Dale is willing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Toward the end of our conversation, I asked Dale about his time at Wright Patterson working at FTD on the AF Remote Viewing research projects.  I asked  him specifically about the claims that were made by Ernie Kellerstrass in his interview with Bruce Maccabee (and his claims made to Bob Collins as well)."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Ryan:   Dale – there was a book written in 2005 by Bob Collins called Exempt from Disclosure…
             </p>
             <p>
              Dale: Yes – I know Bob and he did work at FTD when I was there.  I left FTD in 1981 and I’m almost certain I met him there and met him off and on a few times.  We’ve exchanged some letters at one time (during the time before emails).  I’ve talked to him and know a little bit about him but don’t know this latest book.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ryan: Well, some of the latest information that is in there has some claims that go back to one of his core sources – Ernie Kellerstrass…
             </p>
             <p>
              Dale: Ahh yes – I know Ernie quite well.  I used to work for him!  He was at one time, for about a year, he was my division chief (branch chief) so I had a professional working relationship with Colonel Ernie Kellerstrass.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ernie and I had some very long discussions over the years, usually after duty because we didn’t want anyone to know we were talking about any of this stuff."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Dale:   …I was always guarded with our discussions.  He (Ernie) was a very helpful individual and very supportive, but it wasn’t really well known in the organization that I was involved in the Remote Viewing research.  I happened to be assigned to his group for a certain time…it was classified so some of the stuff I couldn’t even share with him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Because it was such a political hot potato – only a few people in the organization were allowed to be read into the project, and I think at one point I had a lot of meetings, about once a month, with the chief scientist (Dr. Cacciopo).  He came in mostly from the psychological side – he was very interested in the topic and just wanted personal updates, and there were times I’d be in his office late at night and we were just shooting the breeze discussing the phenomenon of remote viewing – the source of it – the kind of things we’re discussing here.  I don’t even remember having any discussions with Cacciopo about UFO’s!
             </p>
             <p>
              Ryan: If anyone had ever said you and Cacciopo had gone to a number of high level classified meetings, would those meetings most likely have been related to the Remote Viewing research that you were involved with at the time?
             </p>
             <p>
              Dale: Yes, absolutely."

               Christian author Dave Hunt wrote a fictional account about the RV program entitled THE ARCHON CONSPIRACY.
