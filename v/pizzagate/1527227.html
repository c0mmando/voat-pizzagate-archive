            Great angle to go into pedogate is through Obamacare and vs scandals, into the fraud systems. Also adds in the millions of other victims.

            Really as long as a video can be embedded in Facebook and the site can handle the traffic it shouldn't be too hard to move to a different service, sure you're giving up the ap, which has nice features, but I feel it's time we start promoting alternatives to Facebook, twitter, google, Reddit and other sites that are censoring. Try gibiru for a google replacement by the way.

            They don't need to use fluoridated water.  The lead will do the job, and all that requires is laziness the perfect alibi.
           </p>
           <p>
            No joke though, the lead problem only grows so there will be an intersection at some point when lead could cause mass retardation.  It would be interesting to see if lead causes a glass ceiling to IQ or if it drops IQ uniformly across the spectrum.  They are scared of intelligent cattle.

Though I WANT to believe that he is a really good guy and very passionate about this topic.he's  starting to sound  like Alex Jones, he called John podesta I reptilian? I don't want people to think this is crazy I don't want any shadow of doubt cast on people who are investigating so hard.

             For the record, I am in awe of all the work y'all are doing and posting.  I believe in this 100%, but I believe that the movement would do well to distance itself from David Seaman.  He is not a credible spokesperson, his videos are not well researched, he is inarticulate, he makes disgusting noises as he speaks, and he rants like a madman.  He is NOT a good spokesman.  I am starting to believe that YouTube is in the right on this issue.  Things that concern me:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               WHAT RESEARCH HAS HE ACTUALLY DONE?  So far, I have seen no proof that he does anything other than rant.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               WHAT IS HIS EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND?
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               WHY IS HE PUSHING GOLD, SILVER, AND BITCOIN?  Seems like he gets attention to his YT channel by teasing with "pizzagate" headlines, but then his videos are the rambling rants of someone who seems like he's impaired (or jonesin').  When he starts his nauseating sales pitches, I not only turn his video off, I throw the laptop into the wall.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               WHY DOES HE PLAY VICTIM?  As others have suggested, he should invest in a bloody domain name and launch his own website.  But, oh yeah, that takes money, and from what I understand, he is unemployed.  Grow up, lad, man up, get a freaking job, shave your neck, and go to work each day.  That is what grownups do.  Quit begging for support  because it is quite unbecoming, most everyone else is doing this work for free, and the whining makes the general public think badly about the people doing real research.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               MOST CITIZENS ARE DOING REAL RESEARCH FOR FREE.  Whom does Seaman think he is to have to be compensated for everything he does?  He gripes about YT not "monetizing" his videos, but who here on Voat is being "monetized" for working your butts off at great risk?  He has no right to be profiting off this investigation when all y'all are doing so much hard work on a pro bono basis.  What makes Seaman too good to go get himself a real job?  Is it the pot?  Most employers I know would never hire an admitted pot user.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               HE IS ALLEGEDLY A POTHEAD (according to his own videos).  He is admittedly pro-pot and that does nothing but detract from the quality of his videos on "pizzagate."  Thanks for nothing.  His "pro-pot" crap is out of place, disturbing on its own, and it greatly diminishes his credibility.  As soon as he broadcast his doper views, he lost all credibility in the eyes of many.  But that kind of goes hand-in-hand with the whole "unemployed stoner" thing, and explains why he's always looking for handouts from the public (many of whom are also working on this issue -- actually WORKING ON RESEARCH -- and not making a penny).
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Yeah, the more I think of this situation, the more I think YouTube is within their rights to limit what this apparently unstable person can do on there.

              He is a journalist, and has been a professional journalist that has relied on his income to live. The other people that make the videos for free don't have their decades long career in actual investigative journalism. The way I see it is if you don't find his videos valuable enough to click skip ad after 5 seconds then don't watch them. But yeah the difference is this was his job before pizzagate, so he wants to continue to get income from the time he spends on it.

               He should man up and get a full-time job, like most people do.  I, for one, have no sense of compassion for a stoner who is relying on his "name" (of which I never heard until I started looking at Podesta's emails and the ripples from them).  Times change.  Why should we have to support David Seaman when some others who are doing actual research are scrambling to support themselves?  Typical millennial stoner. . . .

              Yeah. It's actually a little disappointing. As someone mentioned in the comments section of his recent video, he seems to be wasting such great potential. He has a leg up in the fact he worked for the Huffington Post. He has a viewership. He has connections. And what is he doing with his potential? He's rambling on, being very sloppy with his video points, and not really bringing any new information to the table, all the while complaining about things. He needs to start acting like a professional journalist with his youtube videos. He needs to use his green screen, dress well, write out a script of topics to cover, and then provide the evidence rather than just yelling at the screen "pizzagate is real! it's real! pizzagate is real". Ok, WE know that, but the new viewers to the channel don't know that and you need to give them something to capture their interest because the whining is giong to push them away. He had maybe 2 videos that were okay early on with some of the evidence, but even those could have been better. I mean, many people here do a lot of the legwork finding things, and he can't even discuss what has been found in all the details? It's very sad. I hope he becomes aware of how he is coming off. And this comes from someone who has watched all his videos since pizzagate broke. He's relying too much on his name to keep afloat, and that will not last forever unless he puts effort into this.

               David, I am in agreement with several other commenters here, that we implore you to branch out, cover more ground, use your considerable skill set to ramp up to the point where you simply cannot be silenced.  You have gained a large following with a blank beige background, sitting in a t-shirt in your apartment, no music, no intro, no branding logo, no graphics, no guests--the time has come to transition from posting a few no-effort videos intermittently, to creating a complete channel with a schedule and a professional presentation.  If you put the work into creating 'David Seaman Reports,' built a set, took callers, did live streaming shows, interviews, multiple playlists or channels if need be, all immediately identifiable as a David Seaman production, and grew your platform, as tubers with far less to say and far less to offer have done, then you will be unstoppable.  Right now you are sitting on a closed vault of potential, and that may be what is also bothering you.  If you really want this, then nothing will stop you.  Where is the intro, the tagline for the channel, graphics, theme song, live streaming shows enabling call-ins at a set time each week, c'mon man, you know what needs to be done to make this channel go big in 2017!  Right now, a demonetized video is easy for them to do to you, and it is knocking you back on your heels, because you aren't strong enough of a presence to be unperturbed by it.  You are not using your range of talents to their greatest degree!  We believe in you, but we need you to believe in yourself.  You can't stay at this level any longer, you simply must commit to making this channel a serious youtube program, incorporate the visuals you are going to need to have in order to continue to grow your subscribers and keep them coming back, and add the necessary elements to grow a network of of cross-platform social media channels for your work.﻿

            That's the thumbnail that he uploaded for the video. The thumbnail can be a separate image uploaded by the creator so there is no reason to think that this was not done intentionally by David to draw attention to what is happening to him.

           <p>
            People do need to make a living. Ones that advocate, esp as stick in issues, get huge financial burdens, behind on all, including jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its just his choice of what to.promote that I do not get. We need a new financial currency system, even.points that reward, doing for others and community; but the ones he promotes, no way that I will back them.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it sure seems like he has been harrased and is stressed. I will give the benefit of the doubt; for it does endanger ones that speak out, and IF he is legit, than I have his back.If he is not, then later, I will say, OK. But for now, I won't backstab him. Do think he needs to expand on the topic yo related areas of corruption, evidence and circumstantial evidence; local Dc , nationwide to worldwide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems as if he is having to move around a lot, so that could be a factor. Life is not easy, advocating, it does have impacts, burden, losses, loss of various access that ones take for granted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe ones should look up examples. Hers one and I've mentioned many. The whistleblowers of the Florida Hospital Huge medicare/ medicaid scandal that went to federal court , finally in Dec 2014. Each advocate when from a salary job, to having yo I've, much financial loss and threatening harms. Also, as usual, called mental.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once ones are stuck.in an Isdue, much impacts. And the life you worked hard for, goes down in a pit, more each week, until you have lost it all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Which brings me to something to hat I have mentioned, a lot. Federal Public Trust Violations, class actions. It most certainly is public trust violations to citizens to violate the govt trust bond, corrupt, add unec stress, duress, burdens, impacts. Great way to confront all the false news and harrasments and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, even in a podesta email set, its mentioned about mccaine, violating public trust that citizens could sue on.
           </p>
           <p>
            We really need every law, contract in every dept, entity, corp, including public health law and corp contracts, npos, and federal acwuistiin handbook to be posted on voutas a subverse or sidebar. To ever help the kids, must do it parallel to law and gather as much evidence of violations of laws or contracts as that IS evidence, not circumstantial.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rick Scott and so many got away with huge frauds, as Noone documented his awareness in violating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also on Podesta, is an attachment for "child labour laws." In fact, a page on children modelling and photos. Should be utilized.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, on podesta is a string of emails on how to further use, Hillbilly's, "takes a village Tp raise a child," and how each child matters with the labor laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, as citizens attacked for putting child and safety rights first and CP's even ignores and violates by not welfare check each reported child, intimidating ones who call, refusing to make reports; podesta emails are full of the child RTS propoganda they used with Hillary to make her famous and to be president.
           </p>
           <p>
            Double standard, full of #memes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Propoganda.com is full of memes too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, from a non laptop view, if you search key terms, the emails come up with the keyterm us some of the sentences typed. They are NOT on most of those emails, but on the attachments. But, if you open the attachment, its usually a logo or pic. Many Correct the need and other ones, HAVE THIS. Even the long podesta email about the media stories of Chelsea pregnant and the birth, that also have the media news that Clinton volunteer staff, followed reporters into bathroom; there is a "meat" msg, but not on the email. But hidden on the attachment. Some joke about Chelsea, about give her some red meat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, many emails, besides Podesta and Clinton are chock full of needed info. I did search terms, meat, freezer, meat- grinder, frozen, and came up with a lot!! Stratford emails show a lot, too. Even about the Serbia mafia that ones hire to smuggle drugs, weapons and such; to and fro from Syria, through Turkey.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb mentions the rest lines, as destabilize areas like Allepo, to steal children out in the chaos.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same as in the Haitian book that I.posted many comments about, Let Haiti Live, on Google book: on how Haiti is purposely destabilized bynusa policies and deplorable abuses, to then route ones in Haiti or increase refugee deportee numbers of status.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sudam , Bosnia and more, just like that. Then CCC, foreign affairs in NYC, and more, as George Webb statess in "day 67 1-3  video parts,  Where is Eric Braverman:" That all the Arab countries around Syria will have war, destabilize, going on; and them Ccc and others, come in and get the oil fields contracted and built up. The CCC website, shows the engineer corps that they work with worldwide.

            Seaman could build up his voice and safety by interviewing others in research of all related topics, advocates and victims. Making shirts/ stickers vs the bitcoin thing would help, too.

            Have not seen him engage with ones commenting. I support him, but as a rule, I do not fanatic any shows, that do not engage citizens in the issues and comments and solutions. We need inclusion news, unity, strategy, faster expedient disseminate and strategy or all stays the same.

             Need to work.on getting Trump to allow Citizen boards at every level with equal access. Maaa advocates, whistleblowers and victims are working their butts off for free, for YEARS to no avail, but sitting with tons of evidence. Protest and riot options are crap, and so savage medieval. Doesn't matter of a million are plus, have every right to sit at the roundtable, dressed civilized and be heard civilized if ones have solutions they worked hard on, dug up mass evidence and taught themselves the ins and outs of every related system.

             And, not united, dividing, not trusting neighbors and beyond is part of the programming. Yes, ones not to trust, but as elite scab violators get away with every corruption and crime for beyond decades, they work as a team, having each others back. We are way behind, and barely have any unity, strategy....

             Occam's Razor can always give a simpler answer. David Seaman has always been a shill for the 'fake paper gold' criminals, using the 'prepping' and such he lures the alt-right likes his counter gay partner 'MILO', they have a following the solution is always the same "GOLDMONEY.COM' is the answer to all problems that ail you. Now of course the problem is that "Goldmoney.Com" is neither Gold nor Money, its a faux paper promise from PT Barnum criminal con-artists so the question beg's to be asked, WHY IS SEAMAN whoring for common criminals?
            </p>
            <p>
             [ per rules 1&amp;4 discussion of Seaman has been ruled by MODS to be an approved subject ]

             I don't see 'whining' anywhere on the subject list of tolerated topics.
            </p>
            <p>
             Constant whining by Seaman, if even 1% of what he say's is true, then why does he remain on youtube.com? It's owned by the PTB; It makes no sense, we have been hearing about his whining now for over a month; How many times has this story or a version of this been posted here? 100's of times.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seaman marketed himself as a poster-boy for pizzagate in October, but by his 5th video in November he was using the venue to SELL GOLDMONEY.COM, blantant shilling and advertising, why in the hell should Google/Youtube allow him to use their venue? Is goldmoney.com even a Google advertiser? I think not.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the fucking problem for Seaman, not content, its that his videos are nothing more than promotional Advertisements for fake gold paper.

            Fiat currencies aside, I do like his style.  He is obviously intelligent and comes across as passionate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been watching his videos for a couple months now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Towards the beginning of all this pizzagate stuff he seemed like a reasonable person, with much gravitas, to check in with to get developing information.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, at this point, his videos just recycle the same simple mantra: Pizzagate is real, John Podesta is a pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is quick to remind viewers that he is a "journalist".

             His first 3 back in November were ok, by 2 weeks after Trumps election Seaman started crying about his health, and then he started shilling for 'goldmoney.com', obviously by that time youtube.com had halted his monetization.
            </p>
            <p>
             Listen folks 95% of us here don't get paid for this shit, Seaman's in it for the money and nothing more. He hasn't added value for more than a month, and google ( owner of YouTube.com ) has every right to ban his ass for blatant advertising of goldmoney.com, even Alex Jones sell's shit, but its like his t-shirts and shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the pizzagate mods have shit a hard-on for seaman, then put a bitcoin collection bucket on the site so that whiners can support whiners.

              yup 100% agree and shills here have won. It is over. He is using mossad tricks. He doesnt investigate anything he just X is real and rambles about nothing. He is faking stuff to gain trust and authority to the point that people here are giving death threats to people who disagree with him. I got one. He is leading us down the wrong path because he is told to.

            Here's the DEAL the OP is mis-leading, it alludes to the fact that youtube has banned Seaman for content of pizzagate, this is NOT true, his problem is that he's using a news channel to shill goldmoney.com
           </p>
           <p>
            Ergo this OP is a lie, and the title is misleading and has not fuck to do with pizzagate.

             I'd never heard of him prior to PG.  I liked his videos for a while, but he has gotten to be a broken record lately.  I still hope for more good vids from him.  In the meantime, it seems likely that others will also tire of his broken record mode (as some clearly are).
            </p>
            <p>
             TL;DR: relax.  Natural quality control will prevail over time.

            YouTube has never turned a profit due to the insane hosting requirements Google picks up the tab. Other companies simply cannot offer anything usually to content creators and make money.

           <p>
            The issue here really is the takedowns, yt made it clear during the elections there would be severe restrictions on politically motivated pieces in terms of monetisation. The 0 notice takedowns he's experienced along with little to no explanation on his specific violation, plus the subsequent strikes on his account are overtly threatening.

            David is a financial commentator that got mega red piled. His non PG vids are under fire too. Check though his videos the share button has been removed from some of them. Takedowns with no details on the specifics of the violation just sets a bad precedent for yt it's  users.

             Occam's Razor can always give a simpler answer. David Seaman has always been a shill for the 'fake paper gold' criminals, using the 'prepping' and such he lures the alt-right likes his counter gay partner 'MILO', they have a following the solution is always the same "GOLDMONEY.COM' is the answer to all problems that ail you. Now of course the problem is that "Goldmoney.Com" is neither Gold nor Money, its a faux paper promise from PT Barnum criminal con-artists so the question beg's to be asked, WHY IS SEAMAN whoring for common criminals?

             Constant whining by Seaman, if even 1% of what he say's is true, then why does he remain on youtube.com? It's owned by the PTB; It makes no sense, we have been hearing about his whining now for over a month; How many times has this story or a version of this been posted here? 100's of times.

             Seaman marketed himself as a poster-boy for pizzagate in October, but by his 5th video in November he was using the venue to SELL GOLDMONEY.COM, blantant shilling and advertising, why in the hell should Google/Youtube allow him to use their venue? Is goldmoney.com even a Google advertiser? I think not.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the fucking problem for Seaman, not content, its that his videos are nothing more than promotional Advertisements for fake gold paper.

              I'm sure they sponsor him so he has to plug them when he can for their continued support, not a big deal to me. Sure he hasn't really had anything new to say in his videos, but he does have 100k+ subscribers so as long he's at least spreading awareness he's ok in my book.

            What is happening in society right now mirrors exactly what happens in a family where child sexual abuse is present. There is usually one parent who is the abuser and one who goes into denial. They deny in spite of massively obvious circumstantial evidence that their spouse is sexually abusing their child.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today, we see this same dynamic playing out in our culture. There are active participants in the abuse (Podesta, likely many high profile people in the media, hollywood and government). Then, you have the general population who is doing the same thing a spouse in denial does. They are ignoring, supressing and flat out refusing to consider the evidence. They are pretending the obvious does not exist, thus helping the abuse to continue.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the majority of Americans believed and accepted the reality that elites in this country engage in child sex trafficking, there is no way they could continue to cover it up.

              Thanks for the correction. I agree. I am optimistic that something as evil as this cannot continue forever. I think, behind the scenes, these people are extremely afraid. That's why you see a national ad campaign against "fake news".

               The internet will win as long as we can keep anti-free speech legislation from passing.  Barring that any lie they tell 10% of the people watching will catch on and join the intenet insurgency against MSM.  We were able to get over 50% of the population to see things our way on one issue.  Those numbers will grow to 60%, 70% as long as they keep lying.
              </p>
              <p>
               What we need is for MSM to keep lying about this because the people will do the opposite.  What we don't want is for them to ignore us.

            David - might be time to expose the pedo-side of YT, all that "video cam" pedo stuff folks listed about a week ago here.  Do the same with Facebook, with FB officials being busted for pedo or cp, and especially their Pedomatch. You got the viewers, the bad guys are watching you -- shove this back in their face: total hypocrites, but criminals first because this is illegal, at least immoral. Same with Craig's list -- all the major second raters crying about Fake News and trying to do something about censoring their zones of the internet -- and there are all these pedo things turning up? hmmm... PG and the rise in Fake News Alerts took off right at the same time. There's a graph somewhere. god bless. take a breath, nothing will happen in this DoJ until Trump comes in. Meanwhile the data pile grows and grows. happy new year.

             Just thought this Depeche Mode child trafficking video might be interesting given the YT discussion:

             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1528002">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1528002
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             It is time to re-evaluate the whole scope of the media.  Professional MockingBirds are singing loudly but the social implications have become quite clear.  This discussion has existed on a certain level in our society for at least decades.  It has never existed in the context of the current cognitive capabilities of the modern technologies.  Maybe we need a place for posting serious video content for easy viewing and censorship free retrieval.  There must be something lying around.

             The YouTube Kids channel/app has tons of pedo videos and employs at least one pedo associate in a high director position.
