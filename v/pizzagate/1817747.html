             There was no problem when people were living under the Justinian Code--that's why (((they))) don't want you to know the truth about the Byzantine Empire.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I don't know what the code is, but Justinian was the jackass emperor who supposedly had the word "eternal" added to the word "hell" in the Bible, which made Christianity a religion of FEAR instead of LOVE. It has scared the hell out of many Christians which has made them go insane and do stupid things, like WAR and CHILD ABUSE and you name it.

            <p>
             Thanks loather!!!, i'm just trying to help a bit :)
            </p>
            <p>
             To everyone,
We need more eyes on this!
Upvoat, repost, translate, research, ask, share, make aware, bring it to the surface.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone can help,
            </p>
            <p>
             We can expect over 1 000 000 views over the next few days, on the multiple videos...
            </p>
            <p>
             Many comments asking "is he ok", "how come he is still alive?"
            </p>
            <p>
             If you go to "His" Twitter account you can't even find one comment regarding the popularity of the video interview....
And there latest tweet regarding Blackrock (as mentioned in the above post) is also not popular at all.

            <p>
             Some extra info, it is possible to hire him to give a lecture to talk about
             <strong>
              this
             </strong>
             topic.
             <br/>
             Price per person 15 euro....
            </p>
            <p>
             The video Interview is embedded on the reservation page,
             <a href="http://baai.nu/events/lezing-vrij-en-blij-uit-de-crisis-met-een-nieuwe-bank/">
              http://baai.nu/events/lezing-vrij-en-blij-uit-de-crisis-met-een-nieuwe-bank/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone could go to one of the lectures and make a video interview if he is ok with that.
also, probably in his upcoming lecture he will at least get some questions about it at the end of the lecture(?)
            </p>
            <p>
             Seems to be a big opportunity for Youtubers
            </p>
            <p>
             Next lecture:
Heerhugowaard (nl)
