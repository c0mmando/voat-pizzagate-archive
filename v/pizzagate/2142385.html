            There are many connections between the two.  The same intelligence networks infiltrate forums that discuss both cases.  There are connections between banks and politicians from London to Washington.  All documented - many times over.

            I would really suggest some more information from OP on this, maybe SHOW the evidence that Thakar Singh was involved in sex scandals, or that Ricky has interest in children in Haiti, most of the videos on the link are dead and so are some of the links, most of the information is speculation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only thing verifiable are children's testimonies, that were later redacted possibly from pressure from Ricky, police and school officials, so the coverup has still yet to be presented as absolute fact. I will agree that Ching Hai has suspicious financial histories involving Clintons...

           <blockquote>

             Taiwan government has investigated Hai's organization for "alleged fund-raising improprieties", which included a transfer of $2 million outside of the country.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             Hai gave $640,000 to Bill Clinton's Presidential Legal Expenses Trust which it returned in 1996 because of "suspicious" funding sources. , also show evidence that

            I am flairing for review because this breaks some of the posting rules in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            such as title relevance, proper working links and sources are missing, contains speculative/disinfo, and lacks pizzagate connection with actual trafficking/abuse of children.

             Yeah...I agree Honeybee_. I think we have to remove this post completely and let OP edit it to satisfy the submission rules if he chooses. I am removing per Rules 1, 2, 3 and 4.

             Most of the posts are most likely done by the real abuser of those children, Abraham Christie, under aliases, or one of his few remaining demented followers, who totally ignore the real facts and stick to his version of events like superglue.
            </p>
            <p>
             They don't like when you point out that the many fresh cuts and bruises on both children could only have been caused by him (with the mother's consent) because they hadn't seen the father for 3 months.
            </p>
            <p>
             They also ignore that he has been in trouble in the past for beating his own children and putting their mother in hospital once.
            </p>
            <p>
             And they absolutely do not want to discuss the child porn that was found on his phone, because hey, it's not as good a story as half of Hampstead being satanic pedos!

            Well, if it is true that they have a connection it certainly is very suspicious for this is what I read in the aanirfan article:   In 1996, Ching Hai asked her followers to contribute money to the Clinton Presidential Legal Expense Trust.[13]   That is not a good thing.
