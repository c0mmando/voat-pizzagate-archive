            I made a post a few days back regarding the people behind these shows. They are quite suspect due to the nature of their work, not just the drag stuff, but mostly sexualized stuff and some things that are clearly trying to push boundaries. Take a look for more

            I am a bit embarassed by how long it took me, but there are some decent shows, I don't do cable, blah blah blah.  I saw the trailer for that fucking "adults only" drag cartoon and was real close.  That child drag show finally did it, thanks guy.  My wife still thinks I am crazy; wanting water filters and railing against degeneracy but as a man it is your job to set the standards of your household.  She is an incredible mother and I hope to convince her to tackle home schooling.  For context she grew up the child of a single mother and I grew up mostly on a family farm (wood stove heat) with both parents.

            .  Netflix has been a hot topic recently on Voat and elsewhere, and Netflix knows they are having no problems in promoting this sick platform.  How many 1 or 2 parents
really give a damn anymore about what their children are watching?  Then add those who actually support this bs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could the teaming up with Netflix CEO, Reed Hastings, and the Obamas have anything to do with this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's go back to 2018 and discuss 2 events - the firing of  Netflix's top communications executive, Jonathan Friedland for use of the "N-word."  Let me tell you, I had to dig for awhile to discover the exact context in which his comment was used.
           </p>
           <p>
            Friedland, who had previously worked about a decade as a WSJ reporter and editor, called a meeting of around 60 employees in February '18 from the publicity department to discuss how the team could better handle backlash to insensitive comments.  He specifically referred to a joke in TomSegura's Netflix stand-up special about how the comedien longed for a time when the word "retarded" was acceptable in polite society.  Friedland told the WSJ he was advocating for parents of special needs kids who might see the routine and feel a "gut punch" over the comments - saying, "As if an African-American person had heard the N-word.". Friedland used the full slur in the meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Complaints from the staff arose, Friedland apologized, and spoke with Hastings and his own team before meeting with two HR reps who were African-American.  He  repeated the N-word again to the two reps  in recounting the story.  2 months after that at an April off-site meeting in Rio, Friedland expressed remorse again.
           </p>
           <p>
            In May '18, a group of African-American employees who requested a meeting with Friedland about his department were disappointed he did not specifically address and apologize for the incident.  Word of that meeting got back to Hastings who called while on business in Japan and fired Friedland over the phone.
           </p>
           <p>
            After news of Friedland's exit hit, an irate Hastings emailed his executives, demanding that the leak come forward to HR, adding in his note that "you'll get a discreet, quiet exit and our generous severance package" for coming forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            In July '18, Hastings stood before 500 Netflix executives at a retreat near LA on the beach.  He shed tears on stage over the scandal, before slicing al emon in half and drinking its juice while reciting the proverb about making lemonade.
           </p>
           <p>
            A little bit about Reed Hastings - he owns Facebook shares worth over $10 million.  He served on the board of Microsoft from 2007-2012.  He is the great-grandson of Alfred Lee Loomis, an American attorney, investment banker, philanthropist, and scientist/physicist who invented LORAN Long Range Navigation System.
           </p>
           <p>
            And last but not least, in 2018 Reed Hastings notched a multiyear deal with Obama and wife Michelle's production company, Higher Ground Productions, to produce "films and series for Netflix."
           </p>
           <p>
            Netflix, in 2007, had a $3 share price and was mailing DVD's to people.  The Obamas were poised to enter the White House and then had a reported net worth of $1.3 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fast forward to 2018.  The Obamas have an estimated combined net worth of $75 million.  Hasting's move to streaming helped him amass $4.7 billion.  The Obama Netflix production deal - on which neither party will put a value - was most likely helped along by new Netflix board member, Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security advisor.

            The contrast between firing a man while you stand on a pulpit accusing him of racially-slurred speech which was completely taken out of context, to broadcasting without batting an eye,  garbage for our children to see is what???  I have no words for it that are strong enough.

            The Obamas have something to do with this.

             It's sick.  Read my post about Red Freedom Club, the Leftist Marxists used Child sexualization as part of their political philosophy, that has not changed apparently.

             But child sex? Also has anyone noticed that these kids almost all have dark, nearly black, bags under their eyes? We’ve seen this before in our investigations, no child that’s 10 years old should have 50 year old bag under their eyes. It’s proof they’re being abused

              The children being sexualized are being abused, but bags under the eyes aren't proof of child abuse. They can also be caused by allergies and sinus issues.

            Don't forget the Muslim "culture" of child marriage and coming up with an acceptable narrative for the western mind to justify this barbaric practice on our soil. But primarily I think this is just post-modernism coming to it's logical conclusion combined with the last phase of decadence before the fall of western empire.

             Agree, all degenerate roads lead to the fall of our country unless something changes on a fundamental level.  SJW and 'Liberation' Leftist Marxism doctrine needs to be fumigated out of the universities.  The Enemy of the people FAKE NEWS needs a proper burial as a nightmarish chapter in History.  People need to continue to speak out for the protection of children and for individual rights and the preservation of the Constitution of the US.  Not succumbing to globalist pedo scum.
