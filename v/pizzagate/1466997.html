            I was having a conversation with one of my friends about this the other day. He said he wasn't sure if there was human trafficking, pedophilia, or anything. It could be money laundering for all we know. But he admitted there's just too much weird shit going around this story for it to be nothing - something is going on and it's probably not anything good.

             Like I said, I think there's SOMETHING here. I'm not going to outright accuse him of pedophilia. It certainly looks like he is. It's not normal. it IS weird, but I don't think the restaurant has anything to do with it.

              Right it's just the hub of where they all these "weird" people congregate to joke about pedophilia and torture. Makes perfect sense. Then why hide there's a basement at Comet Pizza if there's nothing going on? I doubt anyone but JA and whoever else involved in whatever depravity is going on knows it's there. In fact, I'd bet on it. But it is. The RE listings prove it's there. So why use Bucks to store tomato sauce for use at Comet? What is that space being used for if not storage?

               Use Google Street View and use the tool to virtually march your ass around the whole complex. As you turn the corner on Nebraska street, you will see how there's a hill. Comet's "basement" is just a small walk-out area that is "behind the curtain". You people are freaking out about something that doesn't even exist. Just like the guy with the gun. He was SO sure he was gonna go find something.. and you know what he found? NOTHING.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact.. if you go a little further to the very back of the complex, you will see that there are GARAGES with 2 sets of windows above them. I don't know about you, but I've never seen a basement that was
               <em>
                under
               </em>
               a garage. Basement level = foundation. Garage level is also foundation.

                Okay, you're not only a shill, you're an idiot. If I knew there was nothing between your ears,  I wouldn't have bothered talking to you. You wrote that all by yourself, did you? Do they allow you crayons now? Or do you still eat them?
               </p>
               <p>
                Here's the correct info and I will not be responding to anything you have to say, shill. People think you're a shill because you are one.

                And I quote:
               </p>
               <p>
                "Like Pastan, James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong in D.C., doesn't build his pizza sauce with DOP San Marzanos. For seven years, he has been buying late-harvest tomatoes from Toigo Orchards in Shippensburg, Pa., and canning them at nearby Stello Foods for use at Comet. Last year, Alefantis estimates, he bought 12 tons of Toigo tomatoes, which Stello turned into sauce and canned before trucking the jars to the basement at Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping, Alefantis' other restaurant nearby."

            You hit on the correct point I think a lot of newer people around here are forgetting. This is not old, this has been going on for decades. It is now called PizzaGate in this generation. This has been reported since the 80's.

            But in reality it is stopping human trafficking on a global scale. It was never singled out to just 1 place where the crime is happening. It is happening everywhere. How quickly everyone was tricked to keep focusing on comet ping pong when it is a problem involving much more powerful people.

           <p>
            Read up on the franklin files.. then remember that the New york times used to be a different kind of paper that would openly report on things like this! Look at how the media is controlled today.

             This is why some people have suggested that we "rebrand ourselves" and change the pizzagate into another term. I am not even sure if it would be a good or very bad idea, but either way the proposition is usually firmly dismissed.

              It won't happen. Pizzagate will stick. I just really hope people leave Comet Ping Pong alone. It's not good for our research or reputation for them to be hassled.

            I understand. This was one of the things that freaked me out in the beginning, too.

            However, it's not impossible that it's just a coincidence. They do happen.

            I know about the logo at Terasol as well, but I've seen other posts where the same exact 2 hearts with 2 hands inside image was found on a CPR webpage. That indicated to me that it's a clip-art graphic from some graphics editing program.
           </p>
           <p>
            The more I think about it, the more I think people (including myself) have over-reacted. I've commented on quite a few threads. I'm not a "shill"
