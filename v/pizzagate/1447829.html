After he said he thought Sandy Hook was a hoax, quite frankly he turned me off (actually I\'m still mad at him, I\'ll get to that in a minute). I stumbled on videos saying Sandy Hook was a hoax and I thought I would just look at a few.  I was speaking to one of my friends about it and her teenage son said everybody knows Sandy Hook is a hoax.  I was actually in shock! I must admit I cried for hours and days following 12/14/12.  I eventually just turned the channel when it came on as I had lost an infant son some years ago and I couldn\'t handle the emotions it brought to the surface.  I did remember thinking it was very strange that a person with Aspergers would carry out such an act since I know people with Aspergers and other people with autism spectrum disorders and they are simply not known to be violent in that way.  They might have a fit of rage but nothing close to the calculated and diabolical behavior exhibited by Adam Lanza.  After reviewing MANY videos and especially the ones that were supposedly created by the victim\'s families I became convinced it WASN\'T as it was being portrayed.  Something just isn\'t right!  
</p>
<p>I understand that people DO grieve differently;but that\'s just it, they ALL seemed to grieve the same, NO tears, no not 1 from any family member.  I just found this today and I loved it!  Warning, it is almost 3 hours long but I was so enthralled that I couldn\'t stop watching it!  I even thought perhaps the producers could help us with pizzagate as it was so well put together! <a href="https://youtu.be/IxTafqejV6k">https://youtu.be/IxTafqejV6k</a> (again, shills, I\'m not putting this out to debate or argue.  Do not tell me Sandy Hook was not fake unless you have watched this video.  And then if you watch it and aren\'t convinced then I probably still don\'t want to debate you because you obviously have no reasoning skills)</p>
<p>Now how does this tie in to Pizzagate? I\'m not exactly sure but bear with me.  Shills, don\'t start because I\'m NOT claiming to have the answers! I\'m trying to invoke discussion about this. I received threats after I asked a few questions on Twitter about Sandy Hook.  The person told me they were going to find out where I lived and told me to ask Wolfgang Halbig and Jonathan Reich how that worked for them.  These threats led me to more questions as I had not heard of Jonathan Reich.  He sent me a screen shot where Reich had been arrested!   He is currently in the Bronx prison for asking questions!  I then found this video and it sickened me.  <a href="https://youtu.be/yKpIM1mEeYQ">https://youtu.be/yKpIM1mEeYQ</a>. 
  I have tried to get this information to Alex Jones and pretty much all of his staff and contributors and have received NO reply!  That is why I am mad at Alex Jones! </p>
<p>The things that make me wonder how this might be tied to Pizzagate; So many indirect ways but here\'s a few: </p>
<p>I find this video disturbing as this child was interviewed about Sandy Hook.  Watch her parents.  <a href="https://youtu.be/HYn22g2-nxc">https://youtu.be/HYn22g2-nxc</a></p>
<p>We already established the huge connection in these elitists with these two earlier post</p>

<p>Herb &amp; Marion Sandler, parents of the author of the handkerchief email, was very influential with the Obama Transition Team which was spearheaded by yes, you guessed it, John Podesta.  One email that was forwarded to him from Herb Sandler offered three recommendations from Larry Brilliant <a href="http://archive.is/RS2hz">http://archive.is/RS2hz</a>
to Chris Edley </p>
<p><a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/christopher-edley/">https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/christopher-edley/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/79">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/79</a></p>
<p>The three recommendations included Tara O\'Toole 
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/79/127">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/79/127</a> (very impressive resume)</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/YbOso">http://archive.is/YbOso</a> 
  Here is her government bio including of course Homeland Security.  Notice from the site the following, &quot;She was a principal author and producer of Dark Winter, an influential exercise conducted in June 2001 to alert national leaders to the dangers of bioterrorist attacks. She was also a principal writer and producer of Atlantic Storm, an international ministerial-level biosecurity exercise held in January 2005.&quot;  Interesting she produced two &quot;exercises&quot; and wrote them as well.  
</p>
<p>This is a much shorter clip of Sandy Hook facts obviously made by an amateur but still important.  
</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/oU6lMDIfRpE">https://youtu.be/oU6lMDIfRpE</a></p>
<p>The two main parts to this clip that are of concern and connecting to Tara O\'Toole is when the town employee is asked under oath who she thinks ordered the portapotties and she admitted it was probably Homeland Security.  Also when the governor says he was warned earlier something like that might happen and then he denies saying it!  Again, Tara O\'Toole has produced two &quot;exercises&quot; already.  
</p>
<p>Then you have this post that potentially ties Podesta\'s property management group to the Covenant House and Adam Lanza\'s mom to the Covenant House.  &quot;Thank you for all that you do&quot; with a handwritten card from the president Kevin Ryan.  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1442331">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1442331</a><br />
Somewhat far reaching but still a connection.  
</p>
<p>If the government can orchestrate such an elaborate scheme with the help of children and the MSM then we are in for a HUGE battle.  If you delve into this you can see there are body bags tied to this cover up as well just like Andrew Brietbart and so many others.  I\'m praying Jonathan Reich is safe and he can hold out until 1/21/17 !  Please let me know your thoughts and let\'s see if we can connect more dots to pizzagate!</p>',

            I too feel there's a very deep connection between these two scandals. What REALLY clinched it for me was after viewing one of George Webbs recent videos, he proclaimed (without explanation however) they usually take and transport the kidnapped children in groups of 20. How many kids supposedly died in Sandy Hook? Yup, 20!
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a nauseated feeling, of the kids who were real (opposed to being created like Adam Lanza) they might have been sold off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of the parents I've seen in interviews seem to be blatantly devoid of any emotion. They don't even strike me as stoic. They seem empty. Robotic (especially Robbie Parker). And it seems to me when they aren't devoid emotion, they seemed fairly old for having such young kids. So....could they have been bred to be sold?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know but addition to all that----- the close ties Obama and his administration had/has with these folks really leaves a hole in the middle of my gut. Something doesn't bode well with me. Not at all.

            SH was pretty easy to expose.  The DNA evidence is damning and is right on the CT website for all to see.  I hope we find some DNA evidence to support this investigation.

            So Adam Lanza went to a different Sandy Hook where he was abused.... hence they topped him.

            While I hope the pizzagate investigation does not get derailed by Sandy Hook, here is some hard evidence it was faked:
The FBI's own statistics on crime in 2012, state by state. Sandy Hook Elementary was in Newtown Conn.

             Trust me I'm truly not trying to do that but just too many similarities! Even the Connecticut part! Tunnels... not trying to derail but I think it we can make connections it might help make a case in one area if we can't prove something in another.  Al Capone ya know?

              Please examine the link above. Then ask yourself, why does the FBI report that no one died at all in Newtown Conn. in 2012? This is the best evidence that no one died at Sandy Hook: The FBIs crime report. Why would they get it wrong on the single biggest most horrible mass shooting in US history?

            Thanks for having me here, I've watched from afar this issue and for years have followed similar anomalous issues.  As others have said,  you will find that Sandy Hook does tie into all of this with regards to the satanic and lying aspect....but it would do no good to bring up, it will only confuse anyone new to what is going on.  On the other hand, for those who realize how vast the wickedness is....here's a video.  The video is long, but only the first 15 minutes of it or so show what needs to be shown, the rest is an interview with a man, former national school safety expert who fought very hard to expose that TV school shooting.  The video shows the degree to which our "news" is fabricated and by whom.

            Trust me when you watch the video you will have no doubt.  Like I said earlier, whether they did sacrifice some children or adults I don't know but a lot of the families moved in less than a year before the shootings and moved out shortly after.  I'm not sure what scares me more then thinking they found pull it off, the fact that they did pull it off, or that even FOX news was in on it.  I thought they might actually report the actual news.  After I saw this first hand only a few weeks ago I knew CNN was hopeless!

             What the? You sound crazy saying that and I sound crazy thinking you're probably right!  But what we have to remember is this! These people (I hate to call them that) have so much power, so much money, so much technology at their disposal that they have pulled off the worst atrocities for years and no one has caught them!  I feel like even their Hollywood movies are taunting us, smugly telling us what they are doing to either show off or worse putting it out there as fiction so that when someone does slip out and come forward, it seems too unbelievable and too "copied" from fiction to actually be true! Have you read what Nicole Kidman's fathers accusers have said about him and his group?  There were 60 witnesses... REMINDS me of an even more barbaric version of Hunger Games!  We have to do something!

              I know! This is how they do it: Literature and electronic media is flooded with fantastical accounts and programming based upon a high percentage of truth. Then, they take it to the unbelievable extreme so that when we see them in action we associate the events with "fiction" and discount all of it. We saw the horror movie. We know the movie was fake. Therefore, this is fake. The media also serves to condition us to compartmentalize the gore. We've built up a system of locking away the trauma by practicing on horror movies. I can't watch them, BTW.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will never forget watching the towers come down and thinking: "This is a movie!" I didn't believe it when it happened, but it took many years to stumble upon those who had begun to piece it together and expose that there are people capable of perpetrating such a horrific and deadly hoax. And I've been "crazy" ever since. Welcome to the crazy club! :)

             If there were victims we need to have access to their autopsies.  The law that was passed a year before took away our access to them very conveniently.  I'm sure Trump could get an executive order for them which would or should list if they had sexual trauma on their bodies.

            TBH I think pizzagate connects to EVERY conspiracy theory (the ones with people dying anyway) from the past 50 years atleast.

            The SH seem to be related more to controlling the narrative and using staged tragedies to push for agenda.

           <p>
            Here is an interesting video:

            The P0desta case seem to be somewhat different, thought maybe similar actors are involved - pushing for NWO.

            I don't feel like reading all of that just now. BUT
           </p>
           <p>
            Sandy Hook has ties to Obama as well. 
Obama has never had a birth record. His mom couldn't even put him on her passport when he was 7 without it.
Now here is the odd thing. His SS# is a CT number, he never lived in CT. The number traces to Harrison J Bounel who died in 1978 I believe. The Sandy Hook shooting led to the state to change the laws to prevent access to death records.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama was under pressure to produce a BR. He introduce new executive orders that would make it unreasonable to make some freedom of information requests during his first months in office, that would mean his information, like tax records, etc. Thats how he locked out his school records and everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            But somebody posted an interesting video showing his mother passport forms with a new name under his and in brackets.. AND
            <a href="https://youtu.be/5z8EH3C6_-8">

            it will shock you to see he isn't black at all..
           </p>
           <p>
            It always bothered me thinking he does not look half African and I thought maybe middle eastern, but still not right.. Then I saw this and bingo!! He is Indonesian!!

             I am Indonesian, and he looks rather like some of my family. Too tall, though. There are natives in Indonesia who appear to be black, and very tall compared to say, my family. He could easily be a mix. But I have to say, he looks very similar to some of my relatives face-wise.

            I agree because as horrible as I feel about it, they had me hook line and sinker.  I did not ever feel like giving up our 2nd amendment was going to help but I feel like if we could hold them accountable for this come 1/21/17 then maybe more heads would roll and maybe this could lead to names in pizzagate!  It seems too weird about the Covenant House Connection!

            What I find even more scary are her "exercises" the one even starring Madelyn Albright as the POTUS.  It was on smallpox and the person who recommend her to the dean of Berkeley law school who sent it to Herb Sandler who forwarded it to John Podesta is Larry Brilliant, an epidemiologist!  Very scary they these people who we assume are doing what we think they are have access to so many diseases and chemicals! Did you see her resume? It's about 25 pages long and involved uranium and so many other things! I pray we make it until 1/21/17 and I just pray Trump is different and not involved!

            Good post! I started watching the video and it sparked a question in my mind about the Tucson shooting of Gabriella Giffords. Looked up videos calling for that to be a hoax and none of the evidence lines up like this does. I'm not going to lie I kind of wish it was a hoax. Mostly because when I went to school in Tucson I was pretty close to Jared Loughner. He helped me through a lot of struggles. No excuse for what he did, I just wish things were different, for everyone involved.

             I'm sorry to hear that! I have skimmed some of those things too about Giffords but have not really looked into it.  I'm just trying to embrace the fact I was lied to about 20 6/7 year old getting killed and 6 adults! I cried for days and couldn't watch tv because it upset me so and that's what I guess they were hoping! Watching the videos of the "parents" infuriates me because I know when my son died I cried for months, years, and sometimes I still do and it's been 19 years ago.  None of the videos shows one parent crying.  They've received millions and it sickens me that they got by with it! I feel like this is almost more blatant than the pizzagate even though what they are doing with pizzagate is much much worse.  This is something that CAN be proven quickly if we can get Trump in and get the right FBI agents in to investigate it properly!  That might take down some of the criminals!

            I have investigated Sandy Hook every which way. I never believed it was a hoax. I believe it happened and yes, there could be a link to pizzagate, as a ritual. It was brought to light years ago that Adam Lanza was interested in pedophilia. He defended pedophilia under his handle "smiggles." Many users on Shock Beyond Belief would make fun of him for this. He was a budding pedophile- he wrote a screenplay called "Lovebound" about a relationship between an older man and a ten year old boy. He expressed interest in consenting relationships between adults and children and thought it should be legal. It was never confirmed that Adam Lanza had cp on his hard drive, as he destroyed it before the massacre, but what could have been on that hard drive? If you want, I could give you more information on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT- I always had a theory that he was a victim of sexual abuse as a child and these pedophilic feelings and thoughts were a result of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT 2- after pizzagate surfaced, the first thing I did was comb through pictures of his rooms to check if there were any of the pedo symbols but I haven't found any from the stills. Perhaps I will watch the video of the police walk through of his home again and keep my eyes open

             Based on my research, there is no real evidence of him having an online presence, aside from what the MSM has said. Which is impossible for an autistic introvert. Cremated him before we could deal with autopsy reports, second opinions, etc. Why are the lives of these children protected, but the Columbine kids (among dozens of others) weren't?

              He frequented a columbine discussion board called shocked beyond belief under the handle smiggles. there are pdfs available of his comments, you can google it if you'd like. There's also a recording of him calling into a radio station under the name "greg." He talked about it as smiggles on SBB and people who knew him verified it was his voice. The topic he talks about (Travis the chimp) was of great interest to him, and the anecdote he tells parallels his motives imo. You can google that too it's on youtube. There was an autopsy report and it's available on the official report as well as about 18 autopsy photos which are redacted. Peter Lanza claimed his body on December 30 or December 31, I believe he was cremated on December 28 so it's not like they did it quickly... his body was there for two weeks. What do you mean by protected? I sure wouldn't want to see the bodies of 6 and 7 year old children mangled and mutilated after an AR15 was through with them. Also, the crime scene photo of Eric and Dylan dead was not released to the public, it was leaked.

             Most people say they don't believe he ever existed which is what I believe.  It just doesn't make sense any other way! Did you watch the video? The same girl that claimed to be his friend (in another video I saw but didn't post) was the same actress who played James Foley's sister.  Neighbors said they never saw him and the guy who cut his hair didn't even hdvd a license.  Anyone could say they are him on the internet.

              I've watched nearly all Sandy Hook hoax videos... red silver j, professor doom, all of them trust me I've seen them all. I just want to put forth another possible theory that I have always had in the back of my mind: it was not a hoax, it happened, but it was not spontaneous- it was a satanic ritual. I've been to Sandy Hook, and it's a really strange and eerie place. So much of it is comprised of an old run down mental hospital. There are weird things going on there.
             </p>
             <p>
              Adam Lanza undoubtably existed- my best friend in college went to high school with him at Newtown High School. She had latin class with him. There are yearbook pictures of him when he was young, records of him being mentioned on sports teams in news paper articles, him making honor roll in middle school. At that point think about occam's razor.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course they will have crisis actors come on the news and make a scene pretending to be some family member or friend to pull on heart strings, that I do believe.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will tell you this- something is up with that place. It is not right.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have firmly believed since I began researching SH three years ago that Lanza was a victim of some satanic child sex ritual and was essentially brainwashed to carry out this event.

              However, we are starting to tread into some serious not pizzagate related topics so I will end there

               Not saying your wrong but I took Latin and it's not an easy language.  Adam Lanza's dad says he couldn't even tie his shoes so I'm not sure. Still, like you said, something is up no matter what.  I think the part that creeps me out most is the part with Tara O'Toole.  The Homeland Security Connection.  She makes productions and the towns person said she thought Homeland Security ordered them. They were there before the shooting.  Did you see her resume and her knowledge of smallpox and uranium...?  Referred to the position my Herb Sandler after Larry Brilliant suggested her.

            It would be more funny if it weren't so true! I completely agree with you that Pizzagate is different in so many ways because it is currently going on! It's hard for me to sleep and I'm still loosing sleep worrying about Jonathan Reich a kid pretty much who was just doing  what MSM is supposed to be doing and he's in prison! The reason I wanted to point this out is that there are many connections but also that they have no limitations! Of course I realize what they are doing to the children is far worse than false flags but when they exhibit such arrogance that they were so careless with details and such we are in a scary place! The part that makes me really mad is I was fooled, and fooled for 4 years!

            i didn't even read your post, but i don't have to. STOP REACHING..... the further out you try to get the more ground we lose.
           </p>
           <p>
            You guys don't have to take my word for it......but I seriously suggest staying away from  the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            DO NOT try to connect Hollywood,
Mainstream pizza chains, Sandy Hook, 9/11, Boston Bombings, ISIS, random people who like pizza that have no relation to the podestas, Papa Johns, Oscar Meyer, Flat Earth, Mandela Effect, JFK Assasination,
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't use the following terms:
Illuminati
NWO
           </p>
           <p>
            we need to solve pizzagate before we try to make it connect to even bigger conspiracies.

             You aren't going to "solve pizzagate" with blinders on. There are real tentacles from Corrupticut to the District of Corruption. And they are very convoluted. My research uncovered connections via "charities" set up (by people connected with SH) for Haiti, Dominican Republic and Uganda, with links to the deeply corrupt AmeriCares and the Clinton Foundation. Clinton is all over Sandy Hook, and with Clinton comes organized pedophilia. Telling other researchers what they can and can't say, words they can't use, etc. is censorship. It has no place in an open inquiry.

             good stuff. heard Lionel the other day saying Conspiracy Analysis is what we're doing. Much more respectable. associated with science, forensics, deductive sherlock stuff. Also a great reply when somebody accuses you of being a CTer. they'll have to stop and think about it.

             Just to let you know also, I didn't try to make this connect and I know some connections are far reaching! I just kept stumbling onto the same clues that took me back to Sandy Hook and I guess since I had just discovered that it is probable orchestrated "operation" it was fresh on my mind.  The Covenant House connection was first and then as I was researching the Sandlers because of the handkerchief connection and the email from Podesta's assistant to Herb Sandler the day after Maddie McCann went missing.  I saw exactly how influencial Herb Sandler was to the transition and White House appointees.  He sent him lots of emails during the time of the transition!  Then as I was looking at some of them I stumbled on Tara O'Toole and when I saw what she did with Homeland Security and the two operations she produced I thought of what the Newtown employee said about Homeland Security being involved.  The clues led me there I was trying to make it work.  Trust me, it scares the hell out of me.

             Fucking amen to that.  Certain words and events just make people dismiss you right away.  They won't listen to you if you start going off about the New World Order and how you think Sandy Hook was a hoax.  The latter will even make them resent you.

              Please read above what I said to arigold.  And my point is exactly that when I wrote the post! The fact it turns people off to say it was a hoax!  I thought that was so far reaching nobody could possibly pull that off and do I would dismiss the person but the clues took me back there!  It's also weird how Alex Jones was all Sandy Hook this and that and now there is a guy who was just locked up a few days ago for investigating it and he hadn't said a word!  And guess what, I wouldn't even know about it if I haven't been threatened online!

               I watched the documentary and they make some decent points, but also make some bad points.  The google cache is really the smoking gun they should have focused on more prominently.  Something fishy happened there, that's for sure.

              Why do we put so much faith in FBIAnon?  He didn't provide a shred of proof, even going so far as to say he lied to us for "plausible deniability".  Most of the stuff he said was vague enough anyway that they have the same basic legitimacy as a horoscope.  All he had to do was drop
              <strong>
               one
              </strong>
              solid connection in his "suggestions", just
              <strong>
               one
              </strong>
              smoking gun, but he didn't.  Or all he had to do was prove he was who he said he was.  He could have figured something out, surely.

               I'm not sure but he seems to be correct so far.  He started talking 7/2/16 before DNC leaks or Podesta emails.

            I just started watching that video, and something already piqued my interest.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy">
             Lobotomies
            </a>
            . 
Of notable cases
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Kennedy">
             Rosemary Kennedy, sister of  president JFK
            </a>
            .
To this day, that is something that I always pondered about. 
And I still can't believe the creator of that awful procedure won a nobel prize. Really makes you wonder.. The nefariousness of people.

             I watched the video and it was laid out so well I was simply glued to the screen! There are 100 videos with story discrepancies online and I know they might be true but this was done so professionally it and told the true story! Or at least the lack thereof. You must watch the whole thing! It is so scary to think that group of people has such deep ties to that hospital that did such horrific things that you described!

             Thank you so much! I can't believe I was fooled for so long because I just couldn't stand to watch and what I missed was being lied to! These people truly have no boundaries and we must stay vigilante to get justice! MSM is in on it because our government and MSM are owned by these elitists!

             I remember watching it and everything seemed too perfect. Then everyone started talking about it being fake. Though I think the biggest indicator was that it completely died away months after it happened. Everyone knows that the media especially the liberal branches love to boast about that kinda stuff.

            I didn't realize until looking into Pizzagate that the Sandy Hook murderous kid had a Satanic website.   Never saw that in ANY msm stories.  They only called for more gun control...   Worried about Satanicphobia?

             Well according to this video I shared with the post
             <a href="https://youtu.be/IxTafqejV6k">

             they are not sure he really existed!  There are too many lies and cover ups and deaths!  Most people feel it is tied somehow to the occult.  Not sure but feel like if someone watches the video and still believe sandy hook occurred like MSM says it did, THEY have no thinking skills!

              Adam Lanza was also interested in and spoke a lot about pedophilia. He basically was a pedophile.

               Most people don't think he ever existed.  I think they may have catfished him.  There is no evidence he existed.  Neighbors never saw him.  A girl that was on tv that said she was his friend in school also played the sister of James Foley.  You can look it up.  She even was laughing in the interview and her "brother" supposedly had just gotten beheaded!
