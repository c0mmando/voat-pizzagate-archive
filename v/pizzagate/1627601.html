            "Another attempt at making David invisible" LOL. Come on man, did you even care to look him up? He is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time. Also their names are spelled exactly the same.

            Really? Not me. I get still get PizzaGate David, as oppose to the one you're talking about: David Seaman MBE, world famous ex-British Premier League footballer (Goalkeeper) who played for England, Arsenal, Queens Park Rangers and Birmingham City.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...which is weird, because British David IS arguably more globally famous (apart from the U.S) and important and SHOULD be coming up nearer the top of google searches?
           </p>
           <p>
            ...and they both spell their names exactly the same. Don't know why you think otherwise?

Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and say I'm in Merica ,and for that reason I'd expect to see some more Merica fuck yeah search results than any (not-so-popular sport with too much running and not enough action) like wtf Google!? Soros got you paid off too? Damn I wish bing was worth a shit....ooo I wonder where that fat Brit Jeeves went to? Hopefully not with Jared to Subway

            This guy just rants and rants and rants. He should do some research and help out that way. Honestly, I got a bad feeling about this guy from Day 1 when he made definitive claims that Podesta is a pedophile rapist killer. Now, there is a good chance he is, or at least a pedophile. I actually BELIEVE he is but from DAY 1 I never was saying HE DEFINITELY IS! All I did was preach for an investigation into all these people because there is a lot of fucked up shit going on and on top of that I did massive amounts of research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Did we ever see proof his PayPal account being locked?
           </p>
           <p>
            How do we know he didn't enter is password in 50 times and lock himself out to trick people into feeling bad and in the end tipping him even more when his PayPal was unlocked?
           </p>
           <p>
            What research has he done of his own?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was his YouTube locked because he was making claims about Podesta (For the record, I do believe he is a pedo) when it hasn't been proven?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did he say he's not going to talk about Pizzagate anymore because there is nothing left to do but wait for law enforcement and then change his mind?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not even going to look at his twitter but why isn't he live streaming it?
           </p>
           <p>
            I've personally had enough of this guy but don't forget to tip him guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stay cautious.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will keep posting this on every Seaman post because this is the 10th post I've seen about him and it bothers me he does no research for someone who has so much to say

             Well, keep copy n pasting my friend. I'd like to answer the questions as I too am a doubter (you have to nowadays am I right?)
            </p>
            <p>
             Id have to direct you to The Higherside Chats in his most recent podcast to answer any of those questions honestly. 
You'll enjoy the long list of other #pizzagate, Haiti pedo-ring, Clinton admin researchers who met their untimely suspicious demise discussed by THC.
Oh, and I have a question for you! (And since I'm essentially being told I operate Google like a dementia riddled drunk monkey) I'll have to ask you if the Daily Show ever really featured an interview with "the seamen?"

              Yes, you have to question everything. Just think about this whole election. Just think about the fact that HIllary Clinton was given 3 or 4 presidential debate questions. You can't make this shit up and on top of that the MSM never had her address this issue. That is just one small reason to question everything.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for Seaman, I don't believe he ever appeared on the Daily Show and I'm not sure why. I wish David Seaman can be more like Ben Swann. It was a great piece of journalism provided by Ben Swann.

               Ben Swann, is he dead too?
Btw, haven't been able to listen to it yet (maybe on my next long load) but this guy Marty Leeds sounds like a good one.
