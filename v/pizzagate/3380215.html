            Are people really still putting faith in the FBI?  They are fully compromised and NOT on our side.  They are there to prtect the elite and destroy incriminating evidence.  This should be crystal by now.

            Hi LP. Can you add a link to this -- like one of the ones having to do with the raid? Or maybe someone who is a likely whitehat talking about it on Twitter? We have to have a link for every submission per Rule 2. I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. Thanks!

            Were there still people being kept on the island?  Why would the FBI raid the island unless there was suspect of 'evidence' revealed in the Epstein files.  Epsteins death was the best thing for the law.

              If nothing else...   It would be a matter of 'Due Diligence'.   You arrest a pedophile that trafficked people.   Is it possible there were still some young'ens still being held on the island.   It is worth a quick look to make sure nobody is locked in a cage starving to death.

            ATTENTION ALL NEW VISITORS:
           </p>
           <p>
            OP IS A VERIFIED SHILL WHO IS TRYING TO TRICK YOU INTO FALSELY BELIEVING THE Q MOVEMENT TO BE A RACE BASED MOVEMENT. THEY FEAR WHAT Q IS REVEALING, SO WHEN THEY POST "NEWS", THEY ALWAYS USE THEIR TYPICAL LEFTIST COMMIE COLLECTIVIST CONCEPTS, THEIR ONLY INTENTION IS TO DIVIDE THE ACCELERATING Q MOVEMENT AND STOP THE UNITING OF INDIVIDUAL PATRIOTS WHO HAVE NO SKIN COLOR. BY USING THEIR RACIST TERMS THEY HOPE TO PREVENT GOOD, HONEST, PATRIOTIC INDIVIDUALS FROM JOINING THE Q MOVEMENT BY TRICKING THEM ABOUT WHAT THE Q MOVEMENT REALLY IS ABOUT.
           </p>
           <p>
            THEY WANT GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS BASED ON ONE OR ANOTHER COLLECTIVIST CONCEPT LIKE RACE. OR RELIGION. OR POLITICAL PARTY. THEY NEVER EVER EVER SPEAK OF OTHERS AS INDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND VALUES AND ACTIONS. WHY IS THAT YOU MIGHT ASK? IT'S BECAUSE THEY OTHERWISE CAN'T DIVIDE PEOPLE INTO WARRING TRIBES DISTRACTING THEMSELVES WHILE THE REAL, TRUE ENEMIES ARE IGNORED. BY TREATING EVERYONE AS INDIVIDUALS WITH THEIR OWN CHOICES AND VALUES, THEY CAN'T DIVIDE THE PEOPLE. THE FAKE NEWS TRIES TO DIVIDE PEOPLE WITH LIES. SO DO THE SHILLS ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES LIKE THIS ONE.
           </p>
           <p>
            THE RACE BAITING AND OVERTLY RACIST SHILLS HERE ARE NOT WELCOME, NOT A PART OF THE Q MOVEMENT, AND ARE IN FACT PART OF THE ORG OF PEOPLE Q IS TAKING DOWN.
           </p>
           <p>
            THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU SEE THIS ANCIENT DEGENERATE VIEW OF HUMANITY BEING PEDDLED BY THE SHILLS.

           <p>
            THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SHILLS ARE PROGRAMMED HERE TO DO. DISTRACT PEOPLE INTO THINKING NOT OF THE SATANISTS Q IS EXPOSING, WHO ARE THE SHILL'S "HANDLERS", BUT OF THINKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE AS CONSISTING OF INHERENTLY INCOMPATIBLE "TRIBES". TRIBE AGAINST TRIBE. RACE AGAINST RACE. THEY NEED THIS OR ELSE THEY ARE EXPOSED.
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS IS THE REAL Q:

            Sounds great in theory. But we're talking about the FBI here. Its just as reasonable to think they are covering up evidence.

             Exactly this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever evidence was there is long gone. The FBI is nothing more than a political tool and should be viewed as nothing more.  If those who have something to hide (of the correct political persuasion) the FBI will go out of its way to use its full training and abilities to do their beckoning.

             Absolute power necessitates a loyal enforcement agency.
