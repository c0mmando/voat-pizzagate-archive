            Damn, I started watching one of those unlisted videos and even though it looked harmless, within 20 seconds I was starting to feel dizzy, nauseous and emotionally "uneasy"...and I'm a person that loves roller-coasters and horror movies so it's not like I have a weak stomach.  Very disturbing.  I think it's fair to say that the autists have linked Elsa-gate to The Finders cult.

            Disturbing stories from parent whose kid watched the videos:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I'm anon that posted the videos because my daughter had been watching them. Maybe I can help a bit with what happened once she found them. She became a bit detached from her brother, would rather watch youtube then play with him or watch the cartoons she used to enjoy. She would ask for "play-doh" her catch all for the play-doh videos her and her cousin started off watching, mostly kids stuff or toy unboxing videos, we would watch these on the big TV sometimes, nothing nefarious.
            </p>
            <p>
             Best I can ascertain is she got these videos in her recommended videos and it instantly filled the playlist. It would start with Elsa or finger family and go from there, it probably went on for a month before we really noticed exactly how fucked up they were. It only went on that long because it was October and the spooky sounds we thought were Halloween videos, which they often were.
            </p>
            <p>
             In that month she developed ADD symptoms, she could no longer sit and watch a show with us, or play a game, even coloring became boring after a minute or two for her. If she had the tablet she could watch for hours though, I believe this was probably the colors and songs creating an almost trance. She then started blaming bad behaviour on the witch or someone named zee who was "the meanest girl in the world when her face turns green her words (3yr at the timeand started hitting, biting, threatening and saying it was the witch or zee.
            </p>
            <p>
             We caught her one day wrapping a lace from one of her toys around her and my son's neck and blamed it on the witch or zee and we decided to take a closer look at what she was watching. I know, a little late for that, but it was youtube kids on a kids tablet we thought it was safe. She then started seeing a psychiatrist for the behaviours and sleep problems and we've been doing that since November, but she still has severe sleep issues. She basically sleeps 20mins at a time and gets no real rest, she wakes up with night terrors and fears spiders in closet
            </p>

           <p>
            And from a related link:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             read the old threads, I posted the story of what happened to my daughter after watching them for a month before I realized what was in the videos. Be very fucking cautious anon, it's not a joke, they will fuck your kid up. Kids don't have the ability to deal with them and compartmentalize. They think everything is real that young, it takes one bad experience to break a kids psyche, imagine months or years of this type of conditioning to a kid thats mind is wide fucking open to suggestion.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <hr/>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I took YouTube away from my son a couple years ago after the whole HeyKids channel got a bunch of attention. Basically was the same stuff, finger family videos - but then every once in awhile there would be videos with really bizarre content not meant for kids. That channel had a lot of the same colors and music that's happening in these ones.

             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Tell her to stop now or she's dealing with the night terrors and emotional breakdowns. Tell her she can't handle the kid being annoying for 10 minutes, wait till they have the attention span of a gold fish and think grabbing a knife is an acceptable response to being told it's time for bed.
            </p>
            <p>
             She'll stop letting her kids watch them, either now or once she's taking them to the psychiatrist twice a week.

              It's bad...I don't watch any bizarre videos since checking out the whole 'Don't hug me I'm scared' series.  It was hypnotic, disturbing, and had the flashing lights or as least I saw flashing lights for 10 minutes after I stopped watching.  Definitely the war is on.  On the one hand you want to warn people you know, especially if they have kids.  And on the other hand, you don't want to tell them too much, especially if they have kids.
