            Yes, many are literally a different species who is of the bloodline of Cain, who was literally "of the devil". That is all I can say for now.

              I have no idea about that. But I think it is safe to say that there are many people walking around today whose bloodlines tie back to Cain. Perhaps even you. Perhaps me. Perhaps this is why we need to "Die and be born again" before we can enter heaven.

                Yes, you are talking about Hiram Abif. You will notice that the 'illumated' ones all have one thing in common: They like to copy the practices and ideas of Jehova. This is partly to obfuscate the truth and partly because their whole mission is to create a counter-congregation of Luciferians on this earth. They like to deceive and are very much in the counterfeit game. Yet their meanings and symbolisms are all reversed/inverted to what they claim. Mimicing the works of Jehova allow them to hide in plain sight.

                  I was raised in a crazy strict protestant household.
I rejected religion and began to seek out the esoteric.
It was thru learning of the 'mysteries' that I came to understand the 'mysteries' believe in the existence of Jehovah as their arch-rival.
I then looked further into what are the goals of these "mysteries" and discovered it comes full circle to the story of Lucifers fall and of Adam and Eve.
I then realized that most "Christians" today are anything but, yet the truth of Jehovah remains.
"Real Christians" are now essentially a secret society of their own. Irony.

                    Lucifer and Christ are both referred to as "The Morning Star" in those respective passages, but the planet Venus is not mentioned in biblical texts. The attribution of Venus as the Morning star comes later and was probably a benign attribution relating purely to the fact that Venus is by far the brightest celestial object in the sky after the sun and moon. Many ancient religions were invested heavily in cosmology and thusly added their own esoteric meanings to Venus, including but not limited to Quetzacoatl the Feathered Serpent being called "The Dawn Star". If you study the true story of Adam and Eve shortly after they are ejected from the Garden, the reason for this affinity towards cosmology becomes quite clear. (This is discussed in the 'Forgotten Books of Adam and Eve' at great length). The idea that Jesus = Morningstar = Lucifer is a doctrine of the Mysteries designed to befuddle and obfuscate (Obfuscation is their Modus Operandi). This is pretty much the esoteric meaning behind the movie "Zeitgeist" and it is not a doctrine which I prescribe to.

                    Regarding your other question. Let us assume for a moment that duality (The binary system of Good and Evil) existed before the creation of man. Let us further assume that the angelic race was binary in nature (If this were not the case then the war between Lucifer and YHVH in heaven would never have occurred.) Now, after Lucifer's fall YHVH set out to manifest a new creation (mankind) and he placed them in the Garden of Eden without knowledge of the binary system of Good/Evil. We don't know how many species YHVH propagated in total but it seems that the creation of man happened shortly after the fall of Lucifer. With those events fresh in YHVH's mind it is easy to understand why he wished to create a species which still retained free will but instead of being binary in nature mankind was intended to live with nature in harmory, ignorant of evil or good - much the way animals are, as you correctly point out. Before the 'eating of the fruit' Adam and Eve were in fact very much like beasts in this regard, instead of what we would consider mankind today. This was intended so we could live in perfect harmony with nature as animals do in the Utopic Garden (The Dog's Life), but after their 'realization' of good and evil this was no longer possible. As an added note, Adam and eve were instructed to eat only plants, not animals. It was not until some time after their ejection from the Garden that they were permitted to hunt animals. So to answer your question: there were several aspects of man in the early days. The original, Adamic creation was much closer to a beast of the Earth than what we have since become. The tainted Adam, complete with knowledge of good an evil, represents the dual nature of man in the current age, which is a far cry from what was intended for us as a species. This dramatic change has sentenced us to an existence of suffering and pain on this earth until the end days. Would we not all be better off living "The Dog's life"?. There is beauty and harmony in simplicity.

                    As for your last question: I think Jesus was the mortal aspect of YHVH - sent to this earth to a declare a new covenant to his people and provide an avenue for salvation in a world long past 'saving'.

                 But Jehovah is an angry God.  Jesus, while angry in the temple, wasn't vengeful.  Or was he?  Turn the other cheek...  Forgiveness...  Milestones...

                 So what gives with the change in God, did god mature?

                  If I had just created man on earth and subsequently had it hijacked by my former protoge, I'd be pretty mad too. We are created in God's image, and people get angry...therefore I have no logical issue with assuming Jehovah can also be angry. I am not aware of any rules which state what Jehovah can or cannot do, only human speculation.
