            You know you've gone to the other side when media liberals are on Twitter siding with you and putting down everyone else brave enough to investigate pizzagate as losers and nut jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the human trafficking breaks and it catches up pizzagate, stay away Alex.  You don't deserve to come crawling back acting as if you helped expose this horror.

            You know what that means, right? Sooner or later it's gonna be time for some frontier justice. But it comes down to the order followers if they could ever break their brainwashing and conditioning. All the cops and military have to do is grow a moral spine.

            My take is that he got the offer he couldn't refuse, same as Beck did a while back.   Stop it or say goodbye to the family.  Bastards.  I agree with those saying the big names won't be going down, and the best thing we can do is to get the word out about the gaggle of pedos on the streets, and information on how to protect the children.  I saw a piece today about a terrorist teacher who blew up himself and 20 others while showing how to use explosives (!!); I'm hoping, and praying, that there is a big karma force coming to deal with the pedo crowd.  They say prayer and "common wishing" (for lack of the correct term) work, so take a minute &amp; do your thing and let's all hope it works.  BEST WISHES TO ALL THOSE ATTENDING THE DEMONSTRATION TOMORROW; SHINE THE LIGHT!!!

            Fuck Alex Jones!
           </p>
           <p>
            It's because of Jones big mouth and irrational fashion altogether, over time, and taken together that has finally come back to haunt him. His bloated style, right leaning good old boy gun toting conservatism is what is being used as a catalyst for the motivations of pizzagate shooter Edgar Welch. All of it is being squarely blamed on the incendiary notions of Alex Jones. This is because Alex Jones hopped on the story too quickly and didn't do his own research on the matter and passed on the allegation of sensationalism current at the time from disinfo agents and hyperbolists.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've never agreed with the overblown premise that Alefantis was trafficking children out of his space on Connecticut Ave. But through subsequent investigations into the artistic preferences of the establishment's patrons, its late hours, and no age limit events most discerning adults would agree that this is not the safest place for children, night or day. To suggest he ran a sacrificial ring there and in his basement was ludicrous, to a degree, but certain authors and myself were cautious about over interpreting what WikiLeaks was implying. I tried many times to try and quell certain voices that were continuously trying to push fantastical and overwhelming imaginings to the front of the line. Of course the MSM condensed version made it even worse. Now we can say, with much certainty, that both these issues outlined above now effecting pizzagate, have counterintelligence aspects working in concert with each other. Shills and disinformation plant superfluous information, like underground tunnels, baby coffins and kill rooms instead of the relevant issues like artistic pursuits, influence lobbies and corporate social engineering, the likes of the ten essays by Yoichi Shimatsu.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike Alex Jones authors like myself and others we have not advocated impulsive, incendiary or even confrontational approaches to the pizzagate scandal. While I know that Jones does not either, his temperament and stance dictates otherwise, and I can see how easy it would be to stir up one of his more unstable fans. We've all been saying this about you for years now Alex, along with your current alignment with the 'far right' and your 'roger'ized trumptards I would say that you have done your job right and a good portion of your fans are mentally and governmentally 'vetted'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of us were smart enough to avoid the sensationalism. And some of us are not out for profit (which is another reason we know you're a cointell shill is that you don't want to risk your huge member funded bank account to back up your fat ass) and your incorrect hurried claims, at least what Shimatsu writes about can be backed up by affidavit by simple internet sourcing.

            The DC Pedo Mafia and their Flying Monkeys, (YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc) were killing Alex Jones financially, demonetizing his videos, blocking him, shadow banning. I gave up watching him because he had to advertise so much to make up for it. I think he struck a deal to do the apology thing the night before our demonstration so the media could block any coverage of us with headlines like ALEX JONES DEBUNKS PIZZAGATE. APOLOGIZES TO PIZZA OWNER, yada, yada.

            For all the newcomers who latched on to AJ, I hope this is a lesson. The veterans figured out this clowns game long agao. He is a gatekeeper. He attempts to represent a movement and then discredits it by either his words or behavior. He is cointelpro and has stratfor agents on his staff. AJ should not be quoted or brought on board. Milo is used the same way. How people cannot tell that they are acting and performing a character is beyond me. His voice, facial expressions and body language is even fake. Let this be the last time that AJ is mentioned here.

            He is opening a DC outlet with Corsi at the Desk. He's like a miniTrump jujitsu this way that way to reach his target as honestly as possible. It's a different kind of newfotainment. Much better than the c ia version.

RIGHT BEFORE THE MARCH. This was a set up to make us look like fools. We need to remind people, Pizzagate 2011 exposed by Andrew Breitbart. AJ had nothing to do with our info

            He doesn't want to get sued out of existence. Unlike all of us, he is a very public figure running a business. No way he can win with the pedophile judges in place already, and JA probably has the endless monetary resources of the CIA behind him...he at least  brought Pizzagate to the public's attention. No one has hard evidence of trafficking on the part of JA, just a lot of suspicious images, remarks, a sleazy pizza dive and many questionable business ventures. Discretion is the better part of valor, after all.

            I cannot believe what I just witnessed...a sad day indeed. He has done DAMAGE to the pizzagate investigation in my opinion. That is just my .02 however.   Let me explain my damage statement by saying that anyone that was looking for further "alternative facts" to debunk pizzagate with just found their way. Suddenly AJ will have all the street cred he never had before making him the spokesman for why its a debunked conspiracy theory.

            I'm so pissed. I've watched him almost every day for years! I've defended him ALWAYS. Even argued with people on here because I defended him. I never thought I would do this, but I told him off on Twitter today. I no longer support him. I'm DONE with that coward.

            His head has grown so much lately. All he talks about is how much bigger he is now than mainstream media and reminds us that he's not bragging. Well, he's lost a lot of people as of today. He even invited the satanist to be his guest!

            AJ does realize that JA would have to show monetary damages. According to him and the idiots that buoy up that disgusting place, the community is supporting it and it's never done better ... how can that be if they're suing? They'd also have to prove that what AJ said was responsible for whatever hit JA's reputation suffered and the scores of INAPPROPRIATE, LEWD, OBSCENE PHOTOS AND CAPTIONING THAT HE HIMSELF MADE AND POSTED FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION! Then there's his magazine ... really Alex? Re-ally?

             You don't have to prove monetary damages for per se defamation claims. Defamation that affects your business is per se defamation. 
"Examples of libel per se are statements that: (i) relate to the person's business or profession to the person's detriment; (ii) falsely claim that the person committed a crime of moral turpitude; (iii) imputes unchastity on the person; or (iv) claim that the person suffers from a loathsome disease."

             Categories of Untrue Statements
            </p>
            <p>
             Traditionally, there have been four general categories of untrue statements presumed to be harmful to one's reputation and therefore defamatory per se. Typically, if the statements do not fall into one of these categories the plaintiff is required to prove his damages. If it does fall into one of these categories, damages are usually presumed. The four general categories are:
            </p>
            <p>
             Indications that a person was involved in criminal activity
Indications that a person had a "loathsome," contagious or infectious disease
Indications that a person was unchaste or engaged in sexual misconduct
Indications that a person was involved in behavior incompatible with the proper conduct of his business, trade or profession

              A public figure must show damages. JA continuallty posted LEWD, OBSCENE, PEDOPHILIA-LACED IMAGES AND COMMENTS. To use your example, if someone continually posted about having an infectious disease, and then someone picked up on it, it really wouldn't be defamation, would it? Then the preponderance of evidence would have to be shown as to how this person was adversely affected and that would rely on proving monetary damages, of which, there is none.

               I do not think Alex Jones committed defamation at all, so there shouldn't be damages. I'm just saying that in per se defamation cases you don't prove your damages. So if Alex Jones were to lose that case he would be screwed. This would be per se defamation if it was defamation at all, which it isn't but I'm not holding my breath for a fair result in a DC court or a federal court or even a Texas court for Alex Jones. Courts operate based on bribery a lot more than you think.  That is not my example, I just posted the link so you could read about this. I know about this from law school but I'm not an attorney. I'm positive Alex Jones was both threatened with a lawsuit and personally physically threatened.

                If he were threatened, he should take it up with the police. And, again, a public figure must prove monetary damages. JA is a public figure. He was listed as one of the 50 most influential people in Washington, etc. What you're saying is not applicable here.

                    Well, you don't know until you get in the courtroom. If it's a jury trial, I think AJ would have aced it. Think about those photos! Any reasonable person looking at those photos would have assumed something was going on -- that's what JA DID TO HIMSELF! What AJ did is mild in comparison.

            It means they've gotten away with it as well. None of the major heads will roll. Podestas, HRC, Alefantis, Silsby etc...the whole DC ring will walk.

            Maybe a lawsuit? Maybe not? Maybe just a cease and desist letter? Or perhaps a direct email/letter from JA? Who knows?

            Alex Jones certainly took the high road. I'm sure he didn't want to... and I know for damn sure he didn't want to admit he HAD to. But, he did. With the lack of any real/concrete evidence, he caved.
           </p>
           <p>
            The connections, emails, PizzaPAC, events, social imagery/commentary, there is most likely something lurking beneath the surface. But for Alex Jones to comply with the requests (whether they were litigious or not), makes sense. For now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Jones may be crazy, but he's not dumb. He knows he can't single-handedly investigate this with his team... I guess he just folded his hand based on some kind of threat.

            AJ you let us down on this one. I hope you had a very good reason to do this and that you will explain your actions to your listeners soon. There are a lot of people who like what you do... if you let them down you will lose their support. Pizzagate is of utmost importance for many of us. If you are really fighting the good fight, and many think that you are, It's time to come forward, to be honest and fearless.

             From the wording of that retraction there is no plausible way he could ever explain himself unless Alefantis got publicly convicted and sent to jail. There is a lot of bullshit going on right now in every way and the trolls posting garbage theories to discredit us is working. Focus on what you can document and carry on. Alex Jones shouldn't be telling anyone what to think, you have to think for yourself.

            A couple days ago Alex said, "Just throw me in a wood chipper!"
           </p>
           <p>
            The reality is, Alex Jones did distance himself from Pizzagate from the beginning.  Without hard core proof it was wise to do so. He has a business and responsibility to employees.  He is very high profile.  It's not the same as speculation  in a Pizzagate forum.

            I have listened to Alex spew his BS for years because my mother listened to him, among others, back when I was in my early teen years. (Sidenote:  I always thought she was crazy until I was older and began to see shit for myself...funny how that works with our parents.) My problem with Alex isn't that he's a complete liar liar pants on fire, but that has been "preaching" for so long about the same shit just to get ppl all riled up, but then he never actually leads them to the battlefield and leaves all his followers on the precipice of "the truth"...which he hasn't ONCE reveled in the 20+ years I've known of him. Some days I still kind of  like him, some days I cant stand his lunatic ravings, but with this matter in particular I think the people pulling Alex's puppet strings are definitely involved in these pedo rings and he is being shut-down and silenced more so than ever before.

             He's always been CIA. If he was really anti-establishment, he would have been shut down a long time ago. See: Ben Swann

              Thank gawd you're paying attention, they kill your ass way before you get a fan base that big.  Take a quick look at some of the pedogate journalists before this story broke...double tapped in the head suicides, blown up in cars, shot with heart attack gun, or poisoned with arsenic.  Fucking wake up.

              I don't think he was CIA in the beginning, but I do think he got into alt media because he saw the potential cash flow on the horizon. I do think he is a sellout and is now fully under elite control. The Ben Swann scenario intrigues me, but I haven't been able to get a moment to catch up a bit more on him. Has he taken a completely different opinion on PG now or is he just not saying anything further?

               Last I heard, Ben Swann did show up to work the next Monday, though all his social media was deleted, and he was now the co-anchor, and very much in the background. I ca assure you he hasn't said anything about pizzagate since then.
              </p>
              <p>
               What i truly believe, based on the fact that David Seaman for some reason feels safe tweeting what could be slanderous claims against Podesta et al, coupled with the attitude Ben Swann had when he left social media, and the hint he gave us, that this was some "Art of War" stuff going on, where you don't see the actual fight going on, and when he seemed very assured that we are winning. Based on this and David's claims  that he has spoken with people inside the intel industry, contacts he made whilst reporting on the NSA, and that they say there are investigations going on as we speak, I believe that they know something we don't. David hasn't been sued for making claims of Alefantis' and Podesta's pedophilia - he knows that the intel agencies HAVE PROOF of it in their investigation, and that they can't take him to court because they'd be busted.

               We know that the NYPD has the laptop of Weiner, which has all of Hillary's deleted emails on it, and leakers are coming out. the FBI met at the White House today, and Comey is being called out for not acting on the evidence they know he has.

                I am fairly despondent...I guess the attitude has to be one of ultimate perseverance.  I just hope the main players succeed, but there is a lot against them.  I appreciate your analysis.  It brings a measure of hope.  What is your opinion on what Alex Jones is doing?

                 I think I just figured out what is going on. It hit me when I watched Random Rants of Ryan, who just did a piece on this. Alex (and Ryan) only gave ONE example of Alex's supposed pizzagate coverage (that he is currently apologizing for, or retracting) that was in error, only one thing that could possibly be actionable. That was the child porn story by Joe Biggs - however I don't believe that ever made it to infowars proper, it was just a tweet by Biggs, who was let go within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Furthermore, if insinuating or calling Alefantis a pedorapist is actionable, then David Seaman would also be looking at a lawsuit, no? But he is not. David has been calling them out and proving to us that they have no case by the very fact that they won't take him to court over it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Alex never showed proof of any lawsuit. He insinuated heavily, and then flashed a folder, insinuating that inside was the lawsuit.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He is doing this alongside Alefantis on behalf of the deep state in order to scare everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Question: it was the inconsistency with the singular example that could have caused trouble for him, but the fact that he let Biggs go, so wouldn't be liable, and then talking about it as if there were multiple reasons for him to grovel and retract. This is what raised red flags, why is he trying to make something big out of nothing? Why is he trying to puff up his case? He is lying. Why would he lie? Well if he is indeed CIA, and the CIA runs all the child trafficking, then he is being used to stop everyone from calling out the pedos, to strike fear in us EVEN THOUGH THEY DONT HAVE A CASE (they are guilty).

                  I understand your point of view.  I hope the March is successful tomorrow.  Some people say it's not about a lawsuit but a violent threat against his family and called him either pragmatic or a coward.  I've also heard about his connections with the CIA via his family.

                  But  With Flynn gone and now this it makes me wonder what Trump is planning to do. The intellegence hearing was lousy outside of Gowdy, but then Nunes comes out with proof that he doesn't share at today's new conference. Supposedly Comey just left the whitehouse.

                   i've got a sinking feeling that Trump is pretty much going to let everyone go. i've been cheering for him, and i've agreed with some things he's done, and i am grateful to have him vs Hillary, but he an elite, he invited the Clintons to his wedding, and it is the case that Bill Clinton encouraged him to run for president before he decided to. Why? Covering bases, or? I think that stuff is coming out, but that all the elites will be let off the hook, as Trump really isn't their enemy. I HATE to say this.

                    Yeah...I hear ya.  Too good to be true.  At least he isn't Hillary.  The genie is out of the bottle though.  They will contain it the. Eat they can and the Pedo's will regroup.  Boy do I hate the media.  Internet will eventually get censored to all hell.  I just want those evil elite pedos to get theirs...is that selfish or wrong?

            I am not fucking surprised, he would always avoid talking about certain subjects. He always reeked of controlled opposition to me. What I am surprised about is he was acting so tough about wanting to go head on in this case and now he is being a pussy about it.

             He went head in and immediately claimed Alefantis was set up by the govt, without offering any proof of it. Legit claimed that govt agents had planted stuff on the internet to frame him. People so desperately want a hero they ignored this and other major red flags, like the fact that his father and half his family are CIA, and that he has an ex Stratfor employee running infowars.

              Yeah I don't listen to him so I didn't even know what he was saying between the grove and recently when he said he wishes alefantis would come at him with a lawsuit so he can fuck them up. Now the pussy has his tail between his legs. I was aware for a while he wasn't on our side because he has cookie cutter topics that never ooze out of the edges. But this shit is just a new low. Even for him.

              He was screaming, "Are you crazy? I'm a father, I would never be for this type of stuff, I love full grown women" last time, now he's all for kids being hurt and killed. Before I even knew he was CIA, I always thought to myself all the other truthers were killed or died suspiciously but this fuck is always on air talking about shit for years. edit: great thread though, so many of his followers ought to know.

               Also, i've heard pretty good arguments that even his ability to get onto the grounds at BGrove is further proof that he is controlled opposition. That was crafted to give him street cred. No one gets on those grounds and makes it out alive.

               BAM. Exactly. If you see a shiny studio and professional graphics, lie the Young Turks and InfoWars, you can rest assure you are NOT watching anything anti-establishment, no matter how loud they scream that the opposite is true.
              </p>
              <p>
               What happened to David Seaman, his HuffPo column ended, his Wikipedia bio deleted, hit pieces written on him in major media, even Voat mods being overtly biased against him, THIS is what happens to real truth tellers, to real anti-establishment figures. That's how you know who to trust.

                I agree with your other points but I don't think seaman was a real researcher, he was just saying stuff anyone can say and he wasn't sourcing anything, I watch alot of him then I learned he's just a bit gold shill. I'm not saying he didn't bring any awareness but he was not doing it for the kids. There was a thread that ultimately linked soros to bit gold. But this thread isn't even for that. I would argue that better researchers are the honeybee and george webb because they site infromation and where it came from. Admittedly bad quacamole does a lot of just talking into the camera but it doesn't seem like personal gain with him. I dug deep into seaman and came to the conclusion he was just a drama queen that talked more about his personal life and big gold coins.

                 That does not explain why he is being attacked. He is being attacked precisely because he is bring a LOT of awareness to what researchers have uncovered, and he does not take credit for doing the research. Many people are into bitcoin, he cannot be debunked based upon that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 George Webb is "ex" CIA and claims that we should be happy with the pedos just admitting to what they've done, and no jail time is in order. He also claimed that we should all tweet a certain hashtag, and then later we will get a million dollars. He also said Hillary is not really into the occult. He also claimed Seaman was disinfo, and when I asked him for proof, like an example, he tweeted "Oh i should have said "distraction" - which is entirely different, and for a CIA agent he know damn well the power of words, especially ones that don't get retracted. so this means he lied. Show me anything close to this bullshit that David Seaman has done.

                  david seaman wasn't even ever a paid writer on huffpost so he can't say he was employed there. I've seen enough of him saying anything anyone can say. Idk he was way too fishy to me past a certain point and I watched alot of his videos for months. Plus he just incites whitch hunt type shit and just says fuck podesta, fuck hillary, here is my bitcoin, buy them. 
Sure many people have bit gold but not many people are paid by bitgold. Idk my mind was already way made up about him. There is alot more but I hate giving him any attention. He'll be back from his vacation when shit blows over again and be asking for more bit gold like he did every time he took a vacation.

                   I don't think he has ever said he was employed there. He just said they took away his column. He was not able to log in after his viral post on Hillary's ill health, and they would never give him a reason as to why. (Note Dr Drew also lost his spot at CNN the day after mentioning Hillary's health)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I've been following David since back in 2012, when he was reporting on Occupy related stuff, and then was one of very few reporters to discuss the NDAA. He was on RT a lot and writing for HuffPost (no, not paid). His reporting was stellar, and, as with the case of pizzagate, he has never made a misstatement or spewed disinfo. And he has brought awareness of pizzagate, and the heinous FACT that Hillary and Podesta are pedos, to a lot of people (or whatever reasons are in his heart that we can never truly know).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also he is no longer affiliated with the stuff he was selling, he announced that last week.

                    Maybe he "isn't" affiliated now, but he was the whole time and told nobody he makes 25% commision from people using bitgold because of him. He was only just saying fuck hillary every few episodes. Everyone here on voat, reddit and 4chan did the research. Sure he generated some hype but he was only using his own advice from his self promotion book to do everyting. I'm not saying he didnt help shed light on the topic, he did, as did many, many other youtubers who didnt ask for donations. All I'm saying is he a huge selfish prick. So I'd rather be getting actual info from other youtubers that do real investigations instead of saying what me and you can say on a video and screaming how fucking creepy podesta is. We fucking all know. He can announce he's not part of anything but he can still be. Just like he didnt tell anyone he's been paid by them and hefty too, them buying him superbowl tickets and him being able to travel and do shit like that. He's a drama queen. Other people do a better job. He's just a self absorbed asshole, I dont believe he does anything in support of kids.

             If this turns out to be true there will have to be a revolution or everyone will have to pretend we don't live in this world and form their own off grid societies consisting only of their own families and a few other families nearby for marriages.

            I do not blame the guy for wanting to stay alive.   The only reason we aren't under attack is because nobody outside our little club reads our words.  A normal person would never stumble here via google searches at this point.   This verse is useful to the enemy because they can see all we know and what evidence we have.   Anyway, it doesn't matter.   I'm confident the President is very aware of the true nature of his opponents.   If he is on their side or is going to ignore it we're all completely screwed anyway.

           </p>
           <p>
            Someone posted on voat, that if you accuse someone of comitting serious crimes and they have not been convicted, you will lose.  You don't have to jump over all hurdles to prove libel that you normally would.

             Reread what you wrote.  If that were the standard, then EVERY successful libel case would have to have a criminal conviction to stand as the foundation.  There are scores of examples to refute that.

              What is a Defamatory Statement?
             </p>
             <p>
              A statement is defamatory if it tends to hold the plaintiff (the subject of the statement, who is bringing the lawsuit) up to scorn, hatred, ridicule, disgrace, or contempt, in the mind of any considerable and respectable segment of the community.
There are certain types of statements that are automatically considered defamatory in some states. These types of statements are often called defamatory "per se" Statements that are defamatory "per se" include statements that claim that the plaintiff:
has committed a serious, notorious, or immoral crime
has an infectious or terrible disease, or
is incompetent in his job, trade, or profession.
             </p>
             <p>
              DC has this type of law

               http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/district-columbia-defamation-law
              </a>
              Defamation Per Se
In the District of Columbia, any written or printed statement that falsely accuses someone of committing a crime constitutes defamation per se. See Raboya v. Shrybman &amp; Associates, 777 F.Supp. 58 (D.D.C. 1991). If a statement is defamation per se, the court will assume harm to the plaintiff's reputation, without further need to prove that harm.

               It's only potentially defamatory at this point. The defense to defamation is that a statement was true. Without proof of it being true yes you COULD lose a defamation suit but the standard to prove defamation is that the statement is false and that the person making the statement acted with malice (knowing it was false, or reckless disregard for the truth). So the burden is on Alefantis to prove that the statements were false and that Alex Jones acted with malice. James has no case, but without actual proof there is a high risk that he will be found liable anyway. It probably doesn't matter what level of proof we know that we have, a court isn't necessarily going to side with facts on something like this, they are all owned by the same people. The best proof you can have is the criminal conviction and that doesn't seem likely at this point... since basically every single pedo we know about is still running around free and they're all playing hearing games and putting on dog and pony shows for the media. Until Hillary Clinton goes down nobody else is going down.

                No.  You misreading what I quoted.  It would not be potentially defamatory, it would be automatically defamatory.

               <p>
                The burden on Alefantis is easy.  He can show he has never been convicted of child trafficking.  That's​ it.  That's all he would have to do.

                 I didn't misread it I disagreed with it. Defamation has to be proven. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove the elements of the tort. First he has to prove it was false, then that the statement was made maliciously since he's a public figure. Anyway I'm going to get back to work, I don't feel like this is a good use of my time trying to explain defamation on here since I'm not in charge of his case and it looks like there won't be one anyway. James Alefantis has the protection of the people who control everything in the world and our best bet at beating the pedos at this point has gone way beyond just typing on Voat. I'm not sure we will ever win. Defend your own family. Buy guns. Lock your doors. Watch your surroundings. Every man for himself.

              Every successful libel case would have to have a criminal conviction....?      NO.  Not what I said.   There are just different standards in those cases.

               OF COURSE there are different standards.  One is civ, the other crim.

              <p>
               This is what you wrote, verbatim:  "It's pretty obvious they felt they would lose the libel lawsuit.
              </p>
              <p>
               Someone posted on voat, that if you accuse someone of comitting serious crimes and they have not been convicted, you will lose."'
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe you weren't as clear as you would have liked.  In any case, you wrote it.

             Just look at the time and there's a protest tomorrow and on Monday he would definitely be expected to comment on it and he is just getting ahead of the curve here in introducing some bullshit letter saying that he is never going to speak about it again and inviting JA on the show. He wasn't threatened he just doesn't want to talk about it on Monday

              Well, the issue is, these scumbags will go far to defend/protect themselves. I bet you Alex could handle being sued and threatened, but if they threatened his family, his relatives, his cousin's, took pictures to showcase that their threats were real, I could see why he back's off.
             </p>
             <p>
              Because at that point you have to ask yourself, can you live with knowing your family was killed for a cause in helping others. He could risk his own life, but when it comes to the life of his loved ones, he doesn't have the right to decide the fate of their lives.

            Obviously the Rothschilds are backing Alefantis. They own the government. That is why these freaks are so callous with being pedosatanists. Bring it on. They want court &amp; lawsuits.

             Even if his family got threatened, this just doesn't add up. Everything else he talks about "could" get him and his entire family assassinated, being the "patriot" He is its the occupational hazard which comes with what he does for a living. There is more evidence that James Alefantis is one of these sick satanic kid fuckers which he has been speaking about for years and he apologises to him? What the fuck. And to think i have spent hours watching his fucking podcasts.

               I would be 200% in but unfortunately there's so much disinfo and horrible logic from many (autistic) people it's hard to take seriously all the time. I'd say I'm about 70-80% in though.

             Lot's of misinformation here. I think you're conflating Alex Jones with David Icke. And the ONLY thing Jones does is say that there is not good evidence that Alefantis is involved and he apologizes to him. He knows damn well that there are organized pedophile networks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does Jones actually believe this about Alefantis? Who knows. He hasn't gotten into the details of the investigation like most of us have, so I'll let him slide for the moment.

              What you just saw was very carefully worded.  Alex Jones is not just worried about a lawsuit, he knows that that youtube can delete him.   Censorship in the name of stopping fake news and racism is advancing so quickly that I'm fairly sure that Comcast, Timewarner, and the ISPs are going to get involved.  At that point, free speech is dead.   I think I could sense great anger in Jones as he forced himself through that.    He knows that Alefantis is guilty.

              UFO's are evidence for runaway secret military spending. Flat Earthers need to shut up and look up, at the movement of all the other spinning spheres in the sky. It's pretty fucking obvious that you're standing on one, if you watch long enough and think about it. Bigfoot, however, is totally real.

            He god sued by Alefantis for millions of dollars... This James Alefantis has also connections to the Rothschilds. At least one of the houses he owns was previously Rothschild owned and everybody knows the picture from lady Rothschild with David Brock on the stairs. This is not just some Pizza-joint owner. There is a very BIG force behind him..

             Don't be an idiot. he has backed down from pizzagate many times with backlash. he wants his stupid viewers to think he was sued so he can instill fear into people about being sued. This is planned and orchestrated right before the protest.

             I don't know what to do with this one. Your's is the best theory I can come up with at this point, except I would say that Alex probably received a letter from Alefantis' attorney and was threatened with a suit. My hope is that there is some multidimensional chess going on at the moment and Alex had to get rid of this distraction, but who knows?

               Right - and even though Alex might not have come out and said Alefantis is actually guilty, he (well, mainly his staff who he is responsible for) suggested the hell out of it. So it would have been a long, drawn out, expensive fight. Alex has other fights he feels called to fight, and believes that the pedophile networks were formed in service of binding people to the Globalist agenda, which is most likely true, so he is just concentrating on exposing the larger picture and what is going on in the political arena. When pizza/pedo gate is finally mainstream, and court-worthy evidence is finally revealed, he will be on it like white on rice instead of on occasion.

               If they are not blood related, they are both filled with evil and venom and hatred.  I think I read on here that David Rockefeller had 5 hearts during his lifetime.  I wonder how the old lady dragon will have before she does us the favor of leaving this earth.

              Alefantis probably told Alex Jones to retract his statement and apologigize and he won't get sued. He probably did it because Infowars is already in jeopardy. But, I never expected him to to being a coward.

               Ha! The only Infowar Alex Jones wages is the one AGAINST his listeners. I used to enjoy listening to him, but I grew out of it once I realized he was a sensationalist con man, and those commercials for the snake oil he sells are annoying as shut AND CONSTANT. Plus he interrupts people like a jerk off.

               I certainly don't wish anything but well on him and his family but I am thinking this has to be the deal. Maybe that is me hoping that AJ isn't a wuss and just cracked under threats from JA. Those threats could get real bad real fast though so do what you gotta do AJ.

               He is cointelpro-counter inteligence. This is his job. Get the normies to watch him and think he represents the truth movement, then mislead them once he has their attention and trust. He is fake in the first place. Catch up guys.

                He's more like double agent working the pentagon and Mossad..I've heard CIA army. He's been pumping up,war with North Korea recently. The pedo stuff gets too close to Mossad Israel interests. They told him to back off because the other side has protection plus the dragnet would get some of their own. Compromises are made and deals get done. At the echelon, they're pretty much the mafia with various competing families all wanting to keep the racket going.
