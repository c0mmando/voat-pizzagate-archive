<p>Concerned Women of America is a biased group, quite conservative and Christian, but have a good point. Child prostitution needs to be illegal. Duh. The liberal argument is, why prosecute a child, but the fact is, the under age victim rarely gets prosecuted. They get arrested, taken away from their pimp, or whatever abuser, and can get help. When it is legal, it can be ignored. Law enforcement can\'t intervene, only report it... to the corrupt child protection services in the government. Wtf.    
</p>
<p>It\'s the same thing we saw recently in California; underage prostitution was decriminalized, defenders claimed, &quot;It\'s wrong to criminalize victims,&quot; <a href="http://archive.is/38Rgu">critics pointed out</a> that a child being abused in this manner is much less likely to get help if it\'s legal. They are instructed to tell LE they are doing it by choice. They are afraid to go to LE on their own, so arresting them is a good way to pull them out of their situation.

<p>The Democrats, and especially the Clintons, have a history of pushing laws to decriminalize child sex abuse.

            Except laws that punish the pimps and traffickers instead of the child victim are not, in any way, "decriminalizing child sex abuse".

            You seriously think kids that are essentially enslaved into prostitution should have criminal records dragging them down for the rest of their lives? Brilliant.

            Wait...so first you're complaining about a bill that doesn't have child victims arrested and charged, and your complaint is that criminalizing them is the only way to help them because they don't want to come forward....now you're complaining about a bill that requires victims to help prosecute their abusers, and your complaint is that they don't want to do it?

             There are better ways for wording a bill against this issue shill, Its very clear that this has been an attempt to create a legal loophole for child prostitution. Anything saying that the act of selling a child for sex is't illegal opens up a can of worms in regard to a a case by case basis, ie; child was "willing" to prostitute and there was no pimp. More focus on a bill such as this needs to be on repercussions and how law enforcement acts in such situation, not on the child's persecution , (which btw is a dumb argument on the dems side, give me a case where a child has been sent to jail  or charged for prostitution, because it never happens)

              But it doesn't say that. It says the child itself is not a criminal. The person pimping the child, or soliciting the child, is the criminal. So the rest of what you said is irrelevant nonsense.

            Rep. Jepson (R) in 83 added an unknown amendment to the 'gay bill of rights' to lower the age of consensual sex to 9 yrs. old. Sen. Grassley didn't believe it was in the bill when notified by Ted Gunderson and Noreen Gosch. So those two and others went to DC to Grassley's office where he provided a copy of the bill. Seven hours later there it was !!  Amendment 29 or something near the end!
            <br/>
            That is why the gay bill of rights failed in 83.
           </p>
           <p>
            You see the Republicans were trying to lower the age of lawful sex with a child. THEN when someone got caught it would be known it's legal! The meme was planned "THE DEMOCRATS HAD THIS IN THEIR GAY BILL OF RIGHTS!   See??  Do you see how the blame was to be placed?  But a republican male did it!
           </p>
           <p>
            When we researched the Franklin scandal we thought it was a republican thing as poppy Bush built that ring with the CIA. But there would be more.  Poppy got old and it's clear Clinton was groomed to take it over. Hence the server in his home built for HIM according to Hillary, when he left office. So it pains me to read here it's Clinton and the democrats. This op is a worldwide op we run that makes the most money ever. Just because the dems got caught doesn't mean republicans aren't just as involved. This is a cabal. It knows no party. That is a social game set up for US Cerf's. At this time they need to be arrested in order for our republic to be restored back to it's people. If not, nothing changes. 
Please get off the democrat thing. The Republicans built it. Both run it! The partisanship in this research will hinder your work and turn your fellow researchers off. We here make up all parties and the history shows who is in charge. House of Bush/Clinton/Saud/Moasad. Why do you think republicans are just as angry as democrats in elected office that Trump won? Anyway, its not the democrats per say. Can we keep this non partisan as we have democrats trying to take the Clinton's down too?  Or do you really believe your own words about the democrats doing this?

             No, I agree it should be nonpartisan. (I side with neither face of the two headed monster.) You need to be non partisan, too, ie, if I call out democrats (or republicans) specifically don't get mad. I've been following along, I realize it is the entire government. But who has been throwing a temper tantrum since November? Who has been in histrionics over ever cabinet pick? So I dug a little into why. I think another question is why aren't the Republicans fighting it when so many of them are dirty?

            If he pissed off Think Progress and The Ole Spirit Eater it's fine by me!!! A great sign that he knew what they were up to for a LONG time. Just couldn't say anything because most of the public was unaware. Hell, I was unaware in 2010, but I was still adamantly opposed to legalizing teenage prostitution. I have a whole big post on Pelosi floating Proposition K in SF in 2008 (think it was 2008) to start pushing and normalizing this agenda. Goooo, Mr. Sessions!!! We're behind you!!!! We hate pedos as much as you do and are waiting on you to help these kids!

            I think it's more just than locking up someone being forced into sex. If it were undercover police watching a known drug house and happened to see people not involved in the racket, in the course of the investigation. Not lawful? Lawyers need their power diluted when it comes to children. Powerful criminal person Vs poor person. Not a fair fight and only one unjust outcome.Children first , lawyers last  imo.

            The only legislation that protects the girls is the Nordic Model of prostitution.  It recognises the imbalance of power in the transaction.  It decriminalises the selling of sex and criminalises the buying of sex.  It recognises that it is the buyer with the power.  There are women's rights organisations in America who are pushing for the Nordic Model.

            Covert surveillance. Follow child, watch pimp, arrest pimp. The idea of arrest is good but corrupt child agencies spin them into bad intentions. DCPS is a perfect example. 80 BILLION dollar budget to legally kidnap and traffick children.

            The argument is that if child prostitution is illegal for the child (victim) they have a conflict of interest, admitting that they are victims puts them at risk of arrest. Sex with any minor is illegal already, and offers grounds to remove the kid, so having a kid arrested for crimes against it is harsh and created a fear in the child to not testify. I do not think that the attempt to legalize child prostitution for the minor is to eliminate the crime for the perpetrator, only for the child who should be treated as a victim and provided services, not threatened with arrest. The implication is that the kid is trafficked and not keeping the money and the handler and john can be charged.  if a kid is not pimped, and selling sex directly then only the john is arrested.

            In May 2006, Palm Beach police filed a probable cause affidavit saying that Epstein should be charged with four counts of unlawful sex with minors and one molestation count. ... The grand jury returned only a single charge of felony solicitation of prostitution, because the child victims he was trafficking were labeled as prostitutes.

             Really interesting -- 
Deep confusion on this law making, imo.  There should be a specific law for minors who are found involved in prostitution -- either forced, or forced by personal circumstances.
             <br/>
             No one seems to really care about these minors and getting them back on safe ground.
Just where that might be is another question.  Most of the institutions for caring for children seem to be havens for child abusers.  From what I'm seeing on this issue, both sides are wrong.  There has to be help for the minor -- specific help -- and not just more sexual abuse coming their way.

            I can see the point of making sure the victims are taken off the streets, so they can be helped, but there must be a better way.  If they are arrested as a criminal they will have a record for selling sex when they have been enslaved, which is not their fault.  There must be a better way. Since we know that many in LE are also sex abusers, having access to these victims is not always safe.

             People are seeing arrest as something different than simply being taken into custody. It's not the same as being booked, charged, and jailed.
             <br/>
             The biggest problem here is the idea that underage kids can
             <em>
              choose
             </em>
             to be prostitutes. If a kid is found in that situation, there should be no questions as to whether or not to allow it to continue. But, with the system the way it is, which is better- taking that kid into custody, or leaving them and just calling the welfare office? Child Protective Services may or may not get around to checking on them, if they can find them. And we all know now that CPS is often abusive itself.  LE can be abusive, true, but spending a few hours with LE isn't the same as spending your childhood in the human services system.
             <br/>
             The system needs to be: find a kid in that situation, put them in a safe place for help, period. Those safe places is what needs work.

              This.  I also agree that those places need work.  There is no easy answer.  I almost think that there should be places run by community groups.  I guess I am just afraid also like you say that CPS is a problem.  Often they are also sending kids to be trafficked, it has been rumored on here.

              I agree, and that occurred to me, but somehow I don't think it will happen.  They still need to be helped though.  This is what happens, these kind of people fall through the cracks.

              they are kids, so its always statutory rape, why arrest them in the first place? If the kid is threatened with arrest, its a conflict of interest and will affect the testimony.
