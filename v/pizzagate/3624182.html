Democrats Party Exclusive Bank <a href="https://loomered.com/2019/10/03/exclusive-the-new-bcci-democrats-party-exclusive-bank/">https://loomered.com/2019/10/03/exclusive-the-new-bcci-democrats-party-exclusive-bank/</a> <a href="http://archive.is/VspIo#selection-837.0-837.302">http://archive.is/VspIo#selection-837.0-837.302</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of bank would book a dinner, jet, or hotel for their clients? The BCCI. What kind of bank would recommend a masseuse and finish your paperwork for your campaign or business deal sealed with a kiss? BCCI. </p>
<p>What kind of bank offers political clients access to round-the-clock concierge service, with Barack Hussein Obama veteran campaigners so they quickly process million dollar top-off loans, reconcile election paperwork, or find you paid media placements? Amalgamated Bank does. Their spiel: “Political Investment Banking,” ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we looked into the financials of Epstein tracing wire transfers between Deutsche Bank and other institutions – ONE bank kept surfacing with a specific routing number. We ran the routing number through ABA search database to find the “branch” that is allegedly located in Washington D.C. Apparently the American Banking Association (ABA) has no record of a branch in Washington, D.C. with that routing number. Strangely enough, the CEO of this bank is the “BRANCH MANAGER” of the Washington D.C. branch which flanks FedEx and Nordstroms on K street. Below is a screenshot showing all results during the search of the routing number. Oddly enough, a routing number for the HQ (where you would think the CEO would be) popped up and then all the branches in New York City had the same routing number. Oddly enough, the location in Washington D.C. didn’t pop up. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Routing numbers are issued by law to track money transfers by location for each bank. How does a bank branch in Washington D.C. not have their own ABA routing number? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As we began investigating the bank that Epstein’s wire transfers would flow through, we noticed something odd: The bank itself has a CLASS A rating and that is because of the leverage they show on the books – LABOR UNIONS. Teacher unions and other labor unions in the United States and Canada all house their money in this one bank. This bank was in turmoil before and it seems the SHARK who “rescued” the Democrat Piggy Bank is now sitting pretty in President Trump’s cabinet. </p>
<p>Vulture “angel” investors swoop in and save dying businesses. In fact, President Trump’s Secretary of Commerce, known as the KING OF BANKRUPTCY, helped inject $100 Million in this bank, taking a huge chunk of stock in return back in 2012, when the bank was under scrutiny by the FDIC. There was an enforcement action, according to Bloomberg, because it allegedly allowed many “loans” to be delinquent, with negative accounts collecting dust, but never “written off”. The bank itself wrote out NEW loans to cover the loans that were sitting in the red idly so they don’t have to list them. </p>
<p>In addition, 20% stake share in the bank by Trump’s cabinet member also received aide to resuscitate the bank with an investment from none other than former Bill Clinton “employer” Yucaipa Companies, who seems to “obfuscate” and omit as an asset and protected it in the bankruptcy restructure in 2009? <a href="https://illoominate.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-18.png">https://illoominate.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-18.png</a></p>
<p>Yucaipa Companies has been under the control of Ron Burkle, who is based out of Los Angeles and a VERY close friend of the Clintons. Back in the early 2000s when the Clinton’s were “broke”, Bill worked as a senior adviser to Yucaipa, collecting “finders fees” for determining and arranging “business deals”. One has to wonder how his former presidential seat and ambitious wife Hillary’s clout was used to seal deals. Burkle funded over $1 million for HRC’s run for presidency in 2008, and the bank he has block stock in funded and facilitated all monetary transactions for Hillary for America, Obama for America, the DNC, DCCC, Fusion GPS, and many more. </p>

<p>Keith Mestrich, regular HuffPo contributor and Climate Change advocate that operates out of the Washington D.C. Branch of his bank that has no unique routing number, (??) stood tall and proud next to his biggest pocket liner: TEACHERS UNION LEADERSHIP at a Clinton Global Initiative gala in 2015, one week after the Teachers Union endorsed her. The same Clinton Foundation that Epstein founded, and the now deceased Jeffrey Epstein was present at this gala. Mestrich is also the head of recruitment for Democracy Alliance, a liberal donor club founded by billionaire George Soros. </p>
<p>Notably, the union that endorsed Hillary Clinton is also a client of the bank and the union. The American Federation of Teachers also happens to be a client of the bank. </p>

            Also, she alleges that BCCI is a CIA front iirc.

            I won't make many friends on here with this but does anyone else recognize that Trump is obsessed with keepin America healthy economically but he doesn't seem to care much about other things, such as the abuses in China in their workforce. Slaves being paid a pittance for 14 hours work a day. I mean, we all had and have so much hope with Trump but then he ignores real serious issues all the time, justifying that he is getting jobs for Americans. He softened and reinstated the Patriot Act which has been used to target innocent people, citizens, that are put on a watch list for no reason. I am not slamming him but for people like me, he has nothing. Have him get the Clintons(which is why I was pro Trump during the last election)  yet I am still waiting for him to really nail the child abusers, the infested state of D.C. and Hollywood. I can't imagine having a cabinet where I know certain people in my inner circle are pedophiles and yet, I'll just look the other way if we can benefit financially. Like....really?? Take your best shot at me if you have to but tired of 'hope' or false 'hope' we have in him exposing the evil. Lots has been credited to him from Q but so far, not the BIG take down.

              Sure but I was addressing this  "In addition, 20% stake share in the bank by Trump’s cabinet member also received aide to resuscitate the bank" which is in the post. You have to know that Trump knows what some of his cabinet is up to, and that is pedophila which is what we at Pizzagate are all concerned with. The ends do not justify the means. That's it, end of story

Cecil's daughter (Obama's cousin) married a Saudi, Abdullah Al-Ahmadi, who was/is a Civil Engineer and a manager with Saudi Aramco. Here is Obama's cousin Abdullah in a photograph with Prince Alaweed (who financed Obama's Harvard tution):

             Thank you.  I'm looking into the Arkansas/Riady/Stephens/banking/Indonesia/China/HongKong/Panama/Carter/Clinton plus so much more (in no particular order: Pakistan/AbuDhabi/Obama and his mom/uncle/Promis software/alltel/Suharto/BCCI/CIA/ too many names/places to list.  It really is all connected. During this I came across the Amalgamated Bank article.  If we had the mother of all timeline posts, even a new person would find it evident just how connected it is. China and Carter, Mochtar Riady/Jackson Stephens &amp; Arkansas is a good jumping off point for digging.

              The mother of all timeline posts would be amazing. I feel like it would have to be created and hosted elsewhere, though, to really be usable. Voat's platform is too limited, not just graphically but in terms of character limits and formatting as well. A timeline that linked to each relevant bit of our research would be amazing, though.

               Right now I'm finding timelines already put together. This one has good info (US related)  to1998:
               <a href="http://prorev.com/recovered2.htm">
                The BCCI affair -- CARTER, REAGAN, BUSH, CLINTON, BUSH, AND BCCI
               </a>
               (scroll down to it)
              </p>
              <p>
               At the end of it:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The BCCI scandal cheated depositors out of over $10 billion worldwide. Many of these were lower income people now being paid off at 15 and 25 cents on the dollar for damage done by a illegal operation willingly used not only by hundreds of drug dealers and other criminals from various countries but by the intelligence services of five nations (including the CIA) and at least one government, Pakistan, seeking to finance its nuclear weapons development.
               </p>
               <p>
                Things always moved a little too smoothly in the BCCI investigation, leaving scores of unanswered questions and, so far as can be determined, hardly anyone to blame. One exception, Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's number two man, was given a mild sentence -- over the objections of Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. He later told prosecutors that he had never explained to Altman and Clifford who really owned First American.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Ironically, in the Palestinian Time-Line just before this one on same site, final entry:
              </p>
              <p>
               1999: Ehud Barak, a former Israeli chief of staff, is elected prime minister and a new peace effort begins with the help of Bill Clinton
              </p>
              <p>
               What a scam.

             Larry King worked with Susan Buffet at the Savngs &amp; Loan. What a funny coincidence since Warren remains untouched.  Last heard he was singing with a touring Children’s Opera group. They never stop.

               I’m can’t use my laptop til next mo and my cell skills are sad. I saw it about 1 or 2 yes ago. The probably a lot of the stuff on Warren and Susan has been scrubbed. Especially him. There is other stuff I read but won’t print here. Too controversial and I don’t have the link. I will tell you to read Democratic Underground.
