<blockquote>
<p><em>In more than 30 letters submitted to the court, a Wisconsin community rallied behind a youth baseball coach accused of groping three young boys</em> while visiting Disney for a tournament over the Fourth of July weekend.</p>
<p>The outpouring of support praising 26-year-old Nicholas Groth as a talented and compassionate leader was filed with the court ahead of a bond hearing for the elementary school teacher from St. Francis, Wis., who founded a kids\' sports league in his spare time. <strong>A judge set his bond at $250,000</strong> and ordered him to have no contact with minors until his case resolves. Groth has been in jail since his July 3 arrest.</p>
<p>In the pending case against him, Groth faces five counts of lewd and lascivious molestation. The charges arose after three boys — ages 7, 12 and 15 — reported that a man touched their buttocks while playing a game of catch in a pool at Disney\'s Pop Century Resort. The boys said the man that they did not know grabbed their behind multiple times and didn\'t stop after being asked, according to an arrest affidavit. One said the man &quot;swiped his fingers up in the middle of his butt,&quot; the affidavit said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Groth was stopped at his hotel on Wednesday, and questioned by a detective, officials say &quot;Groth appeared to be in a mental struggle.&quot;</p>
<p>After indirect and slow responses to questions, the detective said, &quot;his responses disturbed me.&quot;</p>
<p>Groth doesn\'t just work with kids during the summer. Online records show during the school year, he works as a second grade teacher at Willow Glen Primary School in St. Francis.</p>
<p>Deputies say Groth\'s responses disturbed them so much they asked if he was on any medication or had mental illness. His response was that he\'d been hit in the head with baseballs three times this year.</p>
<p><strong>Groth is now being held without bond</strong>, facing five charges of lewd and lascivious molestation with most of the victims under the age of 12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in other words, Groth was being held without bond <em>until</em> the court received 30 letters of support from his Wisconsin community. This is in spite of the fact that he had been investigated earlier that year in Wisconsin for the same behavior:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A St. Francis teacher and Racine coach who faces criminal charges for allegedly fondling boys earlier this week on a baseball trip to Disney World had similar allegations made against him this spring at his school.</p>
<p>Months before Orlando police arrested Nicholas Groth for allegedly grabbing boys in the pool at Disney\'s Pop Century Resort, St. Francis police took a complaint from a mother who said the teacher had grabbed her daughter.</p>
<p>&quot;She loved him. She adored him, and I guess a lot of the kids do,&quot; the mother said.</p>
<p>This mom asked WISN 12 News not to identify her or her daughter, who is a student at Willow Glen Elementary School.</p>
<p>The girl went home in April and told her mom that she had asked Groth for a hug and that when the teacher hugged her, he put his hand on her rear end. The mom wasn\'t sure what to do.</p>
<p>&quot;I\'m going back and forth. \'When do you go to the police?\'&quot; the mom said.</p>
<p>She decided to tell the school and the police and shared the report she filed. It says, Groth told police, &quot;He did not intentionally touch (her) rear end and was not even aware that he did until this incident was brought forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Police did not arrest Groth.</p>
<p>St. Francis police told WISN 12 News they don\'t plan to reopen the case involving the little girl, saying they still don\'t think there\'s enough evidence there to prosecute. They will, however, work closely with Orlando authorities as they investigate the Disney case.</p>
<p>The St. Francis School District also determined the teacher didn\'t intend to fondle the girl. It is now investigating the Florida incident.</p>

               That is correct, and they are referred to as the Marquette mafia. Scott Walker cheated his way into the club. That’s why he was elevated, because he was compromised long ago. They control all courts and many major firms. They are also part of a bigger ‘interfaith coalition’ with Unitarianism, Scientology, FLDS, Kabbalah and OTO. They use the churches and other community outlets to control minority populations.

               Why do Georgetown and Cornell have locations in Qatar? What FF event happened in Racine regarding ‘hate speech’? Why did Warren Buffett buy control over all newspapers in the area? Why did Tim Dolan move to the area for his special ‘assignment’? How was he rewarded when complete? How did Mark Ruffalo get rewarded for his role in the same ‘assignment’?

               ? Why did George Sweigert claim to have met Jesus Christ in Racine? What happened after the meeting? Why did George claim he never wanted any help from Jenny or Jesus Christ, and gave them both too much credit? Why did he delete that video, and why did he “allow” all of his videos over many years to be deleted?

               Vampire and cannibal clubs openly operated in Racine for years? Dialysis clinics and tunnels? Harbors and airports? Major human trafficking hub? Underground Railroad?
