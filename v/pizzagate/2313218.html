            This article gave me nightmares. I am glad that this being exposed, but the suffering of the victims is gut wrenching. It's too awful to believe. I pray for their healing. It's the least I can do.

             “Oh we do have our stable of weird people working for us. Did I ever tell you about the Pedophile Academy? We actually had one down at Camp Peary, (in Virginia) right near (the CIA’s) Jim Critchfield’s place. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but we called it ‘The Farm,’ and it was supposed to be a secret training center for young agents. Allen Dulles set up this training center down there for pedophiles. They were in training to seduce, molest, and most especially photograph the young children of targets. Not only, Allen reasoned, would our graduates have a spanking good time but they could get wonderful action photos of the wee ones to blackmail their families with. I understand they broke it up when one of the graduates nailed a (CIA) Deputy Director’s son at a summer camp.”

            i joined Voat again to post something in PGwhatever but i don't have enough points; after reading this article (i highly recommend we all read it if time permits you) i feel like what i wanted to post is relevant here too. i'm too sketched out by Voat to keep an account anymore so i doubt i'll ever accumulate the points in time to post this myself. here is the post:

             Kars4Kids sketchy children's charity
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            just wanted to drop some links for anyone looking to research.
           </p>
           <p>
            kept hearing this insanity inducing jingle on the radio and decided to look it up on YouTube. was mildly suspicious because after experiencing PG everything to do with kids and charity is suspect. didn't really expect to find much, but quickly found that the charity is accused of things like misleading donors, etc.
           </p>

           <p>
            it was mentioned in the news reports that one way the charity has been fraudulent is because the money it makes goes to a "sister charity" - a Jewish summer camp (i say Jewish neutrally, tbh any religious summercamp is suspect). it was also mentioned that i think 10 million in the charity has "gone missing" through "real estate transactions" ??
           </p>

            weird, red flags, but then it got weirder... this video
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            it's posted on the official Kars4Kids YouTube account, so it caught me off guard when i realized it wasn't a serious commercial. something about it seemed "off" and i wasn't the only one who noticed. here's a comment from the video posted 8 months ago:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I don't get it. This seems like the real account of Kars 4 Kids because it links to other social media for the foundation, but they have lots of videos completely making fun of Kars 4 Kids (if you look at the other videos they uploaded). Is this a parody account or real account?
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing makes sense.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            so i decided to look into the accounts other videos. what in the fuck
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0WzU7py9VU">

           </p>
           <p>
            okay, i can see how that would be funny to people who don't know about charities and children's organizations committing sexual abuse and trafficking kids ... i'm giving it the benefit of the doubt but something still seems off.
           </p>
           <p>
            one of the commenters on that particular video is named "Waffle Nation CP" whose profile photos are of Club Penguin (i think there was some shady shit people uncovered about that site) and his videos are weird shit with Club Penguin "nightmare fuel" and cartoons with all-seeing eyes in pyramids. could be nothing, is still weird.
           </p>
           <p>
            but then, another video a lot like it guised as an April Fools.

            anyway, it could all be nothing. just wanted to drop these links for anyone who wanted research potentials. maybe you could look into the people involved. ultimately, do whatever you want with it.

            fucking hell. that article makes you wonder how much the American tentacles of the beast mirror what's described here as happening in Mexico.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One officer in the P.F.P.'s anti-trafficking division told me that 10 high-level officials in the state of Sonora share a $200,000 weekly payoff from traffickers, a gargantuan sum of money for Mexico. The officer told me with a frozen smile that he was powerless to do anything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             ''Some officials are not only on the organization's payroll, they are key players in the organization,'' an official at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City told me. ''Corruption is the most important reason these networks are so successful.''

             The article says something about forcing things inside the children to stretch them out. I want these people tortured and killed. I hope the children rescued can recover and have the support of the whole world because this shit is beyond sick. The sickest of sick.

            Nice catch, pairing that quote with that pic.  Also this entire article is worth reading, and illustrates the important role of transport in child trafficking.  If you are familiar with 4chan's Anonymous5 (supposedly a high level insider), he said the key to destroying "pizza" and child trafficking is exposing the transport networks: ie. identifying the distribution centres, the fleets of vehicles and the routes they use.  Check 4chan's Human Trafficking General threads to read the work of channers investigating the transport networks.  Those threads are always quickly heavily shilled too--a dead giveaway they're close to exposing something fishy.

             is part of the trafficking network. There's a cargo import/export law that allows ships to bypass certain checks and balances; I believe this law is being used to hide trafficking.

              THis was also a distrubring paragraph, but makes a lot of sense about people like Ghisaline, Hillary, Huma, etc. BREAKING THE GIRLS IN
             </p>
             <p>
              Once the Mexican traffickers abduct or seduce the women and young girls, it's not other men who first indoctrinate them into sexual slavery but other women. The victims and officials I spoke to all emphasized this fact as crucial to the trafficking rings' success. ''Women are the principals,'' Caballero, the Mexican federal preventive police officer, told me. ''The victims are put under the influence of the mothers, who handle them and beat them. Then they give the girls to the men to beat and rape into submission.'' Traffickers understand that because women can more easily gain the trust of young girls, they can more easily crush them. ''Men are the customers and controllers, but within most trafficking organizations themselves, women are the operators,'' Haugen says. ''Women are the ones who exert violent force and psychological torture.''
             </p>
             <p>
              This mirrors the tactics of the Eastern European rings. ''Mexican pimps have learned a lot from European traffickers,'' said Claudia, a former prostitute and madam in her late 40's, whom I met in Tepito, Mexico City's vast and lethal ghetto. ''The Europeans not only gather girls but put older women in the same houses,'' she told me. ''They get younger and older women emotionally attached. They're transported together, survive together.''

              Everything is pretty bad, but hearing how it works, breaks my heart. Govts in on it. A porous border is not good for anyone.

              "The girls' first contacts are usually with what appear to be legitimate travel agencies. According to prosecutors, the Komisaruk/Mezheritsky ring in Ukraine worked with two such agencies in Kiev, Art Life International and Svit Tours. The helpful agents at Svit and Art Life explained to the girls that the best way to get into the U.S. was through Mexico, which they portrayed as a short walk or boat ride from the American dream. Oblivious and full of hope, the girls get on planes to Europe and then on to Mexico.
             </p>
             <p>
              Every day, flights from Paris, London and Amsterdam arrive at Mexico City's international airport carrying groups of these girls, sometimes as many as seven at a time, according to two Mexico City immigration officers I spoke with (and who asked to remain anonymous). One of them told me that officials at the airport -- who cooperate with Mexico's federal preventive police (P.F.P.) -- work with the traffickers and ''direct airlines to park at certain gates. Officials go to the aircraft. They know the seat numbers. While passengers come off, they take the girls to an office, where officials will 'process' them.''
