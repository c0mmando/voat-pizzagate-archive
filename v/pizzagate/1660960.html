            Your story really caught my eye, AND MY HEART!  Happened to my grandson! We caught it fairly quickly but not before it led to some other problems such as lying, stealing, leaving home and walking down the middle of the highway. Begged the mother to get him to a counselor. Finally happened after a couple months of begging. We live  a couple hours away coerced her into letting him come stay with us. Got him into guitar, lessons,practice, tutorials, accessories. Five lessons in...he's figured out 3 21pilots songs, a Keith Urban, snow patrol song, plus what the teacher shows him. Apparently a savant!?!  I shudder to think what COULD'VE HAPPENED! Never thought that baby would know what anime is!!@@@@!!!!!! Hell, I sure didnt! Thank you!

            Whoa. Projection, maybe?
I for one am aware of the ongoing and incessant attempt by tptb to minimize and even ridicule the abuse kids have survived, and recognizing such and calling it out for what it is in no way means my fight and journey down the rabbit hole have slowed down. Compassion for victims is a must in this fight

            Thank you for sharing your story. They try to silence the victims with shame. I only have anger towards the pedo conspiracy. What happened to me was a result of corrupted government and compromised adults. It was not your fault or any child or youth's fault. They play young people's emotions like a fiddle. It's easy or they wouldn't do it. The sickos make you feel wanted and valued up until you walk into the kill room.

            Hey thanks for sharing, it's so important to talk about I think, because not only does it give others the courage to come forward, and not only can it help with investigating these people and bringing them to justice, but also for you and other victims who speak out, I expect it is cathartic to be able to say this happened to me, and for others to acknowledge what you went through and show you just how many people there are out there who wish they could've protected you and who are fighting alongside you to stop this happening to more kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a kid, even with the internet between you and an adult, you still have that ingrained idea that the adults you engage with normally are to be listened to and obeyed, that they know what's best, what's right and wrong. So when an adult pressures you to do something you feel wrong about, it's incredibly confusing, because as a kid you are always having to do what adults say even when you don't quite understand what the reasons are behind it etc. And it makes it even worse in a way, because kids in these situations end up convincing themselves that they chose to do it freely, and that they aren't entitled to the awful feelings they have about it. When that's not the case at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope you're okay and thanks for sharing, every one of these stories just hammers it home even more how important it is that we stop these creatures.

            I can't find the link right now, but the CIA was using online game servers to communicate coded messages to their operatives and operators.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure one of the navy seals or the ambassador in Benghazi was posting on an mmo webpage something like this is not a joke, the base is under attack .
           </p>
           <p>
            Just thought I'd point out that the CIA and FBI use game servers as well as use games as honeypots
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the link , it's been whitewashed and mostly scrubbed from the internet
            <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/09/vilerat/">

            But I was write. US officials were using a game server to convey the embassy was under attack

            TBH mate I personally wouldn't go to law enforcement, if anything write a letter to Sessions, who knows who to trust, and while the average cop would likely want to do something, top brass in DC is likely to put ur name down as trouble, imo. Glad you seem to be ok now, had no idea the cunts were so active and scheming, fucking hell.

              Thanks for reminding me! :) I didn't have time last night and would have forgotten. I couldn't find a link to the video I watched for some reason. This is the guy. Zachary King. And the description says it tells how he got started. The video I heard was interesting and held my interest. Hopefully this one will do the same.

               thx!   listening now.  have you ever heard this guy - he's great.  Seen it all and ended up being able to get out and spill their secrets.  He has a lot of good videos and goes deep into the history of this group which is fascinating.

            Being gay is not something you simply 'are'. It's a sexual deviancy and a perversion that you need to challenge. It is not something that is simply 'a part of life' and you seriously need to end it. It a step towards pedophilia as it is one of the first steps on the perversion-ladder.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the result of having a society that is highly sexualized, because when you spend much time and energy on sexuality, you need to keep feeding your sexuality to keep it interesting and thus you push yourself further.

             From all thats come out from pizzagate it looks like people are not "born that way" but are encouraged to be gay by their parents or made gay(satanic upbringing - androgynous baphomet ) with the parents forcing them giving them hormones and such or they were molested at a young age.

             I politely disagree. Homosexuality is not a pathway to pedophilia but I respect your opinion... Though only homosexuality may be due to "premature sexual advances" from.my older brother.

              If you hadn't been exposed to sexuality at such a young age, you would have found every bit of sexualized content very arousing. Now you seem to want homosexuality because it's what is hot for you? Take a second to think about it.

            You are bringing up a good point OP.   You are at least a semi-survivor of underage sex predation at an internet place that exploits the play habits of young boys; you may have valuable knowledge about individual high level predators in DC and elsewhere, and also you also may be able to point the way to places where trafficking or predation may be going on right now.

           <ol>
            <li>
             Do you need help or counseling?  That is the first and most important question.
            </li>
            <li>
             Do you believe you have evidence that needs to go to the right place?

            <li>

              he said semi-survivor so he meant semi-survivor. I get that OP went through something fucked up, butit also seems that he also didnt watch a baby cut into pieces and eaten or literally kidnapped and held hostage. Shut your fucking faggot ass feelings mouth with this holy correction. stupid bitch.

               Complete opposite attitude of the spirit that's needed to stop victims from being discredited and stop the evil behind rampant child abuse. Makes me sick. But not personally offended in the least. Abuse is a continuum, and there's no way to say where being a survivor  starts. Interestingly, the OP who replied to this comment of mine actually had compassion and an open-mind, qualities that are needed in this fight against evil

            </p>
            <p>
             2) the only evidence I would even possibly have is my Xbl account from 10yrs ago and Idk what email or password I used at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             3) if I ever had the opportunity to pursue this in court I would. No settlements, only justice... My anonymity is forfeit on this matter.

             <p>
              All of my gay friends were molested by grown men at some point before they were 15. It just makes me think that homosexuals are not born, but made.

             Of course they know about it. I wish I had my laptop and not just my phone or I would be able to post way more evidence.

             This story was covered up. I remember back when Benghazi happened there was more talk about this. Think about it. The embassy is under attack , a CIA annex building under attack, they have weapons and tech everywhere, and the officer decides to take time post about it in a game website?

             The wired article is a cover, I'll try to investgate more but I only have an octacore smart phone. I need a laptop to do sufficient research, butbi digress.

              wow, I am reading this hours later and am mesmerized.  If you could find the time and resources just to post this as a submission, I think it is hella important to be a part of the record here.  (This whole place is basically a law enforcement hive mind experiment anyway. Just get this down.) If you can't do it just reply and at least I'll post the wired article and an explanation.

               I always wondered if they look for new recruits, like people who are awesome at the game, especially now that it's getting closer to the point where people will be engaging in combat remotely, literally using an XBox controller to hnt down and kill real life enemies. Like in the book Ender's Game, which is a great book, although not the kind of world we'd want to live in!

                 Ender's Game the book I remember as being amazing, but I was only about 8 when I read it (it's not a kids book, I was just a big reader from early on) so my 8 year old mind may have found it more thrilling and surprising than an adult would. It really stuck with me. They made a movie about it not that long ago, but it wasn't as good as the book in my view.
