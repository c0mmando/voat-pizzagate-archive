            I agree with everyone we need to stand our ground. They love to lead the narrative and they have plenty of tools to do so, mainly mainstream media. We need to own this narrative.

            In my opinion, the problem with "Pizzagate" is it focuses attention on a few people (Alefantis / Podesta etc.) and the goings-on in a restaurant in Washington DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Pedogate" encompasses the whole issue by including many other alleged pedos like Chuck Schumer, Weinstein, Hilary &amp; Bill, Epstein &amp; Co. and geographically can expand to include DC, NY, Hollywood, Bohemian Grove plus international connections - Norway, Belgium, Haiti, Panama etc. Almost everything here has interstate and/or international connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            I actually think the tag #SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse) could be used instead of / as well as Pizzagate and Pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just my thoughts...

            pizzagate is about the giants and those are the ones who enable everyone below them... the giants need to fall and those giants are only directly related to #pizzagate

            Use Pedogate when operating on enemy territory, but NO, Pizzagate is NOT and NEVER WAS limited to DC or Alefantis.  That's a lie spread by the enemy's media shills.  Accommodating that lie may seem convenient, and in some ways it would be, but the Pizzagate label ties us into the code words which got us started on this investigation in the first place.
           </p>

            Pizzagate is about pizza like Watergate was about water.

            Guilty as charged. I have suggested the change as well. Reasoning:
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate, although very real is a very fake term now for common folk. Simple, try and google it. It's a conspiracy about Hillary Clinton running a child trafficking ring out of DC Pizzeria basement.
           </p>
           <p>
            How does
            <em>
             that
            </em>
            sound to you?
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedogate: on Google searches, is much more serious. The links return Pedophilia research into DC and beyond. Another reason Pedogate is important is because it has been THE term used by political circles for a long time
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            is known worldwide.
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole point is (apart from stopping this as soon as possible to save lives)  to wake the sleeping masses.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm no longer worried about James Alefantis. He's like the little fish that feed off the gills of a shark. Net the shark, and the little fish will be scooped up as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            By all means continue to use Pizzagate, although you will probably get more of an eye roll when trying to redpill common folk, it's still has it's value for those well into the term.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedogate is where one wants to start connecting the dots.

            I put BOTH hashtags in everything I broadcast, #Pizzagate and #Pedogate. I also include the tag #HumanHarvesting for all the ways the globalist/capitalist elite 1% profit from making the 99% sick, from owning the cure, from locking us up in prison and from keeping us in debt. And that's just Americans. Globally #HumanHarvesting includes slavery, child sex trafficking, organ harvesting, sacrificing infants, baby farms, forced prostitution. I say take control of BOTH labels and any other they throw our way just like we stormed and took over "Fake News". There will always be more of us. Overtake all forums.

            The name Pizzagate defines the origins of this investigation, is directly symbolic of the codified language used between the roaches and IMO evokes more curiosity than Pedogate.  I also suspect that the push for change is coming from sources that are controlled opposition.

            they want the focus off their use of codes and how they conceal their dark passengers. And believe me dexter had it right, its far more a "passenger" than a defective mind. That is why pizza had to go. They have to restructure their entire codex of modes of recognition now.

            I like pedogate better because it is obvious what its about. I didnt even discover pizzagate until recently because of the name sounded too uninteresting. So many people I know heard of the term (while it was mainstream) and had no idea what it was, and didnt care. At least with the name pedogate its more of a threat to the elite. I also think that maybe pedogate can erupt as its own thing. Everytime I say pizzagate I cringe a little because it sounds kinda ridiculous. It sounds like its about pizza. If pedogate was trending on twitter im sure everybody would click on it to find out what it is. I really dont think there is a disinfo trying to change the name because pedogate is a more thretening name.

            I thought the protest yesterday, even if small, still did some good and I thought the protestors did their best in interviews under difficult circumstances.  There was very little support around them and a lot of hostility.  Staging the protest in a hostile neighborhood like that was brave but not effective.
           </p>
           <p>
            However I felt the worst thing about the protest yesterday was that it was too focused on the pizza parlor thing, on CPP, Alefantis Instagrams specifically, on Welch, all the saga of pizzagate details.  I don't think spirit cooking and Satanism or even the art is an effective way to address the public and bring them in - there is too much cultural relativity now and if you start out by attacking a weird artist you just sound intolerant.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel that it is easier to talk to people about pedogate in general and human trafficking first, then child trafficking, then pizzagate and the specifics there last.   People can readily accept that slavery and human trafficking is a reality.  Then child and organ trafficking is the next bitter pill.  After that the specifics of pizzagate make sense.   The Podesta emails don't seem like just anomalies, the art, the Satanism all fill in some of the blanks.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess I am overall with the pedogate term, as it has less baggage, and has a wider scope.  It does not include all human trafficking, but it does including all trafficking of children, and that's a big enough challenge to work with.

            Talk about discrediting - look at how our most active mod thinks about this board - uses "conspiracy theorists" disparagingly just like the CIA taught her to, thinks it is outrageously demanding for members here to expect a simple annoucement about major forum changes like taking down the search bar and never putting it back as promised.  Also just before this I showed very clear inconsistancies in leaving and removing posts, when they made a mistake and showed that sensitive and wecanhelp are the same mod or they use their names interchanably like brand names.  I didn't post that part here if you want it I will.    What else, oh yeah, and has the nerve to complain about the QUALITY of the posts the mods leave up on the board - as a MOD who is supposed to do something about it!!   LOL It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and shows how we are left, high and dry by this busted forum-

There are decent investigators and minds here, outstanding even, but a growing majority will jump on everything that looks dramatic enough without actually doing their own five-minute research and reflect a bit. And why do you think Voat developers owe you anything, let alone a notification of every little development step that they take, considering how it's already been stated by one of them that this is a temporary change? Try developing a platform like this sometime, you'll soon find out that things don't always go as planned. In any case, this is not

             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            material. If you want, you can bombard Voat devs with your queries and theories all you like over on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/voatdev">
             /v/voatdev
            </a>
            , you'll be surprised that they do actually react eventually.

            how transparent. It's the CIA generated phrase used to control people who question and supposedly shame them. YES pizzagate is a conspiracy theory actually, so yes they populate this board. Sorry you don't like the actual pupose of this board which is to investigate a CONSPIRACY.

            That's because the moderation here allows any nutball post to stay up for days, I have pointed out several that are misleading, false in their titles, unsupported by evidence. And every mod just like you comes back and says, Oh, I can't do anything about it. What a bunch of pathetic agenda driven losers you all are, and very transparent as well.

            Because they INVITED this community here and promised transparency. Maybe you weren't around at the beginning and missed that part.
           </p>
           <p>
            You guys are unorganized, inconsistent and constantly knocking the balls out of this movement and then try to cover it with fabrications, tissues of lies and cowardly excuses. You really think it is too much trouble to make a freaking announcement about removing the search bar on an INVESTIGATION forum? Just incredible. I can't wait to take this converstation far and wide for further proof of just what your mod culture thinks is reasonable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now please hurry back to doing absolutely nothing except fighting the effort here, and have a great time at your next CIA sponsored pizza party.

            I should stop saying "transparent" when I mean "obvious" and then I use it later to mean being "honest" as in they promised transparency here.  I specifically remember all the good vibes cast around by kingkongwaswrong and VictorSteinerDavion here at the beginning, they were so happy to have and welcome this community here and were going to do so much to be supportive.  pfffffft.

                At the time I was in the vein of encouraging everyone to just speak up here or wherever you go, and I know of course you do and very well I might add.

                These mods wield way too much power to represent this community with sticky posts promoting doubt, fear, paranoia and defeatism.  Really more than a week of shame for them demonstrating how very much on the wrong side of history they are, and acting contemptuous about our requests to get the site enabled again.  They'll be the first to say "I helped lead the charge!" if the protests get traction and the people get their chance to stand up and make a difference.  They seem to exactly embody the character of "Frank" on M.A.S.H if you ever saw that.  My contempt for them is freeing, as the gloves are off as far as I'm concerned.  Whether through complacent carelessness or design, these mods are not going to sit pretty in their ivory towers dropping their fear bombs on this place without consequence or criticism while I still have a mind to keep an eye on them.  Vindicator actually accused me of not being "gracefull" and complained about needing a vacation a few hours ago - I saw a comment where she thought the first protest's campaign was too sophisticated for "a construction worker".  They sound like spoiled prep school snobs trying to sit on top of this movement with their powdered pampered asses.

            I posted the first thread on your list and I have got to say that I never expected this community to be so divided over the use of these terms. I am starting to feel like we're losing the fight and I hate it. If there was ever a time when I felt like I was about to give up was today. Sorry folks, it's not looking good for us. I'm gonna be totally honest and say what is exactly on my mind right now : Fuck #Pizzagate and Fuck #PedoGate and let's just please #SaveTheFucking Kids

            That could be. I thought the protests were bad ideas because of the ease with which a false flag could be staged, but maybe I'm wrong about that.

             I think that MOST people know that pedo is short for pedophile.
            </p>
            <p>
             The prefix "pedo" has several other meanings, including:
1)  Children.
2)  Foot/Feet.
2)  Soil.
3)  Farts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those are lesser known definitions.

            I can't give Alefantis "credit" for an easy scripted "interview" with Megan Kelly. He was not asked any hard questions- especially when he cracked that sly smile when asked about child trafficking...

            I believe Brock's hired shill posters will do anything to take the focus off Alefantis. I see ansipizza's point- we can't take the focus off of what's been uncovered. Allthese low level busts are great. But I want to see the "big boys" in DC who have been using kids like they are a disposable object get their much deserved comeuppance
.

            The idea to call it "pedogate" instead has been floating around a while. The point is to broaden the scope. There are hubs in the child trafficking network that have nothing to do with pizzerias.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying that I trust Reddit higher-ups, but I think it was pretty clear that the main problem with having the pizzagate sub was that it was all focused around a particular restaurant and its owner. The thing about harassment is that it doesn't matter if you're correct about what you're saying or not. If you're congregating online to make accusations against specific individuals and people are creating real-life consequences for those individuals, you're making a very easy case for someone to shut you down.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Pizzagate" focuses us on CPP and the Podesta e-mails, where people have built circumstantial cases. "Pedogate" is stronger because it can encompass the actual
            <strong>
             busts
            </strong>
            that have happened recently. Predicating the whole thing on charges that were actually filed that led to arrests is more "justifiable" than so-called "speculation" surrounding a pizza joint.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we're talking about something that has been going on since before Comet Ping Pong even opened, why do we need to keep "pizza?" I don't see a reason to stop using pizzagate because we've already put so much fuel in it, but I don't see a good reason to avoid "pedogate" at all. I personally think it's the more appropriate of the two.

            This logic is something to consider. While both terms have legitimacy, we need to remember that pizzagate involves JA, who was lovers of Brock, the propagator of paid shills through CTR and ShareBlue. It could be an effort to deflect from the specific investigation and interest in the DC pedo ring, Comet Ping Pong, Podesta, etc.

              No sudden change of heart. My explanation for needing to use other tags than pizzagate is explicated fully in this thread and relates to the active censorship of the term, which limits exposure of this whole movement and investigation.

            This makes sense. Good first post. And I agree that Pizzagate keeps the focus very specific to the DC elite pedo ring with Alefantis as an easy to spot player with tons of circumstantial evidence that points to his opperations. The pizza angle keeps him as a major focus as it should. Anybody going through his material will get red pilled the easiest by looking at the Alefantis evidence.

            At the end of the day it is all VERY SIMPLE... Pedophiles speak in code... child porn is coded as "cp." CHEESE PIZZA is a way of saying "child porn." There is probably evidence going back to the 1930's of them using such codes... THESE CODES WILL BE IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS if we comb through old stuff enough we will find other "codes." The effort to rid the name "pizzagate" in my opinion is to take focus off the fact that they SPEAK AND COMMUNICATE THROUGH CODES. The PIZZA in PIZZAGATE is in reference to speaking in code, NOT A PIZZERIA IN DC.

             Absolutely! It's so key to keep drawing attention to the code words! Once you start seeing it, you can't unsee it. I think this is true even for some people who initially can't believe it. They start seeing the codes in other places and go back to read up and give it more consideration.

              This is the exact reason we need to keep calling it Pizzagate... not because of some stupid pizza place in DC, but for the fact that they are speaking in CODE in PLAIN SIGHT. We have only just begun to crack their code... Imagine if we start to comb through decades of info only to find out it was in front of our faces this whole time... THAT is what PIZZAGATE is... the fact that all this is CODES.

             </p>
             <p>
              De Blasio said it, and the audience immediately groaned.  Hitlery then covered for him, calling it "Cautious Politician time."

             <p>
              Commenters on YT claim that it stands for "Colored People time" so is a racist term.  However, since de Blasio's wife is black that is highly unlikely IMO.

            Some prick called AdminAssistantNo9 was trying to murky the waters on Reddit by posting a ridiculous number of discussions at once including posts doubting pizzagate/pedogate and a lot of pages saying Trump is a pedophile.  Yesterday he dominated the front page but thankfully he has been receding.

           <p>
            I know how Pizzagate started. You're missing the point. Pizzagate has already been smeared and few people take it seriously anymore precisely because the evidence is almost all circumstantial.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a completely rational opinion to rename Pizzaget considering the above and the fact it's just a tiny tea spoon of ice from a massive iceberg of fraud, corruption, human and organ trafficking and money laundering to name just a few.

            It effectively takes the focus off of Alefantis. He's the weak link and the name should not be changed for that reason alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is central to this investigation hence the enormous effort taken to get the spotlight off of him. If it were any normal person, they wouldn't have strategists working for them, nor would they have created this narrative to spew.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm with you on this one. I just received pushback for being resistant. That's always a good sign that something is hitting a nerve. Upvoat for you.

              Exacty. I think the pressure is off the core group of cannibal elites. I do appreciate and think all the news linking pedos to other parts of the world and country is important, but the pressure is off the ones who were cracking under the pressure. We need to get that back.

            Maybe by calling it
            <em>
             Pedogate
            </em>
            , those whom are uneducated on the subject might be less inclined to ask, "so what's this got to do with pizza?". It seems like a deflection from all the bizarre food references, and possibly an admittance at the same time that the sexual perversion side of things is rampant in esteemed places of the world, we all pretty much know that by now, but without wanting the other half of the story to come out. So it's about mitigating the inevitable damage as much as possible.

            It makes perfect sense to me. Pedogate isn't impugning a specific individual who owns a Pizza Parlor in DC and thereby opening up Reddit to a defamation law suit.

            Actually I'm not sure why you would object to changing the name of Pizzagate now that we've discovered James Alefantis really didn't do anything. Ok maybe he did, I'm not handing out absolution here. All I know is there is no hard EVIDENCE he did anything wrong. Unlike what George Webb has discovered which is hard evidence of human and organ trafficking, drug smuggling and money laundering at the highest levels of the U.S. government:

             We descovered no such thing about Alefantis and you sound a little disinfo yourself. His Pizza place alone is incriminating, then there are his back and forth picture and text sharing, the bands that play at his joint, his conncections to the elite, masons, CIA, childrens organizations and business etc. So what are you going on about how "we've discovered James Alefantis really didn't do anything." You are not looking very good at this moment. Downvote to you.

             The only credit I can possibly give for Alefantis is that he has publicly spoke about the matter. Then again, he's not really had much of a choice. Doesn't mean many of us aren't right if we claim he's one creepy son of a goat - he certainly has some odd fetishes which are wholly incompatible with anything "family friendly".

             The term "pizza" was used in the Podesta emails, it was through Wikileaks that we heard about a DC child trafficking/rape/murder ring involving many who use food words to describe illegal sex acts. Comet and other pizza shops were included in the armchair investigation, but it is disinfo that "pizzagate" is about a pizza shop. They'd love to redefine it that way, because it's easy to then debunk the entire thing by saying there are no overt signs of abused children at Comet. Don't fall for it.

            We should stand our ground and keep it as Pizzagate to 1) Show that we won't be bullied or manipulated into changing the name for any reason or any person and 2)  Keep form and consistency, and persist on until we make a breakthrough.
           </p>
           <p>
            IMO, global pedophile rings are important and something we should pursue at a later date after we finish with Pizzagate, but for now we must focus and concentrate on taking down the key players from PG here in America first.

             screwn fuquing reddit. WEINERGATE -- makes the Hot Dog connection. PIZZAGATE is the name everybody came up with once they were through throwing up when they learned the Pedo Code. This was the surprise that will never leave the minds of those who find out.

             Pizzagate IS global.  World wide they are raping babies and calling it "Ping Pong" and eating babies calling them "Pizza".
            </p>
            <p>
             EliteAreRapingAndEatingBabies-Gate
            </p>
            <p>
             And its NOT ONLY the elite that are doing this.
            </p>
            <p>
             They own these "pizzarias" so they can talk in pizza code 24 hours a day in emails and on the phone and no one suspects anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before pizza was invented over 100 years ago they were using different words to describe little children as food and one world was probably "chicken". And before "pong pong" was invented I suspect some of the local bookstores was where the ping pong happened or occultic sacrifices...eg...Politics and Prose bookstore.
            </p>
            <p>
             And in the 1800's or earlier when people would correspond via letters talking about bookstores or chicken or w/e the code words or places were back then no one would suspect anything.

             how the fuck are we gonna get through to all the retards commonly known as sjws and such by calling it pizzagate? to call it pedogate is probably more accurate and a better idea. i know it sucks to switch names but whats more likely to get recognition/

              We will get through to them by making breakthroughs and finding undeniable proof. Which will be difficult. But easier than doing it if we allow ourselves to be compromised and then swept under the rug. It's hard to sweep pizzagate under the rug. It's easy to do so with pedogate. Just as the OP says. We need no more recognition. The higher the recognition, the harder it is to plug leaks in the ship, so to speak. The cause becomes diluted. When this community was just a couple thousand impassioned researchers, there was no need to rebrand; everybody was happy with "pizzagate". It's unnecessary, through and through.

              You'd probably call me a social justice warrior. I can't think of any cause more worth devotion than pizza/pedogate. For one, stop talking like 'social justice' is a bad thing. Institutionalized Pedo-sadism is one of if not the biggest social justice issue facing us right now. What you are is a true social justice warrior, stop saying it like it's a bad thing. Think of another label for people who take social justice to petty and fake things.

               as much as i appreciate your comment i dont like the history of "social justice" in fact i dont like the history of most things today and thus i am not on board with most terminology. i chose sjw because it is 3 letters and so much easier than how i actually feel. how bout
 zombie retard bleeding heart whores with nothing better to do than nothing at all while riding their high horse, morally crrupt feigning moral indignation and actually helping no one at all. or sheep cucks bandying about in the streets screaming shit like no speech for hate speech these dumb cunts. im sick of it they are as bad as the people we are trying to bring down i wish i had a way to hammer their skulls into reality that wasnt murder.

               I believe you've got an impossible task reclaiming "social justice" from the opinion sewer.  However, taking out the pedo-elite is a cause worth joining forces for.  The only ones I won't work with in this fight are the pedos and their lackeys.  It's everyone else vs. the inhumans.

             Maybe the idea is, if it's called "pedogate", a slew of low level pedo arrests can be said to have solved the problem. "Pizzagate" only makes sense in the context of its history, involving podesta, alefantis et al, and ultimately reaching high levels of government.

              Excellent post. Comments relating pedoGate to pizzagate and the larger issue of occult sacrificial abuse are the target. No one is supposed to know about the esoteric religion of the elites.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you read the trial of Alcibiades by Plato, a youth profanes the esoteric sex-based religion of the elites and is put on trial. He goes around lopping the cocks off the hermai (bust-like statues that are commonly found from ancient sites, they have male genitals on them). History repeating itself. Same religion? Probably not exactly the same, but the notion of esoteric (elite, inner, hidden) /exoteric (common, public) religion is central to all of this. The plebs are not supposed to know about any of this.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you read about ancient cultures and religions, you will notice that there is an element of esoterica/exoterica to many of the belief systems.

              This times 1,000. TPTB have realized that we aren't going to stop so they must give us something. They're going to throw their low level minions under the bus and try to call it good. Pizzagate has a definable history and we need to stick to it.

              This is well put.  They certainly love being able to "one and done" complex issues, making just enough of an effort to quell the public concern with some showmanship over lower level busts (like the war on drugs), then quickly forgetting about the issue and saying "but it's already been addressed!  We've done something about it.  Show's over.  Moving on."
             </p>
             <p>
              You can't completely sweep Pizzagate under the rug without Alefantis or Podesta getting nailed.

            Yeah there's probably something to this theory. I do think pedogate is a more credible name than pizzagate, esp since pizzagate has been so tainted by the msm, but this feels coordinated.

             The media will attack, smear, and taint anything that can harm the criminal cabal they're protecting. The fact that something is smeared is just more proof that it's a threat to the powers that be. If they're not smearing something that seems to threaten them, it's because they're controlling it, using it to trick the people into thinking action is being taken.

             NO, you are WRONG... the fact is they are HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT. They are using CODES RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR FACES... symbols and CODES... Child Porn = CP = Cheese Pizza. Kinda like how marijuana is called "Mary Jane." They have been speaking in codes for DECADES... we don't even know ALL their lingo yet. PIZZAGATE is a key that can unlock DECADES of evidence that has been hidden in plain sight. IT IS THEIR METHOD OF OPERATION/COMMUNICATION that makes up the name PIZZAGATE. Focus on their lingo and all will start to make sense. IGNORING their lingo keeps them safe and hidden.
