             Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol.  It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone.  Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down and sometimes into oblivion, and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post on the face of it is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.

             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles.  I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030
            </a>
            .   If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <pre><code> - 1 Also reaching out to the mods 
 - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion 
 - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
</code></pre>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up.  At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all.  If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.

             I don't know if this will matter to you but I copy and pasted this title directly from the YouTube title. I actually cut off the portion that said MUST WATCH for the very reasons you mention. I didn't notice or think about the fact that it was full caps until later when I read a comment similar to this one on another post. Because of reading that I deliberately made sure to de-capitalize all but the first letter of each word, as is common in titling, of my next post (which I subsequently deleted for other reasons).

            It was a little mystifying to see the "appeal" to Queen Elizabeth at the end.  Those creatures are not normal and do NOT possess normal human emotions.  So the Queen may be a "mother," but not in the sense that we think of a "mother."  Ms. Ford (formerly known as Brice Taylor) must be incredibly naive about her abusers and/or was just being politically correct.  I prefer to believe it's the latter, not based upon any evidence but just because it makes me feel better.

             I found the question and the reply at the end a bit strange too. Although, I assume she likely only responded because she was asked to. If she had made that appeal completely unsolicited I would have really found it odd. I obviously don't know. That was just my take on it.
