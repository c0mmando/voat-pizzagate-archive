<p>The following was down in the comments at the link:</p>
<p>Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jim Carry, Stephen Colbert, Obama and more… are extremely malicious and specialize in terrorism, trickery and threats. It’s foolish to think Seinfeld had a slip of the tongue because his shields were down and heart open.</p>
<p>The Royal Order of Jesters is a Masonic division of the Shriners and headed up by the House of Furstenberg of Germany and the House of Colonna of Rome. The Shriners are also known as the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. As a European Masonic Order it is Arabic in relation to the Moorish invasion of Europe. The Furstenberg family use a Jester on their coat of arms and have a broad range of influence in politics, banking, and corporations. Court Jesters were used by royalty in medieval times and this still continues today.
The Royal Order of Jesters is headquartered in Hawaii where Barack Obama is from. Barack Obama is a Masonic Jester trained in arrogant mockery and joking. Jesters specialize in mocking the truth and making jokes to deflect away from serious issues. Some Jesters are extremely malicious and specialize in terrorism, trickery, and threats and this type can be seen in entertainment like the Joker in Batman. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope of Insane Clown Posse are examples of sadistic Jesters and they have a large cult following known as Juggalos with a portion of them part of violent street gangs also called Juggalos. Juggalo gang members are insane blood intoxicated terrorists known for carrying out violent attacks and murder.</p>
<p>Jim Carrey is a high level Court Jester in Hollywood and mocks people who expose the Illuminati. Jerry Seinfeld is a high level member of the Order of Jesters and like an elder. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is likely a female associate of the Jesters and also one of the highest level witches in the United States. Prince Urbano Riario Sforza Barberini Colonna di Sciarra is an Italian comedian and he oversees the comedic aspect of the Order of Jesters. Jesters are joyful wickedness. They get joy from terrorizing, humiliating, and torturing people.
The Colbert family were a lower French nobility with Jean-Baptiste Colbert a Minister of Finance in France.</p>
<p>Stephen Colbert is their Crowned Jester in the United States and a major gatekeeper using comedy to distract from the seriousness of political corruption. The news media even considers him as a legitimate member of the news media. The French House of Colbert use a serpent on their coat of arms and that is exactly the nature of Stephen Colbert. Colbert gets paid very well to consciously spread bold disinformation and lies backed up by comedy to distract society away from criminals that are attempting a full takeover. He even manages an online cult that cyber stalk people exposing criminals and they use mockery to do it. Seth MacFarlane is a high level Jester who subtly mixes comedy with sadism and evil. Alex Jones was even initiated by the Royal Order of Jesters and did a show as the joker. <a href="https://ahuwahzeus.wixsite.com/mysite/single-post/2018/01/14/Order-of-Jokers">https://ahuwahzeus.wixsite.com/mysite/single-post/2018/01/14/Order-of-Jokers</a>
Secret societies like Freemasonry and the Order of Jesters are involved with sex slavery, pedophilia, human sacrifice, and a multitude of depravity. The most common practice among these Jesters is the consumption of adrenochrome and adrenaline filled blood. These initiations are how they incorporate and compromise aspects of society to go along with their takeover agenda. Prince Heinrich of Furstenberg and Prince Alexander of Furstenberg are the top managers of the Royal Order of Jesters and they oversee the sadistic and terroristic aspect of the Order of Jesters.</p>',

            Right up my alley. Thanks a million for the post. And speaking of mockery - watch Seinfeld Episode 19, Season 3 - The Limo. 
In tongue in cheek they tell us who calls the shots.

             Yeah, this was such an interesting and thought provoking post. I've never thought of the role of the jester in royalty in a modern setting and this makes perfect sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was just reading up on how the US is technically a corporation and read the Dun &amp; Bradstreet incorporation number and saw how it actually was essentially still owned by the Queen. The royal family had their last name changed to Windsor even though they're actually German and related to the Vlad the Impaler, the historical figure that cannabilized people and inspired the stories of Dracula. So, all that to say, the modern day version of the jester being manifested in Zionist Jews "comedians" would make total sense.

              Formation
The original meeting resulting in the formation was held on February 20, 1911, by Shriners in the Captain’s office of the S.S. Wilhelmina on a pilgrimage to Aloha Temple, Hawaii. Noble A.M. Ellison of San Francisco, California, was responsible and the original cast included a Director and thirteen members. It was organized June 25, 1917, at an informal meeting.

             Yes,you have standards and work hard to 'herd cats' on the board.  Could you possibly consider a debunked flair?  Jerry Seinfeld did say that about pancakes.  His name did come up in the paralegal anon's list of folks Allison Mack is talking about.  But if not, that's cool, it's all good. :)

              I agree about Seinfeld, and honestly the theory proposed here may be dead on. The problem is, this is being presented as fact without enough supporting source material for all the information about the Jesters. We really need a serious, well-sourced, hard-hitting piece on this organization that can be linked back to in all future submissions about those potentially connected to them. Flairing this "debunked" doesn't really help us build the case.

              Users have contributed some of what's needed here in the comments, but the flair has expired and you didn't add it to the body of your post. I have to remove it now. I have posted a Link post to this thread in

               v/pizzagatewhatever

              so folks can easily find it if you or anyone who contributed wishes to put together a true research thread on this topic incorporating the material in the Comments. Removing per Rule 2.

            and it gets pretty funny in this explanation between man and woman, but I really think THEY have their own lingo and meaning.  We have discussed their interest in cannibalism and I think that is what is discussed here. They are pretty sick and evil individuals.  They have convinced themselves and been told that they are way above  us.  They are special.  And we are not.  Well, I don't want to be in their Bleeping Club with her Bleeping Green Pancakes.   I am sure the Clintons and Seinfelds share there love for "Pancakes".  More of their Secret Talk.

              Yes, I know they are kind of crazy sometimes and weird, but then so are the evil cabal.  That's what I wanted to show.  There are always some "other"meanings to their double talk. Like Ping Pong.

            OP, unfortunately, the ahuwahzeus site is a known disinfo site. The guy just makes most of the stuff up.
           </p>
           <p>
            He mixes some facts with errors, lies, and speculation. Most often he's just freely associating.
           </p>

            I recently spent five hours vetting some of the articles on his site. In the end, we had to flair the post that was based upon it 'Debunked'.

             Yeah, I was impressed by the wealth of details, but it all seems like a bit much, eh...

             In the realm of 'conspiracy theory', I think we can be led astray by:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               Fantasists who just love to make up horror stories
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Trolls who love to make fun of conspiracy theorists
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Propagandists who make up stories 'for the cause'
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Disinfo
               </strong>
               people who are actively working for 'the bad guys'
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Incredulous people who promulgate and string together other conspiracy theories
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Probably the latter case is most prevalent, so you get a mixture of everything. It's popular to say source A is either all lying or telling the truth, but I think it behooves researchers to check out interesting 'facts' from sources individually. There is a big 'echo chamber' effect on the web though, so sometimes your 'supporting evidence' is coming from the same source. I think some sources intentionally discredit themselves for 'plausible deniability', like David Icke with his 'reptiles'.

             I still think the scandal about some Jesters hiring prostitutes is real. I recall teenagers were involved. I'm sure most Shriners are really good people who want to help kids, but I could see this could be a nefarious way for some to get close to kids:

             Jimmy Saville was big on charity fundraising and working with hospitals. He even had his own room in some and worked as a volunteer mortuary porter to indulge his necrophilia. He said he preferred hospitals to discos, because they were open 24 hours. In some wards the nurses would tell the kids 'just pretend to be asleep', as he would roam around at night and molest the vulnerable.

             I knew that Julia Louis Dreyfus was very rich due to banker daddy.  Sheesh, all the royal lines and whatnot is too complicated for me.  We are starting to see cracks in cabal with the recent "suicides", that is why people are starting to talk about who else might be 'depressed'...Seinfeld's name is popping up.  The man has $900 million.  Incredible wealth...and talks about human flesh.  Who knows.  The elite seemed steeped in weird.

            It adds "Alex Jones often acts like a fool which is used to discredit people who speak out against corruption. An FBI report right off the FBI’s website details John Trowbridge as a member of the New York Buffalo’s chapter of the Royal Order of Jesters and he was involved with transporting prostitutes to a Kentucky Jester Lodge and there were also admitted fellow Jesters also involved."

             "The Imperial House of Ligne and House of Merode are high level criminal bloodlines. The House of Merode have a bat on their coat of arms. They are like vampires that drink adrenaline filled blood and go into what they call “euphoric” intoxicated states. The Catholic Church uses wine as a metaphor for blood. Prince Florent de Merode of France is a winemaker and many of these French and Italian winemakers are processing adrenochrome into their wine."

               My interest in Belgian Illuminati stems from the Dutroux affair, but I wasn't able to find any allegation of any connection between these houses and Dutroux on the web.

               I like to check out wild allegations, and what could be wilder than adrenochrome wine. Overall I'm not buying the adrenochrome theory. Apparently it's easy to synthesize without having to ensanguinate anybody.

               "you can buy Adrenochrome online in it's pure form - it's not controlled because it's NOT RECREATIONAL"
              </p>
              <p>
               ...according to PhreeX of bluelight.org, at least. Rather than assessing PhreeX or bluelight's crediblity I prefer to investigate these 'facts' on their own merit.

              <p>
               In info that came out after the Jimmy Saville case it has been alleged, without proof of course, by anonymous sources, that Sir Anthony Blount would strange boys for high level pedophiles while the rapist would orgasm. I believe perverts actually do this to chickens. This works on a purely physical level, could be seen as some sort of psychic vampirism, and something like this seems more plausible to me than making a beverage to enjoy later.

               Freaky...Alfred Dreyfus was the one accused of sharing military secrets with the Germans and this is known as the “Dreyfus Affair.” The family claimed Anti-Semitism as their defense for the accusations which Alfred Dreyfus was later cleared of. If Anti-Semitism was so powerful a force in France then why were some of the wealthiest families in France Jews like the Dreyfus, Javal, Fould, and Rothschild families and why do they continue to exist with their wealth? Why did the Dreyfus family move their company to the Netherlands which is ruled by the House of Orange who were literal Nazis?
              </p>
              <p>
               Julia Louis Dreyfus is the daughter of the deceased businessman Gerard Louis-Dreyfus who was worth about 3.4 billion. The reason these connections with the Nazis and fake Anti-Semitism is important is because the Dreyfus family fund Nazi style persecution and I have been a victim of their relentless persecution carried out by satanic Wiccan cults and other groups. Julia Louis Dreyfus is the highest level witch in the US and involved in drinking the blood of children. Julia Louis Dreyfus threatened to murder members of my family and three of my relatives have been murdered. The Dreyfus family carry out this persecution under orders from the House of Orange and House of Bonaparte and in return are allowed to be wealthy. They use their banking connections with the Bank for International Settlements, BlackRock Investment, along with their personal wealth to fund satanic cults.

            The Shriners are proud of their charitable work with children (hospitals, etc.) The Jesters are a subgroup, ostensibly organized just to have fun. It's been known now for years that the fun can include sex with prostitutes, including underage teens.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would think if Seinfeld or Carrey were Shriners that would be known publically. If they were associated with the Jesters I'd think that would be out there, from before the scandals about the Jesters.

            I haven't found anything so far, except for this same information (and this thread; that's kind of freaky).

             The actor who played Kramer on the Seinfeld show is a famous Shriner (not necessarily therefore a Jester). It's all over the web. You'd think if Seinfeld were also known to be a Shriner it would be mentioned as readily.

             I clicked on your link yesterday but missed the tiny text including Seinfeld, Letterman, Colbert, and Seth Myers. (Hmm, certainly comedians seem to have an undue influence and undue riches in our society, most of them aren't even funny.) The PayPal founders too (wow Musk had a bad complexion back in the day)!
            </p>

             The Seinfeld/Colbert does go to support the OP from a different angle.

             I hope more high level names associated with NXIVM do come out. So far, to me, the whole scam just seems like it was to benefit Rainiere's sex perversions and lifestyle, with the collateral effect of gathering 'compromise' information useful to intelligence agencies.
