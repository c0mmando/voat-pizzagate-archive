<p>Vincent Christopher was the founder of Fazbear Entertainment and creator of all the animatronics featured in Fazbear Entertainment. He had 2 sons named Max and Cameron. Max was very sensitive and would cry easily. Cameron bullied him because of this. Vincent, being the creator of the animatronics, usually kept some of the animatronics in his house. Cameron bullied Max by putting on one of his dad\'s animatronic masks and scaring him. However, Cameron quickly regretted being a bully on Max\'s 10th birthday party, Max had his party at Fredbear\'s Family Diner, and was injured by an animatronic because Cameron and his friends shoved him into the animatronics mouth. The animatronics SpringLocks loosened and &quot;bit&quot; Max, crushing his skull. The doctor had to perform a lobotomy in order for him to survive. And he did.</p>
<p>Max was mysteriously was found dead in front of Freddy Fazbear\'s Pizza (1987) a month later. Leaving only Vincent, and Cameron left in the family. This made Vincent almost give up with Fazbear Entertainment. But after 10 years, he wanted to make another restaurant to honor the death of his son. So he created Freddy Fazbear\'s Pizza in 1997. Even if it had a lower budget than the 1987 Freddy\'s had, he tried to make it as safe of a place as possible, so no one gets hurt. But after 6 years, 5 children went missing inside the pizzeria, and then less people started to come. Vincent was forced to shut the restaurant down in 2003. The next day, Vincent was not in the house. Nobody was able to find him, and Cameron moved into his mothers house until he grew up to be 19. This has made many people believe that all the restaurants Fazbear Entertainment has created to be haunted. (Which was the inspiration of Fazbear\'s Fright) Specifically the 1997 Freddy Fazbear\'s Pizza, which has remained longer than Fredbear\'s, the other Freddy\'s, or Fazbear\'s Fright. Even though it is closed.</p>

            Interesting how the small size is completely sold out. Really? Is it normal for it to be so popular to dress up a young child with this disgusting pizza horror puzzle game theme.

            After searching into this further it became apparent that this is a wide-spread phenomenon (~ 500k google hits for Freddy Fazbear Pizza, many are websites with their own set of high quality fake data). This didn't happen by accident, there is serious power involved - in my opinion it is tied into the same themes of Pizzagate (pedophilia, murder and possibly cannibalism), it is being pushed out by the world administrators. A lot of the types of people who are promoting and supporting "fake" Freddy Fazbear Pizza data are the types to be involved with pedophilia - the network of families that appear "normal" in outward appearance yet are in reality crypto-satanists who routinely offer their children for sexual abuse and possibly sacrifice. People didn't decide to start running with this on their own - phone calls were made, combined with mind-control networks that push this and other "fads" out into the world reality.

            I don't know much about FNAF that I couldn't learn from the unofficial FNAF wiki (I don't like the gameplay but find the lore interesting,) but I can find no proof that the third site you linked is even an official site for the game. It could easily be a fan site given how popular the game is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back when we were on Reddit, I was dismissive of FNAF as Pizzagate evidence as were most people, and I still don't think there's anything here.

             I'm not sure either, I started doing some searches for more data and found that website. If it's not part of the game, it's still interesting because the tone and style of the messages don't seem to be very "funny". They also don't necessarily seem to be very specific to the game itself. Here are some coupons for pizza, "we don't have pizza"!? I know people can be weird, but the chances of their language happening to practically verbatim coincide with pizzagate details I think warrants more investigating.

             Here is a Facebook site, that's pretty weird.

             I found the address on Google maps and it's a house. A bunch of posters made weird comments like this one from some asian lady: 
"Wenchel D Bais this my story about freddy fazbears pizza why he is close on1998 there was a bite of 87 is real purple guy that killed animatronics of freddy bonnie chica foxy just like that bite of 87 is real i know map of freddy fazbears pizza it is hughesville pennsylvania 726 pa 405 scott how he make five nights at freddys game someone telling freddyfazbears pizza real"
            </p>
            <p>
             "I know map of freddy fazbears pizza"? "how he make five nights at freddys game someone telling freddyfazbears pizza real"??  You may think she's some type of quack yet check out her own personal Facebook page, she studied at a University she seems well put-together, apparently has a family and takes vacations:

            The Safe Room is a secret room within Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. According to both the phone calls and minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 3, there was a "Safe Room" that was hidden from the cameras and was invisible to animatronics. This room ended up being covered with a false wall, due to what was presumably budget restrictions. According to the map of the minigames in between nights in the third game, this room is right next to the Restrooms, near the entrance.
