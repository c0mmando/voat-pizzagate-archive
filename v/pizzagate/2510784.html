<h1>Secret mission: A child</h1>
<h2>NXIVM is years into project &quot;Rainbow Cultural Garden,&quot; an intensive effort to raise potential</h2>
<hr />
<p>By JAMES M. ODATO Capitol bureau Published 1:00 am, Sunday, July 25, 2010</p>
<hr />
<p>ALBANY -- The boy is 3 years old. He lives with a 40-year-old woman who is not his biological mother. And he is the first-ever enrollee in a unique educational project.</p>
<p>He is Gaelen, and he is being raised by Kristin Keeffe, a devotee of the secretive enterprise called NXIVM. It isn\'t clear where the child came from.</p>
<p>The boy has become part of a unique program begun by self-improvement organization NXIVM founder Keith Raniere called the &quot;Rainbow Cultural Garden&quot; aimed at helping youngsters master several languages. As a result, the child has been under the care of a number of different nannies, some from foreign nations, each using one of five different languages.</p>
<p>Barbara Bouchey, who worked within NXIVM\'s intellectual inner circle for nine years, handled financial matters for the organization\'s biggest benefactors, Seagrams heiresses Clare and Sara Bronfman. In an interview last week, Bouchey revealed that the boy came to the NXIVM associates around March 2007, shortly after his birth.</p>
<p>Barbara Jeske, a high-ranking NXIVM student, Bouchey recalled, declared that the boy\'s grandfather in Michigan gave up the boy after his daughter had died shortly after the child was born. Jeske and Keeffe traveled to the Ann Arbor, Mich., area to get the boy two days later and brought back the child to live with Jeske, Bouchey said. Yet, after about two months he was transferred from Jeske\'s home in Clifton Park to Keeffe\'s residence a short distance away but much closer to Raniere.</p>

<h2>NXIVM \'sex lair\' in Halfmoon targeted in FBI raid</h2>
<p>Authorities say woman was a victim of sex trafficking at the home</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>By Brendan J. Lyons Updated 7:09 am, Friday, April 6, 2018</sup></p>
<hr />
<p>A Halfmoon townhouse raided by the FBI last week was dubbed &quot;The Library&quot; by NXIVM leader Keith Raniere, who had allegedly used the residence for years as his private sex lair, according to court records and interviews with people familiar with the residence.</p>
<p>The nondescript townhouse on Hale Drive, in the Knox Woods residential development, is a short walk from the small residence where Raniere lived for more than 15 years before he abruptly flew to Mexico last fall — after he became the target of an intensive federal criminal investigation.</p>
<p>The Hale Drive residence, which has a hot tub and a large bed on the second floor, was searched by the FBI around the same time the nearby residence of NXIVM co-founder Nancy Salzman was raided on March 27. Property records indicate the Hale Drive residence has been owned since 2004 by a now-inactive corporation, Executive Housing &amp; Properties, which lists Salzman as its chief executive officer. The corporation\'s address, 455 New Karner Road in Albany, is also the location of NXIVM\'s headquarters.</p>
<p>The FBI\'s searches took place two days after Raniere, the leader of NXIVM, was arrested by Mexican federal police at a $10,000-a-week villa in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Raniere was with some of his most devoted female followers when he was taken into custody. Federal agents later brought Raniere to a federal courthouse in Fort Worth, Texas, where he appeared on a criminal complaint charging him with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit forced labor.~~</p>
<p>~~In the federal criminal complaint filed against Raniere, prosecutors said the residence known as the Library is where Raniere, 57, repeatedly had sex with an unidentified actress in her 30s. Raniere is accused of illegally coercing the woman into becoming part of a secretive slave-master sex club associated with NXIVM.</p>
<p>The federal criminal complaint alleges that Raniere formed the group in which numerous women said they were lured into joining the club by other female members of NXIVM. They were required to provide some sort of collateral — such as nude photographs or damning information about their pasts — that leaders of the club threatened would be released if they failed to follow instructions or tried to leave the group, authorities said.</p>
<p>Some of the women have said they were also pressured to have sex with Raniere, while others told federal authorities that a female doctor associated with NXIVM, Danielle Roberts, used a cauterizing iron to brand them with a design on their lower abdomen that contained the initials of Raniere and Allison Mack, an actress and NXIVM associate who is listed in the complaint as an unnamed co-conspirator.</p>
<p>The Hale Drive townhouse is where federal authorities say the unidentified actress, who is listed as &quot;Jane Doe 1&quot; in the criminal complaint, became a victim of sex trafficking and forced labor. The actress lived in Brooklyn during the time she was an allegedly a victim of Raniere\'s — which is part of the reason the case is being pursued by the U.S. Attorney\'s office in the Eastern District of New York, which includes the borough.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges Mack, who is identified only as &quot;Co-Conspirator 1,&quot; recruited the actress to join the secret club in February 2016, including making her provide &quot;collateral&quot; that consisted of &quot;letters detailing false and highly damning accusations against her family members.&quot;</p>
<p>According to an FBI affidavit, the actress was required to provide more collateral, including turning over her credit card numbers to Mack. The actress also was ordered by Mack to travel to Halfmoon every week, and remain celibate for six months.</p>
<p>During one of her trips to Halfmoon, the actress said Mack instructed her to meet Raniere in the middle of the night near his residence. He allegedly instructed the actress to remove her clothing, placed a blindfold over her eyes and drove her around. Once he stopped the vehicle, they walked through some woods to a shack where the actress said she was tied to a table and forced to engage in sex with an unidentified person who was in the room with Raniere.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, according to an FBI affidavit, Raniere had repeated sexual contact with the actress at the Hale Drive townhouse.~~</p>

<p>[2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_Mack">wiki: Allison Mack</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Legal issues</h1>
<p>In 2010, Mack was reported to have been recruited to the Vancouver chapter of the alleged cult NXIVM along with her Smallville co-star Kristin Kreuk.[16] In a 2003 article from Forbes, advocates of NXIVM portrayed it as an organization focused on inspirational executive coaching, &quot;like a practical M.B.A.,&quot; while detractors accused the founder Keith Raniere of running &quot;a cult-like program aimed at breaking down his subjects psychologically.&quot;[17] The co-founder of the Vancouver chapter reported in a 2017 The New York Times exposé that she had been branded in an initiation ceremony under the supervision of a top NXIVM official.[18]</p>
<p>Mack was arrested by the FBI in Brooklyn on April 20, 2018, on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. According to prosecutors, Mack, who ranked directly below Raniere in a pyramid scheme called DOS, recruited female slaves for him, and forced women to have sex with him under threat of having damaging information about them released, in exchange for what were described as &quot;financial and other benefits&quot;.[19] She faces 15 years-to-life in prison.</p>

            A Halfmoon townhouse raided by the FBI last week was dubbed "The Library" by NXIVM leader Keith Raniere, who had allegedly used the residence for years as his private sex lair, according to court records and interviews with people familiar with the residence.

            The complaint alleges Mack, who is identified only as "Co-Conspirator 1," recruited the actress to join the secret club in February 2016, including making her provide "collateral" that consisted of "letters detailing false and highly damning accusations against her family members."
           </p>
           <p>
            According to an FBI affidavit, the actress was required to provide more collateral, including turning over her credit card numbers to Mack. The actress also was ordered by Mack to travel to Halfmoon every week, and remain celibate for six months.
           </p>
           <p>
            During one of her trips to Halfmoon, the actress said Mack instructed her to meet Raniere in the middle of the night near his residence. He allegedly instructed the actress to remove her clothing, placed a blindfold over her eyes and drove her around. Once he stopped the vehicle, they walked through some woods to a shack where the actress said she was tied to a table and forced to engage in sex with an unidentified person who was in the room with Raniere.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the months that followed, according to an FBI affidavit, Raniere had repeated sexual contact with the actress at the Hale Drive townhouse.~~

            In 2010, Mack was reported to have been recruited to the Vancouver chapter of the alleged cult NXIVM along with her Smallville co-star Kristin Kreuk.[16] In a 2003 article from Forbes, advocates of NXIVM portrayed it as an organization focused on inspirational executive coaching, "like a practical M.B.A.," while detractors accused the founder Keith Raniere of running "a cult-like program aimed at breaking down his subjects psychologically."[17] The co-founder of the Vancouver chapter reported in a 2017 The New York Times exposé that she had been branded in an initiation ceremony under the supervision of a top NXIVM official.[18]
           </p>
           <p>
            Mack was arrested by the FBI in Brooklyn on April 20, 2018, on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. According to prosecutors, Mack, who ranked directly below Raniere in a pyramid scheme called DOS, recruited female slaves for him, and forced women to have sex with him under threat of having damaging information about them released, in exchange for what were described as "financial and other benefits".[19] She faces 15 years-to-life in prison.

            <p>
             A doctor described as the resident physician to the twisted upstate sex cult Nxivm has been charged by a state oversight board with illegally conducting human experiments.
            </p>
            <p>
             The action comes eight months after the state Health Department refused to act on a complaint from a former cult member who alleged that Dr. Brandon Porter, 44, forced her to watch disturbing rape and dismemberment videos for a “fright study” he was conducting.

               “He continued to film my reaction for at least 10 minutes as I just sat there, dry heaving like I was going to puke and crying very hard,” Kobelt, a Canadian actress, said in the complaint to the Health Department, adding that Porter began showing her the violent images without warning.

               “He failed me, not only as a friend but as the medical practitioner I had trusted on numerous occasions with my health while I was in New York,” Kobelt said in the complaint.

              <em>
               In a Sept. 6, 2017, letter, the state Office of Professional Medical Conduct told Kobelt it would not investigate Porter, adding that “the issues you have described are not medical misconduct.”

               But the OMPC has now accused Porter of moral unfitness, gross negligence and gross incompetence among other charges. He is accused of showing “human subjects an actual video of the horrific and brutal murders and dismemberment of four women by machetes; and violent film clips, including a male African American being viciously stomped by a Nazi; a conscious male being forced to eat a portion of his own brain matter; and a graphic gang rape.”

               He is also charged with violating state law for improperly conducting studies on obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette’s syndrome and one monitoring the brain waves of those who attended Nxivm programs.

              <em>
               The state also slapped him for not reporting to health officials that many of the attendees, including children, at a 2016 Nxivm event became ill with an infectious illness that produced flu-like symptoms, vomiting and diarrhea.
              </em>
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             A hearing on the charges is scheduled for June 27. If the charges are substantiated, Porter could have his medical license revoked or suspended.
            </p>
            <p>
             Porter, an internist, resigned from St. Peter’s Hospital in Albany last fall and reportedly fled town. He received his medical degree from the University of Iowa and got his New York medical license in 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
             The state Health Department would not comment on the OPMC’s action and Kobelt declined to comment. Porter did not return a request for comment.

                I do this more than healthy minded people because I am a treasure hunter. In 1100 and something England started making Ireland pay taxes. Before then they did not have last names and spoke Gaelic. That is one key. The other key is hidden in most history books, and that is the story of the Phoenicians. Their main city was Tyre in what is now Turkey I believe(edit Lebanon). These seafarers traveled right up the coast to Ireland, nefarious for slave trading or anything else tradable. Major traders in Africa, not only for the wealth, but the great seaports to get to the other wealth. Think Tripoly, Libya.

                 I've put some time into looking into Irish/Gaelic history, but, so far it hasn't been a huge priority - my looking into Scientology and NXIVM, certainly changed that.

                 Doesn't surprise me that Turkey, Africa and Libya are 'connected' via slave trading and etc.

                 If I was a fucking enemy here, an enemy of Trump and those trying to fix the corruption, Trump/Q/Anonymous would have "shut [me] down", LONG ago. I've even walked myself into my local police department(sometime at the end of last year - maybe the year before now, I forget) and have pointed them directly to who I am here - so, no doubt, they see every bullshit accusation against me - including the cunts who accuse me of being a fucking pedo/cannibal.

                  Actually said that in jest because I see the same bickering on other sites and it gets old. This Egyptian thing with the satanists is glossed over by all but a few Egyptologists. Hyrkanians came into the upper kingdom and married into the original royalty. Akenaton's father was half Hyrkanian, and a snake worshipper. Described as light skinned, hook nosed fierce warriors, the Hyrkanians were expelled from Egypt for defiling the ancient temples and gods. That is the exodus in the Bible where they were put to the wilderness of Caanan, then invaded the Phoenicians a couple of hundred years later. It was only after much shapeshifting, and more expulsians, that they became the Khazars. They never abandoned the Egyptian mysteries or the Moloch/Baal worship. The Kurds are a lost tribe of the same group. Proof was found of their travels in the Atlas mountains, where travelers found black Africans wearing kilts and playing a musical instrument that closely resembles bagpipes. Their language contains words considered proto-Gaelic.

                   Inaccurate to call them "Satanists", Satanism was not 'defined' until very recently. The practices referred to in relation to the ancient egyptians are, well, they're morbid as fuck but it was simply the way of the times(not to be too simplistic, just pointing out that it was 'normal' practise of dominance and control - eg: skullfucking).

                   "defiling" according to whom? These are stories retold time and time again over thousands of years - it's as likely as anything else, that much of this is propaganda designed to maintain control after said exodus.

                    (1) I was shortening things for time, and calling them Satanists, because by Biblical reference they have many names, and that is the recent American term. (2) "Defiling" meaning announcing to the kingdom that he was the son of the sun god and all those old gods that they worshiped were pretty much just cast to the side (bad day for the people who devoted their life to religion). That was the start of monotheism, and well documented by other ancient historians. As far as your, "these are stories told time after time for thousands of years", No, these were written in stone and translated from the Rosetta stone. Aramaic is the preferred language to learn before attempting to read Egyptian Hieroglyphics. A means academic?

                     Right, and how many people know about the original stories and what would have been destroyed elsewhere breaking up the story. That's why there's so much confusion about the origins of the mass-scale corruption and theft/misappropriation of that knowledge - leading to the fear based anti-Satanism propaganda. I'm referring to the backwards shit people are told, because it's easy to blame on Satanism.

                      I will be the first to admit that many things have been faked on purpose in Egyptology (Vyse and the great pyramids comes to mind). What I am talking about is the direct obfuscation and purposeful distraction of a very small but world changing part of history, and how it relates to now/Pizzagate. They are inseparable. I have only taught myself computer after Obama won so I am not sure of the controversy of a double sided mouse or the relevance. This must be on another thread?

             Zapatista uprising

            <p>
             On January 1, 1994, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, EZLN) issued their first declaration from the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico. The date coincides with the date that NAFTA came into force. Salinas immediate response works for a peaceful solution: offers pardon to deposed arms; orders cease fire; appointed the peace negotiator and send Mexican Congress a General Amnesty Law.

             ~~He negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with the United States and Canada. Critics say that NAFTA has had mixed results for Mexico: while there has been huge increase in commerce and foreign investment, this hasn't been at all the case for employment and salaries.[32] Salinas also renegotiated Mexico's foreign debt.

            <p>
             Alejandro Junco de la Vega was born August 28, 1948, in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. He is a distinguished Mexican journalist. He earned his bachelor's degree in Journalism from the University of Texas at Austin in 1969.
            </p>
            <p>
             He worked in the newsroom and occupied different management positions at the “EL NORTE” newspaper in Monterrey and, in 1970, teaming with U.S. journalism professors, created Mexico’s first school of journalism to battle the flaws that plagued the profession. El Norte’s journalism courses successfully raised the journalistic standards in the newsroom to a new level and were the cornerstones for the growth of what has become Grupo Reforma.
            </p>
            <p>
             He became publisher of El Norte in 1973, and under his leadership the paper has garnered a number of major awards for Journalistic Merit, both at the national and international level.
            </p>
            <p>
             In November, 1993, he launched the REFORMA newspaper in Mexico City,[1] which today ranks number one among readers in the nation’s capital.
            </p>
            <p>
             On November 20, 1998, he unveiled MURAL in Guadalajara, Jalisco, which has also become the leader in that city.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under his leadership, the Metro dailies were also founded. These morning papers offer information to readers favoring a tabloid format. Today, Metro dailies are published in Monterrey, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Toluca, and Puebla.
            </p>
            <p>
             Grupo Reforma has been a cyberspace pioneer. Its reforma, elnorte, and mural.com websites are indisputable leaders in their fields. In addition, Grupo Reforma’s information is downloadable via attractive, user-friendly Apps available on devices like the iPhone, iPad, or Blackberry.
            </p>
            <p>
             Grupo Reforma is the largest newspaper consortium in Mexico, both in circulation and advertising revenues.~~

            <h2>
             Source: Former Mexican President Carlos Salinas unhappy with son, Emiliano’s role in ESP
            </h2>
            <p>
             September 20, 2017
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             A source tells Frank Report that Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the 69-year old former president of Mexico, has distanced himself from his eldest son, Emiliano Salinas, 41.
            </p>
            <p>
             Carlos reportedly disapproves of his son’s role in Executive Success Programs (ESP).
            </p>
            <p>
             Emiliano has been a member of ESP’s Executive Board since 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
             His father is said to actively tell friends not to join ESP, according to our source.
            </p>
            <p>
             Father and son have been “mildly estranged” for more than 15 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shortly after joining ESP, Emiliano discovered, through ESP technology, that his father was an obstruction in the path of his personal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
             His father’s money and political influence, however, could be still utilized to help create “a more noble civilization.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Conversely, Carlos Salinas was said to be worried his son’s reputation in Mexico might suffer a setback since ESP appeared to be a bloodsucking, money grabbing cult.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recent revelations about DOS – a secret offshoot of ESP – seems to support the elder Salinas’ view.
            </p>
            <p>
             DOS is a blackmail, extortion, and sex trafficking scheme hatched by ESP founder, Keith Raniere, who prefers to be called by his  self-given childhood superhero name  of “Vanguard”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Emiliano has spent the better part of 15 years following Vanguard and working in his service. He co-founded the Mexico City Center of ESP with Alejandro ‘Alex’ Betancourt.~~
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to co-owning the Mexico City Center, Emiliano co-owns the ESP Guadalajara Center and the now-defunct ESP Los Angeles Center.
            </p>
            <p>
             Emiliano’s mother and sister are also in ESP.
            </p>
            <p>
             Carlos Salinas divorced Emiliano’s mother, Maria Cecilia Yolanda Occelli Gonzalez, soon after leaving the presidency. He served from 1988 to 1994.
            </p>
            <p>
             Carlos later married Ana Paula Virginia Gerard Rivero. He has three children with each wife.
            </p>
            <p>
             Emiliano’s sister, Cecilia, also earned the High Rank of Green Sash. Their mother is less active. Sources say she is unhappy that her son is involved with a group that is branding women on their pubic area and holding blackmail material to coerce their silence.

             In November 2017, Kreuk and her Smallville co-star Allison Mack were linked to a multi-level marketing organization known as NXIVM, which was founded by Keith Raniere. Upon accusations that Mack and Raniere engaged in sex trafficking, as well as branding female members of the organization, it was reported that both Mack and Kreuk were within NXIVM's "inner circle" and actively recruiting women into the group. In March 2018, following Raniere's arrest, Kreuk disclosed on her Twitter account that she had joined the group in 2005, but had left it by 2012, and was not in contact with any members of the group, nor had she witnessed any illegal activities.[35]

            <p>
             Due to the notoriety of the cult (also known as DOS), it emerged that Mack joined the group alongside fellow Smallville star Kristin Kreuk, who took to Twitter on Thursday to break her silence about her involvement in the group, refuting rumours that she was involved in recruiting young women in the cult.

             According to Kreuk — now starring in CBC drama “Burden of Truth” —  she was 23 when she took what she understood to be a “self-help/personal growth course that helped me handle my previous shyness, which is why I continued with the program.”
            </p>
            <p>
             However, the Vancouver-born actress maintains that she “left about five years ago and had minimal contact with those were were still involved,” and says that “accusations that I was in the ‘inner circle’ or recruited women as ‘sex slaves’ are blatantly false.”

            </p>
            <p>
             Kreuk’s version of events has been backed up by actress Sarah Edmonson, who co-starred with Kreuk in Vancouver-shot teen drama Edgemont, who wrote on Twitter that Kreuk “never recruited sex slaves and has been out since 2013 before s**t got weird. She is a lovely person who should not be dragged into this mess.”

             ~~"Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere,” said U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. “The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit. This office and our law enforcement partners are committed to prosecuting predators who victimize others through sex trafficking and forced labor.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mack, an actress who is best known for her role in the television series "Smallville," which ended in 2015, had initially been listed in a federal criminal complaint as Raniere's unidentified co-conspirator.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to people familiar with NXIVM, Mack joined the organization about a decade ago, around the same time several other young actresses were pulled into its ranks, including Nicki Clyne, Grace Park and Kristin Kreuk, who recruited Mack. Kreuk left NXIVM several years ago — before the slave-sex club was allegedly formed by Raniere — and has denounced the practices made public recently.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mack was with Raniere in Mexico when he was taken into custody on March 25 by Mexican federal police officers, who arrested Raniere at the request of U.S. law enforcement authorities.~~

             ~~It can be difficult to disentangle the facts of Raniere’s life from the sometimes cringeinducing hagiography presented on NXIVM websites. The son of a New York City adman and a mother who taught ballroom dancing, he grew up in the bedroom community of Suffern, N.Y. His father, James, has said he exhibited early athletic gifts, tying the New York high school record for the 100-yard dash and becoming East Coast judo champ at 12. Home movies show a young boy in martial-arts garb dominating his opponents with quiet, unfussy aggression. He arrived in the Albany area at 16 or so—about the time his mother died—to attend the well-regarded Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.~~

             ~~More than one NXIVM apostate or former business associate has wound up in court, and then filed for bankruptcy. When Toni Natalie, a Raniere intimate, left NXIVM in 1999, Raniere sent her passages of John Milton’s Paradise Lost-a seminal NXIVM text— with notations comparing himself to Jesus and Natalie to Lucifer. “I was the chosen one,” she says. “I was brought in to bear the child that would change the world.” Natalie later filed for bankruptcy—Raniere was a creditor, in an ordeal that lasted over eight years and which a judge ultimately complained “smacks of a jilted fellow’s attempt at revenge, with many attempts at tripping her up along the way.” Critics say NXIVM’s workshops, which cost US$6,000 for a 16-day “intensive,” use 14-hour days, warm rooms and protein-poor meals to push newcomers into a psychologically pliable state. They point to the handful of people who have suffered breakdowns while pursuing the NXIVM curriculum, including an Alaskan who in 2003 paddled a canoe to the centre of a lake and drowned herself. “I was brainwashed and my emotional center of the brain was killed/turned off,” she wrote before her death. Yet even former Nexians with good reason to distance themselves from the group say such reports fail to reflect how effective Raniere’s program can be in raising self-esteem and erasing anxieties, and stress that good, intelligent people often stay with the program. Says a former member who admits she spent US$90,000 on workshops over 10 years: “I will never regret it.”

             Yet, in an eerie echo of Consumers’ Buyline, high-ranking Nexians can earn over US$100,000 a year enrolling new recruits, former members say. Those high rollers increasingly live outside Albany, where bad press has led to the group’s decline in numberes there. Focus has now shifted to NXIVM’s outposts in Mexico and in Vancouver, where it has made inroads recruiting TV actors, including Smallville cast members Allison Mack and Kristin Kreuk, and Battlestar Galáctica’s Nicki Clyne. Vancouver boasts 133 active members. NXIVM’s success there is puzzling given the amount of negative reporting on the group available online.

             Former Nexians, meanwhile, say Raniere has become increasingly eccentric. Five years ago, he invited a Mexican family to Albany, where they worked as videographers and documented his every move—whether he was pronouncing on some aspect of his philosophy or merely playing volleyball. A more professional crew of Nexian filmmakers has since taken over these duties. He is also said to encourage his lovers to remain thin, going so far as to prescribe foods; fat, he tells his intimates, disturbs his subtle energies.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was chiefly his philandering that, 14 months ago, led to the mass defection of nine well-placed NXIVM members. One of those, Bouchey, is a one-time Raniere intimate who, as a former executive, is the highest-ranking Nexian to ever leave. For Raniere, hers is likely an unhappy departure. It was her deposition that contained the allegations he gambled away US$65 million of the Bronfmans’ money trading commodities—a loss so deep, according to the Bouchey deposition, that the sisters at one point had to borrow money against a trust they do not receive until Edgar’s death. Speaking to the Albany Times Union, Robert Crockett, one of the sisters’ attorneys, demurred, saying the two women, and not Raniere, made the commodities investments. Clare and Sara, meanwhile, are suing Yuri Plyam, Raniere’s former broker and their partner in the L.A. development project, for embezzling money (Plyam, in turn, has countersued).

             Raniere does not appear to live lavishly. His home, a blue-beige townhouse in suburban Albany, is modest. He does not drive and apostates say he owns no fancy cars. He does not travel outside upstate New York or wear expensive suits. In the house next door lives Gaelen, a three-year-old boy whose upbringing he is said to oversee. Sources say that under his direction five nannies, each with a different mother tongue, arrive one after the other to care for the boy, who eats a diet of nuts and berries and is allowed no contact with other children.~~
