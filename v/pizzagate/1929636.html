<p><strong>SUMMATION:</strong>  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know that United States of America has a alternative Internet called Internet2... Internet2 was created by 34 university research institutions in 1996, when the commercial and non-commercial branches of the Internet’s evolutionary tree split off and went their separate ways...Internet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government. Internet2 headquarters are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with offices in Washington, D.C. and Emeryville, California.... The Internet2 backbone is an Infinera-based optical network that delivers up to 400Gbps of wavelength capacity. The network is operated in partnership with Level 3 Communications. And <strong>Juniper routers</strong> are used to create multiple 10 Gigabit Ethernet links between nine core nodes around the country.</p>

              I'm still scratching my head, as well. Which is why I asked the OP for clarification. The lack thereof is a sign this is probably disinfo meant to stir us up.

            These back doors have existed since the days of the telegraph, essentially.  The Black Chamber, headed by Henry Yardley, was the predecessor to the Army Signals Agency and eventually the NSA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Black Chamber eavesdropped on the League of Nations (predecessor to the UN) meeting in the 30's in SF to gain advantage during trade negotiations.  This was done by backroom deals with Western Union, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            This eventually migrated to not just deals with the service providers, but also hardware manufacturers.  The massive ATT building in NYC = NSA.  Google server farms = NSA.  The list goes on.  There is a reason why the data center in Bluffdale was built - they needed to process and store the data of EVERYTHING.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would also be beneficial for those not schooled in the history of SIGINT to read up on Echelon.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Internet 2 is not the same as the "deep" or "dark" web.  I2 uses a different transport protocol (IPv6 I think) and is a research network between its' creators and other entities who have the need to pass very large datasets back and forth in near real time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The deep/dark web is still the same "Internet" that we know and love, it just exists in a different, less controlled manner without all of the constraints of the "Internet".
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding CPP - I remember seeing the original server file logs back last fall.  Someone also had claimed to have seen CP in the files.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, I don't know about you, but I cannot proffer one reasonable explanation why a single-location pizza joint would have the need to have any type of PC/server hosting files on premises.  Again, 30k foot thinking - I'll leave the arguments as to the directory structure and other BS diversions for the shills and autists to hash out.
           </p>
           <p>
            What may be entirely possible though, is that there are entities on I2 which may be involved in the NWO/DS/PG cabal and use the resources and relative privacy of the network to move video; customer orders; manage the business, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ponder this - if you ran the multi-billion dollar US franchise of the NWO, to include human trafficking operations, I would think you would need a little more computing power than some POS Acer in a pizza joint or a little black book.  Where would you keep your enterprise apps, files, and content safely and away from prying eyes?

            I mostly agree with this post. There's only one thing I've got an issue with and that the computer Edgar Welch shot by accident.

            Yes there were suspicious looking files in a private download area. At first I was totally convinced they were some sort of child porn secret download. And they may still be I don't know. As I learned more about Brownstones and Psy-ops my opinion of that server and what it held changed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I wonder if those files were part of the psy-op as well. Maybe they were intended to be found, downloaded and cracked into. As far as I know no one has hacked into them. Again they could be child porn but my gut's telling me there would be sort of a

            Double Data Encryption
"... a privacy solution that sends users’ Internet traffic through two VPN servers. The double encryption may not be necessary if you simply want to unblock services that are inaccessible in your location, like WhatsApp or media content. However, in cases where high level of anonymity matters, DoubleVPN can be extremely useful.
Usually, when a user connects to the internet, the traffic travels from A (user) to B (destination). With a VPN, it first passes through a VPN server where it gets encrypted, so the connection is A – VPN Server – B."

            Clinton's server's purpose was for her and her family's emai and she is used for work emails as well.   Whether or not that's acceptable to you, doesn't matter. That's what it was.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her work emails were only released because of the controversy of keeping a private server and not making them available as government records.  The government/courts do not have any rights to her personal emails.  These are the only emails we should expect to see.
           </p>
           <p>
            COMET PING PONG:  Where's your proof this computer was a server?  What entitles you to see the content of this computer.   It's a private citizen's and a crime victims's at that.   Upon what basis are you so arrogantly asking to see the data of a private citizen?
           </p>
           <p>
            DNC SERVERS:  Again, this is a private organization what gives you the right to expect to see what's on here?   Also a crime victims as their emails were stolen as part of a massive campaign to interfere in the election.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we have the right to demand that we see all your computers, thumb drives, cloud storage, web history, data discs, etc?  If not, why not.   If we don't, why wouldn't this apply to other people?
           </p>
           <p>
            You know what else the public hasn't seen?   The millions of other private servers out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you have a whole bunch of claim's to invade people's privacy linked to a computer company with a girls name.

            You'd have to ask TF that...this is the first I've heard of this #Juniper/dark net port connection...but this thread is a hodge-podge of links and innuendo which is generally a disinfo tactic, so I am skeptical.

            Brilliant. 
The world's largest 'NGO' is Bangladeshi BRAC. It's registered in the Dutch Antilles for taxation purposes of course. It's a known money launderer and tax avoider. Factories in Bangladesh paying $1 per day output pushed @ 200-300 articles per day PLUS! LANDED AV COST IS ~$1.20/ITEM.  BRAC operates throughout the 3rd world and is a pet favourite of the Clintons, Soros, UN. It works the slave labour model and micro financing debt enslavement model especially with women. Monsanto works in with BRAC and the slaves, poisoning land, environment and food.

             I'm skeptical as well. The big red flare here is:

             -&gt;   Embody a virtual character.png
            </p>
            <p>
             This Juniper VPN client obviously gains access to your cam(s) if you have them on your PC, and is a given on your mobile. The lure is fun, your virtual character's face mimicking your own face.
            </p>
            <p>
             BUT, THIS is the PERFECT set-up by the Sectarian Syndicate to get a
             <em>
              real good look at your face and stuff it in their database
             </em>
             And FEMA Round-you-Up when things come to be.
            </p>
            <p>
             Secondly, before you know it you might end up with incriminating content on your computer (if even in your temporary cache files).

              I think you are off, I am 100% sure my intentions here are to expose the elite for their secret exploits, especially in places they hide their criminal activity.  Bio-Pharmaceuticals, minerals and energy are the places with the most exploits and most people are oblivious to them.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for 777 - you are wrong I am more of a 555, and that is only because I find the number 5 to be fun. That is it, no logic or intention behind me saying  555.

              or anyone. In fact I believe you are at this point. You attack anyone as Luceferian with your alleged "depth of knowledge" The only ones who jump on your side have been outed as black hat government insiders, and worse. Worry about the company you keep and let everyone make up their own mind. You are not the most brilliant one here. Everyone can reason for themselves. The stone throwers will be buried under rubble first.

               You did not answer my simple question of morality I asked you when I last replied to you. You simply ignored the post. You had your chance to show you are indisputably on the right side of history. You did not take it. Until then. I regard the concept of the closest friends to be the most vile enemies a very tangible reality. The psychological warfare is blowing across this globe full-force. Sorry if I don't give you a free-pass for just being nice and agreeing with me on some subjects.

                That is the point. I don't want your free pass. I refuse to answer your moronic question on morality. First of all I intentionally ignored it as I am doing now because it is moronic.
               </p>
               <p>
                If I was truly evil then I would in fact answer it by lying and giving you the answer you want to hear. That sort of manipulation is in fact evil but quite easy to do for those involved in psychological warfare. Sorry not interested in playing games with you or anyone. By the way my being nice or agreeing on somethings is called being a respectful human being. Do you see how I am not asking you morality questions even though you have given out an intimate knowledge of the inner workings of Luceferian worship. Maybe you should go first and explain to everyone how you know about Goathill Pizza &amp; Pineal Glands and pineapples on pizza.

                 The hypothetical question of morality is a breeze for anyone who's genuinely on the good side of things. For you see. Someone on the good side that is posed this question will NEVER choose the epitomic opposite. Not as a lie, not as a cover, not as an anything. For it equals denouncement of inner alignment and makes one a dissident to one's chosen alignment at the spiritual level. That's why everyone I posed the question so far has refused to answer it flat out without a hitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For you that means you're either going to have to admit (insta-bust) or "lie" (break allegiance with your chosen alignment and become subject to retaliation from within).

                  You keep taking me as evil or ignorant or both. Again you have know idea. You think you are so good at analyzing everyone and you are not. Everyone who challenges you is not your enemy and using big words and concepts do not make you smart. Most everyone here can do that. You live in the Netherlands, know the ins &amp; outs of Luceferian worship, pedogate, pizzagate, flat earth, aliens, etc.

                  Really you seem to be an expert on everything and feel comfortable calling others evil, uneducated, shills and whatever judgement you choose. Hopefully your bag of stones is getting lighter as you continue to unload them on anyone not agreeing with you or taking your I am God morality tests.

                   Vault 7 caused more harm then good. Further more, you again, indeed affirm you know more, just as I wrote about when I told you my side of the story when I shared my analysis on networking.

                   I am not yet calling you evil but you are not making things better either as long as you refuse to answer the little question. Nor am I God, nor do I claim to be. I'm just a fellow human that spent his lifetime figuring out stuff. The question of morality is simply a litmus test. It serves as the gateway to further conductance. If you're not pleased with that, you're free to leave it and ignore my postings here on VOAT.

               LOL. Well if it makes you feel any better I am a "NWO" shill to this guy :)  He keeps a "mental profile" of certain people he doesn't like and calls them shills. It's kind of funny. Well at least to me.

                It has nothing to do with liking. It has to do with honesty and the willingness to adapt to reason. For instance, pushing flat-earth bullshit into my mind in a subversive fashion either makes you ignorant, or willfully deceitful attempting to bank on my perceived ignorance. Especially when I had given you a means to prove yourself through a simple method that the earth is curved, if you haven't seen it with your own eyes like I did on that trans-atlantic flight.
               </p>
               <p>
                You have been doing the latter. It has nothing to do with "liking". I'm entirely analytic in my profiling.

                  The plane window is slightly convex along the lateral axis, not along the longitudinal axis. I have a go-pro. I know the fish-lens effect. I know photonics. Now go do the experiment I outlined and report back.

                 It has to do with whomever you disagree with, and not understanding that people are at different levels of learning in their lives. Doesn't make them a shill. You would do well to stop calling those you disagree with "shills." Esp by name.

                  Stating the truth as it is is no arrogance. It's just that, stating the truth firmly as it is. Spin you do not detect because you have the same momentum as the outer shell of the globe. You take up about one square metre when standing outside. The earth's circumvention is 40,000,000 metres. You're not gona see a curve. You're a spec on an elephant's butt. When you drive your car at a steady speed you do not feel yourself moving either. Same momentum as the car. Only the visuals give you the knowledge you're moving along with your car. Same principle. You sound intelligent but you are willfully failing basic physics. In the same vain, attempting to say there's no spin because you don't feel it, while the concept is provable with your own car shows that your body doesn't tell the full story. And as such, neither can you then say aliens (I hate the word) exist or not.

                    As for being able to look a little further than standard goniometric math on a circle would show is because of Earth's mass bending time-space along the circumvention of the globe, causing photons to slightly slope along with the curve and thus hit your eyes instead of going over your head. Until you increase the distance beyond this bending threshold.

                      The helicopter: No. The atmospheric mass is subject to momentum as much as surface objects at that altitude. Only very high up the stratosphere and beyond as atmospheric density decreases, atmospheric drag becomes a thing. That's what gives us the northern and southern hemisphere

                      The plane: Again, a very small object compared to the globe. Gravity counters the centrifugal force. Think tying a wooden bar to a rope in the middle and start swinging it around. Your pull keeps the wooden bar 'nosediving' without the bar actually doing the nosediving itself.

                         No, I was thinking UK. But speaking of labels, I have many dutch friends, and they will indeed argue ad infinitum. Not a label, just a fact. They also have somewhat of an impish sense of humor, and of course, they are incredibly tall (as you know). I have no ill intentions towards you AD. Take care.

              Had Killery won that would definitely apply. But she didn't win thank God. And that means the entire Deep State house of cards is coming down. Mark my words.

             <p>
              Because the second Hillary or John Podesta are arrested they'll spill the beans and turn in everyone else. Trust me. I know it's hard to believe but you need to look at the Physics of arresting so many high level perps.

              They're all lawyers so they know what a plea bargain is. When everyone's done turning state's evidence there'll be nothing left of any value.
             </p>
             <p>
              And that means tragically or fortuitously that Deplorables aren't the ones who should be worried. The mother fuckers at the very tippy top should be worried.

               Then you did not understand a single word of what I have been saying in all my posts. Because that statement is a total contradiction of what I have been sharing with people. In fact; I've proven the existence of God (in Omni-dual infinite sense) and Duality. Thus, the recognition of The Infinite and Infinite Good and Infinite Evil as a factual given, from our frame of reference. But, do not think that the Bible is the only valid work that recognizes The Infinite and Duality. There are more Omni-dual religions that recognize these elementary elements to our existence. That's the wake-up call to people.

              <p>
               In fact, that is the much harder part to grasp for those who read the Bible, "Why, if there's a God, is there evil still?", that my scientific approach has the explanation for. Without potential (force / duality), we can not be at the most elementary level. From a biblical perspective, the necessity of evil is depicted by the fact that God did introduce the Snake at the forbidden fruit. If there wasn't any intent for evil to be, God would not have introduced the Forbidden Tree/Fruit and the devilish snake.

               As far as "God is dead", I'm not a warped Talmudic Rabbi that had claimed at some point in time he 'Defeated God' and claimed victory and rule over gullible (Jewish) people. In fact. I challenced and disproved this Rabbi that made that claim. Guess who's still here and who is not. The Infinite is still giving us life; that rabbi has long been buried.

                 No worries, apology accepted. My motivation is in part to stop us (the people of this planet) from ending up in the gutter through evil doing. I live and have a life because of the effort of other people. I feel it to be my responsibility to help guiding people and bring them together despite of classic differences that have been designed to keep us bashing heads for millennia on end.

                 Rothschild for one is sitting on a pile of human effort doing nothing with it in terms of giving it back to mankind as a whole and truly make this a better place for everyone. He could be remembered as a world's hero. But likely he'll be remembered as one of the world's most vile villains. (Not singling out them Rothschilds though, just using them as an example).

                  . Something I thought was possibly true back months ago while reading your thoughts on evil. You are very aggressive with your writing and attack many who seemingly would be natural allies. Why? Do you think about the scriptural directions of how we are to offer or guide others? Through compassion &amp; grace...through mercy &amp; forgiveness. Your insight is only granted to you as a gift to be used to help others see as is mine. Everyone has their part. You are correct that evil is trying to stop the message and has to be confronted aggressively but as

                   See, that's the point. This goes well beyond scriptures and humanoids. Note I didn't write "humans"? For you see.. it's about something that transcends Earth. Just as there are the laws of physics, which, in essence are the scientific mapping of the workings of our known world, there are laws in regards to spirituality. These will hold up here on Earth, but, also beyond. It is referred to as Cosmic Law. You might want to google this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have written about this in one post on this thread already, where I talked about the absolute duality being factual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   When the time comes we will make new friends.. what are you going to do. Attempt to convert them..? As a spokesman of the Vatican recently said, Baptize them if they so want? You might be in for a surprise if you want to oppress a certain school of thought that pertains to Earthlings only and don't respect other concretes that are nonetheless still compatible with Cosmic Law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I respect anyone following their own concrete omni-dual religion so long they are on the good side of things as per Cosmic Law. In fact. It is retro-applicable to any omni-dual religion without forcing anyone to forgo theirs. That is why I have not chosen any specific concrete religion to follow because of this leveraged, trascending knowledge while respecting the same Infinite (Good) we all look at.

                  <p>
                   If we can live in unity and harmony based on such premise, this can truly become a better world. Not just today, but also tomorrow, when we are able to get off this rock, form new communities elsewhere and then, one day look back at our common home. Or, when any of us is under threat, be able to call up on each other for defense against evil.

                   Still, I see you were not going to answer the little question of morality. So, this will be my last reply until then. * write-protects his truth-tree until further notice *.

               This shit is not for the weak minded, I am no Milton Erickson and have no subversive intentions.  In-fact I wasn't aware of neuro linguistic programming or any of the work done by Bandler and Grinder.   As a scientist I totally agree with their resolve for successful communication being; "To have enough sensory experience to notice when you get the responses that you want".  I use advanced cameras every day to visualize and monitor the technologies I work with.  I am only here to shed light on the dark corners of society.

               They allow the speaker to ask more subtly and in a way that the listener can respond sometimes without consciously knowing he or she has been asked. (We do this all the time without realizing it).

               <p>
                The most often detected illegal peptides were potential dopingagents, including the growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRP-2, GHRP-6, CJC1295, sermorelin, Ipamorelin), AOD9604 and the wound healing peptide Thymosin β4. Furthermore also the skin tanning agent Melanotan II and the potential geroprotective and anti-cancer peptide Epitalon were detected.

                Recent advances in genomics, proteomics, recombinant expression technologies and peptide synthesis have led to an increased development of protein and peptide therapeutics. Unfortunately the uprising of these kinds of active pharmaceutical ingredients also goes hand in hand with an increase in the number of incidents with SFFC pharmaceuticals, including

                and substandard proteins and peptides.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Falsified biopharmaceutical injectables are frequently seized as unlabelled glass vials for injection with coloured caps shipped in small, unmarked boxes (Figure 1). Characteristically, these vials contain a white to yellowish lyophilized sugar with a peptide or a protein. Most peptides appear to be doping agents but some are used for skin tanning or libido enhancement. Users dissolve and inject the vial contents without proper instructions and without knowing what they are injecting.
               </p>
               <p>
                Three countries reported biopharmaceutical injectables. Laboratory assessments were reported for 4 of the 5 included shipments. In each case, one or two vials had been analyzed. The analyzed vials contained human growth hormone (HGH), sermorelin, and melanotan II. One lot did not contain any active ingredient. All included shipments came without any labelling or documentation. Since sterility tests were not conducted by the seizing laboratories, the microbiological quality of these products is unknown. HGH and sermorelin – a growth hormone releasing hormone analogue – are both used as doping agents. Melanotan II is known to stimulate the melanocytes and is used for sun-free skin tanning. Medical literature and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) report several serious cases of health damage caused by melanotan II in the UK.

             This brings us back to a short list of possible suspects. The biggest one is the U.S. National Security Agency. Among the documents leaked from the NSA by way of the whistleblower Edward Snowden and first disclosed by the German magazine Der Speigel was this: Feedthrough. It’s described in a catalog of devices and software used by an NSA division called ANT as a “persistence technique for two software implants … used against Juniper Netscreen Firewalls.”
