<h2>Charities say new EU regulations would stop tech firms searching out child abuse images on their platforms and reporting them to police because it would be a potential breach of paedophiles\' privacy.</h2>
<h1>Unlike the new laws on data, there are no exemptions in the proposed EU regulations (European Privacy Regulations (EPR)) that would allow investigators to override the rights of paedophiles to privacy to protect children from abuse.</h1>
<p>The British government is understood to have raised its concerns with the EC that “personal rights should not obstruct companies from protecting children who use social media platforms.”</p>
<p>A source said Sajid Javid, the home secretary, fully supported companies having the power to detect and act upon “abhorrent” images and grooming for child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>“We have taken note of the EU’s proposal for the introduction of European Privacy Regulation (EPR) and are discussing it with EU member states,” said a government spokesperson.</p>
<p>John Carr, secretary of the Children’s Charities\' Coalition on Internet Safety, which represents 11 of the biggest charities including Barnardo\'s and the NSPCC, wrote last week to the EC, demanding they amend the regulations so investigators can continue to report and remove indecent images.</p>
<p>Mr Carr said: &quot;There ought to be no room for doubt or ambiguity on a matter of such fundamental importance to the protection of children.  And yet there is.&quot;</p>
<p>Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardo’s, Britain’s biggest charity, said: “Online child abuse is appalling. Any regulation change should not restrict the ability of tech companies and law enforcement to work together to stop child abuse online.</p>
<p>“We would urge the EC to make a simple change to the new e-privacy regulation so that all EU countries can continue to fight this horrific crime effectively.” </p>
<p>Microsoft technology known as PhotoDNA has enabled tech giants like Facebook, Twitter and Google to track down millions of illegal child abuse images on their platforms.</p>
<p>It is estimated more than 20m such images will have been located by US watchdogs and the Internet Watch Foundation in the UK by the end of this year and removed through the use of PhotoDNA, which &quot;fingerprints&quot; any illegal image so copies of it can be traced across the internet.</p>
<p>Under new data laws - the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - there are three exemptions to a users\' right to privacy which allow tech firms to seize and report indecent images.</p>
<p>These are where it is of vital importance to protect the interests of an individual, to comply with a legal obligation or to perform a task that is carried out in the public interest.</p>
<h1>The European Privacy Regulations (EPR), however, have no such exemptions. &quot;Article 5 of the EPR prohibits the processing of data unless consent is given by the end user [ie the paedophile],&quot; said a charity legal expert. &quot;The worry is that if consent is the only exemption to the prohibition on processing data, then child sexual abuse offenders are unlikely to give their consent.</h1>
<p>&quot;The purpose of the regulations are to stop the abuse and misuse of people\'s data and privacy but the consequence is it potentially undermines what is being done to tackle child sexual abuse online.”</p>
<p>It is understood a number of other European countries have raised concerns in an attempt to force through an alternative option aligning the privacy laws with the GDPR exemptions.</p>

             responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU.

            The
            <strong>
             European Parliament
            </strong>
            is the directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union. Together with the Council of the European Union (the Council) and the European Commission, it exercises the legislative function of the EU. The Parliament is composed of 751 members, who represent the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009).

           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting when you think of what is Behind them, which controllers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its capital, Luxembourg City, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, is one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest judicial authority in the EU.
           </p>
           <p>
            Strasbourg is at the seat of several European institutions, such as the Council of Europe (with its European Court of Human Rights, its European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and its European Audiovisual Observatory) and the Eurocorps, as well as the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman of the European Union. The city is also the seat of the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine and the International Institute of Human Rights.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets just pull out One of their organizations called the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines shortened to EDQM is actively involved in a number of other international harmonization initiatives, such as the World Health Organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically a Lot of control over medicines. . .one of those areas they say they are "helping" you, but have All the control over What goes into those medications.
           </p>
           <p>
            The contents of the European Pharmacopoeia are elaborated upon and updated by the European Pharmacopoeia Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the practical work of 700 or so experts in every field of the pharmaceutical sciences – all volunteers – who participate in more than 70 Groups of Experts and Working Parties. The European Pharmacopoeia Commission decides on the work programme, appoints the experts, and adopts the monograph.
           </p>

             a member of several organisations working for racial equality such as the Society of Labour Lawyers, Fabian Society, Council of the Institute of Race Relations, British Overseas Socialist Fellowship and the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants.[7] In 1968, he co-founded the Runnymede Trust think-tank with Jim Rose. He was chairman of the Runnymede Trust from 1991 to 1993. Lester is a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lester is a patron of the Family Planning Association, previously called the National Birth Control Committee. He represented the FPA in a contentious case in Northern Ireland where it was widely claimed that the FPA were trying to use strategic litigation to introduce liberalised abortion laws into the country.

            <p>
             Lester is Patron of the FPA (Family Planning Association) and a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Lester was special advisor to Roy Jenkins at the Home Office in the 1970s – when Jenkins was concealing the paedophile gang  in north Wales in his capacity as Home Secretary (see post ‘The Most Dangerous Man In The World – Part I),
             <strong>
              although it’s obvious from Lester’s other affiliations that Roy was certainly not the only person known to Anthony Lester who was concealing child abuse or the associated abuses in the mental health services.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Lester was given his peerage in 1993. Once those five witnesses to the activities of the paedophile gang in north Wales were safely dead after the firebomb attack (see post ‘The Silence Of The Welsh Lambs’), once Sir Peter Morrison had stepped down as MP for Chester, once Mary Wynch had been shafted by Michael Howard at the Home Office (see post ‘A Few Of The Relevant Politicians Re Mary Wynch’s Case’) and once the North Wales Police had satisfied themselves that there was not a paedophile ring in operation in north Wales. The North Wales Police who at the time employed Superintendent Gordon Anglesea who later went to prison for abusing children in care in his capacity as a member of the paedophile ring which did not exist.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2007 Lester acted as Jack Straw’s advisor when Straw was Secretary of State for Justice.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lord Lester practices at Blackstones Chambers. His colleagues there include Michael Beloff QC. Michael Beloff is a friend of the Blairs and was the legal advisor who in 1996 ordered the insurers of Clwyd County Council which ran the ‘child protection’ services investigated by the Jillings Inquiry to withold from everyone (even the Councillors) – and then pulp – all copies of the Jillings Report on the grounds that what happened to the children was indefensible.

            Of course they are its the EU! All they care about is getting their supply and protecting their kind.  ANYTHING we believe in think of the opposite and these evil sickos are doing/protecting it......they need to be OUT OF POWER IMMEDIATELY!  People should be looking into these EU leaders before their social medias are wiped from the internet.

             I've also had a great deal of attackers and distracters while and after I put up the two part series linking Ralph Blasey's company, his CEO and her husband's company. . .life long friends with Blasey, to people connected with fall of Lehman brothers (some reorganization) , rise of Blackstone, weakening of middle class America and Germany . . .and Baal's band profited nicely!

             I have to look closer at this, but it is already making me sick.  Disgusting doesn't even cut it.  They are dragging their feet with Brexit and May is doing her utmost to hold it off.  I told my husband when they were first trying to push through the EU that I hated it and it would only come to no good.  Some thought I was crazy.  Don't be afraid of progress they said.  Yeah, look what a mess we have.  It's always Our Children that suffer.  We make allowances for the Freedom of Others, but it seems that lately we are forgetting Our Children.

               I thought I was a Progressive but not in their sense of the word.  I wanted everyone to be able to have health care through their work like we used to, I wanted fairness for all, not all this crap they are offering when you look under their rock.  They lied to us about what it really was.  Now I find it is pushing for changing the teaching of Our Children and giving rights to pedophiles. Among other normalization propaganda they are now pushing.  I am all for change it it means to go back to Good Values and Our Freedoms that they want to take away.  I am into Our Freedoms Not Theirs.

                 I really have tried to tell others but they think I have gone completely bat crap crazy.  They think I am nuts and don't know what happened to me.  Little do they know what is down the road for them.  What worries me now, is how are we going to stop their Freight Train before it runs us all over.

                  I have said very similar words as even the people who Feel they are in the Know and awake, still don't Really know.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You're right. . .it is a Freight Train and very scary.

                 <p>
                  Don't worry, everyone thinks I'm nuts, lost most family have about zero friends except for some who are Genuine Patriots in the Awake crowd on different platforms.

                  I still believe there are more of us than we know.  They try to keep them hidden from us.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Almost daily we find posers who are pretending to be on the side of good, but are either fooled by the posers or possibly have been one of them all along.

                  They end up aiding and abetting them in leading many astray through diabolical distractions.

                  Generally we can spot them by their actions and sense of entitlement.  Eventually they give themselves away when they elevate their selfish agenda above the good of the Patriots and The Plan.

                   Good to hear your family things your nuts too.  I am on the fence feeling sorry for them or waiting to say I told you so!  They say, What sites are you on?  Famous last words.  Magically their sites are always the right ones.  What scares me is the water rationing coming.  They have already let led stay in the water and are not fixing it.  This ruins the brains of Our Children.  So Sad.
