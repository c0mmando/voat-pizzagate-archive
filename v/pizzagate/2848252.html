<p>&quot;...a San Francisco liberal, which I am proud to be, ..and that with San Francisco values of ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI, WHICH I AM PROUD TO BE AN INSTRUMENT OF GOD\'S PEACE....&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LoT9flhL6oYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LoT9flhL6oYouTube</a></p>
<p>AND WHO IS ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI?</p>
<p>&quot;Born c. 1181–1226 St. Francis of Assisi abandoned a life of luxury for a life devoted to Christianity after reportedly hearing the voice of God, who commanded him to rebuild the Christian church and live in poverty. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;St. Francis of Assisi was renowned for drinking and partying in his youth. After fighting in a battle between Assisi and Perugia, Francis was captured and imprisoned for ransom. He spent nearly a year in prison — awaiting his father\'s payment — and, according to legend, began receiving visions from God. After his release from prison, Francis heard the voice of Christ, who told him to repair the Christian Church and live a life of poverty. Consequently, he abandoned his life of luxury and became a devotee of the faith, his reputation spreading all over the Christian world. &quot; <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/st-francis-of-assisi-21152679">https://www.biography.com/people/st-francis-of-assisi-21152679</a></p>
<p>Nancy has accumulated $100 MILLION while in office. RICH, just like Francis! BUT FRANCIS GAVE IT ALL AWAY! Just think how many CHILDREN could be saved if she kept poor families out of poverty so they wouldn\'t pimp their children for money! Just think how much CORRUPTION she could help expose AND SHUT DOWN! <a href="https://celebsnetworth.org/nancy-pelosi-net-worth/">https://celebsnetworth.org/nancy-pelosi-net-worth/</a></p>
<p>Evidently, Nancy quoted this prayer attributed to St. Francis (although &quot;it cannot be traced farther back than 1912&quot;) &quot;after becoming Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2007.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.</p>
<p>Where there is hatred, let me sow love.</p>
<p>Where there is injury, pardon.</p>
<p>Where there is doubt, faith.</p>
<p>Where there is despair. Hope.</p>
<p>Where there is darkness, light.</p>
<p>Where there is sadness, joy.</p>
<p>O Divine Master,</p>
<p>Grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console;</p>
<p>To be understood, as to understand;</p>
<p>To be loved, as to love.</p>
<p>For it is in giving that we receive.</p>
<p>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,</p>
<p>And it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.</p>
<p>Amen.&quot;

<p>All research is speculative. One begins with facts that appear to cluster into a pattern. This leads researchers to speculate on an explanation that fits the PATTERN. THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF VOAT PIZZAGATE research.</p>
<p>Nancy has previously been the topic of VOAT SPECULATION regarding factual evidence pointing to a link with her and a pizza restaurant named GOAT HILL PIZZA. One of the owners worked for Nancy. &quot;This official document CERTIFIED LIST OF ELECTED CANDIDATES FOR THE NOVEMBER 2, 2004 GENERAL ELECTION from a government website shows that Pelosi used PHILIP@GOATHILL.COM as her official email. Her official headquarters seems to also be in the same area of the pizza parlor. &quot; <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1442209">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1442209</a></p>
<p>Posters speculated that it could be a campaign money laundering operation front and/or a front for pedo activity. THIS POST WAS NOT GIVEN A 24 HOUR FLAIR! I watched a current interview of Nancy and pointed out her verbal linking of her approval and support of SAINT FRANCES OF ASSISI, a born-again Christian reformer who took a vow of poverty. This seemed inconsistent with her past behavior. VOAT/PIZZAGATE continuously references the SPIRITUAL REALM and acknowledges DEMONIC ACTIVITY and SATANISM as being a motivator for satanic ritual abuse of children. If Nancy has truly spiritually flipped, this is important research. If she becomes Speaker of the House, she could have influence over putting an end to child trafficking and punishing those who participate. Even if she is lying about her sincerity, it is important information that she would associate herself with a highly revered Christian.</p>',

            No.  She is a Satanist like the rest of them.   I don't believe anything she says she talks out of both sides of her mouth  She may have been born a  Catholic but the closest she comes to that now is to bow down to the pope another Satanist  There may be a hidden message in  her so called prayer.  I wonder if she is asking for understanding about her crimes, to be pardoned and Eternal Life is what the Satanists have been feverishly seeking  Jeffrey E is part of Life Boat.  These people always Talk in Riddles.

             You are probably correct, BUT the prayers of the new Church turned SAUL into PAUL. Saul was a Pharisee and had his head full of the teachings of the Torah. It took a SUPERNATURAL EVENT for him to understand them, repent, and BELIEVE CHRIST. Christians should pray for those in authority over us whether they are saved or not "that it would go well with you." I CERTAINLY don't want her to keep following SATAN.

              All Christians should be praying for all of Christianity not just their own Church  For they are trying to kill ALL belief in Christ.  We must stand together or we .......you know the rest.  I wonder about St. Frances now because HE picked that name.  I don't trust anything he does.  The devil sits in the chair of St Peter.  That in itself is Blasphemy.   She will never repent or turn, her heart is black with hate.  For us.
