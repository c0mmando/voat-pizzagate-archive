<p>Having just heard from Ricki who talked to John, and hearing from <strong>book group people galore</strong>, I thought I better send this much out. AT your and Mary\'s service to guide a circle of 25 or so totally devoted fellow readers but also friends, and again, anything else I can do to just keep people informed. I hope I worded this suitably or aptly or whatever.

Plus, I have only been able to be in touch with family members and friends as David &amp; I have been on 3 legs of a flight to get to Oklahoma City to get to nearby Norman for a nephew\'s graduation.  Mary was hit by a car this morning, with John thankfully in town and nearby. Because her head was cracked in some way and her pelvis was whacked, it sounded pretty scary for awhile. From what I know from very recently, while she has had a lot of pain, so far, all looks OK and all should be OK. These are not official words, but that\'s as current as I know.  Knowing more than I\'d like to about people who have sudden medical or hospital events/arrivals, I am quite sure that there basically is nothing we can do other than what you think feels right, but probably means we have to leave her and family to themselves now -- a note to her at home to be there when she gets home, an email so she can read it later, etc, etc. John and Mary\'s kids will be at the hospital and one or more may be there by now, and you know the close circle they have.  No matter what, unless something is happening while I type, our Mary Podesta WAS injured badly but SHOULD be OK.  I will try to keep sending word, or find a way that you get word, and when we can all do something to help, I and our other Mary Followers will round up ways to truly help.  Please know I\'m in Oklahoma and right now, I will not be with the family and I also think we know enough about bad accidents or medical crises that there\'s just not a whole lot we can do. As soon as I have more word or &quot;guidance,&quot; I\'ll send it out. and if anyone else has something to add, please do that too. For those there at Carolyn\'s on Sunday, we all were with Mary, and since she is my usual chauffeur since my damn medical devil stopped me from driving since \'04, she and I had <strong>our usual wonderful drive to book group and back home catching up on family, recent events, where each of us were going next and as always, her love for her family, Truckee, AND our own circle -- we really did talk about all of that. SO, now I will refrain from saying what I REALLY think about the idea of a vehicle hitting her or this happening to her.</strong>  LOVE TO ALL. Time for prayers, candles, karma, and oooohhhming once again. </p>

<p>What exactly does this mean?</p>

<p>Also, is the book group mentioned connected to the one Clinton sent pizzas to?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comet’s neighbor, said during an event yesterday for Clinton’s What Happened book tour. “You bought I don’t know how many pizzas, but a lot of pizzas, and sent them … to an after-school literacy program in D.C., which was never publicized.”

            Sent: Wed, May 26, 2010 11:06 pm Subject: OUR Mary Podesta--this is an old list so please forward to who isn't on it cause I'm on D's laptop   Well, not the message I like to send. Plus, I have only been able to be in touch with family members and friends as David &amp; I have been on 3 legs of a flight to get to Oklahoma City to get to nearby Norman for a nephew's graduation.  Mary was hit by a car this morning, with John thankfully in town and nearby. Because her head was cracked in some way and her pelvis was whacked, it sounded pretty scary for awhile. From what I know from very recently, while she has had a lot of pain, so far, all looks OK and all should be OK. These are not official words, but that's as current as I know.  Knowing more than I'd like to about people who have sudden medical or hospital events/arrivals, I am quite sure that there basically is nothing we can do other than what you think feels right, but probably means we have to leave her and family to themselves now -- a note to her at home to be there when she gets home, an email so she can read it later, etc, etc. John and Mary's kids will be at the hospital and one or more may be there by now, and you know the close circle they have.  No matter what, unless something is happening while I type, our Mary Podesta WAS injured badly but SHOULD be OK.  I will try to keep sending word, or find a way that you get word, and when we can all do something to help, I and our other Mary Followers will round up ways to truly help.  Please know I'm in Oklahoma and right now, I will not be with the family and I also think we know enough about bad accidents or medical crises that there's just not a whole lot we can do. As soon as I have more word or "guidance," I'll send it out. and if anyone else has something to add, please do that too. For those there at Carolyn's on Sunday, we all were with Mary, and since she is my usual chauffeur since my damn medical devil stopped me from driving since '04, she and I had
            <strong>
             our usual wonderful drive to book group and back home catching up on family, recent events, where each of us were going next and as always, her love for her family, Truckee, AND our own circle -- we really did talk about all of that. SO, now I will refrain from saying what I REALLY think about the idea of a vehicle hitting her or this happening to her.
            </strong>
            LOVE TO ALL. Time for prayers, candles, karma, and oooohhhming once again.

           Also, is the book group mentioned connected to the one Clinton sent pizzas to?

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Comet’s neighbor, said during an event yesterday for Clinton’s What Happened book tour. “You bought I don’t know how many pizzas, but a lot of pizzas, and sent them … to an after-school literacy program in D.C., which was never publicized.”

I've been seeing people lead to random images like this a few times now. Has anyone used a Hex editor to check to see if there is hidden info in these images or similar ones. I remember someone finding a strange site that lead them to a bunch of mr potato head pictures. If I remember correctly when i was doing cyber security stuff in college the example images for our steganography lessons were of mr potato head or alice in woderland. A lot of the lessons we had were based around concealing child pornography since it is a huge focus with cyber criminals. my point being who's to say these random dead end images are clean and not really holding extra information. Especially since the file size is way larger than what it should be.
