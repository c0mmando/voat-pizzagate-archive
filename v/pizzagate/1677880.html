            That would make a great video.  But even this information, even though it's the closest thing  that aligns to my own perception,  it still doesn't get to the root, but great stuff.

            I especially liked your comment:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The deeper you're into conspiracies the more you see how Jones is controlled opposition. Fun, but still controlled opposition. Not just for the "growing babies in cows" stuff, but for things like conflating ChemYouTube TrailsYouTube with mind control chemicals... Rather than part of Geoengineering and the hundred year old weather control system.YouTube Here's a short documentary about the South Texas Weather Modification Association.YouTube We have these smaller operations all over the USA, and big time operations enlist commercial airliners. Beijing has a Weather Modification Office and they boasted about weather control for Olympics. Yet AJ goes off the deep end with the Chem-Trails conspiracy. Sure, the metallic chemicals can be harmful to humans, but AJ never touches on their actual uses. Why not? Controlled Opposition = pretend opposition that distracts you from the truth. Why keep it secret? Because it's now used politically, just like all other systems. if California knew their drought was artificially created they'd revolt. Soon as Trump gets in office, their drought disappears... Trump knows "Climate Change / Global Warming" is a sham because he knows we control the weather, and so does AJ, but he won't talk about weather warfare.

            I've seen this approach with a lot of his segments.  He'll whip people into a frenzy while showing them one item, but really the magician trick is to keep you from looking at the other item, which he never discloses.
            <br/>
            I'm not entirely sure he knows that he's used for this purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think he is ignorant of his role in the propaganda game or do you think he knows what his role is. 
All the worlds a stage, Shakespeare got that one right.

            Be very skeptical. First this video was deleted. Second, Alex Jones has been on the wrong side of Pizzagate since Day One. His coverage has been embarrassingly pitiful and misinformed for such a self-proclaimed expert on global corruption, or it is all a poorly directed disinformation and controlled opposition scheme meant to muddy the water about what the real story is behind Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption - anyone who knows what is really going on knows that Alex Jones is either a loud-mouth idiot or completely controlled. After first you can see how others might believe him, but after years of listening you see the many lies and holes in his coverage. Pizzagate was one of the most obvious, and it has only gotten worse since, with this as yet another final straw. Anyone on his show including Roger Stone and Robert David Steele should be equally questioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is most likely tactic to scare off everyone one else from investigating and reporting about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. If they are threatening Alex Jones with legal action, that is a setup to indirectly threaten and intimidate everyone else. Alex Jones has done a disservice to the entire investigation and reporting of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and is a bad actor. Anyone with true knowledge of what is really going on knows that he is part of the controlled opposition, whether he is purposely involved or not. He is simply not believable, particularly when it comes to the real story of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. He is an entertainer and possibly a shyster.
           </p>
           <p>
            After all, there is a lot of suspicion regarding what happened to Andrew Breitbart, Ben Swann, Michael Hastings, Monica Petersen, Gary Webb, David Seaman, and possibly even Julian Assange, among many others. But Alex Jones has been safe all this time while he mixes complete nonsense and snake oil salesmanship with some true conspiracy stories usually after they are already widely known by others.
           </p>
           <p>
            If our faith and future lies with Alex Jones, Jeff Sessions, James Comey and Donald Trump, the only real hope is to force our own change through our own investigations and building Common Global Knowledge about the real story of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption - not the fake news version they are trying to steer this toward with a narrow focus. This is not about pizza places, or a few people. This is about a global system infested by evil and corruption at all levels and the propaganda, disinformation, and censorship machine of control.
           </p>
           <p>
            The key to solving Pizzagate is not Alex Jones and a few DC power players, or even Donald Trump locking up a few bigger names and making a few mid level arrests. The key is Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's home district that is an epicenter for criminal corruption connected to every aspect of the bigger picture behind Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Instead of a few profiteers shouting on YouTube and narrowing the focus to exactly what the elite want, the focus needs to be on what the real agenda is and it is much deeper than what Alex Jones thinks Pizzagate is. Racine, Wisconsin connects every element involved of the real Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and will prove whether Trump is legitimate or not - if he cannot effectively drain that swamp and connect the dots to the secret societies and areas such as DC, Chicago, Hollywood, Denver, Haiti and others, then everyone will know he is not what he claims to be.
           </p>
           <p>
            The powers that be are frightened about exposing the system behind Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, but they aren't frightened of Alex Jones, David Seaman or others shouting nonsense that plays right into their strategy. The real key lies with Racine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption than two decades of Alex Jones telethons.

            This is a great video. Alex hasn't seemed to figure out that JA is guilty, but I expect him to figure that out soon. I'm guessing that he hasn't even seen the Instagram pictures yet.

             Oh how I loved this video!!  Best thing I've seen for years, comedy wise. Alex wipes the floor with John Podesta!!!  and yes, seems like he's only seen the spiritcooking material and the wikileaks emails about the 'hot tub' ?  Imagine if he sees the rest?  Oh, that was the funniest 40 minutes EVER.

            Thank you for the information and links for further research. I think the word "demon" is a bit misleading. I do think there are non-physical entities or energies both light and dark that are influencing people in different ways. Especially when they consciously try to connect to it. Those could be considered demons. Like the entity that receives all the worship and devotion energy from the world's religions. And the spiritual hierarchy of archangels and "ascended masters" that are part of the cosmopolitical realm. The spiritual aspect of this is fascinating but there is a lot of unprovable non scientific stuff out there.

            I think this happened because of the Joe Rogan podcast.  I know a lot of normies even talking about it.  As much as Jones tried to say CPP was "innocent" it brought a lot of awareness to pizzagate.  It doesn't matter how much Alex tries to sweep it under the rug, as soon as it's brought up and a person does just a little bit of research, they can see it's worthy of an investigation.  didn't Rogan's sponsors get hit too?

            I'm aware I'll be called a shill but I just don't trust Alex Jones. He makes mad money selling fear.  He discredits theories by acting absurd. I could be wrong but I feel like he's paid opposition.

              Well obviously you are yet to come to terms with the fact AJ is a limited hangout. Give it a couple more months perhaps. It's a hard one to come to terms with because he's responsible for waking so many of us up, but it's the truth...

               In a way this makes me feel better since I don't have AJ's extremism on my conscience. He made it very obvious last live stream he did where all he said was about funding and buying products from his website... No call to action at all. AJ is the shit that the media can use to foul the water

            Alex is a fraud.  He's lucky there isn't a class-action suit against him from his readers.  He's trying to cover his ass, cuz he's getting sued by Podesta.  This is what happens to "leaders."  They decide that the money is more important than actually fighting the cause and losing it all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Forget about Alex and IW.  I hope they do go down.  We the People who have NOTHING to lose will pick up the slack.

            I will always find Alex Jones to be a bit of a crack pot. He's done a lot of stuff over the years to create that image.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said, suing Alex Jones over this only goes to remove any remaining doubt. You know what you do with crazy people? You prove them wrong with facts, which triggers them
            <em>
             hard
            </em>
            , and shuts them down. There was zero attempt to do that here with AJ.

              I know. I wondered about much of this. Admittedly the Pence thing no surprise but never thought of it. Couldn't put name to who this version of Chelsea is. Can't wait for the day someone can track what happened to the little Obama originals. Their personal trauma was so visible at my last sighting them at the Turkey pardon for Thanksgiving I tweeted about it.I am sure that image is either now doctored or gone. Never saw nor heard the real children again. My opinion. But since someone here has access to that kind of deep deception. I'm sure it's gory. We are learning the ugly occult ritual practices.

            He's doing good except he doesn't believe in Alefantis and the pizza place is all involved. 😒 I just wrote him a long letter. I told him that it's that sick son of a bitch that helped lead us everywhere! I told him to come here if he wants to learn more and told him to get his butt on Gab!

             Dude save you energy! Jones knows damn well what CPP is all about! He's a limited hangout/gatekeeper!!! It's a bummer to come to terms with but it is what it is.

                 I'm on your side dummy. A few months ago I was in the same boat, I thought that "Alex Jones is controlled opposition" was ludicrous. It's not, but I'm not gonna wake you up it seems. Just remember this quote: "The best way to control your opposition is to lead it." Don't think for a second they're not utilizing this incredibly powerful tool.

              It's like Twitter. The maker got sick of being censored so he made Gab. There is no censorship. It's pretty new and people can sign up and be put on waiting lists. It's growing fast and improving. Someday the hope is to replace Twitter since they no longer allow free speech

             Anyone who has been a regular listener for years knows that there are some red flags with Alex. He has been very deceptive over PG overall. He'll lead you only so far on the path of truth, but you have to get off the bus when he ignores Israel gov influence over US politics as well as Israel's crimes against humanity in their rampage towards a one state solution and dominion over the Middle East. He also completely ignores the Mossad involvement in 911 and points the finger conveniently at the Saudis. Anyone who has done the research knows where it leads - CIA, Mossad and MI5.

             There is fault in the man, but he shares important stuff about pizzagate. I like him a thousand times more than any MSM shils.

             I have to admit that this guy isn't a good figure head for the scandal. He believes in too much bullshit that isn't true. He can't separate the real conspiracies from the fake ones. I'll give him some of my attention, but I won't believe shit he says without him backing it up with something. Which he often does.

               He whitewashed the entire thing!  I'm convinced they made a deal: Yeah, we'll let you come in here (with TIGHT security --- look at attendees!) and film, but you can't capture anything substantive."  AJ then hypes it as "exposing" Bohemian Grove, when it is no such thing!  Obviously it works on some suckers.

                I don't think David Gergen is that good an actor.   Did you see Alex interview him on the streets of DC?    He drew a lot of attention to the grove, which is something the attendees clearly would not want.

               I've come around on Alex Jones. I used to think he was totally crazy. Then 2016 and Wikileaks happened, and I no longer laugh at conspiracy theories. But still now, I'll watch Alex and be totally on board until some point in the show where he goes TOO far, like aliens or HAARP (weather control). It's hard to believe in all of that craziness, but check back with me in a few more months.
