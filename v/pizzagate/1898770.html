Press Release: Kim Dotcom
KIM DOTCOM APPROACHES SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATING INTERFERENCE WITH THE 2016 UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REGARDING EVIDENCE</p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
30 May 2017</p>
<p>In accordance with his previous statement on this matter, Kim Dotcom’s solicitors in New Zealand have today sent the following letter to Robert Mueller, Special Counsel appointed to investigate interference with the 2016 United States presidential election and related matters:</p>
<p>30 May 2017</p>
<p>Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>
<p>Attention: Robert Mueller, Special Counsel</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>INVESTIGATION INTO INTERFERENCE WITH THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND RELATED MATTERS</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We act for Kim Dotcom in New Zealand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are writing to you in your capacity as special counsel appointed to carry out the above investigation pursuant to Order 3915-2017 (Investigation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Dotcom has evidence that he considers relevant to the Investigation. The purpose of this letter is to confirm that, subject to appropriate arrangements being made and his constitutional rights being preserved, Mr Dotcom is willing to provide this evidence to the Investigation. He has instructed us to make this approach to initiate the necessary dialogue as to the required arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you may be aware, Mr Dotcom resides in New Zealand. Since 2012, the United States has been seeking his extradition to face a criminal prosecution arising from his involvement in the Megaupload group of companies. Presently, Mr Dotcom is on bail while he exercises (as he is entitled to) his rights under New Zealand law to resist extradition. Mr Dotcom emphatically denies the alleged offending and is committed to defending the allegations in the extradition proceeding in New Zealand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Dotcom is also committed to achieving an outcome where his evidence can be properly received and reviewed by you as part of the Investigation. You will, however, appreciate that, given his current status, he is not in a position to voluntarily leave New Zealand\'s jurisdiction. Further, he is concerned that, should he travel to the United States voluntarily, he would be arrested and detained in custody on the current counts on which he has been indicted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, for Mr Dotcom to attend in person in the United States to make a statement, and/or give oral evidence at any subsequent hearing, special arrangements would need to be discussed and agreed between all relevant parties. Such arrangements would need to include arrangements for his safe passage from New Zealand and return. This is because Mr Dotcom is determined to clear his name in New Zealand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Dotcom invites the Department of Justice to contact him through counsel to progress the taking of his evidence once you have had an opportunity to consider this letter and are in a position to discuss the required process and appropriate safeguards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you. If you have any questions, or require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yours faithfully

            I will say this again - Take everything with measured caution, but keep plugging along. Dont rest your entire life emotions on one guy coming through. It will be a bonus if he does. It is entirely plausible that he is trying to cover all his bases before unloading the goods (not preposterous considering all the flak he has taken from the govt).

            I'm giving him an Upvoat for going through with this. Obviously, he has the goods. You don't get yourself involved in that level of government without having the proof to back up letters to special counsels. Just Mr. Dotcom ... please stay off of Flagler ... and MedStar hospitals.

            He probably does have more. He may have kept the original dumps somewhere guaranteed.

            They can try and spin this, but it won't work because if he is 'abled' to testify here in the US? It'll be too late. He has a high powered firm behind him, that, by itself, carries media weight insuring visibility .They can't possibly suicide all them. I'm also very sure he has created insurance with others and even Wikileaks themselves.

            Listen..pretty obvious Kim was in DIRECT contact with #SethRich...Rich was sending documents somewhere and doubtful he was using the public upload in the Wikileaks website.  Kim has said Rich contacted him directly re the Internet Party.  Kim, I would surmise, has direct evidence of 1) contact with Rich, 2) proof Rich was the DNC leaker, and potentially Kim has Rich's "deadman switch.." and I would think he had one...but Kim in a difficult position..does he release info thru Wikileaks?  NO..he cannot due to Wikileaks policy of never revealing a source...but thanks to Donald Trump appointing a special counsel (this could not have happened any other way..) the evidence can come out....

             Many people believe Seth Rich is the first loose string that will unravel the whole Pizzagate sweater. Not just the elite kiddie diddling (aka Pedogate), but the entire web of worldwide criminal activity, corruption and lies.

              Okay I understand, the pizzagate subverse doesn't seem right for this and other seth rich stories in my opinion. Maybe I got OCD or something. Besides government corruption tying it to Seth Rich, its the SEIU right, since Jacob Schwartz dad or lawyer (I don't remember) represented them before.

            The thing is, there are many questions about Seths murder, but when you own the media, you control which ones get asked. I actually don't think that in this Orwellian climate, offing Kim is off the table. They're not reporting on it to begin with, and they could just blame his weight if questioning became too loud.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again, the numbers on the White House petition for an investigation into Seth rich seem to be going down, not up. So they can also control how loud the questioning gets...

             There are a lot of newly ex-Dems who want to see that party destroyed too. Only the media and a few Facebook addicted, Maddow watching housewives still believe the Dems are the good guys.

            This is news. As also the President of the Unites States should have interest to solve the election case, even personal interest due to his staff being accused on the Russian narrative in the main stream media, I'm assuming that some arrangements will take place for the Department of Justice to receive the evidence in question.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd be extremely happy also for that afterwards the main stream media might be caught on their false perspective due to this evidence. It would most likely wake up the citizens to demand more honest media, in a long run returning some trust on journalism. Currently (2016 poll) the trust on MSM in the US is as low as 32%, indicating a serious problem in the freedom of speech. Also services like Wikipedia would get a hit, having put too much trust on MSM in their source policy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also see this as a key to open one of the locks in the pizzagate, depending on the evidence of course. Let's hope for the best!

            I think he's doing what he can in the context of rising Clinton body count, media/Internet censorship and deep state manoeuvring. No one else should have to die (or more likely in his case, be imprisoned) for trying to bring DNC corruption into the light

            I do believe he has the evidence of which his Megaupload site hosted the leaks dump from Seth Rich. Wikileaks got them soon afterwards. He needs to prove the IP adress the dump came from was Seth Rich's and it's game over.

             I hope not.  I have mixed feelings about Kim Dot Com.  Some of his info has been spot on.  At other times, however, he has dangled juicy carrots in front of us, made empty promises, and then pulled the stick back just as we were about to bite.  So he better put up or shut up.  I had to post the news, though, because it's noteworthy that Dot Com's attorneys wrote that letter.  At least they're kicking the ball down the field a little bit more. . . .  LET'S GO, BOYZ!  MAN UP.  SPEAK.  GET THIS SHIT DONE!
