                You're making a logical fallacy that's called an appeal to authority.  This guy is a former admiral.  So what?  We are answering a question of fact here, not a question on maritime maneuvers or naval warfare or anything where an admiral would have expertise.
               </p>
               <p>
                How does it make him different from any other 90 year old on the internet pushing a conspiracy theory?  He retired from the Navy 31 years ago and he has an opinion?  Why is his opinion more valuable than others?
               </p>
               <p>
                I will engage his argument.
               </p>
               <p>
                He starts off with a claim that Devin Nunes exposed unethical behavior  and maybe crimes at the DOJ.   This is a highly dubious statement and he provides no evidence.  This is opinion.
               </p>
               <p>
                He some how connects this to Seth Rich.    I think this is rhetorical sleight of hand.
               </p>
               <p>
                He then fudges his facts
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Washington Metro police detectives claim that Mr. Rich was a robbery victim, which is strange since after being shot twice in the back, he was still wearing a $2,000 gold necklace and watch. He still had his wallet, key and phone. Clearly, he was not a victim of robbery.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                He is underplaying the police theory.  The police have always said it was an attempted robbery.  As evidence they point to the fact that Rich's watch band was damaged as someone tried to remove it and he resisted.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 This has all the earmarks of a targeted hit job.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Lawyers call this assuming facts not in evidence.  And he doesn't provide any backup for this claim.  He jumps to a complete non-sequitur and some more assumptions
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 However, strangely no one has been charged with this horrific crime, and what is more intriguing is that no law enforcement agency is even investigating this murder.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Why is this strange?  This sort of thing happens all the time.  A staple of True Crime TV is the unsolved murder.  He claims the cops aren't investigating without providing support for this.
               </p>
               <p>
                He then passes along this unsourced rumor
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 According to other open sources, Metro police were told by their “higher ups” that if they spoke about the case, they will be immediately terminated. It has been claimed that this order came down from very high up the “food chain,” well beyond the D.C. mayor’s office. Interesting.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                He then jumps to a different crime and calls it a twist in the Seth Rich case.   And he just goes for it at the end and piles on the bullshit.  AND HE FINALLY PROVIDES A SOURCE.  And It's Ed Butowsky.   Which leads me back to my original question.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Why would anyone believe Ed Butowsky?
                </p>

            The facts that we know of in the murder of the DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was that he was gunned down blocks from his home on July 10, 2016. Washington Metro police detectives claim that Mr. Rich was a robbery victim, which is strange since after being shot twice in the back, he was still wearing a $2,000 gold necklace and watch. He still had his wallet, key and phone. Clearly, he was not a victim of robbery.

             Yes, same here. I hadn't heard of it before. Doesn't the police feel incredibly stupid when they claim that it wasn't a robbery. Well, we now why they do.

                Yeah, I have been researching his death on and off since that fateful day.  I was on my laptop that day when I found out and was on it until 2 am.  I am constantly typing his name and searching for answers.  They will never let us find out the answer, I am afraid.  They threw in the stupid muh Russia thing and now the sheeple people are transfixed on that.

              A joke.  The DC PD are a Bleeping Joke.  Newsham in pics with JA and DWS. Maybe there is one of him at Obama's Hot Dog Party.  I still think those two SEIU members found dead in Myrtle Beach were involved and the stolen Glock is a Hot Clue.  Where were those two at the time of that FBI car robbery.  No answers.  Many questions.

             Seth Rich was likely the leaker who got John Podesta's emails to Wikileaks, which then went public.
Pretty direct connection to Pedogate here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whether Seth was just trying to get it exposed that the DNC was in bed with the Media and cheating Bernie Sanders' campaign OR Seth was trying to expose Something Darker -- he alone opened up the can of worms.
            </p>
            <p>
             MANY people, myself included, came into the Pizzagate research because we were first curious as to how the DNC was [blatantly] cheating out their own candidate. I was into the Bernie research for MONTHS before the rumblings of Pizzagate/ Pedogate even came to a crowd conensus about the odd coded language, and it was a while before those lead to credible connections like James Alefantis' relationship with Tony Podesta.
            </p>
            <p>
             First -- the general population must be led to the water source and NOT forced to drink it -- lest they reject it outright. *They *have to come to that conclusion
             <em>
              on their own
             </em>
             , and ONLY then will they be able to accept whatever underlying Truth there is about the Cabal and its Blackmail rings. Getting people's feet wet with insider information about dirty politics is genius.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whether or not Seth Rich did this on purpose or inadvertantly kicked the hornet's nest when he leaked Podesta's Emails may remain a mystery. But one thing's for certain -- there was a target on his back and the young man is now dead because of his actions for the good of Democracy/Our Republic and humanity as a whole.

               Whether Seth Rich is the source for one or both of the leaks or not -- I'm not going to shoot the messenger [twice in the back in a 'failed robbery.] Either way, cat's out of the bag and the emails are genuine and have NEVER been refuted. The only defense given is that they were 'hacked.' THANK YOU to whoever shined a light on this scourge. You are a true Patriot!!!

                  "Cheese Pizza" never appears once in Podesta's emails.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The origin of the use of "Cheese pizza" is that it comes from CP.   Folks on places like 4chan would request child pornography by saying post CP.  From this came various CP phrases.  Copier Paper, Captain Picard, Chocolate Pudding were all used.  Computer processors is in use in Eastern Europe.  Originally this was used as a joke.  Cheese Pizza was the one that was used the most, but it's always a CP phrase because CP was used for child porn.

                 <p>
                  This is not really code, because it's so widely known, it's more like.....hence why this guy got arrested.    Again this phrase appears zero times in Podesta's emails.  Another fake code list was posted by some anonmyous person.  That was a complete hoax.  They faked a screenshot, but provided no link to the source.   Google searches from before Podesta's emails were leaked, show this didn't exist previously.

               <p>
                He has nothing to do with the hacking of John Podesta's email account.  We know exactly how that was hacked.  Because the people who did it targeted hundreds of other Americans with fake GMAIL password alerts like the one below.

              I couldn't agree more.  In part, that is my rationale behind the push to maintain quality posts with minimal shitposting.  If a sheep starts to wake up and get curious, they may go looking (censorship notwithstanding) for knowledge.  The Chans and Reddit will drive anyone above the age of 35 away.  It is very difficult for traditionally educated people to follow.

            The crisis PR spokesman Brad Bauman who was forced onto the Rich family to quash rumours he was killed for the DNC leak is friends with Erick Sanchez, who is also friends with James Alefantis. Erick Sanchez works for Frontier Solutions. Frontier also specializes in 'crisis management'. Sanchez was a main organiser for the Comet Ping Pong support demonstration. Tweeting about what a class guy DC police chief Peter Newsham is and how the event was "mission accomplished".

            If the cover up of Seth Rich's murder is revealed to have been due to his role in leaking to Wikileaks, then it should make the public question was the WeStandWithComet event a similar operation?

             I am convinced that NONE of these "rallies" or "demonstrations" are legitimate or authentic in any way. They are all PR stunts created for a purpose or to push an agenda.

            <p>
             The only one in recent years I would say was legit was the Maheur refuge one, and we all know how that one turned out

             Thanks for the info about Sanchez and Alefantis.  If Newsham was seriously interested in solving crimes he would look into this connection but we know we have seen him in pics with JA as well.  I don't think anything will ever be done about The Murder of Seth Rich. It's really disgusting, imo.
