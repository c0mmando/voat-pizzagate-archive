   I found an interview with a Satanist where she admits her family is involved in the occult as well as politics and I'm being downvoted because the lead involves Jews... Pizzagate is compromised.

<p>They\'re also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture. ( <a href="http://sli.mg/senxlZ">http://sli.mg/senxlZ)</a>). </p>
<p>Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members. </p>

<p>Guess what else?  He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass. </p>
<p>&quot;The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called &quot;Satanic Mass&quot; (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as &quot;the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio&quot;).&quot; </p>

<p>So now I\'ve just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn\'t surprising considering  the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews. </p>
<p>I\'m still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what\'s up.  Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil.  The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism. </p>
<p>The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists.  Jews are Satanic. </p>
<p>I\'m not religious, but look what Jesus said,  who was a Jew btw. </p>
<p>&quot; You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm</a></p>
<p>Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.  
</p>
<p>Now here\'s a lead for you guys to investigate.  The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics  and even names them. </p>
<p><a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/</a></p>
<p>She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it\'s common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism.  I can show you  statements made by both  Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.</p>',

            I believe this user is attempting to cause division.
           </p>
           <p>
            The content of the post is true, but the tone of the header is really divisive. And the user isn't using any of the tangible evidence, all he's providing is some bible quotes and symbolism. When in fact, Judaism is the source of satanism. Or more specifically, the Talmud is the source of this occult shit.

            Any Jew is forbidden to reveal to non-jews, what is written in the Talmud.

            I'm Jewish (reformed) and can say that I believe this is true from my experiences with Orthodox Jews and Muslims. They are fucking nut jobs with dark personalities who believe twisted shit. They don't care about lying and have very perverse ideologies. After my bar mitzvah, I stopped going to temple completely because the Jewish faith just centers around victim hood and death.

            It's a very complicated issue and that's on purpose. Research by a Jewish geneticist has indicated that some 80-90 percet of self-identified Jews are non-Semitic, hailing instead from an ancient kingdom known as "Khazaria", which ADOPTED judaism several hundred years ago in an effort to "clean up their image" (they were thieves, murderers and brigands). The REAL Semites? Appears to be the Palestinians, of all things.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a very complicated and confusing issue, since "Judaism" is a faith, and anyone can adopt a faith. Best to steer clear of it despite the obvious relevance.

              not so sure about that. go back only a few hundred years, and the "Saudis" ARE Jews, by marriage. So what's a Saudi? THAT was a construct of the British Empire, which is BARELY a hundred years old (Balfour Agreement I believe)...

            I know where you're coming from but we're gonna have to tread carefully with the whole judean connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would suggest a more specifically pointed reference to calling them out as followers of Sabbatai Zevi or maybe even just a Sabbataen sect.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are way too many existing mechanisms for control as soon as you highlight or use the word Jew.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even just highlighting a sect that follows the Talmud is too grey...
           </p>
           <p>
            we need a term for the Talmudic sect of Sabbataen Zionists.... that's not jews lol

             Most Jews have nothing to do with this shit and will probably support us. OP is a fagot.

              I agree,,,the average 'Jew' wouldn't have a clue about Sabbatai Zevi or the Sabbataen sect. The worst thing is by not recognizing that fact we risk alienating way too many people who can help...

              Only thing to do I think is to encourage the OP to back off this campaign and get Voat back to digging for EVIDENCE... if in the very end it leads us to Saudi's or a Sabbataen sect or Royal family's then we'll deal with it then but we can't jump to the end point or we'll just get shoved in a box and ignored... imho

               It's the top people from all the "groups". We can't discriminate based on race or religion. They have been using that to enslave all of us for thousands of years.
