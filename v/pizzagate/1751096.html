            I can't tell from this clip, how we know the guy is a CPP employee. But maybe there's more, not shown here, that makes that apparent. THAT aside, going by the beginning of the conversation, he's not a witness:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Were(?) you here when that, when all that went down?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "I was ten minutes away."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Because he was ten minutes away when the incident occurred, the rest of his account,
            <strong>
             <em>
              ...He shot LIKE, LIKE, three rounds...
             </em>
            </strong>
            must be based on what he's heard from another person (people) and/or media reports. I'm not saying he's lying, he probably believes what other people are saying is true. Keep in mind, he's had a lot of time to digest numerous varied accounts, and he's probably just sticking with the account that suits him.
           </p>
           <p>
            More of the conversation:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Where was he shootin it at?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "He was shootin it at a
             <strong>
              locked
             </strong>
             closet that he
             <strong>
              couldn't get into
             </strong>
             ."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Forgive my ignorance if I've missed or forgotten this detail -  I've read numerous accounts about
            <em>
             shooting the closet doorknob
            </em>
            . In their reports, did the media make a point that
            <strong>
             the closet was locked
            </strong>
            , or that the  crisis actor/shooter had
            <strong>
             specific intent to get into that closet
            </strong>
            ? And if so,
            <strong>
             WHY?
            </strong>
            What did he think he might find? A hard drive, captive kids? Either of those reasons would demand explanation, IF we had any speck of decency, competence, or honesty in what we used to call
            <em>
             mainstream
            </em>
            media. Rhetorical - I wonder how that FOIA request for Comet Ping Pong bullet hole pics is going?
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. Much love to OP,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/1ew">
             @1ew
            </a>
            , for scouring these videos. Time is gold, so thanks for spending yours on this cause. This story is
            <strong>
             <em>
              fucked up as hell
             </em>
            </strong>
            -
            <strong>
             YES IT IS
            </strong>
            . Fucked up reporting, fucked up non-investigation. The non-coronation of Queen Hillary REQUIRES the media to LIE, about everything, all the time now. If this stands as is, and sets the bar for the future, our own kids will will have to deal with that precedent.
