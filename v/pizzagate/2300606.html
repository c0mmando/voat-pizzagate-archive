<p>Any serious researcher into elite pedophilia will have read Nick Bryant\'s book: <em>The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse &amp; Betrayal</em>, the definitive account of the Franklin pedophilia ring.</p>
<p>Did you know that it was Nick Bryant who published Jeffrey Epstein\'s address book in Gawker:</p>
<p><a href="http://gawker.com/here-is-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epsteins-little-b-1681383992">http://gawker.com/here-is-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epsteins-little-b-1681383992</a></p>
<p>The one where Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew are listed?</p>
<p>They also published a number of other articles on Epstein &amp; the Clintons.</p>
<p>They did this when no one else had the guts to touch Nick Bryant\'s stories</p>
<p>Sad to say, bilionaire Peter Thiel went on a vendetta against Gawkwe because they published the rather well-known open secret of his homosexuality. He funded dirty tricks against the to the tune of millions of dollars, and finally drove them into bankruptcy by filing lawsuits against them repeatedly until they exhausted their insurance coverage and went bankrupt:</p>

<p>So now, the bankrupt assets of Gawker, including the archive of its stories, are up for sale, and Peter Thiel is one of the parties planning to bid on them, and he obviously has the money to bid way above what they are worth so as to guarantee driving out the other bidders and getting them. </p>
<p>His obvious intention is to delete the archive once he has completed the purchase. This guy is so vindictive, he has set a goal of deleting all of Gawker, trying erase them from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Most important quote: <em>the site, where I worked as a reporter for three years, was the first news outlet to air allegations of misconduct against Louis C.K., Kevin Spacey and other members of the political, cultural and journalistic elite</em>.</p>
<p>That would mean loss of any Epstein, Clinton, Spcvey &amp; other info that hasn\'t been archived (possibly in multiple locations, since I wouldn\'t put it past Thiel to attack sites like archive.is to try to force removal of archived Gawker pages.)</p>
<p>A portion of Gawkers back articles are still up, but if Thiel wins, they will be deleted within hours of his completing the purchase.</p>
<p>Is anyone else aware of other Gawker articles on pedophila and the elites? Please post links in this thread, and try to archive them.</p>

            Thank you for this. Totally agree that the gay bashing and racial shit has no place in here. Also if some makes a post about Muslim, Jewish involvement doesn't mean it's racist either. In the past got attacked for making Muslim post on different platform, yet I'll make a post about the pedo protecting the Pope and everyone agreed. We all know this involves all races, religions, Political, etc across the world. Most important thing sick vil Evil thing that the public should know about. More are finally waking to the horrible reality of this.

            You really have the balls to cite a Washington Post article on here while speculating on a conservative's intentions? My money is on Thiel turning Gawker into a conservative news source with a healthy amount of journalistic integrity, engineered to burn Hollywood and D.C. to the fucking ground.

            While I don't really do what you guys and gals do, I feel like I should remind you to download the zip copy from archive.is if you use it. You all should remember how a lot of your data was lost when another website was taken down so keeping your own local copy would be a good idea just in case.

             Yes, good advice. Another thing I have been doing is using the "File"&gt;"Save As" function to save a copy of the really important webpages on my harddrive.

             This, aside from the fact that in the haydays of the NSA, Thiel was basically.. the NSA in a mortal form. His company did more than half the analysis over there, but I'll forgive him for it. He's a successful, technologically inclined, gay Republican. Just the kind of person that the GOP should be putting on a pedestal to show that we're not a party of 'rich white supremacists,' we're a party of all sorts of Americans that happen to know how to do fucking math, and thereby abhor socialism.

            Several of Gawker writers were gays themselves. I read a lot of gay bashing in here of people equating pedophilia with being gay, which is ridiculous. But if you want another source of gossip that were talking about several Hollywood figures way before Gawker and whatnot that is The Datalounge, a gay website forum where lots of Hollywood insiders (like myself) hang and exchange their experiences in real life. Another great place is crazy days and nights, their blind items are legit and this week even recounted that Bryan Singer is desperate and tried to commit suicide to no avail.

              No, they are legitiamtely racist. This is what happens when you start censoring every forum. All these people have had to migrate and consolidate in other forums to speak.

              Yes, newcomers: please do not get discouraged by negative and vitriolic posts. There are plenty of people in here that are tolerant and accepting, and like you they want to end child sex crimes and/or satanism in government. I am about both myself.
