<p>Turns out the Children\'s Aid Society in Ontario is being used to kidnap children from their parents, those parents then go on to complain their kids are missing, being abused (one was pregnant at 13) and sometimes just never seen again. </p>

<p>Ontario Police are using Children\'s Aid Society to take kids from their parents whether they like it or not. This mother took her kid back and had a manhunt put out for her, as if SHE was the one hurting the kid. It\'s the fucking childcare in Ontario, they take people\'s kids away so easily and the parents have no say. Also the missing people list is VERY suspect, compare these two sites</p>
<p><a href="https://missingkids.ca/app/en/missing_children_database">https://missingkids.ca/app/en/missing_children_database</a> -&gt; official database, barely any cases</p>

<p>One is WAAAAAY longer than the other. Also TONS of 14-17 year old girls going missing in Toronto and Brantford. Will continue digging</p>
<p>WTF is this shit? Paying for a subscription to a &quot;missing kids magazine&quot;? Kinda weird <a href="http://missingkidsnews.com/subscription.php#sub">http://missingkidsnews.com/subscription.php#sub</a></p>
<p>I have also been curious about why this case had it\'s charges dropped. <a href="http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2013/09/11/former-grimsby-youth-pastor-arrested">http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2013/09/11/former-grimsby-youth-pastor-arrested</a>
The church is very strange and quite new-age-y for a Christian church. I know they have a basement and recently in November of 2016 they had the parking lot filled with police cars (including the black Mercedes vans that look similar to what kids were being transported in). The school next to it also recently underwent construction. I wonder if there are a few &quot;underground&quot; ties in the literal sense between the two buildings. I contacted the detective that is in charge of the case and hope to hear back. </p>

             I'm just digging up a lot of stuff. Let me know what's wrong and I can go back and check it out again. I haven't seen the lead seriously pursued so I'm not sure where to start.

            <p>
             "I am Allana Haist's uncle. Many of you know that I travelled to Cairo, Egypt early in 2016 in an attempt to mediate a solution to this complex situation. Since then, I have continued to work closely with a network of relatives and friends to ensure that Allana and Layla can live peacefully and safely here in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have set up the Allana Haist Custody Fund as a means of providing Allana and Layla with the money to secure a lawyer to help them through this legal dispute. Allana's ex- husband is a very wealthy Egyptian businessman with the financial resources to crush Allana's legal case over an extended period of time. The Allana Haist Custody Fund is intended to ensure that Allana and Layla have a fair chance to win their case."

            Everything needed for a satanic ceremony but at the time I had no idea what all the objects were. The library was useless but later I went to an occult bookstore and yes, confirmed all the objects, everyone of them

            - Mom denied access to daughter
           </p>
           <p>
            Fortier also asked that the Ministry of the Attorney General’s Office of the Children’s Lawyer (OCL) be appointed to represent Layla.
Ontario Superior Court Justice Theresa Maddalena denied both requests. 
“There is no evidence of harm to the child before this court at this time, other than the bald and accusatory statements of the mother,” Maddalena said, while ruling on the motions.
Fortier earlier argued that there is “ample material before the court to indicate that she has serious concern about the safety of her child.”
Those concerns, she added, are based on a lack of information about the child’s well-being, and concerns about lack of supervision.
Lawyer Roslyn Tsao, representing Layla’s father Mohamed Abdel-Motaleb, expressed concerns about granting access to Haist.
She said an affidavit signed by Haist said she “decided to take some time away from home to think about the situation and regroup.” However, when police took custody of Layla, her hair was cut short and dyed a different colour.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok I tying to make sense of this and why would they remove her from that area or put her with family wtf
           </p>
           <p>
            Fortier said the family also learned that Layla was removed from the region “despite the very clear provisions of the orders of Justice (James) Sloan.”
