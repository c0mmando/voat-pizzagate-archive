<p><strong><em>The Tomb</em></strong>: For nearly a decade, the things that occurred at the tomb of this deceased A- list child star (<strong><em>Heather O\'Rourke<strong><em>) actually resulted in her body being permanently moved to an unmarked grave in 2001. She was originally placed in an above-ground mausoleum (</em></strong>Westwood Memorial Park, Los Angeles</em></strong>), which is still marked with her name and at which people still leave flowers and teddy bears. The weird stuff began happening the day after her interment. A man was seen after sundown taking a bouquet of flowers from her grave, but he fled before he could be identified. In the summer of 1988 someone used red spray paint to write &quot;ALL WORN OUT - RR&quot; (<strong>&quot;Rocky Road&quot;</strong>*) (<strong><em>episode: &quot;Moscow on the Boardwalk&quot;</em></strong>) across the marble face of her vault. The family was notified, it was photographed, and then over the course of five hours the vault was cleaned. The police were called, but they didn\'t think it was important. For whatever reason the photograph didn\'t develop properly. Sometime in the fall of 1988 another man (probably the same as before, but there is no way of knowing) was spotted kneeling in front of her tomb after dark. He also fled when spotted. On the anniversary of her death in 1989, her family (mom, dad, stepdad, sister, grandparents) gathered at the tomb to remember her. It was very somber, they held hands, the sister placed a little stuffed Dumbo in front of the grave. As they were about to leave a man approached them and said something which frightened the mother. Her dad and stepdad each took her by an arm and led her away, back over to their car. Then they left. The unidentified man stayed behind and picked up the little Dumbo that the sister left and stuffed it in his pocket before leaving. Now here\'s where things get really strange. There wasn\'t much activity around her grave for several years. Then, in about 1991, her body was exhumed. It was done in the dark, so no one would notice. Her body was returned to the tomb three days later. In 1992, her body was exhumed a second time. One of the police present was asked why they were exhuming her again. He said, &quot;What do you mean, \'again\'?&quot; Turns out the first exhumation wasn\'t legal even though they had what looked like real police and really good paperwork. Why did they want with the body of a deceased 12 year old? Surely it would warrant an investigation, right? Nope. Anyway, the coroner\'s office kept her for about a week before she was brought back and we reinterred her. In 1994 somebody had smashed the face of her tomb, removed her body, cut some hair from her head, and (fortunately) placed her back in the crypt. A worker there saw the corpse and he said she looked remarkably well-preserved. He started to float the possibility that her body had actually been replaced with an exact replica. The police investigation went nowhere. In 1999 there was another vandalism of the tomb. It wasn\'t another smashing, but red spray paint had been used again to write &quot;BK KILLED ME&quot; (<strong><em>Bruce Kane</em></strong>- developer of Rocky Road). In the summer of 2001 her family had her body moved to an unmarked below ground grave.</p>',

            This is awful. :-(
           </p>
           <p>
            What are the stories about the filming of Poltergeist? Any evidence they summoned a real entity for the production of that movie?
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't help noting that Poltergeist planted the seed for the "ghost hunting" craze. I've been listening to a lot of talks by the exorcist Fr. Chad Ripperger, and he has said more than once that he has dealt with cases of demonic obsession (harassment) and even possession in people who got into ghost hunting. Turns out, it's not actually ghosts people are encountering, but demons. It's a modern form of necromancy not too different from the seances that were the rage during the 19th Century.
           </p>
           <p>
            Makes me wonder if they produced that movie to incite curiosity that would lead people unwittingly into a dangerous fascination with these evil entities. It's certainly true that Heather's heroic role in the movie made them seem less threatening.

             I dont think a real entity was summoned for the the film, LOL, but as we know, journalist Dominick Dunne’s daughter was murdered right after it finished shooting. Of course the crazy on-off boyfriend got the blame, but Dominick knew a lot of Hollywood secrets so honestly wonder if it was carried out by someone else as a warning to keep his mouth shut.
            </p>

             I look back at most suspicious Pedowood deaths now and can believe they were probably all hit jobs.

             Ghosts? Exorcism? And how about real live skeletons instead of props?   Yes I believe these were and usually are added to stir and interest those of the younger years.  Look at what Halloween has become.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://filmdaily.co/news/poltergeist-cast/">
              https://filmdaily.co/news/poltergeist-cast/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Many fans who try to trace the root of the hauntings and the curse believe one possible explanation is that, well, real human skeletons were used in filming the movie. In Poltergeist, Diane (JoBeth Williams) falls into a pool. It’s a pool full of skeletons. It was cheaper to use real skeletons than fake ones. Either way, they were really, really there.
            </p>
            <p>
             In an interview with TVLand, Williams said, “In my innocence and naiveté, I assumed that these were not real skeletons. I assumed that they were prop skeletons made out of plastic or rubber . . . I found out, as did the crew, that they were using real skeletons, because it’s far too expensive to make fake skeletons out of rubber.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Many believers in the paranormal say that by using the skeletons, the filmmakers tempted fate by using the bones of the dead in such a way.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Exorcism
            </p>
            <p>
             Fast-forwarding to the sequel Poltergeist II: The Other Side, an exorcism was conducted on the set of the film. Will Sampson, who played shaman Taylor in the movie, was very concerned about the use of skeletons in the first film.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sampson was reportedly so concerned that he offered to perform an exorcism on the set. No one knows what happened during the exorcism as Sampson did the ceremony alone in the dead of night. The next morning, however, the cast and crew reportedly felt “relieved”, which means that it was a success.
            </p>
            <p>
             As you know since you are aware of Fr. Ripperger that an exorcism must be performed by a real ordained priest and not a shaman.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those who are sensitive as am I be careful looking at the pics in this article.  Pretty scary stuff especially if you have been affected by the Judith and Heather cases.

              Sounds to me like a lot of folks got opened up to demonic persecution because of that film and how it was made.

               Still freaks me out. Can’t see her in any pics from that movie. Someone said in the comments that there was another girl molested on Brian K show. Even though he may be responsible I remember the first CDAN Bl says many took turns VILE. He possibly sold to pedo friends (fiends). This is why I have shortened my time on here. Brain has been overwhelmed with sadness.

               It's scary right?  I mean I have seen some awful stuff on here but I only saw that movie once and I wanted to run out. What really upsets me is that they had Children there and they floated those cadavers in the pool with them.  I can't even find words.

                 The real life story that The Exorcist was based on is hair raising. I have read it twice. Each time I was frightened by it. I may read it again just to refresh how evil satan really is. No wonder she was disturbed. Life Altering. Warren B was in that movie which freaks me out.

           <p>
            LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The death of 12-year-old ″Poltergeist″ actress Heather O’Rourke was ″distinctly unusual″ because she lacked prior symptoms of the bowel defect that reportedly killed her, gastrointestinal doctors say.
           </p>
           <p>
            ″I would have expected a lot of (digestive) difficulties throughout her life and not just to have developed a problem all of a sudden,″ said Dr. Daniel Hollander, head of gastroenterology at University of California, Irvine, Medical Center.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other specialists, also unconnected with the case, said Wednesday it was possible she died as the resulted of a birth defect, but added that the circumstances of her death were extremely unusual.
           </p>
           <p>
            A private funeral was scheduled for Friday at Westwood Village Mortuary in Los Angeles for the blond youngster, whose character encountered ghosts and warned ″They’re heeeere 3/8″ in ″Poltergeist″ and ″They’re baaaack 3/8″ in the sequel. Filming was completed on a third ″Poltergeist″ movie last June.
           </p>
           <p>
            Terry Merryman, spokeswoman for Children’s Hospital of San Diego, said Heather died Monday of septic shock due to congenital stenosis of the lower intestine, or bowel. That means she died of shock caused by infection in the blood, which in turn was caused by a birth defect that made a section of her intestine abnormally narrow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Such narrowing typically reduces bowel diameter to one-eighth inch instead of the normal half inch, impeding movement of food and fluid through the bowel. The defect usually is apparent at birth because it causes severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, Hollander said, adding that it is very rare for the disorder to kill an older child who lacked prior symptoms.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mike Meyer, the actress’ manager and lawyer, said Heather didn’t suffer chronic digestive problems, and the bowel narrowing wasn’t discovered until she underwent surgery and died on the operating table after suffering cardiac arrest en route to the hospital.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hollander speculated that Heather’s bowel narrowing might not have been congenital but could have developed suddenly due to inflammation.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, congenital bowel narrowing could cause sudden death after years without symptoms if infection caused the bowel to rupture or become perforated, said Dr. Frank Sinatra, head of gastroenterology at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meyer said a section of Heather’s intestine burst after ballooning to 4 inches in diameter. She contracted an intestinal parasite last winter, probably from well water at her former home in Big Bear, and her doctors assumed the parasite inflamed the intestine, he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moderate bowel narrowing at birth might not cause symptoms, but a lack of symptoms before age 12 ″would be distinctly unusual,″ said Dr. Paul Hyman, chief of pediatric gastroenterology at Harbor-University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, as the intestinal muscle upstream of the narrowing is strained by trying to push material through the narrowing, ″there may be more and more widening of the bowel tissue″ so it becomes infested with bacteria and eventually perforates or bursts, Hyman said.
           </p>
           <p>
            When intestinal narrowing is obvious, the defect is corrected by surgically removing the narrow section and connecting the normal sections on both sides, the experts said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hyman said congenital narrowing of the small intestine occurs in roughly one of every 50,000 live births, while such narrowing of the large intestine is about 10 times more rare.
           </p>
           <p>
            ″I cannot understand what precipitated the death because it’s usually clear when they’re born they have an important disease,″ said Dr. Carlo Di Lorenzo, a University of Southern California pediatrician.
           </p>
           <p>
            ″It just doesn’t seem to quite make sense,″ said Dr. Hartley Cohen, a USC gastroenterologist.
           </p>
           <p>
            ″It’s weird,″ Meyer said. ″She was completely healthy Saturday, they thought she had the flu on Sunday and she was dead on Monday.″
           </p>
