From the time of the predator\'s arrest, they have been trying to speak, but have been shut down by federal law enforcement and threatened with deportation if they speak. You see, the victims of this former A+ list celebrity in his corner of the entertainment world were children of primarily undocumented workers. These workers performed the tasks necessary to keeping the resort where the A+ lister performed open and clean. They thought he was being nice when he would invite their children to shows.

<p>So, why keep quiet about it? Why would the feds care about keeping that part quiet? Well, our A+ lister had financial backers. There were hugely expensive servers and encrypted cloud resources that were beyond what the A+ lister could do or had knowledge about. Much like with Epstein, you had the rich and powerful who would be exposed. Several of the rich and powerful are some of the largest political donors to campaigns for almost every office on the state and federal level. It would hurt the pocketbooks of politicians to have those people in jail or compromised. So, you keep everyone quiet and ignore what happened in person and focus on what happened everywhere else. The bad guy goes to jail and everyone was supposed to be satisfied with it. The thing is though, lots were not and wanted more justice and also money and to give their statements. Nope Threatened with deportation, they all have stayed quiet and they are expected to stay quiet about it forever. </p>

<p>Ex-Vegas headliner faints at 20-year sentence in porn case</p>
<p>Jan Rouven Fuechtener, 40, stiffened and fell backward over his chair after Chief U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro rejected his apology and his attempt to say he derived no gratification from thousands of pornographic videos and images the FBI found in password-protected files on nine computers at a home dubbed the &quot;fun house.&quot;</p>
<p>Fuechtener recovered after a sip of water, without medical assistance. His attorneys, Russell Marsh and Sunethra Muralidhara, said later it wasn\'t clear if he ever lost consciousness.</p>
<p>The judge branded Fuechtener a shameless liar and manipulator who dragged out his court proceedings &quot;like a soap opera&quot; and only regretted he got caught</p>
<p>This is not acceptable, here or in Germany or anywhere,&quot; the judge said, describing the videos as &quot;not just children having sex, but sadistic violent acts.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, prosecutor Elham Roohani sobbed as she recounted the &quot;heart-wrenching screams&quot; and &quot;whimpers&quot; of children forced into sex with adults on files she viewed preparing the criminal case.</p>
<p>Fuechtener blamed his pornography collection on boredom, a methamphetamine habit and people he surrounded himself between his six shows a week at the Tropicana resort while his husband, Frank Dietmar Alfter, traveled around the world. The show closed following Fuechtener\'s arrest in March 2016.</p>

            It would be nice if u had a source to back up the claim that Trump visited a country and a month later a pedo ring was busted.

            Hi molly, I’m K and a political junkie too. Everything you said was spot on. Look back at the foreign countries Trump visited or visited the USA right after he took office. EVERY ONE within a month had (sometimes multiple) HUGE pedophile rings busted. NXIVM payments to Clinton Foundation they think might’ve been payment for trafficked humans. There is still one little boy who was a part of the Rainbow Garden they can’t identify. They don’t know where he came from.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rainbow Cultural Garden, connected to NXIVM, and Barbara Bush was connected to it and she died not long after info was leaked.  I saw on twitter where she was involved in the UK Op of RCG.  Quickly Scrubbed.

             I know this bothers some here that Trump is actually busting the pedaphile rings and the very top of the pyramid too...vatican and barclay of city of london.......without protection mafia / CIA will not go on. They are one and the same. So , bite the bullet and pay attn. to Kevin Annette , the only man who has been willing to take on the vatican by himself...now the numbers are growing. Big ritual and sacrifice planned for July in Vancouver. Wayne Madsen used to say there was an airport near DC that was used for trafficking to Vancouver. Began with an A...Wayne used to be in naval intelligence which seems to be the heart and soul of military evil....according to Dave McGowan's book on Laurel Canyon.........so many of the mkultra victim's fathers were in it. They experimented and sacrificed their own children. Fascists do not like women and children. Big "tell" as they say in poker.

              Is it Allen Dulles Airport?  He was first civillian head of CIA and brother of John Foster Dulles who was NY Senator and became Sec. of State under Eisenhower.  They were VERY powerful.  If he controlled the CIA it might have been that airport.  Must still be in operation.  Cant get rid of a good thing that supplies the perverted elites.    Barclay was that the bank that was robbed of jewels but they were really after a book with names of elite pedophiles?  Boy, you can't make this stuff up............

              Did The Bushes Try To Hide Their Connection To The Second Mile?
             </p>
             <p>
              On December 4th, 2017, Disobedient Media published testimony and research outlining a massive, well connected human trafficking and child pornography network located in various locations along the U.S. East Coast. The list of individuals connected to this wider network allegedly included disgraced former football coach, Jerry Sandusky.
             </p>
             <p>
              While Sandusky was initially caught for acts of abuse that occurred on Penn State’s campus, the Grand Jury probing the case noted that he had access to hundreds of vulnerable and disadvantaged youth, using his nonprofit The Second Mile to find victims. Despite Sandusky’s use of The Second Mile for these purposes, a number of high profile celebrities sitting on the organization’s board expressed shock after the misconduct was made public. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette noted that in 1990, President George H.W. Bush nationally recognized The Second Mile as a philanthropic “Point Of Light.”

              - Celebrities Unaware of Sandusky Charity Board Membership
             </p>
             <p>
              The allegations of sexual molestation of young boys leveled against a former Penn State football coach have shocked the nation, but a few celebrities were in for another jolt when they found out their names were directly tied to the coach's and apparently had been for years.
             </p>
             <p>
              From movie star Mark Wahlberg to baseball icon Cal Ripken Jr. and golf legend Arnold Palmer, a handful of household names were listed on the Honorary Board for the Second Mile Foundation, the charity former Penn State defensive coach Jerry Sandusky founded in the 1970s and, according to investigators, used to meet some of his alleged victims. Sandusky currently faces dozens of charges surrounding the alleged sexual abuse of several young boys over a 15 year period. He has admitted to showering with some of the boys, but maintains he is innocent of any criminal acts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some of the celebrities, like Wahlberg and Ripken Jr., said they never had any idea they were on the board and only had a passing acquaintance with the charity.

              David Copperfield accused of drugging, assaulting model when she was 17
             </p>
             <p>
              On Wednesday, David Copperfield preemptively released a statement saying he supports the Me Too movement but cautioned against rushing to judgment about false allegations.
             </p>
             <p>
              Shortly after, a new, decades-old sexual assault claim broke against the famed illusionist.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to The Wrap, aspiring model Brittney Lewis, then 17, was drugged and sexually assaulted by Copperfield in 1988.
             </p>
             <p>
              The alleged assault happened after she competed in a modeling contest in which Copperfield was a judge, The Wrap reports.
             </p>
             <p>
              Copperfield, then 32, invited her to a show in California and later poured something into her drink in a bar. Lewis says she blacked out, but remembers him taking off her clothing and performing sexual acts on her in a hotel room.
             </p>
             <p>
              HELLO???!!!   He was 32 then, and he is still NOT LOCKED UP YET.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's no illusion: Lacey L. Carroll, who had accused magician David Copperfield of raping her in 2007, has been arrested in connection with another case where she alleged rape.

Somehow, he managed to keep the place secret, because paparazzi and countless fans of the director still don't know where exactly in the Madeira Archipelago these islands are located.“
