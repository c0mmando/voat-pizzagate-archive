<blockquote>
<p><strong>Former Phoenix New Times owners Michael Lacey and James Larkin</strong> have been charged in California with conspiracy to commit pimping in connection with their controlling interest in the Backpage adult classified ad portal, and warrants have been issued for their arrests.
State agents in Texas, meanwhile, raided the Dallas headquarters of Backpage and arrested Chief Executive Officer Carl Ferrer following allegations that adult and child sex-trafficking victims had been forced into prostitution through escort ads posted on the site.</p>

<p><strong>However, the fix is in.  California dismissed those charges, but charged with money laundering.  But they were \'prostituting children\'</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>California prosecutors can bring money laundering charges against the creators of a website that prosecutors label an online brothel</strong>, a judge ruled Wednesday.
<strong>He dismissed other charges, though, months after another judge threw out the entire case as violating free speech and federal protections</strong>
Prosecutors filed new and expanded charges against Backpage.com chief executive Carl Ferrer and website founders Michael Lacey and James Larkin this spring. The three pleaded not guilty after the judge allowed the money laundering charges.
Several of the victims in the case were from Tulare County, law enforcement said.
Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Larry Brown also dismissed 15 pimping conspiracy and other charges against Backpage.com’s operators.
He ruled that those charges relate to their publishing of sex-related advertisements and cannot be filed because of a federal law protecting free speech that grants immunity to websites that post content created by others.
Brown sided with California’s state attorney general that 25 of the original 27 money laundering charges alleging illegal bank fraud can proceed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It\'s a vile story: <strong>vulnerable teenagers are exploited online and lured into becoming victims of sex trafficking</strong>, &quot; <strong>said Attorney General Xavier Becerra</strong>. &quot;Today\'s victory doesn\'t exact justice just yet against those who would prey on vulnerable young women and men. But it brings us a step closer. Local, state and federal law enforcement authorities are working together to combat sex trafficking across California and the United States. We will vigorously prosecute this case.&quot; </p>

<p>The Young Centre is an organization built around championing human rights for <strong>immigrant children who are quite vulnerable</strong>. They fight for the improvement of the current immigration system in place in with the aim of having the children in deportation hearings to be viewed as children that require protection.
Children coming to Arizona are more likely to be separated from their parents as Arizona does not have detention centers for families. <strong>The Lacey and Larkin Frontera Fund have taken great pride in supporting the organization to recruit advocates and also train them for the children separated from their parents to offer the children various services.</strong>  (I bet they do)</p>

Children coming to Arizona are more likely to be separated from their parents as Arizona does not have detention centers for families.

             The Lacey and Larkin Frontera Fund have taken great pride in supporting the organization to recruit advocates and also train them for the children separated from their parents to offer the children various services.

           ( which is just one of Michael Lacey's hit pieces on Sheriff Joe)   in your attempt to smear Sheriff Joe with falsehoods claimed by Michael Lacey. (LOL).  My reply to his comment explains why I say this.

            Regardless of any smear campaign Joe's record speaks for itself and the cases of child sexual abuse (one was 3, or 2, can't remember) that were never investigated bc the children where latino.  He is a racist.  No hero material here.

            Good God, this guy Lacey tries to make himself out to be a moral hero while at the same time being busted for running a thinly veiled online escort platform. What seriously evil scum. These are subhumans who follow no moral code and will conjure any ridiculous fictional image of themselves in order to pursue their deviant sexual impulses, using our own moral codes and sympathies as weapons against us. Our own survival dictates that we must destroy them.

            A smear machine?  Unlike the Backpage guys, Arpaio was convicted of a felony and also had to pay like $140 million in civil suit and misspent another $100 million in jail funds.  The guy was a disaster.

            The pimping charges were thrown out because they were not doing any pimping.  They were publishing ads.  They are afforded the same protection that Voat would be if I published something illegal on their site.  I would liable not Voat.

             Wrong. Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt of court, which is NOT a felony. They lessened the charge so they could deny the Sheriff a trial by jury.

            I'm being patient. Remember, that's what Sean Hannity counseled. "Be patient," he said. I'm really, really, really trying. It's so hard. God bless anyone doing battle with this pedo scum. They are reprehensible, and there's no normalizing that.

              Just more coincidences that we should ignore. Any speculation will be cause for the WaPo to label us "crazies", for Snopes to say it's "debunked", and for The Cannibal Elite to generate a false flag.

              (sigh) It's hard being a herd animal.
