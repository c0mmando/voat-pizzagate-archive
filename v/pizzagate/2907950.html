<p>YELP! reviews of COMET since PG broke have been 4 or 5 stars and have a contrived vibe and are obviously edited ( many mentioning us \'freaks\' working on PG ). So I thought I would share some excerpts from diners who were not so glowing with their reviews and visited prior to the filtering that Yelp is now practicing. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/comet-ping-pong-washington">https://www.yelp.com/biz/comet-ping-pong-washington</a></p>
<p>&quot; My fiance and I went here the other night for dinner. <strong>I was a little thrown off by the amount of children in the restaurant</strong>...I guess my impression was it was more a bar than a restaurant and didn\'t realize how close to DC suburbia it was. The ping pong area was pretty much all kids so we didn\'t get a chance to check it out. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Every time I\'ve gone, <strong>the ping pong area has been infested with children</strong> (even fairly late into the evening and then they take the tables down for live music) so I\'ve never gotten to play in all 3 times I\'ve been there. I really wish they\'d do something to <strong>discourage parents from bringing their kids</strong> since it really is more of a bar atmosphere otherwise, and the shows are usually punk rock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Additionally, the restaurant seems to have grown grubbier over time. On our last visit (meaning both the most recent - and the last time we plan to eat here), the restrooms were gross - skeevy gas station bathroom level. And it wasn\'t just the can; the wall next to our table was splattered with dried food and drink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am glad we sat outside because after we ate, we decided to go in to check out the atmosphere and ping pong tables (hopefully try to play a game), but <strong>there were children running around EVERYWHERE!! It seemed as though there were 50 children.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot; We came to eat here following multiple recommendations and were so disappointed - the pizza is simply not good. The worst we had in DC. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The service was horrid. No silverware, no napkins without asking, no refills, and every employee it looked wore whatever they wanted and were all chatting with each other instead if working. I also overheard the person next to me complain about the service.&quot;</p>
<p>\' Josh was a very rude bar tender. He held hostage hospitable services from the customer - a policy that disgusts me and if indicative of the rest of Comet bar staff I cannot recommend this establishment. Also when I told Josh I\'d write this review he said &quot;Fucking do it. Nobody fucking reads Yelp reviews anyways.&quot; \'</p>
<p>EPILOGUE: Excerpt from Washington Blade article right after fake gunman incident at Comet: </p>

<p>\'Josh Vogelsong, a Comet Ping Pong bartender who performs in drag and books shows at the restaurant as part of its entertainment venue, told Slate.com that he and at least two other drag performers who performed there have received harassing messages, including death threats, on Instagram and other social media from Pizzagate believers. Most of the threats and harassing messages he and the other two drag performers received have been anti-LGBT in nature, he said. One Instagram user called him a “dumb bitch or whatever the fuck you are” and a “fucking tranny.”</p>',

            Ok, in this review we find out that the customer had two orders. One was "spring chicks" and the other was "the Jimmy".
           </p>
           <p>
            We've been going to Comet since 2007.  Brought my college aged kids, brought friends, brought families and just come with other adults.  The experience tonight was so bad, we WILL NOT GO BACK AGAIN.  We ran through the rain to get to Comet, and of the three greeters, not one could be bothered to grab the door and help us get inside.  They were the most cold unfriendly hostesses and not a smile shared amongst them.  We arrived early after a book event at the wonderful Politics and Prose.  Took awhile to get seated, even though there were empty tables, I headed for the bathroom.  As you know they are camouflaged and that's part of the entertainment value.  Unisex, I pushed the first door open and the smell of a bus stop emanated out the door, so much so that I retreated. Tried the other thinking the urinal had overflowed in the first, but that's where the urinal was in the second.  Went back to the first, and just prayed that nothing of mine would touch anything in there!
           </p>
           <p>
            Waiter was OK, didn't seem to know the beers or pies very well.   We tried a summer special Spring Chicks and an old favorite the Jimmy.  Spring Chicks was tasty, it's a white pizza with pesto, no sauce.  The Jimmy had two microscopic meatballs piled on maybe 2-3 slices of the pie.  We instantly asked the waiter for a side of meatballs because the pie was practically naked.  Waiter did check back briefly.  At the end of the meal, when I asked for the check and an extra piece of paper so I could write the Manager a note.  The waiter got more attentive, I assured him it wasn't about him and he wanted to go get the manager.
           </p>
           <p>
            An over sized frat boy arrived at our table after about 10 more minutes.  I actually tried to be nice and stated that I loved the place but after this evening probably wouldn't be coming back.  He asked why and I shared with him the poor hostessing at the door, the lack of quality food and the disgusting bathrooms.  He said  the Jimmy normally has five meatballs on it, he would remind the cooks.  I wanted to hear, I'm going to remove the meatballs you had to order in addition from the bill.  He continued with he was sorry and hoped we would come again.  WTF?!  Would you?  Drive to Columbia, MD and try PUB DOG, high quality pizza and delicious beer.  Head to a gazillion other places, but I wouldn't waste my time waiting on a table with a crew of staff that are so busy trying to be cool they forgot what customer service is about!

            Seems you missed the most creepy review.....We heard about ping pong tables and just had to check it out.   Front of the restaurant is full of booth style tables with "ping pong" Type tables, pretty cool keeping with the theme.  In the rear there are three ping pong tables with ample space for playing, and a "gum ball" machine with balls for .50 cent.  The paddles lying around are below average so bring your own.
           </p>
           <p>
            At first the place was great,** ping pong in the rear**, good beer on tap, and food in the front.
            <strong>
             Then the rear started to turn into a playground
            </strong>
            .
            <strong>
             at one point I counted in excess of 15 kids under 10 wanting to "play.
            </strong>
            <strong>
             Parents who couldn't understand why they couldn't "play".
             <strong>
              No wonder the paddles are all ruined.
             </strong>
             Seemed parents enjoyed hanging out the bar to drink while they sent their kids to the rear for unsupervised playtime.

            The menu is simple, pizza, salad, beer wine, but not being able to think with the melodious sound of a dozen little ones running around, we opted to eat elsewhere.

             Hah and I had one of them argue it's upscale to me yesterday, as if this is upscale. Although their food appears to be good... So they have that going for them I suppose.

            Don't forget the findings by "Pod Awful TV" on youtube. They make fun of us a lot and yet, they found some alarming things that lend credence to these reviews. Their videos about this issue are some of the most important out there, because they are ANTI-pizzagate-research even to this day. The videos speak for themselves, and their position on this whole thing lends credence to their footage not being set up (they explain the parts that were a prank later on).

               Washington Pundit doesn't seem that reliable to me. Here's what I do: Go to the site and poke around. Look at their Contacts and About pages. Do reporters use their names? Do they have bios? Look at their news topic pages. Is their reporting wide ranging? Do they cite their sources and preferably, link to them when available? Are their headlines clickbaity? Do they clearly delineate news from editorial opinion and speculation? Do you get a sense they have a certain bias in the way they approach information? Do they repeatedly push certain ideas with scanty support? Do you get the sense that they are putting a spin on events or facts?
              </p>
              <p>
               I also usually do a quick search of the site to see how they cover certain topics that tend to be heavily buttered with disinfo: How do they cover Julian Assange? Michael Flynn? Antarctica?
              </p>
              <p>
               As for the Clinton CP "bombshell", I commented on that -- the memo from the FBI that is the source of this pretty much itself debunks the idea Wiener received CP from Clinton or Huma.

             There have been news reports though. This is from the Catholic News Agency:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Sydney, Australia, Dec 12, 2018 / 10:48 am (CNA).- Cardinal George Pell has been convicted by an Australian court on charges of sexual abuse of minors, according to media reports and CNA sources close to the cardinal.
             </p>
             <p>
              A judicial gag order has restricted Australian media coverage of the trial since June.
             </p>
             <p>
              Despite the gag order, a story published Dec. 11 on the Daily Beast website first reported that a unanimous verdict of guilty had been returned by a jury on charges that Pell sexually abused two altar servers in the late 1990s, while he was Archbishop of Melbourne.
             </p>
             <p>
              The verdict reportedly followed three days of deliberations by the jury - the second to hear the case. An earlier hearing of the case is reported to have ended in early autumn with a mistrial, after jurors were unable to reach a verdict.
             </p>
             <p>
              In October, two sources close to Cardinal Pell, members of neither his legal team nor the Catholic hierarchy in Australia, told CNA that the first hearing of the case had ended in a mistrial due to a jury stalemate. One source said that jury was deadlocked 10-2 in favor of Pell.
             </p>
             <p>
              In remarks to CNA Dec. 12, the same sources independently confirmed this week's report that a guilty verdict had been reached.
             </p>
             <p>
              The conviction has not yet been confirmed by the Australian judiciary, and the gag order on Australian media could remain in place for several months.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pell will reportedly be sentenced in early 2019. He will not be incarcerated prior to his sentencing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Citing deference to the gag order, the Vatican has declined to comment on reports of the guilty verdict.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The Holy See has the utmost respect for the Australian courts. We are aware there is a suppression order in place and we respect that order," Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told reporters Dec 12.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pell has been accused of multiple instances of sexual abuse of minors.

            Yep yep yep we've been pushing this the entire time, great point and great thread. The fact of the matter is that even Mr. ""Everything they say about me is true. Except I don't like kids" Alefantis has a secret loathing for them he certainly enjoys having them come to his ginger bread house and brick oven. You can just smell the contemptuous snot from a mile away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything is supposed to be all sweet and innocent but the kiddies can hang out for grunge rock if they like and get their ears assaulted along with their anuses if they stay around long enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            The way these reviews sound it looks like he filled the place with preshow children for the mature clientel to ogle over and see which ones they could groom to stay later, the SAME kind of attraction he used Doktor Pong for in Germany.SO EASY to see through this turd...
           </p>
           <p>
            ...but it's also easy to SEE THE MONEY THE AGENCIES ARE PUTTING INTO THIS TO COVER IT UP, GOOGLE RESULTS FOR JAMES ALEFANTIS COME UP WITH THE WAPO ARTICLES AND THE SHOOTER INCIDENT FOR PAGES EVEN WITH A VOAT TAG, THEY ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO REPRESS US.

              <p>
               <strong>
                Pinging Doktor Pong
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The Obama-Alefantis connection has deeper roots, as shown by the availability of a ham-and-pineapple pizza in East Berlin. Our passage to Hawaii starts below the Berlin Wall, or what’s left of it, into the Death Strip on the edge of uber-hip Green Party stronghold Prenzlauerberg. This section of the infamous wall was preserved as a stretch of open space to memorialize East Germans who attempted escape but were gunned by the GDR border guards.
              </p>
              <p>
               Post-Cold War, the Death Strip is a graffiti-sprayed playground for teens, with its Sunday afternoon Bearpit amateur karaoke show in the amphitheater and outdoor basketball courts (take note, Barry, and be sure to tuck a hankie in your back pocket). Adjoining the Turkish ghetto of Kreutzberg, the Death Strip is a gay-cruising zone for those hankering after Arab, Kurdish, Kosovar, Bosnian or Albanian hot meat on a stick, a spicy kofta kebab slathered with tahini sauce.
              </p>
              <p>
               In year 2000, James Alefantis and partner Oliver Miller discovered Prenzlauerberg, where Miller opened Dr. Pong, a ping pong bar. San Francisco architect Miller had arrived to Berlin earlier, in 1993,
               <strong>
                when he noticed that ping pong is the only low-cost sport for plebeian youths in every sad town from Muncheberg to Kosovska and Bucak, Turkey. Playing ping pong is an easy way to strike up a conversation with penniless and hungry young kids eager to please an older male who takes them under his wing
               </strong>
               . In the sexually segregated Muslim realm, sex between an older man and a young boy is taken casually as a misdemeanor that goes unnoticed as opposed to the felony of adultery by a woman, which is punished by the death penalty. The bored boys from nearby Kreuzberg are easy pickings drawn to the bait of ping pong and beer.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just up the street from the Mauerpark market, the ping pong tables at Dr. Pong provided the model for Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington D.C. The Berlin pedo-center is described in a reddit post: “Dr. Pong is a rugged little dingy bar in the heart of Prenzlauerberg, reminiscent of a teenage clubhouse with its minimal decor.” Note “teenage”. Its limited beverage menu is mostly non-alcoholic for entry-level rough-trade Muslim boys circling around the game tables for the next volley in the group game of “Around the World”, a dress rehearsal for a daisy chain.
              </p>
              <p>
               While the Doctor doesn’t do beer deliveries to embassy residences, there’s probably a lot of demand from diplomats for take-out meat sticks, judging from the great reviews on Trip Adviser’s English-language list of the top 10 bars in Berlin. The Top Ten list fails to include the plusher interior of the fetishist KitKat Club. Another telling indicator is that 666 bar-hopping tours stop at Dr. Pong, indicating a connection to the Satanic rites similar to those in DC. What’s intriguing about Dr. Pong is that its male-on-male games may have provided the concept for torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Graibh prison.
              </p>
              <p>
               During the last years of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) or East Germany, Prenzlauerberg was the favored residential district for gays, hippies and avant-garde artists, a tradition that continued after national reunification in October 1990. Prenzlauerberg is also the location of Rykestrasse Synagogue, the largest Jewish center in Berlin, which was restored at great expense after reunification while Berlin was being restored to its former glory as a Jewish capital with coprophilia clubs and fetish bars to degrade the goyem.
              </p>
              <p>
               Oliver Miller’s arrival in 1993 coincided with the massive expansion of human trafficking of children for the European pedophile sex trade out of the war-torn Balkans in the wake of the Clinton-Blair NATO interventions to break apart Yugoslavia. Berlin was a transit point for children transshipped between Belgrade and the UK by the Kosovar mafia and Western military contractors including DynCorp. London is the wholesale global market for child sex slaves through fraudulent NGOs that act as adoption agencies.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sadly for Alefantis and Miller, the pair arrived a few years too late to join SchwuP, the Movement for Gay, Pederast and Transsexual Rights, which until 1987 was a wing of the Green Party, itself a product of the sexual liberation and drug experimentation theories of the CIA-allied Frankfurt School. Even after being busted for possession of methamphetamines, SchwuP leader Volker Berg survives as a parliamentarian in the Bundestag as the crusty old chief of the German-Israeli Parliamentary Friendship Group. Go chew on that, vice cops and DEA agents.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 1986, Volker’s “Schwuppies” distributed this Green Party flyer to parliamentarians: “He is a boy, roughly 10 years old, with a pretty face, full lips, a straight nose and shoulder-length hair. The wings of an angel protrude from his narrow back, and a penis is drawn with thin lines on the front of his body.” In any country other than defeatist Germany beholden to the Israeli pedophiles, this sort of drivel is called illegal pornographic trash and justification for SWAT shoot-to-kill raids.
              </p>
              <p>
               The politically ambitious Greens eventually had to repudiate their support for sex with kindergarteners by their founders including Danny “the Red” Cohen-Bendit, the CIA-promoted leader of the 1968 student riots in Paris. The pedophile campaign was carried forward until 2008 by Volker Berg’s partner Jacques Teyssier, a former member of the French intelligence service, who was on board of the Lesben und Schwulenverband in Deutschland (LSVD), the lesbian and gay association in Germany. The German gay movement is obviously a brainwashed arm of the CIA.
              </p>
              <p>
               The darker side of the pedophilic underground has since been carried on by a provocative novelist with the pen name Klaus Wanninger, the Anonymous of the Karlsruhe-based Schwaben-sumpf (the Schwabian Swamp). Sadistic and Satanic imagery was developed in parallel by this deviant strain, which obviously has had a huge influence on the artists and customers at Comet Ping Pong Pizza.
              </p>
              <p>
               In early 2012, Alefantis and Miller teamed up to start a restaurant called Nalu or “wave” in Hawaiian. The partnership in the Berlin restaurant inspired Alefantis to sponsor a “sausage festival” at his Buck’s Fishing and Camping restaurant in Washington DC to honor a visit by Oliver Miller. There is no indication that Nalu or Dr. Pong has ever celebrated Octoberfest in Berlin by adding traditional bockwurst mit sauerkraut und senf (mustard) to their menus.
