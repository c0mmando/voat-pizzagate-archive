            , it's a mighty big stretch that this has anything to do with sexual exploitation of kids by the global elite. The only reason I am leaving it up is for someone to please:

            If you comment at the daily, and have seen the article with new Pentagon pics from 9/11 released, I could use help redpilling people on pedogate if you can get posted. It's overwhelmingly doubting of the new pictures, and I've never seen people so wide open about 9/11 there. It's odd, tbh because people were freaking out about Sandy Hook theorists just this week AND the coverage of pizzagate rally in DC. I trolled a bit in the 9/11 thread thinking, lemme be open to this, thank fbi thank DM. I got red arrowed hard, made one "vomit" So I then played the card of, well if you're willing to believe all that is 9/11 it's not a stretch to believe pedogate/pizzagate. they question the narrative NOW on 9/11, are they gonna wait 15 years to question it on Pedogate as presented. I dropped some bombs from trafficking to organs, and implored people not to sign their donor cards just yet. I'm perplexed, figured I'd put it out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            This means to me there's people shilling, repeating the theorists and truthers who question events suddenly makes me think something big was touched upon, or is about to be. It looked like an equally divisive tactic because errybody was kung fu fighting. It was absolutely bizarre. 9/11 is still touchie among a lot of people still, even not so much normies. And definitely comment in these articles and I will as well!

             I've gone past the realm so to speak, and was pol/d (I need to find a classic before /pol after /pol picture. I happened upon a link posted to look at old german propaganda and goebbels writings for kids. I realized my grandfather made me read these as a child, they were familiar, and I enjoyed them, and his writing style. I hadn't an idea it was frowned upon. I grew up in a folk help folk (or volk as uncle Adolph said (his real name lol) family. ANY of my family that were WW2 vets that spoke, it was barely a thing of their experiences. They seemed traumatized, but sworn to carry the secret? Even Vietnam vets are more open, and they're a closed mouth bunch. My dad was.
            </p>
            <p>
             Grandpa just said the war made him think differently. I think his view on Jewish was particularly interesting to me. He scoffed at my history books, only thing said he thought of Jews not as much the victim and hopes the war he fought helps my generation, and my own generations down the line. He had to serve and was willing after Pearl Harbor which is why most of my male volk are military, especially ww2 vets. I have vets from all wars here and abroad. They'd be sad that generations still had to fight (((them))) (rain down the downvotes but I was the only one grandpa spoke to about that, and told me so. He had me hide the literature, I didn't know why at the time. But fully see why today. I grew up with all kinds, and my view was I don't mind you if you're not minding me and my demise. I'm all for anyone respectful of people, and help their folk when they can, loving their country is a plus (in the free world that is)

             My grandpa was /pol before it was a thing. I spent a lot of time studying genealogy with him. I realize it's an unpopular view even here, but if you really research things well, and not rely on what we've learned in school you'd be freaking astounded. South/North kids were definitely taught different types of history, especially of the Civil War. Imagine history teachings if we have future generations if we don't start naming the jews tinkering. People's rage is at boiling points in normal people, imagine others. If it stops, there's still a chance without mutual destruction. This one's the tipping point, there is no next one to start correcting, as it's been told "History repeats itself" if not corrected, it's like the definition of insanity.

             /plz don't send me back to pol, I made one post and was banned. Is it safe to post normally without a damn vpn? I was using Hoxx and the dang ban was for a week. Evading a ban. Shall I just post there with say OperaOpenVn. I like the place, and can contribute to pizzagate especially. There's not much of anywhere to speak openly, privately anymore. And here, but sometimes my opinion is a bit zesty, suited for "over there"
