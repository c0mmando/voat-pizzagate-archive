<p>MIAMI, Florida, USA (sentinel.ht) – The former director of the Economic and Social Assistance Fund[1] (FAES), Klaus Eberwein, was declared dead by suicide by the Miami Medical Examiner after his body was found in a south Date motel on Thursday.
Eberwein’s death came a day before he would have testified before a Haiti Senate Committee on the management of the PetroCaribe fund and to alleged misappropriation of international donor funds by the Clinton Foundation following the 2010 earthquake.</p>',

            People here disparaging Eberstein's link to the Clinton Foundation should remember that the Clintons practically ruled Haiti. Nothing happens there without a Clintonite footprint.

            So, an official from Hillary's time in the state department - when she visited Haiti more often than Japan or Germany - testifying on corruption and dying shortly before that of suicide while in the process of buying a new restaurant and apparently having been 'in good spirits' shortly before - well if that ain't a fucking red flag I don't know what would be.

            Problem is the Haiti Sentinel is not a newspaper, it's not located in Haiti and it comfortably fits with fake news, citing nonsense news sites like Infowars.  Look at the bottom.  The facts in this report come from the Miami Herald. The fake part about Hillary Clinton is taken from the fake news site yournewswire
           </p>
           <blockquote>

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This guy puts his own byline on the article like he did the reporting, but he uses whole paragraphs from this Miami Herald report and I bet he didn't pay them, just stole their content.

            There nothing that ties PetroCaribe Investigation to the Clinton Foundation.  Zero.  The idea that the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission came from nonsense news.  Do a search prior to this month, you zero hits.  This needs to be flagged as fake

           <p>
            Put your critical thinking cap on read this paragraph
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Eberwein was scheduled to appear Tuesday before the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the head of the commission, Sen. Evalière Beauplan (Nord-Ouest/PONT) confirmed. The commission is investigating the management of PetroCaribe funds. He was also widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Do you see the deception?
           </p>
           <p>
            Two true sentence followed by the fake.....  Two parts Miami Herald + one part YourNewsWire.  This is what tipped me off this guy didn't do any original reporting.  If he actually was getting , Sen. Evalière Beauplan to confirm the investigation, he would have to use "widely believed."  He could have a genuine official comment if this was true.

             I see the deception. And it is so annoying to see so many smart and influential people retweeting and sharing this story as gospel.  Really James Woods ? Thought you had an i.q. of 170 !
pgate is real. this story is not. imho it was was planted to bury the lede which is peter smith's real story. And also as a great way to make all investigators look dumb when it's further revealed as false.
i found gilbert bailly of the pizza place's facebook page. the dead guy's wife wrote out sad story about the dead guy. This story looks like a case of a guy who was depressed and felt like a loser and overdosed with alcohol and drugs.
             <br/>
             And I am really bothered that creepy mega gehy owner of yournewswire is the FIRST one to publish this story.
The owner / creator of yournewswire, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, is a major art/partying/alefantis type of guy who is married to an equally ghey rich artsy type, Sinclair G. Treadway

              If that were true, it still wouldn't have, would have anything to do with the OP's claim.

              Also is that true?  Your link does not show what you claim.  You are misreading that article.

               You are right about the link, it doesn't do what I said.  I had several links open and linked to the wrong article.  I could go back and search for it, and I believe it may have been in Spanish, but WND has a link on this suicide.

                And they are doing the same "widely expected" and "reportedly" dodge.  If there are actual reports on this point to them.  All these wide expectations came out after the guy died.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you do a search for the name of the government commission and Clinton for the past two years before this guy killed himself, you find nothing.  These "wide expectations" are bunk.

            Wow, congrats because we must be doing something right to get so many shills here spreading disinfo! Have no idea WTH that shlill was, but the story has been covered by what are considered reputable media outlets.

            Edit: nvm I found it. Going to look into this further. But I'm still certain that Neoonettle and Yournewswire are honeypots
