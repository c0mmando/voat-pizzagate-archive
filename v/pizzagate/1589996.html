            Part of it is the "death of god" that came with the enlightenment and subsequent tools gleaned from materialistic determinism. Seeing people as bags of chemicals makes it much easier to do this kind of thing.

            (Wall of text warning)
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I've found out after wasting years of my childhood and early adulthood on researching conspiracy theories, there are 3 main tiers to what you would consider "Early Pizzagate":
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             The Unholy Figures (Ringleaders)
            </li>
            <li>
             The Government (Subordinate Lapdogs)
            </li>
            <li>
             The Consumers (Profiteers)
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Of course, it's a lot more complicated than that as there are all sorts of subdivisions but simplified there are 3 distinctive groups of these "people". Technically, you could call these people the Illuminati as they are in a way "enlightened" about a world that until late last year most of us never dreamt existed, let alone thrived. However, I prefer not to as it's bordering on cheesy, and I consider it impolite to refer to these subhuman scum as if they were an official organization or authority. With that out the way, let's just cut to the chase, shall we?
           </p>
           <p>
            So, you have your first tier. These people think, act, and make like they are living Gods, physically untouchable, and not on the same plane as you or I. I shouldn't even need to mention that a certain family, whose surname begins with the letter R all consider themselves as such. After all, they are the most powerful people in the world. They control everybody below them in the top and middle tier, preferring to leave the bottom tier to those operating in the middle.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Royal Families, or at least, their perverted present-day iterations, are neck-deep in it. The only difference between Elizabeth BÃ¡thory and Elizabeth
            <em>
             Windsor
            </em>
            (Saxe-Coburg) is that the former got caught. The latter will almost undoubtedly take all that she did to the grave. Before I heard about the Kamloops Genocide, I was a staunch Monarchist who sneered whenever the discussion of Republicanism was brought up. What she did is unforgivable in any amount of lifetimes. May God choose not to save her, and instead let her burn for eternity in the pits of hell.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Papacy was compromised a long time ago. Since at least Paul VI, possibly even further back. It has become a cruel mockery of what started out under Saint Peter. Although specific accusations against the Vatican may or may not be true, what is certain is that evil deeds have been carried out by the most recent administrations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next you have primarily high-ranking Government officials and owners of Empires. These people hold a lot of control, including direct creative freedom applying to all those below them, but rescind their most authoritative actions to those working above them. Think George Soros. David Rockefeller. Henry Kissinger. In return for being what those at the top would call a 'good sport', they receive any and all Earthly desires they could possibly want, including extended vitality. It's no coincidence all of these individuals named are living well into their triple digits in spite of them looking like they should've fell apart a good couple of decades ago. They have yet to perfect immortality, but do understand the basic concept with regards to working towards that goal. They operate knowing full well at any time they can be betrayed by those at the top, and are in esssence fall guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the most part, the entertainment industry is that third tier that I was talking about earlier. If you haven't done so already and have some time to kill, read Henry Makow's anecdotes sometime. The man is off his fucking rocker, no-one's denying that, but what he regales with regards to Hollywood is usually on point. There was another one, a woman, who quit the film industry in disgust after being told she'd have to sleep with the director, and she often referred to Makow's teachings though for the life of me I can't remember her name.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's certainly a touchy subject and one I'd dread to imagine is real, but either through powerful adrenochromal hallucinations or actual interplanal communication, they are in frequent contact with an entity referred to as "Rain Man." Sounds stupid I know, and most of you will be reminded of the Dustin Hoffman/Tom Cruise movie about the struggles of a middle aged savant, but if you listen to the number of singers who specifically refer to a "demon" known as "Rain Man" you can't deny there is something very fishy going on in the background.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this third and final division you have a great admixture of people under varying levels of control ranging from slavish drone (Katy Perry, other MK artists) to quasi-independent moguls (those who profit off the bloodshed of innocents), to straight up pedophiles looking to get their rocks off in a discrete and non-revealing way (Clement Freud is a good example). At the end of the day these "people" wield no more control than you or I, reporting back to multiple masters and/or handlers at once, and are liable to be ejected at any time and thrown from grace should they act in a manner that they would deem unsatisfactory.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all due respect I could talk about this all day, but I fear that doing so will derail what I know as concrete too deeply into conjecture. This is the tumour this planet has been forced to bear for decades, possibly even centuries, and I will live to see it crumble, exposed to the harsh, burning light of popular society once and for all.

            Florida School for Boys aka Dozier School for Boys was a century old reformatory in the panhandle of Florida.  It was closed in 2011 after 111 years of continuous operation.  About 15 years ago, stories of the horror and abuse occurred there, generally between 60-65, owing to the age of the victims and the creation of the Internet.  There do not seem to be many claims after 1970.

            In addition, one of the victims, possibly more, have claimed MK ULTRA abuse.  The school was also near the Mariana Army Airfield, a rumored MK ULTRA test site.  This is where the information starts to run thin.

            Given the common thread of MK-XXXX within Pizzagate, the history of this place is submitted as background information in relation to everything we are ingesting.

             dungeons and cages are common- just makes me so sick.
I've been wondering if some of these Hollywood and Media freaks arent under mind control rt now.
             <br/>
             They have truly lost their minds.  It's getting old and boring.   Free Entertainment tho.
