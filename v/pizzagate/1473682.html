<ol>
<li>You own a family friendly pizza place and you have creepy art decorations cause you find those things hipster and cool but completely innocent</li>
<li>Podesta\'s emails are leaked by wikileaks, which has code-like language use + directs the attention to your pizza place accidentally</li>
<li>You as the owner of that place post creepy images, taped children, doll with price tag, comment sexual references on your public Instagram, which attracted other creepy people with further creepy posts and comments while all the posts were meant to be innocent jokes</li>
<li>Podesta brothers, who also love creepy arts, look exactly the same as an old police sketch that is related to a child abduction but the sketch only happened to look similar by chance since there are lots of similar faces on Earth.</li>
<li>People investigating this case find out what Andrew Breitbart tweeted years ago: &quot;How prog-guru John Podesta isn\'t household name as world class underage sex slave op cover-upperer defending unspeakable dregs escapes me.&quot; but Breitbart just misinterpreted something and died monthly after that because of an unfortunate heart attack. </li>
<li>Your profile picture can be linked to underage sex while you picked it for completely different reasons</li>
<li>You invite insanely creepy bands to your family friendly pizza place, one member in a mask(at another place) with modulated voice replies to loving boys/children as &quot;preferences&quot; and laughs like a maniac while you have no idea about any of those, you picked them because they are edgy</li>
<li>You are in direct connection with powerful politicians and you are on the list of the most powerful people in your area, which you achieved only with your high quality food.</li>
<li>Major news outlets come to your aid with debunk stories that fail to mention the true reasons why a crazy amount of people are convinced, they ridicule the case and claim it as 100% fake by providing only twisted, false explanations. They don\'t do this on purpose but because their lack of investigative journalism skills. Unluckily that causes people to be even more suspicious.</li>
</ol>
<p>Extra question: How many of your friends would remain your friends after point 1, 3, 7?</p>
<p>I am sure there are a lot more &quot;coincidences&quot;. Like a couple of people\'s death who investigated this, Soros being connected, the rare mutation of the eye, etc. Please confirm these things and I will add them to the list.</p>',
