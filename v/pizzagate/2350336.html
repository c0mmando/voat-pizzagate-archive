<p>I made good on my promise to further investigate the Paul Mitchell Estates. I’ve never had such a gut feeling about a place. Remember the first time you saw JA’s Instagram and the Podesta’s art collection. Yeah, that kind of feeling., but I was having trouble digging up info on a man called MARTIN CROWLEY. He was co-founder of Patron, a venture with John Paul DeJoria. He left a trust called WINDSONG that’s worth several hundred million dollars. </p>

<p>You are the Executors of the Will of the late Martin Crowley and the Trustees of the Windsong Foundation which was set up to receive the assets of his estate, apparently worth several hundred million US Dollars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I\'m far from finished, but what I found is so astonishing that I had to put it out there. I know there are a lot of geniuses on this site so I’m begging you to look into this. You don’t have to post it here, but do it on your own. If you want to send me a link so I can keep things together, it’s fine, but please make like the humble gopher and dig, dig, dig!!! </p>
<p>So my story starts with this guy Martin Crowley. I was going crazy trying to find something on him. I had that funny feeling about WINDSONG. Instead of #followthemoney, I do believe, it’ #followthetrust or #followthecharity. But the only thing I could find was a messy break-up story of a girlfriend who was sort of kinda helped with PATREON. It’s now the world’s largest manufacturer of tequila and co-founded by John Paul DeJoria and his old pal MARTIN CROWLEY:

<p>In 1989 my partner [Paul Mitchell] died, and I started the Patrón Spirits Co. with my friend Martin Crowley, an architect who\'d gone to Mexico to do some work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And before I get into this, it’s weird as shit that Crowley has his own homeless, rags-to-riches story. </p>

Edelstein and Crowley had met through a friend in 1989, 12 years before the incident. At the time, she was an unmarried 36-year-old with her own financial services company. She felt an instant connection with Crowley, a 6-foot SoCal native with puffy hair and dark eyes who lived in a guest cottage in Hermosa Beach. He had come down in the world after losing $8 million on various enterprises ranging from hotels to vineyards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, blowing $8 million sucks. But the real problem is that these stories keep changing. Like for DeJoria: </p>

<p>When I got out of the service in 1964, I didn\'t have the money to go to college, so I worked as a salesman for Collier\'s Encyclopedia. I had 10 jobs for the next several years until John Capra, a friend who was an employment counselor, said I should try the beauty industry. He said it didn\'t pay much at first, but there was no end to where you could go with it.</p>

<p>See how that one doesn’t compare with this one: </p>

Paul Mitchell and John Paul DeJoria.DeJoria grew up in Los Angeles in a poor family, and at a young age went to work, running paper routes and selling greeting cards. After graduating from high school, he bounced from odd job to odd job, selling office equipment, repairing bicycles, driving tow trucks, and working as a janitor. But the income was not enough, and he lived on the streets. After years of hardship, and with a stroke of luck, DeJoria landed a job as a circulation manager at Time magazine, and he worked his way up the ladder. Somewhere along the way, he met Scottish hairdresser Paul Mitchell. The two formed a friendship and decided to go into business together.</p>

<p>TIME MAGAZNE?!!!! Seems that keeps getting left out of the equation as does him being in the Hell’s Angels. </p>

<p>Yet, behind the image of John Paul DeJoria, there is a remarkable and inspirational story of a former Hells Angels motorcycle gang member who made an incredible journey from homlessness — living in his car — to becoming a billionaire and one of the world’s greatest philanthropists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See what I mean? I’m only surprised they didn’t have him living in his motorcycle … although I’m sure they tried to make it work. Then there’s DeJoria’s businesses. Yes, he mentions Paul Mitchell haircare products and PATREON, but he leaves a teensy-weensy bit out: </p>

<p>CONFLICT-FREE DIAMONDS? WTF?!!!! How’d that slip in?  But about Martin Crowley.  How the hell can a man that leaves several hundred million dollars not leave a footprint on the web? I even have a footprint so it seemed impossible, until I found this: </p>

<p>So that’s how! The filthy bugger changed his name … and Crowley? Is that really his name and is he related to THE Crowley or only emulating him?  Since I don’t have the answer to that, I went in search of Crowley’s trust: WNDSONG. It’s how I ran into this: </p>

<p>LOS ANGELES, Calif., February 24, 2012 — Teach For America announced today that it has received $3 million from two philanthropic organizations: Dream Fund at UCLA ($2M) and Windsong Trust ($1M).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TWO MILLIONS DOLLARS? Nice! While I knew WINDSONG TRUST what was that about UCLA’S DREAM FUND? Dream Fund? Is that connected with the DACA Dreamers? Were they aligned? I was clueless about that organization so I went in search and found this: </p>
<blockquote>

UCLA Chancellor Gene Block and Kirk Kerkorian, founder of The Lincy Foundation, today announced the formation of the Dream Fund at UCLA … </p>
<p>… The Lincy Foundation was established in 1989 to benefit charitable organizations in the U.S. and around the globe. … The Lincy Foundation has also generously supported Armenian charities in the United States, as well as endeavors in the Republic of Armenia. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>ARMENIA? WTF? The Lincy Foundation needs to be on our radar, but what about Kerkorian. The next fall down the rabbit hole was this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://themetalden.com/?p=57035">http://themetalden.com/?p=57035</a></p>
<p>On April 10, roughly five weeks before his untimely death in Detroit, late rock great Chris Cornell departed from the London premiere of “The Promise” film to personally visit an Athens, Greece refugee camp. His wife Vicky, among others, accompanied him.
While there, Chris reportedly met with refugee families and listened firsthand to the harrowing accounts of their escapes, along with sad tales of being separated from their children. …
… Yet, ONLY $16,000 in contributions? That is a paltry 8% of the entire proceeds taken in that actually went toward helping kids. ….
… TMD recenty broke the massive news story several days back about Chris Cornell reportedly being the target for assassination by an elite pedophile ring …
… TMD has also learned that the person responsible for the movie Chris was promoting before he died just so happened to be the founder of MGM Grand hotel, Kirk Kerkorian. Although, he died at age 98 on June 15, 2015. 
Yes, Chris Cornell himself passed away on May 18 this year at the MGM Grand hotel in Detroit. Just a coincidence? Or is there actually a deeper connection? … 
… As the story goes, Kirk Kerkorian personally financed most of the production for “The Promise” film himself, tagged with a giant $90 million budget, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Chris Cornell had an Armenian connection? But what about Kirk Kerkorian? What’s this about him being founder of the MGM Grand Hotel?  Don’t know what the MGM Grand Hotel is? It’s because it changed its name to the MGM INTERNATIONAL RESORTS … yes, the same place that owned Mandalay where the LV shooting took place! </p>

<p>In Memoriam: MGM Resorts International Founder Kirk Kerkorian (1917 - 2015) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you watched The Oscars last year, perhaps you recognize his picture. Yup, that’s right … KIRK KERKORIAN was honored at The Oscars in 2016!!!! </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-why-did-kerkorian-get-an-in-memoriam-at-the-oscars-20160228-column.html">http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-why-did-kerkorian-get-an-in-memoriam-at-the-oscars-20160228-column.html</a></p>
<p>Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian destroyed MGM. Why was he honored at the Oscars?</p>
<p>Jaws must have dropped in the film-buff community during the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment of Sunday\'s Oscars telecast when, among the nearly 50 departed actors, writers, directors, and others who made real contributions to the movies, the name and image of Kirk Kerkorian popped up.</p>

<p>So you tell me, is everyone to the point where we’re all willing to admit that something very strange is going on here?</p>',

           So that’s how! The filthy bugger changed his name … and Crowley? Is that really his name and is he related to THE Crowley or only emulating him?  Since I don’t have the answer to that, I went in search of Crowley’s trust: WNDSONG. It’s how I ran into this:

            On April 10, roughly five weeks before his untimely death in Detroit, late rock great Chris Cornell departed from the London premiere of “The Promise” film to personally visit an Athens, Greece refugee camp. His wife Vicky, among others, accompanied him.
While there, Chris reportedly met with refugee families and listened firsthand to the harrowing accounts of their escapes, along with sad tales of being separated from their children. …
… Yet, ONLY $16,000 in contributions? That is a paltry 8% of the entire proceeds taken in that actually went toward helping kids. ….
… TMD recenty broke the massive news story several days back about Chris Cornell reportedly being the target for assassination by an elite pedophile ring …
… TMD has also learned that the person responsible for the movie Chris was promoting before he died just so happened to be the founder of MGM Grand hotel, Kirk Kerkorian. Although, he died at age 98 on June 15, 2015. 
Yes, Chris Cornell himself passed away on May 18 this year at the MGM Grand hotel in Detroit. Just a coincidence? Or is there actually a deeper connection? … 
… As the story goes, Kirk Kerkorian personally financed most of the production for “The Promise” film himself, tagged with a giant $90 million budget,

           So Chris Cornell had an Armenian connection? But what about Kirk Kerkorian? What’s this about him being founder of the MGM Grand Hotel?  Don’t know what the MGM Grand Hotel is? It’s because it changed its name to the MGM INTERNATIONAL RESORTS … yes, the same place that owned Mandalay where the LV shooting took place!

            <em>
             Gores, according to the New York Times, is said to have hired Pellicano because he wanted to catch Lisa cheating with his brother, Tom, a business competitor (a third brother, Sam, runs the Paradigm Talent Agency in Hollywood and is married to a former soap-opera star). Alec Gores paid Pellicano $50,000, loaned him the same amount (which was not repaid) and treated the private investigator’s family to a Hawaiian vacation in exchange for services rendered.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did he go to jail? Possession of C4 explosives and illegally wiretapping FBI agents INVESTIGATING HIM, along with others...
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank about that for a second.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pellicano is a well known thug who breaks into homes and threatens witnesses. His signature is using a baseball bat.

             As for this, again a YUGE thanks. Pelicano, eh? Yup, I ran across the name and he's a dirt bag. At one point, I wanted to follow up on him, but got distracted. I'm copying this down and will look into it. He's such a perfect candidate for some of these things and knows PedoWood and its inhabitants like the back of his hand. If anyone knows where the bodies on buried, it would be him. In fact, he probably has the graves being dug on videotape.

            Las Vegas Shootings:  No security film footage at Las Vegas...And it is a  casino. No pictures!  And Paddock supposedly
           </p>
           <p>
            brought all those guns up to his room earlier that week.  No Film!
           </p>
           <p>
            Well it "happened again".  The night Chris Cornell was killed at The MGM Gand Detroit Hotel in May 2017 .. The security cameras
           </p>
           <p>
            were  OUT  OF  ORDER all over the place and certainly not working
           </p>
           <p>
            on the floor Chris supposedly stayed on. . No pictures of Chris exiting the elevator.  Nothing.  No Film.  No Pictures Of Chris.

             <p>
              OK...Are you ready for a new theory?
             </p>
             <p>
              Was surprised to hear it discussed.  Very plausible by me.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here It Is:
             </p>
             <p>
              After the concert, Chris DID NOT return to his hotel room!
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember, no films security or otherwise.
             </p>
             <p>
              They took him somewhere else  after the concert to do the unthinkable.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have listened to witnesses who attended Chris last concert.
             </p>
             <p>
              They said he was extremely off and was slurring his words.
             </p>
             <p>
              The witness said his band mates gave him no help or cover at all from what she could see.
             </p>
             <p>
              General consensus is that one or two of Chris band mates knew what was
             </p>
             <p>
              coming down on Chris.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway your MGM hotel theory holds more water than ever.   MGM personnel
             </p>
             <p>
              had to work a 'cover up' shift that night. As did the Detroit Police and many Others.

              Vicky's time line is off.

                Addenda.  Researchers are saying tonight..a twist here:
               </p>
               <p>
                Chris was taken from his last concert to some
               </p>
               <p>
                planned place and 'suicided'.  Now get this.
                <br/>
                They say after they murdered Chris
               </p>
               <p>
                they took him back to his MGM hotel room and dropped his dead body there.
               </p>
               <p>
                This fits with the body being
               </p>
               <p>
                as cold as it was when emt showed up.
               </p>
               <p>
                Fits time line (not Vicky's timeline).
               </p>
               <p>
                Also they speculate someone was
               </p>
               <p>
                using Chris as a front and his foundation to launder money.

                 Vicky's obviously lying. She's the only one to say he was slurring his words. You mean, his band mates wouldn't notice that? And then she raises an alarm based on this and not being able to get in touch with him? If she talked to him, how couldn't she get in touch with him? Nope, not buying it.

            Just a thought, but people with better sleuthing skills than me might want to check out the Wonderland clinic and see where that rabbit hole goes. I did a bit of digging a while back, and there seems to be some meat on this particular bone. It caught my attention because of the whole 'Alice in Wonderland' programming mentioned by Fritz.  Celebs seem to check in there with MPD programming issues. I found a link to the purchase of a machine bought from France to 'deprogram' people who had MPD. The reason I mention it in this context, and it baffled me at the time, was that I also found links from the management to strange combat training groups for kids with links to iirc Armenian/central European orthodox high church. The woman at the top also sold jewellery to the Obamas.  May be nothing, but.

              Thanks.. hope it proves juicy. Iirc it was (when I was researching, two years ago) owned by a couple of guys, and one of their wives. Not much info out there at all. May need to hit the wayback machine hard. I remember seeing a pic of some major religious dude in one of the links (think it was from the combat page), massive beard, all the accoutrements of high church, etc.  Think they had a few other offshoots, one in Ireland?  Seemed on the surface to be touting 'keeping kids safe through self defence' or some such. I just thought it was odd that a clinic would be investing in such  offshoots. That and the jewellery link to the Obamas.  Oh and of course there was that secret Alice in Wonderland themed party the Obamas threw...'Curiouser and curiouser'...

               Yes. It is a tightly-knit cabal. Each part of it has a purpose and they all link together for one thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               I noticed on Twitter the idea of this self-made genius being shot down. The new narrative is that there is no such thing as genius. It's a matter of the number of hours you put into something. Patently untrue. There were geniuses and self-made men/women. but the new narrative is to get people to band together for strength. In its best sense, it's like a pride of lions. In its worse sense, it's jackals and vultures. There's nothing wrong with networking except when you use in cabalistic fashion to undermine all else. Prime example: Amazon. It's too big for its own britches and keeps bloating from the companies it ruins and wealth accumulated. We've been warned of secret societies and this is the result of not taking the warnings seriously. After all, conspiracy theorists fantasized that something was afoot. It was real ... but it was. Just like the predation on youth is real. Take away the dream of being an individual and you have this ... losers clumping together like feces and spreading their disease through attained power.
              </p>
              <p>
               I can't wait for this cabal to fall, but every time there's a glimmer of hope, it disappears. Like the FISA memo. The dems release a statement that it was just talking points and that nobody even read it. POOF! All gone. Here it was building to be this juggernaut to start bringing the insidious cluster of cabalists down and it disintegrates before it's even released. Very frustrating. I pray Assange has the goods because verifiable, undisputable proof about the political leaders funding and fostering terrorists groups like ANTIFA is the only thing that will work.

                I agree whole heartedly, apart from Assange.
If you judge a man by the company he keeps, he has shared a lawyer with, and been in bed with, some rather nefarious characters without explanation on his part.  Then there was the recent green-screened collar incident. Many years ago I came across an account of his early days in Australia, finger tapping phone switches from public phones to hack organisations etc. A fascinating read, but..It seemed to lead to the all C-ing eye aye... It's just my opinion, but he seems to be limited hangout, or as my other half would say, 'all fart, no poo'.
               </p>
               <p>
                That being said, wikileaks has put many people in the spotlight who would, I suspect, rather not have been there, and that's a good thing.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yeah the FISA report will probably wither on the vine, but I just see it as part of their 'death by a thousand cuts'.
               </p>
               <p>
                As to the bigger picture?  The puppet masters? Hmmm. I just get the feeling that you don't ever get into positions of influence unless you can be influenced. What we seem to be revealing when discovering incongruous actions that just don't sit right, is some sort of blackmail 'top trumps' deck.  Who has the most dirt on their opponents wins. Unsure about Trump.  The previous Kleptocrats had to go, for sure, but at what cost?

               <p>
                Btw, Have you come across this guy?  He makes some interesting connections.  His website is a little all over the place, and he's not always right I don't think, but he's erudite never the less.

                 Yes, I have come across and read his posts. He is erudite, but he reminds me of that TV series LOST. Many people I knew watched it. I warned them telling the writers were also LOST and just including anything that sprang up on their radar. He reminds me of that, but nonetheless provides some very hidden events that make it invaluable for intel mining and research.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As for Assange, the problem is that he refuses to fit our definition of what a benefactor and political leader acts like. Yes, of course, he rubs shoulders with all sorts because all sorts may know something. That's the thing great men/women understand. But you need to either be a narcissist or humanitarian to be able to properly cull and put up with the rabble and sin. The narcissist will be able to do it with his unshakeable conviction that he is right and these others are there to serve him. The humanitarian does it by possessing a basic love and understanding that everyone has a divine place and time to live and be a part of this drama. If I had to guess, I'd say he's the latter. He's also complex and difficult, and I'm sure, fighting many foibles. But the most important thing is that I do believe he's interested in the truth which makes him rather noble.

                  Perhaps.  All we can do is keep pushing eh. Something's gotta give. Sometime. The new control systems seem to depend on camouflage and garnering public opinion via sock puppets etc rather than direct censorship. We have to pick this narrative apart, with many caveats, the best lies are 99% truth etc, the question is, which 1%? Fascinating times. I do like the collective spirit behind voat.  Crowdsourcing at its best. Anyway.. thanks for your measured, interesting posts. Meanwhile, according to mcba, the Kardashians claim to be Armenian, and Kanye had one of his kids initiated into high Armenian church. Funny old world, isn't it?

            Why do you think an actual nuclear warhead was aimed at Hawaii... think of all the filth there is to cover... besides starting world war three.
Pearl Harbor was a false flag that killed many Americans ( sacrifices must be made) just to get japan into a war!
Just like Benghazi... let them die!

              I think I may have found that hot dog stand but don't know.  I sent our Island Girl a pic of it.  Am waiting for answer.  It is on Alii Dr.   I am going to be in and out today.  Meetings.  Shopping.  Will try to do what I can today.

            While looking for Kirk connections, I found this. A link with a shit ton of potential new leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            The body guard to Cornell works for G4S. Yes, the G4S that's a known accomplice to false flags such as Pulse Nightclub and is the security firm for the Minnesota Vikings home stadium. I HIGHLY suspect there's a plot for a false flag on 2/4. Likely motive: get US involved in cabal plots to instigate tensions between Sunnis and Shiites.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also Sony connections to ICMEC. All of this goes up to the Windsors.

             Martin Kirsten was body guard to Heidi Klum before Vicky
            </p>
            <p>
             hired him to guard Chris.  Got her marriage broke up.  Their love relationship lasted around 18 months.
            </p>
            <p>
             I heard Heidi had to buy Martin's mother a house and give him some money so he would not talk.

             Low life?  Thug?

             I think he killed Chris in the hotel room in May 2017.

              I agree. Either the culprit or an accomplice.
             </p>
             <p>
              Given his background, having a ligature type weapon would be easy. Includes the use of the very rope used to hang Cornell.
             </p>
             <p>
              Theory: the rush for cremation was to cover up evidence. The "rope burn" profile for a strangulation murder is different from one that was hanged. Its difficult to notice the difference without training in forensics or as a coroner.
             </p>
             <p>
              Actually learned about this difference from a mystery novel. The Mikan Tsumaki case in Danganronpa 2 has a scenario identical to this (strangulation murder disguised as a suicide).

               I heard that verified on the initial police scanner call.  And Chris had nine broken ribs.

             Yeah, it's hard to figure out these things.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could be she was his handler and he wanted to leave the relationship. I know sometimes the Cannibal Elite permit it, and sometimes, no. Then there's them having gotten everything they could out of him. Vicky would be getting all the money and she might be more amenable. Even if they took three-fourths, she could live quite well ... live being the operative word.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't have my mind made up about this. I'd say he was lured there since it was one of Kerkorian's hotels, but who knows?

              Are you referring to where Chris died?
             </p>
             <p>
              He died at the MGM Grand Hotel in Detroit.
             </p>
             <p>
              Chris had just completed his Detroit Concert Tour dates.
             </p>
             <p>
              Vicky did not go with him to Detroit.

              Martin Kirsten his 'bodyguard' was with hm.
             </p>

              I recommend this: absolutely do not trust any mainstream news reporting on Chris death.  Not TMZ. None.

                TMZ is a disinfo agent.  I looked at their reports broadcast and print. They reported very little true stuff.
               </p>
               <p>
                I mentioned not to believe any MSN.   Real possibility -  one of Chris'  band members was or went rogue.

              No. Vicky will not be getting all the money!
             </p>
             <p>
              Chris was married to Susan Silver before Vicky.  She was/is a great lady and was his producer/manager.
             </p>
             <p>
              Susan gets all monies relating to  money earned resulting from his creativity

             <p>
              prior to marrying Vicky.Chris' work
prior to marrying Vicky.goes to Susan I believe. Unless Chris left it to his children.  I do not know how their divorce papers read.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's why Vicky was pushing Chris to work so much
             </p>
             <p>
              when he did not want to.  For the money. Vicky wore the pants.

             <p>
              Vicky was planning by all manners of account to sue the pharma makers

              of Activan over Chris' death for money.

             Good God.  I knew the minute I read the word Dream in the post it might lead to DG.  Dreamworks is also connected to DG.  This seals it for me.  He has to be caught up in this up to his Eyeballs.

               YES!  Amazing.   Although the school did not release details of the case, the Los Angeles Times reported that authorities were investigating whether employees stole and sold body parts from cadavers for personal gain.    Henry  Reid arrested.  Any relation to Harry Reid?  Ha.  That would be a Pip!

            Hawaii is known as the gateway to the east. Look up sex trafficking sex tours to Philippines and other pedophile countries. They have been the major booking tours for sex trade with kids for decades. Hawaii has a huge pefophile problem. They say they love their kids... but is it only because they bring home the money for the biggest welfare scammers in the universe? Obama helped to proliferate this behavior and hid it for them. Hawaiian mafia is huge and they run all the islands. Zuckerberg bought his property on Kauai from Poomai Dousette... connected to all Hawaii mafia... through her Pflueger sons trust fund. She the biggest piece of shit on the Big Island. She knew exactly how many family claims were on his property before selling it to him... just contacted the other families to show up and sue for extra money... they all know and he got rolled Hawaiian style. Never a clean deal... extortion and lies. Welcome to Hawaii!

             I've often wondered how Hawaii went in 200 years from a caste system in which peons faced death if the shadow of an ali'i nobleman fell on them and human sacrifice was a thing, to a bunch of happy-go-lucky uke-strumming stoners. You don't domesticate a society of blood-thirsty badasses who surf down mountainsides of volcanic glass and defend themselves from spears by catching them out of the air that quickly. I don't buy it.

              Read about their sexual anthropology ... anything goes... sex with kids, family, marriage was no barrier it was encouraged to have outside relations. Homosexuality was/ is still revered!
The only difference was their women could get money for sex from visitors....since the first boat landed!
They don’t have a moral compass.....$$$$$$$$$$

                Re watch the movie “ South Pacific” even all the song lyrics with your awakened eyes!
It was advertising the perversions you could enjoy there.
Sex with children “ Younger than springtime.... “‘makes me sick how it was marketed!
Orgies on Bali Hai.... 
Mother’s who sell their daughters to rich old plantation owners... still doing it today!

               We do have actual spooks in here monitoring what we turn up, as well as people paid by the Clinton cabal (Brock's H1b visa minions at Shareblue). It is real. Voat was DDoSed for a month straight here not too many weeks ago in an operation that would have been extremely expensive, and smart folk here who know what is discussed on boards across the site said the Pizzagate and Wikileaks boards were the only ones likely to have generated that much angst among the powers that be. Legal and financial pressure have also been strongly applied in attempts to shut us down.

               You can let a few close compatriots know you're the same person -- just don't do it public comments. And if your username cannot be traced back to your real life identity, you probably don't need to delete your whole Voat history by deleting your account. You could just go back through your comments and submissions and selectively edit or delete them to create ambiguity.

             Didn't know any of that, but it makes sense. They'd have to know if something were going on. It's a small enough place where you can keep an eye on things.

              Look up Noni Fae.. she ran the Women Helping Women shelter on Maui... I went there because of abuse... all Hawaiian abuse victims and their kids were encouraged to abuse any white women and their kids... it was sick! She is a filter for abuse reports... all info is given back to the abusers so they can cover or disappear the women who go for help. Her brother is Nelson Armitage on Maui!
All syndicate/mafia families. Keeping the lid on abuse of women and children. They have nowhere else to go but back into the hands of their abusers. It’s a circle of hell for the victims.. why is there so much mental illness in the islands?  There’s your answer! Put them on pills and give them welfare so they are too afraid to talk about their families. Most of them OD. Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide!
They broke my life and I’m about to return the favor.

                 Samime, if your username could lead to your real life identity, you should definitely delete your account and come back in a new guise. People have been doxxed here, due to careless details made in their comment history or in DM's to those who weren't trustworthy. Do not risk it.

              I just put my neck on the chopping block for that info...she went to school with Obama.
I was forced to live there for many years... on the underbelly side. Saw way too fucking much!
Look up the Armitage family and connections on Maui.
