            Go inside and get a good visual of the layout. when you leave, walk around the exterior and see of there are any doors that lead to an area inside you could not see. Most restaurants are a big open kitchen. If there are a few doors out back that don't look like they lead into the kitchen, it may lead to a staircase down. Look for excessive outside security cameras. A camera above or pointing at a random exit may be a way to see who is outside before allpwing them in. Watch the area. Is there a side parking lot that looks out of place? Check the floors for wear patterns to see if that random door you see inside is used often. On outside doors, make note of the color. If there are three, but one is a different color that may lead to some place secret. like use the red door for the special pizza kinda deal since they cannot have people come jn asking for stuff. Make note of the ages and gender of the wait staff ans employees. Do people look on edge and like they are nervous? What is the age and gender of patrons? Does anyone seem dressed out of place. Like too fancy to be picking up pizza. Listen to how people talk when they order. Does any of the wording sound odd. Does the neighborhood not look like somewhere you expect a pizza place to be. Is there a lot of foot traffic oitside. A pizza place wants foot traffic but a shady place wants to be tucked away private with an exit not seen from the front easily. Go to the back or the side near the outside back and see make a call. See if anyone comes out to ask what you aredoing. if they do just say yoj needed to make a call and couldnt hear well near the road. See of you can find a dumpster and peak in. Note color of the bags and if there are a lot of bags tied off with little in them or a bag with little in them inside another bag. A lot of restaurants use those giant clear bags from that sysco company since they ate pretty cheap. Check to see if there are exterior lights on random side or back doors indicating people leaving late at night. Most business alarms require you to leave via the main entry and this could indicaye a door leading to a private seperate area downstairs. Use your phone wifi to see what the netwroms are named and if there seem to be more than you expected to find. I am sure as soon as i hit send i will have five more things to look for.
           </p>

            I guess the big thing is go with your gut. Does this place just feel off? Does it feel like a normal pizza place? Take a few friends with you both male and female and see what they think. The way I see something to be sketchy is not how a man may feel about something. Is it as busy as you expect for whatever time you go? Take notes as you see things. From when I have worked investigations, I go assuming tjat whatever I am looking for is false. I use my surrounding to prove the situation is false. I find that looking for evidence to prove something is not true leads me to see the bigger picture.

            When I would investigate abuse , i told myself the parents are not doing anything wrong. It put me and then at ease because i was calm and my voice was not making them think i thought they did it. It was easier to see the clues to prove guilt rather than find clues to prove they did not do it. That is just what worked for me though.

            They were shills. He throws up the 666 when he says Comet Ping Pong when he's in the backseat of the car. They work for them.

            Definitely put some scrutiny into the menu. Ask them about where they source their produce, cheeses, meats, etc. Try to act professional but subtly see if they are legit. You don't want to be obvious about what you're doing, and antagonizing them will only makes things more difficult, so look for things out of the ordinary, and take pictures when you can, maybe disguising what you're doing by taking pictures of your food but with the background in focus. Draw as little attention to yourself if possible, and for god's sake, please dont go in their screaming "RAAAAAAPE!" because that only makes all of us look like conspiracy nutjob autists. Oh, and good luck

            Use your smart phone to look for WiFis.  A huge number would indicate scrambling to TorNet.  If you have LUMINOL and a UV glow stick, you could scout for washed blood or semen stains in Le Boum Boum Room.  Or, you could just ask your waiter if you could borrow a large cage.

            Depending on who the regular is, they might be able to stay after the store is closed to everyone else. This is so common with bars, it has a name (lock in)

             there was never "pedo art" in the ping pong room.  there was art that people thought was creepy, but there were no children in the art.

            Seriously I would not eat anything from there, with their special powder in their jar, probably ground up kids, not joking.  Just determine how it FEELS, we know when things feel odd.  Look at how many kids are hanging around late at night.

            The FLOOR! For goddakes look at the floor. Under rugs, under tables.... they always put something on top of it to hide it. It won't be out in the open. In the Instagram pics they had those images of them doing construction and digging a hole. You need to find areas of the floor where it looks like it's been patched up. They will have had professionals fill and match it, so it's going to be EXTREMELY hard to see. I'm sure they will have filled it in. I have a previous posts. They closed for an entire day September 20th. I think that's when they filled it in. or they could have done it any evening after they closed. CHECK. THE. FLOORS. I won't be satisfied this is a baseless theory until I've seen every inch the floor inspected with a stethoscope and a hammer.

                  Buddy... This isn't a bad idea. If a bunch of us went in and just went all business mode and started setting up like the guys who clean the field between innings. Fuck man. This would give us the answer. Problem is, we'd start the kickstarter, word would get around, and they'd know to look out for some hooligans with military grade gear lol

            these are the types of questions that need to be asked. running up to the fool and scream PEDO will not accomplish anything. we need to ask things like.
           </p>
           <p>
            how do you feel about sex with children? do you agree with the age of consent? have you ever done anything illegal in this building?
           </p>
           <p>
            and then you could probably pounce in with a; why is everyone accusing you of child sex trafficking? or something hard ball like that.

            That guy really is just weird as fuck. I also do find woodfire pizza to be somewhat lower on the dining food chain (IE there is really nothing sophisticated about it) but seeing the way he talked about it, he definitely is a restaurant owner.

            </a>
            suggesting to keep an eye out for air vents that imply that the premises extend underground.
           </p>
           <p>
            The user also suggested knocking on the walls to test if they're hollow (as in, hiding passages), although (s)he recommended acting drunk to avoid suspicion.

            logistic reasons why i can't do that. Metro closes before them, so I wouldn't be able to get home easily. And I said stone throw away, but this is going to be a few hours trip into DC. I like the detective work, but I can't put in that muh effort. I am willing to go in and ask some managers some questions, and take pictures and or videos.

            Just keep an eye out, take some pictures surreptitiously. Eat their pizza, see if it's good. If you're daring, take kids with you and observe interactions of anyone with them.

             being around kids scares the fuck out of me. these guys are probably pedophiles, while I am whatever the opposite of that is. giving me your kids might be just as bad as giving them to Comet Ping Pong.

              I mostly meant you could make it a family outing if you've got kids. They're not gonna rape some rando's kids while they're being scrutinized so much.

            See if the pepperoni curls up and crisps a little on the edges.  If it doesn't, you know it's a rubbish pizza joint, and it's full of child rapists...

             well as a person who does enjoy the culinary arts, I can certainly check out the menu. I want to know if CHEESE PIZZA is the only thing these people know. There are so many cheeses, i could go on forever. I drink wine and eat cheeses, it gets in depth.
            </p>
            <p>
             The emails referencing only cheese pizza is weird as fuck from a culinary perspective.

              Yah not for nothing, now that you mention it, when I saw the email where Alefantis says something like, "I regret I didn't get to make you [john podesta] a nice pizza..." it occurred to me that there's never any discussion of toppings.  Wouldn't you ask someone what they like, or brag about how you grow your own tomatoes or basil...

               Even if they just like cheese pizza, what kind of cheese? Is the sauce base a tomato one, bbq sauce, a mix of those two, pesto, creamy garlic, or some other interesting sauce?

               thank you for asking me this question, as I never really looked into it myself. basically these guys have no idea what pizza is. pizza to them is cheese and bread. it just seems really fucking odd they are so obsessed with pizza.
              </p>
              <p>
               maybe it's just a money thing, and not a child sex trafficking thing, who knows.

               BUT, when I think of culinary people, I think more like this:

                 just hearsay from the internet. i've seen been a little corrected. it is hard for me to respect pizza they way they are doing it (i think it was a stone oven, which is fine) but i've worked with flatbreads before and it's just not my scene. the clientele is different for that sort of quick dining.

             it would be located in the office or somewhere back of house. I don't know if I want to play assassin's creed, more like I am just doing some private eye work.

              You are right, they are waiting for you to show up and they have left any possible evidence laying around for you to find which of course has arrows pointing it out for you because you sound like a real Sherlock.

               okay and we've known about the confirmed pedo symbols since 2007/2008, yet no one seemed to notice Besta Pizza's logo until recently. this thread was created to see if Voat wanted any leads to be followed, that are semi normal things to be able to look into. you had two dudes just video record the fucking guy and ask him retarded questions, if we wanted arrows pointing to the smoking gun that should have been it, but they fucked it up.

               anyways man, this is just an offer to record some pics from the inside, because no one is posting that shit.

              <p>
               i am not a professional detective, I already told you I work in the restaurant industry. I am not looking to dance with the devil, just get any sort of evidence.  if you think this is a waste of time, so be it.
