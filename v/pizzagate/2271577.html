            Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

            Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire MONTH ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

            If there is something, why is nothing happening? Where’s the Emergency Broadcast System announcement? Where’s Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people? Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

                      Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire MONTH ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

                        Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

                        Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire MONTH ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

              It doesn't if it says pedophile related. The problem comes in when every little political squabble in D.C. is considered pizzagate forum worthy and it slides the forum.

               This place is a shit hole for organizing information, a VB forum would be better. The major problem around here is that you can't post and talk about new ideas if it's not already proven.

                I don't know what VB is but if you mean a bump forum I agree. In a bump oriented forum if anybody posts in an old thread it automatically pops to the very top of the forum automatically. Then everybody knows something new is added and people start looking again. In this forum threads die in a day because of the way this forum works. And the collapsing comments is a damn nightmare.

               <p>
                For instance a forum like this one bumps to the top anytime someone posts in an old thread. These types of forums are superior for keeping discussions on topics alive.

            I've been more of an outside observer to all of this since it started, but I still cannot understand the advantage of the Trump administration or law enforcement divulging this information to the internet. If it is true that a major "storm" is upon us which may involve a covert bait-and-switch (referring to the possibility of Flynn's prosecution as a Trojan Horse for Trump), then what good could come from it, unless it is meant to throw the dogs off the scent, in which case we return to questioning it anyway?

            Why leak your playbook to the internet? Anybody - including the enemy - can access the analysis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless, of course, it's too late for the targeted suspects, anyway. In either case, I think caution and prudence would dictate keeping cards closer to the chest.

             The purpose is to throw the bad guys off balance by using Q to expose their crimes they don't know what to do they become paranoid with all their dirty laundry appearing on 4chan and twitter. It's psychological warfare and it's very valuable. They don't know who Q is or how many Q's there are how many good guys white hats are working against the deep state cabal.

            Trump's CIA Director, Mike Pompeo, goes head-to-head with Obama's CIA Director, Leon Panetta.  Pompeo does an excellent job and explains how strategic Trump's tweets are and how important it is for CIA to 'follow the money' to disrupt the terrorists/cabal.  It convinces me more than ever that Q anon is in Trump's inner circle.  Leon P also demonstrates how much the Deep State hates Trump's tweets and how nervous they are.

              in Q's last post, (s)he dropped a clue"89074" followed by 'massive underground data center".
             </p>
             <p>
              zip code 89074 is Henderson, NV.  Researchers are trying to figure out what is there.
             </p>
             <p>
              89074b is in OP stringer above and I believe Q had made other mentions of the area.

               Ah, thank-you. I went to elementary school there. The kids beat us up every day. Weird town, had lots of transients.

              Because this isn't Reddit. Mods aren't allowed to touch comments, unless they are actually illegal in Switzerland. The power is in your hands. Use the downvoat button to collapse the comment -- it only takes a few downvoats to do so. That's why this place is called "Voat".

                On the contrary, Esoteric. I've watched this topic bring a bunch of great PG researchers who hadn't posted in months back in to reengage. It's inspired many people to start digging afresh and others to start making memes based on our past research. It's certainly not pushing anything better off the front page. I don't understand why it bothers you so much.

                 People are confusing pigs pushing for a place at the taxpayer pig trough for pizzagate and its destroying the focus and the mission. You are turning pizzagate into football game in which people are cheering for their favorite team. You are bringing the swamp into pizzagate. If it does not stay pedophilia related its a loss for pizzagate. Maybe jangles is right, maybe you are just too thick to get it. Anything storm related needs to be pedophilia related or its a distraction. This political scuffle we see is not about pedophilia. Its two gangs fighting for power.

             /cbts/ is its own board. Noone is bothering 8/pol/. Signal to noise ratio is pretty good. Q has dropped some good stuff. 4chan CBTS has been completely overrun by a Clown-sponsored botnet.

               I don't have to stop and wonder - I've lurked 8/pol/ for years. Anyone who bothers them gets an instant lifetime IP ban from /cbts/. Anyone who invites cuckchan fags gets an instant lifetime IP ban from /cbts/. It's in the rules and it's strictly enforced. This is just the GG exodus all over again except this time the fallout has been minimal.
