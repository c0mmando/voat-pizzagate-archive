<blockquote>
<p>Kate Spade was known as a major designer in the fashion industry, she was also the sister-in law of comedian David Spade, and Emeritus Chair of the New York Centre for Children. </p>
<p>Spade had partnered with the Clinton Foundation on at least two major projects. The designer had helped operate a media campaign for The Clinton Foundation\'s No Ceiling Initiative. Kate Spade also worked with the Clinton\'s in Haiti, sending representatives to deal with Haitian business owners on Clinton\'s behalf.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2015  Kate Spade of New York was a \'NOT THERE\' partner</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New York, NY — Today, March 8, International Women’s Day, the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation’s No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project will engage in a collaborative effort to raise awareness that women are “not there” yet on issues of gender equality.</p>
<p>Condé Nast, for the first time in history, will remove the cover images on Vogue, Glamour, SELF, Allure, Teen Vogue, W, and Brides and direct readers to NOT-THERE.org to learn about gender equality.

<p>Now check out Neon Revolt\'s JUNE 1st Post: <a href="https://www.neonrevolt.com/2018/06/01/the-morally-repugnant-elite-and-their-bad-juju-haiti-dr-humantrafficking-qanon-greatawakening/">https://www.neonrevolt.com/2018/06/01/the-morally-repugnant-elite-and-their-bad-juju-haiti-dr-humantrafficking-qanon-greatawakening/</a> </p>
<p>Consider for a moment if Kate Spade had read something like this post, or found out something about Clinton/Haiti and/or Anne-Christine d\'Adesky</p>
<p>Regardless, Neon Revolt\'s post connects dots very familiar for PGers regarding Haiti child trafficking suspicions in regard to Silsby/Clinton...plus some surprises (for me anyway).</p>',

                 Small detail, but Eva Gabor was the voice of the wife mouse in the cartoon. Rat husband Bob Newhart. Her sister married into Hiltons. Generational conditioning is all over the place and could offer more clues if mapped.

               As I told investigators, though the Silsby group's lawyers claim that only she and her assistant were the ringleaders in this affair, I actually spoke to three people from their group, and it was clear from my conversation with them that their clearly-stated mission had been excitedly prepared. Silsby may have convinced members of her group they had authority to take children, but I definitely told at least two other members they were likely to be stopped. Moreover, when a policeman stops your bus with 40 children aboard, orders them to get off, then tells you you're breaking the law, and you still continue to try to do it - again- then what part of the message are you not understanding?
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't presume to be other members of that group, but they cannot claim the type of total innocence as has been portrayed by their lawyer OR to the media. They clearly knew that others felt their actions were or might be wrong, even if she may have convinced them those other people were misinformed. So yes, they may have been duped - convinced by Silsby, and by the evocation to do God's work and follow God's law above man's (or human's) law.
              </p>
              <p>
               But it's important for people following this story to know that a group was involved, with open knowledge of their church/parishes in the US, and it was a planned trip, and it engaged Dominicans with prior ties in the Dominican Republic.

               Now comes a new layer of what I actually initially (for one day) thought was a case of severely misguided missionaries, that may actually prove to have far uglier layers. Let's hope not. But it won't surprise me at this point. I'm just very grateful for the Border and UN authorities and Haitian justice officials, and that lone policeman, who acted with such concern and alacrity to prevent a crime from succeeding. (Let's hope they or any affiliates didn't succeed before, of course....)

              <p>
               As I have said to inquiring media colleagues and to Haiti-lovers, the greater story here is the ACTIONS taken by the Haitian and outside orphan advocates to prevent this from succeeding, and for insisting on the rule of law, even in this case of catastrophic instability post-quake. I'd love to see articles about that, and articles focusing on how to HELP, legally, and quickly, the tens of thousands fo children who have been orphaned or displaced.
              </p>
              <p>
               As I posted recently, to me the concept of provisional FOSTER placement, working with through the international Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program -- NOT ADOPTION -- offers a appropriate provional LEGAL avenue to quickly helping Haitian children, especially those who are amputees and need onoging medical care outside Haiti, to get to quick safety and care, while allowing Haiti and Haitian officials and orphan groups the time to reorganize and reintegrate these displaced or orphaned children. A mandatory two year period is already the norm required for international adoptions to look for possible living relatives or others that can take in children. Two years would give all parties time to organize this while keeping the urgent needs of children now foremost in mind.
              </p>
              <p>
               Congratulations to Haiti - to Haitian advocates - for their vigilance, and their insistence on the rule of law. That protects everyone.

               Adviser to Detained Americans in Haiti Is Investigated
NYT by Mark Lacey and Ian Urbana
Published: February 11, 2010 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — The police in El Salvador have begun an investigation into whether a man suspected of leading a trafficking ring involving Central American and Caribbean women and girls is also a legal adviser to the Americans charged with trying to take 33 children out of Haiti without permission.

                 There's absolutely no Silsby Clinton connection. I have debunked this several times.

                I didn't quote anything that supports your first contention.  These are the connections people have in mind:

                Yes, what I quoted proves what you said about Anne-Christine d'Adesky. For whatever reason it was a lot of digging to find the detailed account, do you have something to add to that? I am still looking into her relatives, she doesn't associate with the d'Adesky relatives in Haiti (pretty much dislikes them).  From what I've read Anne-Christine d'Adesky is NOT involved in child trafficking. I had edited a comment into the main post about Neon Revolt being wrong about her, but I must have accidentally hit cancel instead of save.
