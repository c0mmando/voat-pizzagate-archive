</p>
<p>So I’m with a friend and he shares with me a story he heard about a man who “saved 669 children” from Czechoslovakia during the holocaust.  He took a “2 week vacation” to Prague and somehow saved the kids from “concentration camps” by train.  
</p>
<p>Of course in these stories he can somehow save the kids, but never the parents or anyone else.  Personally, I find it pure evil to ask people to separate from their children.  
</p>
<p>Here’s the video he showed me:<br />
[<a href="https://youtu.be/c0aoifNziKQ">https://youtu.be/c0aoifNziKQ</a>]</p>
<p>The video shows fliers with pictures and ages of the kids that he used to “find families.”  This is what I imagine happens on the dark web.  
</p>
<p>The guy supposedly made a modest income.  So which one of us with a modest income can find families for 669 children?  How exactly did he find food, shelter and water for these children?  I can’t seem to find the explanation for how he afforded this.  
</p>
<p>When the “survivors” supposedly surprise him at a TV show taping, honestly the women do not look like women to me.  I’ve done some research on the anatomical differences between men and women, like skulls and jaws and foreheads and shoulder to waist ratios, and I think there are way more transgendered people on TV than any of us realized.  And I don’t think these people were given a “choice” like we think of it today.  I think it’s a generational satanic practice.  
</p>
<p>We need to be ever so careful of the people we allow to “help” other countries in times of crisis.  Haiti should be our first clue that these “history lessons” are still happening today.  
</p>
<p>To me this is like a brainwash for people to accept situations where they would willingly give up their children.  
</p>
<p>Thanks for any thoughts on the video.  I found some related articles below that just all source each other for all the information, so the entire thing could be fake, but my money is on it’s just not what it seems, and this was a satanic celebration of sick pedophile.

            There was also a story o 60 Min. about a guy that flew a whole bunch of kids out of Vietnam too.  Another  possibility.  People think these rescues are wonderful and many are, but sometimes there is another story behind it.

            Very few children survived the camps. Physically strong adults, especially if they had a specific skill that might be useful to their captors, like a very talented artist or musician, had a better chance. Parents immediately gave up their babies to anyone who might be able to give them the smallest opportunity for survival.
           </p>
           <p>
            Likewise babies born during WW II and afterwards as part of Hitler's intentional repopulation agenda with the Master Race were given to adoptive families. Some were extremely lucky and others suffered.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of my earlier acting teachers was "adopted" at the age of 2 in France. Then he was brought to the USA by another family. Others were raised as Catholics in orphanages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stories of what happened/is happening to very poor and/or orphaned children in Romania, Serbia, and Yugoslavia should also be questioned. There's a reason why so many beautiful young woman seek marriage to anyone in the West, praying their new husband will simply be kind and not abusive.

            Well, my feeling is that he was just a humanitarian? I could be wrong, but you see none of the people complain, saying they were given to pedophiles. There are grandchildren and great grandchildren who seem happy and well-adjusted. Also, he's now building homes for the elderly, I think he just has a big heart, saw a need and fufilled it and never bragged about it. And for the people being transgendered and odd looking, Chec's and Germans are big, sometimes awkward looking. (Sorry..Lol) just my thinking. Thanks for bringing it up!
