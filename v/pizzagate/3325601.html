            The Hearst girls and the Hilton sisters were very close growing up. Most likely going through ritual abuse together.

            anything based on TV is going to be anti trump as like 6 corporations own 90% of the media.  hearst prob being one of those.  if it's a site geared towards TV huge chance will be anti-trump.   doing some quick researching the Hearst fam is close with Rockefellers so that should just tell you enough right there. haha.  as i look you will find more about the Hearst family researching 13 illuminati fams.  obv this fam is huge in this group they seem to be Rothschild descendants. they are deep.

              to me it is kind of old news but it is important. thing is there are even more cults just like it that will come to light.  this article is old and kind of telling.

            There's zero doubt that a typical Clinton supporter is more reasonable and less hero-worshipping that a Trump supporter.

            Everyone hates Trump except Qtards, especially the far right.  Ann Coulter basically got him elected and she fucking despises him.

             auralsects...........Trump reads the Art of War......have read it . He is governing in just such a way as the Art of War espouses. Stereotypes make life so much easier ...I have  a tendency to do it myself. Yours is off in my case ....am to the left of liberal , think the clintons are war criminals.......under president Trump , there have been more outings of rapists and pedaphiles than anytime in US history. 30 senators and reps in DC are resigning .....unprecedented...one can only guess why . Don't know if I would vote for Trump , but he is draining the swamp....just what he promised. Don't remember Obomba keeping any of his promises. Let's stereotypers start a new meme. Both parties suck!!!

              You fucking stupid woman, Obama was MUCH BETTER than Trump on immigration, which is the only issue that matters.

              You are a race traitor and a nigger-lover, which is why Trump brags about the black unemployment rate, as if a Republican will ever get the black vote.

             Their level of hate for Trump proves how unreasonable they are. They refuse to believe any of the stories connected to Clinton but will take any piece of tabloid level rumour as absolute truth about Trump.

              That's part of the Q psyop.  Q makes absurd retarded claims and his followers push bullshit like Hillary snuff videos.

              Whereas tabloid level rumors abt Trump are totally plausible. He's a known billionaire philanderer Hollywood celebrity.

              I doubt anyone thinks the Clinton's are clean.  But those libtards are probably more reasonable than you, just by not hero-worshipping.  That's literally children's behavior.

            Here is the only thread talking about NXIVM. Notice the lack of interest in their political connections. Notice the reaction when the Clinton's are mentioned. This forum is very sensitive about anything that may put the Clinton's or Democrats in a bad light.

             , would you consider adding this link to your OP - you need an actual link in your OP anyway, not just a jpg, otherwise the post will get flaired by the mods.
