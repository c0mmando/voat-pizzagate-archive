Somehow or another, somebody was able to obtain the action plans or &quot;Plans for 2020&quot; from these organizations, and it makes for some interesting reading - plans that essentially call for the destruction of President Trump.</p>
<p>Relevance to Pizzagate is based on connections - Media Matters was founded and funded by Soros; belongs to David Brock, the ex-boyfriend of Alefantis, a/k/a Jimmy Comet, the famous star of HRC\'s email scandal.  Alefantis has a close relationship with the Rothschilds and is an A-list party guest on the list of all names involved in the HRC email scandal.</p>
<p>SHAREBLUE PLAN FOR 2020
▪Nonstop coverage of the influence of Putin and Russia on Trump and his administration
▪Relentlessly beating the drum that he has no mandate, lost the popular vote, and is the least popular president elect in modern history.</p>
<p>MEDIA MATTERS PLAN FOR 2020
We are going to resist the normalization of Donald Trump.  His every conflict oif interest, his every bit of cronyism, his every move toward authoritarianism, his every subversion of our democratic systems and principles, his every radical departure from foreign and domestic policy norms.</p>
<p>We are going to control every effort, at every level of government, to limit rights, rescind  protections, entrench inequality, redistribute wealth upwards, or in another way, fundamentally undermine the tenets of egalitarianism that must serve as the bedrock of our democracy.</p>
<p>Here\'s How
▪Serial misinformers and right-wing propagandists inhibiting everything from social media to the highest levels of government will be exposed, discredited
▪Interest and social media platforms, like Google and Facbook, will no longer uncritically and without consequence, host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists.
▪Toxic alt-right social media-fueled harassment campaigns that silence dissent and poison our natural discourse will be punished and halted.</p>
<p>Success Will Look Like This:
▪Trump will be defeated, either through impeachment or at the ballot box in 2020
▪The balance of power will shift b ack to Democrats
▪We will free ourselves from solely relying on the press</p>
<p>Ending Note
As a result of our campaign urging major networks to correct course, CBS and NBC News publicly stated they would discontinue Trump\'s phone privilege.  Eventually, others followed suit, and Trump\'s ability to control the news cycle from the comfort of his home was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Media Matters further stated that they will push back on conservative misinformation across all media channels and specifically neutralize the effects and infrastructure of the newly empowered alt-right.  
</p>
<p>Media Matters advocacy - will be vigilant in holding news media accountable for even the slightest bit of normalization of Trump.</p>
<p>Media Matters is prepared to confront the US government under a proven and dangerous dissemble.</p>
<p>AMERICAAN BRIDGE PLAN 2020
The campaign to stop Donald Trump must be nonstop.  We are uniquely prepared to take on the Trump administration, defeat Republicans who enable it, and rebuild progressive power in the states. </p>
<p>We are in a state of emergency.</p>
<p>Evaluation 
Defeat Trump either through impeachment or at the ballot box in 2020.</p>
<p>CREW PLAN 2020
Top Outcomes
If Crew is successful in causing Trump to behave ethically, it will help protect the country from scandal and disatrous policy choices.  Trump will be affected by a steady flow of damaging information, new revelations, and an inability to avoid conflict issues.  Crew will relentlessly probe his ethical conflicts and administration ethic problems through aggressive use of research, open records requests, legal action, and FOIA litigation.</p>
<p>Special Interests:
Our reported complaints in 2015-2016 against the NRA, which consistently hid its political spending, and the Center for Medical Progress, a group that lied to the IRS about its agenda to attack Planned Parenthood, helped to define the public understanding of those powerful interest groups and ensure that the efforts to influence issues and policy were out in the open.</p>
<p>Evaluation:
▪Trump will be affected by a steady flow of damaging information, new revelations, and an inability to avoid conflict issues
▪The Trump administration will be forced to defend illegal conduct in court
▪Powerful industries and interest groups will see their influence wain
▪Dark money will be a political liability in key states</p>

            They iz dead in the water. This strategy is almost all tactics that are already exhausted / discredited. About the only wiggle room I see in it to threaten Trump is if they find some conflict of interest issue from Trump's businesses , that to me seems his achilles heel

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/13Buddha">
             @13Buddha
            </a>
            , thank you for your post.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is important to point out the schemes of MediaMatters and the like, however, we'd need a clearer connection to Pizzagate, especially in the headline.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Rule 3: Clarity: All titles must (...) establish
             <strong>
              direct relevance to pizzagate.
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Please self-delete (headlines unfortunately cannot be edited), edit and re-submit with a headline that points out the relevance for the pizzagate investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, please point out in your intro in the body of the text how the MediaMatters plan could possibly effect the pizzagate investigation. You might want to focus on this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Interest and social media platforms, like Google and Facbook, will no longer uncritically and without consequence, host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You could point out that since Pizzagate has been labelled 'fake news' by the MSM, the Pizzagate investigation could also have been a target for MediaMatters, f.e. by using shills to influence this board.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will flair the post with 'Edit Warning' - please self-delete and repost within 24 hours (otherwise we will have to delete it after 24 hours).
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you!
