THEY WERE PIZZA ATTIRE, REPOST/COMMENT/RETWEET PICTURES OF PIZZA AND EXPRESS THEIR LOVE FOR PIZZA. 
everyone loves a slice, but was it ever that deep? also something to note- Miley Cyrus is a known vegan and once said she was lactose and gluten free. With that said, why does she have pizza blankets and don a fuckin pizza onsie? Unfortunately, I\'m a fan of Miley Cyrus, always have been, always will be (maybe)... but from a very young age she was sexualized. Disney makes girls like her prime time and bam , mind control, celeb take over. Miley has many alters. From her stoner futuristic love of light, to her demonic perverted sexual ways, and then her innocent country girl personality. This is consistent with MK Mind Control.

            Maybe as a child victim of organized abuse, Mylie was aware of being identified as a cheese pizza and imprinted by that to the point of above weird behaviors? Or maybe she's doing a weird kind of whistle-blowing (or both).

            Yes, I agree that the Politicians/Elite who are part of this satantic child molesting cult work hand in hand with the Entertainment Industry. We clearly see how biased the mainstream news is --- CNN is basically a bunch of puppets.
           </p>
           <p>
            Imho, many of the big name celebrities are treated like "pets" to the elite. It's so sad. And I too feel uncomfortable when I think about how sexualized all of these kids were from such a young age. Remember Amanda Bynes? And I think you're right that celebrities are used to push an agenda for the elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, if you look in to "Room 23" and Cannes Yachts  -- there's been a lot of rumours that some of our popular entertainers moonlight as prostitutes. (For wealthy international businessmen) Also I guess some of the celebrities who fly overseas to perform concerts are not just there to sing.

             Yes, when you really start looking at it, there are so many weird celebrity deaths or deaths in celebrity families. Maybe those who weren't blackmailed or mind controlled themselves have been otherwise targeted with a death of family member...

            I believe that some knew that the word was getting out.
By overloading people's minds with Pizza themes, etc, they'd get "cover" by being able to dilute the meaning and intensity of what was really happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same way they deal with toxic pollution. "Dilution is the solutiion."
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why there was a major effort to flood the market with knock-off Pizza themes / memes, to thus hide the real one.

            I think your observations are valid but not solid evidence of actual crimes, but it adds up as circumstantial support. I don't follow any of these artists but I think that the music industry is extraordinarily shallow in general for many years. Up to the 80's you could hear songs with real political messages and/or real musical talent on the radio but for many years now its all hypersexed overly produced marketing schlock as you say. Its tragic that so many of the kids of hollywood/music industry lives are ruined but they are just the ones in public view.  As a course of action, all that shit needs to be boycotted. If we as people cannot arrest the perpetrators of this abuse, we must ruin them financially.
