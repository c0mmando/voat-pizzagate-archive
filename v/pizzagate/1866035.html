<p>Why do people think mainstream media is some giant cabal of journalists secretly conspiring to lie to the American Public?</p>

<p>The emphasis is deliberate, but illustrates the point. Podesta’s story was “the” story which created the tagline “fake news’. So is it real or is it fake? Either way, Podesta, the CIA and Jeff Bezos have all understand what Bernays said so long ago with chilling eloquence:</p>

<p>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.</p>
