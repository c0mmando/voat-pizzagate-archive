<p>The main take away for me was the book that she was looking at, Ender\'s Game by  Orson Scott Card <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ender\'s Game is a 1985 military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card. Set at an unspecified date in Earth\'s future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with the Formics, an insectoid alien species they dub the &quot;buggers&quot;. In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, children, including the novel\'s protagonist, Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, are trained from a very young age by putting them through increasingly difficult games, including some in zero gravity, where Ender\'s tactical genius is revealed.</p>
<p>It has become suggested reading for many military organizations, including the United States Marine Corps. … The U.S. Marine Corps Professional Reading List makes the novel recommended reading at several lower ranks, and again at Officer Candidate/Midshipman.[18] The book was placed on the reading list by Captain John F. Schmitt, author of FMFM-1 (Fleet Marine Fighting Manual, on maneuver doctrine) for &quot;provid[ing] useful allegories to explain why militaries do what they do in a particularly effective shorthand way.&quot;[19] In introducing the novel for use in leadership training, Marine Corps University\'s Lejeune program opines that it offers &quot;lessons in training methodology, leadership, and ethics as well ... Ender\'s Game has been a stalwart item on the Marine Corps Reading List since its inception.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A great-great-grandson of Brigham Young, Card was born in Richland, Washington and grew up in Utah and California. While he was a student at Brigham Young University (BYU), his plays were performed on stage. He served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Brazil and headed a community theater for two summers.  </p>

<p>Brigham Young?  That\'s interesting because I only just wrote about him a few days ago in this post : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3711609">Tom Hanks, the face of coronavirus and \'Philadelphia\' - some wild speculations... indulge me for a minute..</a> Before Hanks took off for Australia he have a bizarre speech when he received a Cecil B. DeMille award. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cecil Blount DeMille (/ˈsɛsəl dəˈmɪl/; August 12, 1881 – January 21, 1959) was an American filmmaker. Between 1914 and 1958, he made a total of 70 features, both silent and sound films. He is acknowledged as a founding father of the American cinema and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history.</p>
<p>DeMille\'s legacy is maintained by his granddaughter Cecilia DeMille Presley who serves as the president of the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation, which strives to support higher education, child welfare, and film in Southern California.[299] In 1963, the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation donated the &quot;Paradise&quot; ranch to the Hathaway Foundation, which cares for emotionally disturbed and abused children.[86] A large collection of DeMille\'s materials including scripts, storyboards, and films resides at Brigham Young University in L. Tom Perry Special Collections.</p>

<p>More about the author: of Ender\'s Game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Card was one month old, his family moved to San Mateo, California so Willard Card could begin a sign painting business. However, when he was three years old, they moved to Salt Lake City, Utah so his father could finish his bachelor\'s degree. The family moved to Santa Clara, California when Card was six; they stayed there for seven years while his father completed his master\'s degree and was a professor at San Jose State College. .. In 1964, Card and his family moved to Mesa, Arizona where he participated in mock debates in junior high school. In 1967, the family moved to Orem, Utah where his father worked at Brigham Young University (BYU).  </p>

             Saw the green symbols over and over even on Jimmy Kimmel's videos where he's wearing all green, random journalists tweeting cryptic one-worded tweets that say "Evergreen" which was Hillary Clinton's nickname by the Secret Service, Matthew McConaughey's weird videos, etc. Thanks for your insight on the color green. Hope they've been tainted after all their adreno-chrome consumption. Wicked, evil people.

             ..I’m in a convention center in Orlando, Fla., at the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference, the largest military simulation conference in the world. And I’ve just experienced the Army’s most lifelike training simulation yet: the Dismounted Soldier Training System which, after two years and US $57 million in development, will arrive at bases this year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, it’s the stuff of science fiction, most notably Ender’s Game, the best-selling 1985 novel by Orson Scott Card that has whiz-kid cadets fighting an alien space fleet through a video game (the book was based on a short story by Card of the same name, published in 1977 as Analog Science Fiction and Fact). Among military geeks, the book—which is being officially released as a $100 million film starring Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley on 1 November —has been a blueprint for the future for years. As Michael Macedonia, the former director of the Army’s simulation technology center, told The New York Times in 2003, “Ender’s Game has had a lot of influence on our thinking. The intent is to build a simulation that allows people to play in that world for months or years, participate in different types of roles, and see consequences of their decisions.”

             ..The University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) is a U.S. government–funded research and development organization in Playa Vista, Calif., that makes some of the most convincing military simulations around. According to ICT, one of its training tools, the Joint Fires and Effects Training System...
            </p>
            <p>
             ..The use of video games for military training began in 1980. Battlezone, a popular arcade hit that pitted players against three-dimensional (albeit wireframe) tanks, was modified for the Army to school Bradley Fighting Vehicle gunners. But when he was writing the Ender’s Game short story and novel, Card didn’t find much in his neighborhood arcade to inspire a vision for the virtual warriors of the future. “None of the games I had seen were remotely useful in preparing soldiers for either combat or leadership,” he says.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..The Army has just begun rolling out its most ambitious mission simulation project yet. Costing $27 million to develop and $490 per system to deploy, the Integrated Training Environment is a suite of government off-the-shelf hardware and software tools that allow a commander to combine virtual humans and real brigades together in what Blake calls a

               It's quite clearly the destruction of the middle class.

               In the UK, a large proportion of the population is ignoring calls for 'social distancing'. It will be interesting to see the disease numbers compared to other countries over the next few weeks.

             I look for clues everywhere.  Including your own submission history .. like this post

             Though you only cut and paste someone else's work from another forum, I'm finding plenty to run with. I'll let you know when I post about that.

             I'll give you credit, this is not especially noteworthy to me and I wish we had stronger threads to dig, but I wouldn't call it a disinfo tactic anymore than I'd point out those twitter responders as shill agents; just genuine people who're scared &amp; angry about someone they have many reasons to distrust. Perhaps some more history of Hanx as a child procurer would help?
            </p>
            <p>
             On account of criticizing the thread, it's not like I have any better (yet) alternatives to offer, neither of us do. Hopefully, with my country's workforce soon in full lockdown, we'll all have plenty time to cross research.

              Pizzagate doesn't mean you obsess on every stupid esoteric detail in a pathetic attempt to bury any meaningful research into actual child abuse.  This is a well known disinfo tactic called the Forum Slide.

             Tom and Rita are currently in a position to help mankind like no others can: they’ve been diagnosed and (at least apparently for Rita) cured of this virus.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tom and Rita could give in-depth insights into every aspect from diagnosis, to quarantine and treatment, to eventually beating it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Given their celebrity and the fact that the public is quarantined and starved for details on this virus, their firsthand accounts could possibly save countless lives, alleviate suffering, and make them truly world wide heroes, even bigger than they already are.
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m confused as to why they haven’t reached out to humanity in this respect. The very same humanity that made them who they are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Out of all the blue-check celebrities who respond to their posts, none of them are (publicity at least) asking these questions either. Don’t these people have families they’re worried about? If not for their sake, for the sake of their fans? Where is the panic in this particular segment of society, the same panic that is cultivated daily in the MSM?
            </p>
            <p>
             This crisis seems a very odd time to live up to the stereotype of the narcissistic movie star.

              They don't see themselves that way. I don't really even know that the fans are indeed the ones who elevate them in status, I mean truly, that probably isn't how it works, but thats a different issue. The point is, they feel themselves on another level and don't much give a shit about us, neither their "friends", and of course none of them worry about it since as you can well see they recieve highest level medical care and do just swell. They are fucking disgusting in my opinion, all of these stars are vile

             I can see taking a book or two books on vacation (I do that). But taking an old typewriter on vacation doesn't sound normal, so probably a lie.

            If you scroll down on Rita’s tweet to  Jim Carey he has a face there with triangular pieces that look like pizza. They are in the corona virus floret design. Maybe I’m over analyzing this so please take a look.

            An Orson Scott Card Quote: "With false names, on the right nets, they could be anybody. Old men, middle-aged women, anybody, as long as they were careful about the way they wrote. All that anyone would see were the words, their ideas.
            <strong>
             Every citizen started equal, on the nets
            </strong>
            ."
           </p>
           <p>
            Madonna also posted a bizarre video of herself in the bath.. and she was babbling on about how we are all equal...

             I think one of the most interesting things about the book is how at the end, Ender thinks he's just doing another simulation but it's actually the real deal and he saves the human race. Does this somehow play into what Rita is conveying? I'm not sure how - unless she's telling her fellow elites this is it, it's not a game anymore?
