            id rather hear more about Mike Berman.  Hes a longtime Podesta friend who also wrote them about how he was on the list to get a kidney transplant (they offered no help unfortunately).  A similar note informed them that Pam Fleischaker successfully received her second heart transplant and a new kidney (she has a disease)
           </p>
           <p>
            The pizza references are starting to seem less sinister though.  You could ask your friend if he wants to get a beer for an hour and he knows it means you want a necessarily brief social encounter, which are usually done over food/drink.  "Who wants pizza? We only have one slice and we need to know how thin to cut it" is playful office humor.

              On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing The Global Intelligence Files, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered "global intelligence" company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.

 There's apparently been some confusion: we're not reserving slices here. 
 Everybody gets one slice, according to their needs, just as the glorious 
 tenets of Marxism would tell us.

             It may be playful humor,  maybe it's   ''psychological method''  (whatever the hell that is)   but in connection with the rest of the information,  it needs to be investigated.

              could mean  going for an hour, but normal people   don't  usually phrase it that way.   Anyone who has that type of art work isn't anything normal people could relate to, so there's that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Normal people might say,  "would love to  get a beer, I can only stay  an hour"    instead of  "would love to get beer for an hour."
             </p>

              Maybe he's on a rushed  lunch break.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I'm booking something in time increments,  like a massage, or timed and structured  session,   I might say,  "I'm getting a massage for an hour."

              I  think the wikileak excitement describing  success with   dominos on pasta or cheese  is less likely to have any other explanation,  along with ordering thousands of dollars of  hotdogs and pizza  flown in for a party.  I don't think it's logistically possible to fit that much in a jet, (that's a lot of hotdogs) or practical to have cold reheated  pizza for an event.    If they shipped them in a refrigerated truck the  hotdogs would  be heated but pizza wouldn't be edible.

               Nice post very rational and unbiased analysis. I think there is definitely something strange about Podesta and his art collection however I'm not convinced pizza definitively means children.

                I recall a co-worker who is pro-weed, told me she created a code word among her friends "cheese buns"  for the word weed.
               </p>
               <p>
                My co-worker had   no idea that cheese is also slang for little girls,  or cheesey pizza might be little girls sex.  Co-worker would have used a completely different code word if she was aware of different slang references.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's no way these people aren't aware of codes... look at Sparky Alefantis group using slices of pizza on groins, etc.  They know code words so why wouldn't they have told their  bum-buddies  podesta's   whom they email with  xoxoxo.... so concerned and loving but not enough to give them a heads up about the words their using?
               </p>
               <p>
                Did they all know what words they were using, because  so many of those emails were phrased    to conceal meaning.  I can think of a few of them right now.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pizza could also mean sex,  or a massage with a happy ending  paid per hour.
Pics of females  and males with a slice of pizza over their groin could just mean sex.
So cheese or cheese has been known to reference  gender or  age.
A few months ago I saw a ytube showing a pre-pg  vid conversation of 2 men talking about getting a really cheesey pizza in related to  a simultaneous conversation  about a child.    I looked for the clip but can't find it now.

                With all the artwork and   abramovic shit cannibalism desensitization - thelema  - 33 degree masonic ritual  stuff it  would be nice to get a complete investigation.  But of course the power people are generally aware of the masonic bohemian grove aspect of their political circles, so we haven't seen any investigation due to potential exposure in areas that have globally been kept hidden in plane sight but never exposed in truth to the public,  similar shelving  of  project flicker,  franklin, etc

                Clinton Foundations involvement with Haiti child trafficking,  and  Bills  odd rescue of Lisa Lings sister Laura's  child trafficking incident,   combined with Saudi  elites unhidden  addiction to white child snuff,  it's  hard to say where the connection and codes stop and start.
               </p>
               <p>
                Have you read or watched Cathy O'Brien's testimony?
I'm not sure if  Cathy  pressed charges... so important to do for the ability to expose, even though it would be another form of legal torment.
               </p>
               <p>
                Cathy said Hillary  cut her up,  but I read another rumor that it was  Col.Maj  Michael Aquino.   I'm not sure which is which, and  her trauma  prevents actual details understandably.

                Somebody did this to her:  (warning; don't watch the last few minutes if you don't want to be haunted)

                I watched Ellen DeGeneres interview with Hillary asking her questions, one included sex with her daughter.    If that was all meant as a joke then what is a joke and what isn't,  but given so much information that's never been exposed to the public in a real nonpartisan investigation it becomes obvious why  this shouldn't be dropped and moved on to the next drama.  Or waved off as a joke.   Who jokes by asking a mother if they'd have sex with their daughter  (paraphrasing because I'm not going to look for the actual clip.)
                <br/>
                People working as a public figure are told that at all times they represent the public and need to conduct themselves accordingly, whether on or off duty.  A politician is on duty at all times -  publically speaking.
               </p>
               <p>
                For once a handful of people are globally attempting to join together and demand nonpartisan investigation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Which is why I wish someone who is skilled would put together a  crowd-fund  for one or 2 attorneys who are familiar and interested in  the topic,  and  have them represent us to the Weiner case, the Clinton foundation emails, re-open the project flicker investigation, etc and hold their feet to the fire --- no sealing documents from the public,  not a partisan investigation either.     As I mentioned in the other thread,  their pinging the public to see if anybody cares if they drop the Weiner charges,  but the Huma-Hillary connection also needs to be investigated related to Weiners emails.  That's where we need a crowd-fund for a lawyer to intercede.
               </p>
               <p>
                If we don't it will be a missed opportunity.
               </p>
               <p>
                But I digress,  hidden verbiage is definitely used  in other podesta emails and that's the problem,  what are
                <strong>
                 they
                </strong>
                using  and how can they provide  productive web of information to provide a  hearing.     WikiLeaks even shows that Obama  exchanged emails using a different name.
               </p>
               <p>
                The compendium of research shows that there's something more going on here, and  these people brought it on themselves by shutting down  project flicker investigation,  military investigations,  Franklin scandal, all related to pedophiles.
               </p>
               <p>
                People are going to ask about child sex trafficking/pedophilia  because  it HAS  happened within these circles.  And it hasn't been adequately investigated.  Why?
               </p>
               <p>
                For example,  I know a   immigrant from Africa  who recently told me that she left because of safety,  Western military men would break into their living quarters  and rape - they didn't care who.   Don't hear that on  CNN, FOX, BBC, CBC, CBCNN,  etc  and if we do  hear it  WE don't care.  Or for a minute we do and it's off to our next drama.
               </p>
               <p>
                One thing on its own might not make a person question,  but if one takes all the information from all factors it's a big  what the hell?
               </p>
               <p>
                Apologies  for the redundant rant.

            Lots of ciphers could be used here. Also, this could be a key to unlock a steganographically hidden image within either another image's data set or other file type. Just some speculation for you.
