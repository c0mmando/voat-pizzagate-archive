            What you call it, what term(s) you use to describe it, whatever the rhetoric, is IRRELEVANT.  The masses need to be awakened.  It is long overdue. No more "pussyfooting around."  Shock the hell out of them.  Whatever it takes.  All of us here have been shell-shocked for months.   JC, this protective attitude is disgusting beyond belief.

            I usually ask people if they heard about the email leaks from Hillary Clinton. Its a boring topic right until I get an excited tone in my voice followed by, "Did you actually see some of the emails and what they said?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I show them emails like, "Still in kill room" to immediately catch their attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            That worked pretty well for me to at least open the door to further explain other parts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or at least let them speculate and analyze the emails themselves which usually makes them curious enough to look a bit further.

            I think not mentioning the word " pizzagate " is fine as long as its highlighted that people used the code word pizza for nefarious reasons etc etc .. then people can think to themselves " where did I hear that pizza stuff" and start putting their own dots together? I had a friend ask me today if I was over this pizzagate stuff yet? As we were talking the news came on about all the recent sexual misconduct cases etc and I pointed to the screen and said " that's pizzagate " it's not about just one lonlely pizza shop in DC , it's about all the complicity and coverups in msm, pedowood, the elite etc . And since their complicit for the most part would you agree that they would call it fake news? She said "omg your right !" .

            For me, it was great realization about the NYPD and FBI having in evidence of the Weiner laptop. It was that with the emails from  Huma and Clinton on there and has the evidence they need for prosecuting her etc. For trafficking, Haiti malfeasance  and  Clinton Fund pay to play. That and the pod esta emails about the "map" etc . But, there is so much-I don't know if one thing does it for anyone-it was all the evidence that piled on.

            This is something that tells the story from the Podesta Emails... can be expanded upon and all the evidence added to it point by point.  Perhaps make it into a narrated video showing visual evidence throughout.
           </p>
           <p>
            It all started with talk about "pizza" in the Podesta emails released by wikileaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no argument the emails are John Podesta's, and are genuine. Along with the wikileak emails, was a  declassified FBI document; a list of symbols and code words used by pedofiles and in the child trafficking industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            In some of the emails, there was the use of those codewords.  The words were used in such a context that they made no sense unless their meaning was matched to the code words listed in the FBI document.   There are words such as pizza, pasta, cheese, dominoes, etc.  The context these words were used in within certain emails only made sense if they were code words for something other than food.
           </p>
           <p>
            The emails also lead to a certain pizza place in DC called "Comet Pizza and Ping Pong" where "pizza related activity" was taking place.   People investigated in person and online.   For starters, the prominent mural in the back room of the pizza place was of women playing with dismembered babies.  Disgusting right?  Well, according to all the "trusted news sources"... that mural was never there.  Nor the disgusting graffiti in the bathroom etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is ample evidence to show the sick mural was there, they painted over it and all the major news agencies are now lying.  That's how big this is.   It can start there for anyone to see the truth about these matters.  Sure, it's just a sick mural they decided to say never existed... but there's more.... much more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding the mural, there are eye witnesses who saw it.  There were many photos taken inside the establishment with the mural in view that were posted on the social media of people who go there or work there.  And there is a children's TV series filmed with scenes inside that pizza place; it also shows the mural as it was before being painted over.

             The artist who painted the mural, an associate of those in and around the pizza place, and her other works of art are another topic on a journey of WTF?
            </p>
            <p>
             Where things dive into the truly bizarre (yes more bizarre than the mural and everyone lying about it) is the other photos and posts made by that crowd on their social media accounts.   All kinds of talk about satanism, talk of killing babies, pentagrams and the number 666 everywhere.  Same admiration for the artist Marina Abramovic (I will get to later).... as we see so many celebrities professing.  No mention of this whatsoever on the "news".
            </p>
            <p>
             There was connection between people from many "pizza places" in their circle of people  communicating with one another on social media.  All of the information from their Instagram accounts was able to be archived.  All those posts of theirs can be seen still through internet archives of what the pages used to look like.  Then there were the bands that played there advertised for "all ages welcome".
            </p>
            <p>
             The two main professional acts that perform there are a band called "Heavy Breathing", and one called "Sex Stains".  Their band posters advertise as "all ages welcome" and often have pedofile activity depicted as well as the symbols declassified by the FBI as being used in pedofile rings/human trafficking in the artwork.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once again, the media worked hard to depict the band "Heavy Breathing" as innocent and the victim's of online conspiracy and harassment.  They did not mention their sidekick "Sex Stains", probably because you just can't whitewash that band into something suitable for children.  Especially their poster with a cartoon of a small child being raped and their spirit leaving their body.
            </p>
            <p>
             The public began an online and in person investigation.  It was discovered it's not just the one pizza place, but several of the surrounding establishments.... including a pizza place just doors down with one of the pedofile symbols in their shop sign.    They changed that almost immediately, but there is still all the evidence showing what their sign looked like before the cover up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Connections were made to the bookstore across the street,  it's a circle of connected friends on that block.  The book store also had the pedofile symbolism present.... and the owner has been writing Hillary Clinton speeches for decades.  The bookstore's name is "Politics and Prose".
            </p>
            <p>
             What is with the connection to pizza?  Strangely enough, around the beginning of 2017 the Department of Homeland Security put out a commercial talking about sex trafficking and the commercial was filmed in front of a pizza place.
            </p>
            <p>
             How does that pizza place tie into anything?  The owner is listed as the 16th most powerful person in Washington DC and is the ex boyfriend of David Brock (he owns a company called "Media Matters", that in large part creates what is broadcast on the conglomerate of news networks).  The pizza shop itself is featured on the food network, and is often spoken of by the political elite in Washington DC.   The owner visited the White House at least 5 times during the last administration.  During a citizen investigation, a car registered to Jet Propulsion Laboratories was photographed parked there at an after hours closed door party.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where is all this headed?  The conclusions many came to were grim.   Many concluded there's a subversive group of  "satanic pedofiles" operating subversively in the highest levels and throughout society.   But is this so?  Was the posting of satanic symbolism just a joke?  Did they display known sybolism of pedofiles on accident?
            </p>
            <p>
             We shall look into the former first.... are there really satanists in society?  At the very top of society?  On first glance, I'd say no... society is run by very respectable and honorable people... surely nothing of the sort could be present.  We are going to investigate further into that group around the pizza place.  One woman everyone in their social circle seemed to revere was an artist named Marina Abramovic.   Marina professes to be a practictioner of "Crowley Magic".... also known as satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where else do we find Marina?  Marina can be seen hosting parties for the celebrity elite in Hollywood.. sick parties with bodies, sometimes bloody bodies as food.  Are those just some kind of innocent weird dinner parties?
            </p>
            <p>
             We see Marina everywhere behind the scenes in Hollywood.  We also see she's admired by the prominent politicians too with the Podesta brothers planning to go to one of her parties.  Is there any connection?  This can't mean the celebrities and politicians could be practicing satanists?  That's a little far fetched.   How did so many people come to the conclusion there are practicing satanists pretty much running society?
            </p>
            <p>
             Marina Abramovic mentioned Allister Crowley.... most of us have heard of him.  The rock star Ozzy Osbourne titled one of his songs after him.   A quick search shows he was known as the wickedest man alive "limitless", and did practice and preach "satanism" or worship of the devil.  Mr. Crowley wrote several books.   In his books he describes the practice of magic... including the sex rituals and human sacrifice rituals recommended to gain the most magical power.
            </p>
            <p>
             This has gone way off the deep end!  Could there really be people nowadays still practicing Crowley's magic?  Well there's Marina.  Is there a church of those people?  How long has this been going on?  How many are involved?  Do they really do those  sacrifices Crowley's book talked about?  Who are they?  Where are they?
            </p>
            <p>
             There are many questions.  As for how long it's been going on... apparently it was around long before Allister Crowley, as Crowley only expanded on the works of Manly P. Hall... who wrote much more than Crowley on the practice of the dark arts.  As for how many involved, it's hard to say.  Their practices are called the "occult", which literally means hidden.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do they really do the sacrifices talked about in those satanism books?  There is where things take a very gruesome turn into the unthinkable..... its beyond the limit of most to even conceptualize such activity.   Perhaps for an artist like Marina who claims to be "limitless", such practices could be performed.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no proof any of that is being done!!!  Here is where I present to you numerous cases of witness testimony made over the years which say that is exactly what is being done.   Despite all the testimonies, no investigation is ever done.  How can that be?  Surely such a band of wicked people could not be powerful enough to control police investigation?  Is it the police too?
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's look at a very prominent figure in society...Walt Disney.  We all know Disney as a children's entertainer.  Nowadays, the Disney corporation owns most of the movie and television production companies.  Everyone knows Walt Disney was a good guy!  Right?  He is a good guy right?
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe not so much.  Looking into Walt Disney we find back in the 1930's he was in an all male club called "The Uplifters", attended by powerful people... to include heads of the media networks of the time, Hollywood celebrities and the Sheriff of Los Angeles.... what's interesting is, the wikipedia entry mention's the play they produced titled "the uplift of lucifer".
            </p>
            <p>
             When looking closer at the media produced by Disney, we find some creepy, tell tale signs.  Maybe not conclusive, but they are there.

               Yeah, that was on here... .someone here long ago went to Comet.  It was closed, but there was a car registered to Jet Propulsion Laboratories... it originally run by Jack Parsons, and known by workers there as "Jack Parsons Laboratories".   On wikipedia there's a photo regarding Parson's wife leaving him for L. Ron Hubbard (the fiction writer).  And also Allister Crowley, the photo is titled "the inner circle".   It does go deep, those flat earthers are not wrong... we are lied to about the shape of the earth...its been going on strong since WWI, all evidence of how the earth was conceived prior was removed from the western world.   Like Micheal Jackson tried to say... our history books are lies.   The message of all that ball earth, evolution etc. science is "there is no god"... and all throughout the history of ball earth science... we see "satanists" involved... even to this day.   Look close at all the photos from outer space.,.. they are computer animations pawned as photos.  The "art of deception".  The astronauts are here on earth on a Hollywood studio set.  The accompanying science is equally as fraudulent.
              </p>
              <p>
               Regarding satellites... there are none... just ground based antenna across a flat circular disc (that's how everyone had it figured before the ball earth "science" was put upon us).  LORAN worked to track ships hundreds of miles away... impossible on the curved surface of a ball for the antenna to send signal in a straight line to the ship and back to triangulate its position... and if tracking was being done with ground antenna, why even a need for expensive satellites?  For one, they help enforce the fantasy we live on a giant ball spinning at over 1,000 mph, while orbiting a sun 93 million miles away at 66,600 mph (notice all the 666's in that science too.. earth tilted at 66.6 degrees in that model).... and the sun itself moving along at over half a million miles per hour.... you can tell by the light trail behind it, its moving along at at least 300,000 mph.   lol  It really is all fantasy and illusion.... twisting what we really see into their fantastic model...and by dispersing their members throughout society have made the illusion manifest.
              </p>
              <p>
               With the trio or "inside circle"..  Hubbard first wrote about satellites in his fiction novels, not long after, Parsons built the rockets and made them scientific fact.... Am thinking the reason Howard Hughes went from flamboyant socialite to paranoid recluse, is because his company built the first satellites.... yes, they really built satellites intended to go into space, but he caught on they really don't go into space.... and caught on to cult the people behind such a massive and complex deception.  Pizzagate goes far beyond the pizza place, it goes much, much higher and the crux of it is satanism.   All these hollywood elites diddling teenagers is superficial... i mean its not good what's going on there, but puts the investigation way off track in getting to the bottom of where the rabbit hole leads from that pizza shop and its association with children and satanism.  Crowleys books did describe human sacrifice and sex ritual.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyways, yeah, next time you see them launch a rocket into space... watch close for the trickery... what we really see is a rocket launched out over the ocean and once it leaves our sight, there's a switch to Hollywood magic.  Based on what we see, its logical fallacy to conclude the rocket went anywhere but back down to earth once it left our sight.  Read the fine print, the rockets are built with an "emergency escape chute" down the center... though they've never been used... but it leads to a room beneath the pad.  What's really going on, is after the actors board the "command module" at the top.... they drop down to the safe room and the rocket is launched into the ocean.   Its all trickery and illusion... and always has been.  Go back (on youtube) and watch old "live" television broadcasts from the late 60's taken "up in space".  The Hollywood magic was primitive then....looking back its ridiculous anyone ever bought it.. now, its pretty obvious its just satanist story telling time. :/

                 Yeah, sorry.... I will probably never find the photo of that car parked there.  You won't be able to confirm that.   Regarding the other, I can show you proof with this latest photo of planet earth shown on the Huffington post... but same photo shown on all the news networks, the same networks that say pizzagate is conspiracy theory in concert too.

                 The photo is also at NASA's website and will be in school textbooks.  You can decide if it is really a photo taken from about a million miles away.  Look upside down bottom left on the photo... what is that it says in the clouds?

                 Yeah, I have no idea how to search this site.  Nice archive for an investigation.   So yeah, due to the lack of ability to scan through old posts.... I'd say its just hearsay then from your standpoint.   If you have any idea how I can look through posts from probably a year ago or search for posts that might contain key words and look for it..... or even if I could go back and see all of my comments, I commented on the photo mentioning the connection between JPL and Jack Parsons.   And I haven't commented on here a whole lot.... didn't even log on for a long, long time.... just read stuff, didn't comment.   So if I could just see all the comments I ever made I would find the original post.. provided this site doesn't black hole information.

                 Do you have any idea how to search this site?  I probably commented on the post way back when, or maybe it was a photo in the comments.  Somebody went there and took photos and yeah, looked up the registration with motor vehicles for the car there.  Then there was the talk here too when researching Epstein, and everyone was baffled about all his interests in science that were discovered.

             What about that Sheriff who was in their Uplifter club?  His name was Sheriff Biscailuz, the sheriff of LA county at the time.  Here is something interesting, he had a badge custom made in 1939 with a symbol  listed in the FBI documents as being used by child traffickers.    That same badge design has since been adopted by other police agencies across the country.   Could it be a mistake they used that symbol?  In a Young Turks news report talking about those symbols, Cenk didn't think anyone could use that symbol and not know what it meant.... but then again, Cenk didn't know so many police departments had it on their badges. (note same symbol is seen in the band "Sex Stains" music videos).. it's the spiral triangle.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also of note with the 1930's club is they started and ran many youth groups.  There seems to be a pattern with those associated, being involved with youth groups.   Back to the start and the DC pizza shop:  the bands that play there, the manager of those bands is the leader of the DC girl scouts.
            </p>

             Jimmy Saville is another character who for years was accused of being a practicing satanist with a lust for children.  Saville was the top star on British television.  He was loved by everyone.   Saville raised money on TV for children.  He worked closely with and had his own offices at Orphanages and children's hospitals.  He was charged with molesting children, and accused of abducting them.  The accusers said more than 400 children had gone missing from the facilities he worked at over the years.  After being charged with child molestation, Jimmy Saville killed himself and the investigation ended.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where this whole disclosure reaches the peaks of horror.... is Saville was a regular visitor to both the Royal Palace and Vatican.   Make of that what you will, but one newly hired newscaster at the BBC was invited to parties, and he quit... claiming Saville was a leader in a satanic ring using children for sex and sacrifice... and it led all the way to the royal palace.   The man's image was smeared and he was called crazy.  There was no investigation.  That was around 30 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Apparently these people often work closely with children and are somehow protected from investigation.  How vast is this network?  There was a police report filed in Australia against the father of Nicole Kidman.  The woman states as a child she was used in satanic rituals where other kids were killed, she was used for sex....   Nicole Kidman's father was implicated and he left the country, was found dead in a Singapore Hotel room... "heart attack".
            </p>
            <p>
             This is all shocking information and there is more, much more that links things together from every direction.   An alarming number of children do go missing every year... .as we are finding out, sometimes they go missing through the orphanages.
            </p>
            <p>
             The number of people involved or subservient to the upper crust of it would have to be astounding.  Some say Kennedy caught on and described it when he spoke of "secret socieities, secret oaths, and secret proceedings"... and warned "we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy, which has conscripted vast human and material resources".

            I agree to not call it anything-- pizzagate, pedowhatever, don't call it anything. Branding it it triggers the mindcontrol and then you and your message are locked out. Show the creepy biden videos.

            I saw some really disturbing images yesterday of some promotional material for an A le fantis art opening (I think)-- it was an infant in a Santa hat with a bruised face. Very disturbing image for what it shows and what it doesn't the look in the child's eyes will break through to alot of people.

           <p>
            What's up with that picture where Obo has a child splayed across on his lap or the one where his hand is in a girl's waistband? 
Map related handkerchief?

            I appreciate all the suggestions everyone and am also myself going through both the Pizzagate wiki for what I already do and don't know along with the sticky at the top of the forum. I will create a movie length red pill from different clips sometime this week and link it here. If more want to add feel free.

            I always thought seeing these two things side-by-side put into perspective the scale of the coordination to discredit this info:

            Everybody is now familiar with the term "Fake News" but showing that the only reason that term was created was an attempt to quash these "theories" from being spread is pretty powerful.

            Of course you will need to read through all the weird code and innuendo in the emails - cross reference it with the FBI warning to watch out for this exact same pedo lingo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the profiles on elite, well known individuals who have serious dark shit in their closet are very captivating. That's why people love tabloids - they love finding out the people they "thought they knew" have major issues. I think the best approach, as others have said, is just displaying the information in a concise manner using open-source, confirmed reports - finding old articles to support your claims from MSM sources is the best, because it shows you are not just reaching at the fringes for info and it shows others that this info is right in front of them if they will open their eyes and learn to connect dots.

            Hillary State Department send "New Life Children's Refuge" to Haiti to "collect 100 orphans".  This team is led by Laura Silsby.  Silsby gets caught trying to steal 33 kids, 22 of which still had living parents. She gets locked up.  HRC send a lwayer to get her out of Haitian jail but the lawyer gets caught up in his own Sex trafficking scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silsby eventually gets out of jial thanks to HRC.  A few years goes by and Silsby resurfaces as VP or Marketing for "Alert Sense" which provides technology to FEAM to assist with Amber Alert systems.  This company "Alert Sense" is represented by Podesta group.

            I'm seeing a lot of comments about avoiding the term 'pizzagate' and I do agree that phrase has been successfully maligned by the MSM, but I have found that if I mention pizzagate and people automatically show rejection, then I ask them to define pizzagate. I ask them to tell me how it got the name pizzagate. 100% of them define it incorrectly and I share the correct knowledge that pizzagate is an investigation and that 'pizza' is one of  the code words used by pedos in the JP emails. This takes the direction away from the distorted Comet and Hillary narrative that MSM presented.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I am kinda mixed about using pizzagate, on the one hand it is a turn off, and on the other hand it allows you to engage and correctly define what it is... and distinguish between pedogate and pizzagate.

            I started a conversation with my neighbors about the Netflix series "The Keepers" because we often discuss our favorite on-demand entertainment. I mentioned how interesting it was to see these two women (students of the missing teacher) do all this investigative work for almost 50 years. And, doing it without the ease of access like the internet - they did lots of 'boots on the ground' investigation that the police would not follow through on. My neighbors agreed it sounded interesting and would watch it.
           </p>
           <p>
            This gave me the opportunity to put in a few hints at how citizen investigators are documenting and archiving a similar 'scandal' that involves child abusers on a massive scale. They knew I was referring to pizzagate because I had mentioned it before but I didn't push it. Just wanted to make a parallel that when mainstream media and law enforcement abandon wrong doings, it's up to others to keep the quest alive.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't really achieve a red pill moment, but I believe it was a nudge towards them being more open minded and respectful towards citizen journalism and crowd sourced efforts.

            It's called pizzagate because pizza is a code word for sex with children, and it gets a gate because politicians were using this code.

            There's a list of university staff jailed for child porn or child rape, the same lady also has a list on her website featuring Rep politicians charged with possessing child porn or child rape. Sorry, currently don't remember her name.
           </p>
           <p>
            Showing them the sheer amount of names and what they did helps.

            I always tell newbees to go to the beginning. Start with the TV movie that was removed 2 hours before airtime. The beginning explains this ao they can see information is controlled and covered up. Then I give them links to hear Cathy O'Brien and Brice Taylor speak. Now Bob Hope will make sense and be believable, as in his involvement. Start here: Conspiracy of Silence.

            I have used the Conspiracy of Silence video for 15 years. It works! Then every time something happens locally or in DC the dots keep connecting for those just introduced. They will not understand or believe without that video. The reason it was taken down before airtime!

             I'll put it like this. Alot of my videos involve diseases and the attempts of humanity to contain them. I consider pedophiles and these elite rapist scumbags to be the worst disease possible. Humanity needs to stop this virus and we need to wake people up to stop these sick fucks.

              They literally are cancer if if you think about what they do. They have been aware of this ratio for thousands of years. What they do is invert the ratio, flip it backwards, and use it as a weapon. One obvious example is pushing transgender and you will see why when you watch this three minute video. Watch this and think backwards. This is what they reverse.The Golden Mean Ratio.

            Good thinking.

           <p>
            I would not call it pizza/pedogate either.
Call it for what it is. Child rape and murder, rituals for personal gain of power. On a VERY organized high level.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also recommend that you contact Jake Morphonios on End Time News Report.
He has ALOT of solid info on ritual abuse, peados and the elite.
And he makes it easy to understand.
He is a really good independent journalist.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the luck to you.

            introduce it with elite level rings that have already been busted, Epstein's island, Marc Dutroux, Jimmy Savile, and other pedo sex offenders. With Jimmy Savile, make sure to explain that accusations were common, and everyone "knew" - (see how John Lydon was banned from BBC for publicly accusing Savile

            Bring up how Westminster have been covering their tracks ever since Savile's death and subsequent exposure -

           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe question how the singer of a band Lost Prohpets called Ian Watkins that started out completely straight edge (no alcohol, drugs, promiscuous sex) moves to LA and eventually gets sent to prison for 35 years for raping a baby (despite again, a few cover ups from police about 2008, lack of interest in investigating claims)
           </p>
           <p>
            Then move onto what's been uncovered in wikileaks, Laura Silsby. Establish that this is very much a real thing first and foremost

              And Obama's 65 thousand dollars in "hot dogs" and "pizza" where the person asks "I assume we're using the same channels" - that just sound guilty as heck, especially since no outside food is allowed in to the White House.

               Agreed. Easy to understand too. Just got sent a memo on my FB which traveled all over the US with the words, "Obama has never been accused of grabbing a pussy." Posters said if the news item wasn't on MSM it was a lie. That's the mentality. FB (now former) acquaintances who were circulating the memo are all college educated professionals. Most Americans don't have the energy or time to research bad news that makes them feel even more powerless. Please keep this in mind. Better to start off with mass child abduction &amp; rape. Most Americans fear gang violence.

               Would not do stories re Europe unless you are seeking a mostly European audience.  Not everybody even knows the names associated with pizzagate so that term might be confusing to some.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remember the post re Keanu Reeves was reportedly said to have punched out a producer after finding a dead White &amp; Brown baby in his elite, expensive home? Brand new videos have gone up with thousands of viewers basically saying the exact same thing. Smart creators who want to build an audience. Sure people linked the bad quality video denying it produced by Media Matters. More asked about why the elite would want to drink a dead baby's blood.
              </p>
              <p>
               Please think about the reasons why these videos are so popular. Also that Keanu's PR Team would be foolish to aggressively complain about what Keanu did or did not say a few years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
               Guarantee you with this info it would be easy for you to find a star who wants thousands and thousands of people to praise his/her name for speaking out. Personally credit should go to RDJ for starting the trend initially. Any star you can contact and get approval for name dropping a sentence or two into your video along with a shocking statement like the one above would bring in a ton of gossipy followers.

               Or you could go the Abel Danger Field McConnell route and be far more intellectual. He even admitted he only got a couple of new followers daily until he went on another YouTube channel for an interview that was posting and explaining all of the 4Chan "Q" reveals. The woman had a very pleasing, soft voice and was easily understood. So Field got 1700 new followers afterwards.

            Introduce it through the Catholic church, people are aware of the pedo practices in that area, back track down that line to the royal family, (show them the video how that kid is jumping out the window, it will then make sense what you explained previously about the royal family then.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then explain has it's interconnected through generations then explain on that note how people in positions of power have been doing this for awhile, (introduce the Bill clinton flights to the Island) how story's are coming out from Celebrities who have been stuck in this cycle as they stuck in the cycle as child stars then go off the rails.
           </p>
           <p>
            Show pictures of Maconly Kulcan &amp; Lohan &amp; explain how you are told to think they are crazy but what has happened is they just escaped. Then explain the process of nabbiding through HolyWood &amp; commet Ping Pong.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lead them down the rabbit hole as if you were a guide, you don't just push someone down the cave if they are new, sometimes that's what you do when you have more experience, sometimes people stumple into said cave &amp; people are already down there researching then when you explain everything that hits them hard.

              Classic projection from a narracist FAGGOT. In little words, meaning that which you claim is good about yourself is lies and how you insult others is what's true about YOU.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nobody takes you seriously, everybody hates you, you have nothing useful to say, you're an idiot who claims to be a genius, all you do is make the rest of us look like nazi sympatheziers. and you have no valid role here. Go on, leave and never come back. We'll all cheer when you're gone.

            You should delete the channel anyway.  Here's a red pill for you: the Puritans who singlehandedly founded this country came from a culture that saw dramatic performance as evil manipulation, not to mention QUEER since males played female roles.  They banned Christmas because it comes from Saturnalia pagan festival involving role-changing, gambling, and no doubt pederasty and licentiousness.

            Don't introduce it to people as pizzagate, since the well was poisoned on that already. Instead, point out to people in a series of arguments that in cases of petty power, like the Weinstein sex scandal, that people abuse to the limited degree they're capable of. And mention that when something relatively unimportant is involved, like college football, people will still work to cover up kid-raping.

            Work up from there to Lord Janner, who had more than petty power, and more than petty games, still officially covered up by the MET. They went so far as to steal the dossier on it to protect his name.

             The code word in many of the emails is "PIZZA" ... comet ping pong (even though they may have been a honey pot/red herring) is still a PIZZA shop!  I get that some people dont like using the term "pizzagate" but i dont understand people that are agressivley AGAINST it.  Pizza is the word used in the emails.  i say go with "Pizzagate".  I think the people that want it changed to "Pedogate" are shilling,  whether they even realize it or not....

                You should be aware of how you come across. People reflexively defended Sandusky, and he was't exceptionally wealthy or powerful. If you ratchet up the wealth and power, sycophants will reflexively attack you.
               </p>
               <p>
                Its better to ease outsiders into the otherwise obvious idea that people with wealth and power abuse their wealth and power. You don;t do that with unnecessary baggage.

                 Sometimes you have to throw a huge brick as hard as you can to break the glass bubble.  If you keep trying to get people to slowly roll down the window to communicate these "conspiracies" they will simply roll the window back up in your face.  If you throw a brick through the window they have no choice but to, at the minimum, give it some thought until they can get it fixed (*plug back into the matrix) or realize that they should just get out of the bubble.

             Was thinking that...was thinking of just introducing it as Pedogate. However for the people who know about Pizzagate it's a viral word. I'm going to see. Human Trafficking at the Olympics and major sporting events is a big one. Going to mention that FBI raid from a while back.

              Brosif, there is no situation in which uttering the word "
              <em>
               Pizzagate
              </em>
              "Helps you... or us, Or anyone other than the people Who have been exposed by said
              <em>
               gate
              </em>
              that shall not be named.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "It's a viral word for people who know about pizzagate." I mean, I understand it's a viral word...But I don't understand how that's justification for continuing to use it... Especially if the people who interpret it at as a viral word, already know about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unless you meant people who know
              <em>
               OF
              </em>
              pizzagate... As in, They've heard of pizzagate, but wrote it off as nonsense... But Ironically, They probably wrote it off as nonsense because of the name Pizzagate.  Which brings us back to square one.... There is no situation in which uttering that word, benefits anyone other than the deepstate.

               "Pizza" is the code word used in the emails.  Besta and Comet are PIZZA shops. I get that "pizzagate" may not be ideal but it is what describes the code in this case.  I say keep it.

              I don't even know if I'd mention pedogate. People don't like being preached at. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. It might be easier for people to swallow if you pose info as questions. I'd present the most compelling info and say "hmmm  am I crazy or is this crazy? What do you all think? " By posing questions you get them thinking for themselves, showing them the info, but then having them connect the dots I think is the only way they'll start to actually believe in the possibility that there might be some truth behind this "crazy" conspiracy theory. Also, by posing questions, you get an open dialogue and healthy debate into whether or not this could be true. Godspeed, my friend.

               This is good strategy -- gotta get folks thinking and wondering for themselves. And have links in the comments to solid sources.
