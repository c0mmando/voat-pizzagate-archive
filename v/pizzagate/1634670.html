            "Remember what Cass Sunstein, Obama’s personally chosen Czar of Information and Privacy said about cognitive infiltration of conspiracy theories?  Sunstein suggested a non-governmental source that was trustworthy to the common person needed to strike down crazy conspiracy theories without appearing as though he was a government asset.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph, reporter Matthew Bell asks Julian Assange about “conspiracy theories.”  Assange subsequently explains his position:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “I believe in facts about conspiracies,” he says, choosing his words slowly. “Any time people with power plan in secret, they are conducting a conspiracy. So there are conspiracies everywhere. There are also crazed conspiracy theories.  It’s important not to confuse these two.  Generally, when there’s enough facts about a conspiracy we simply call this news.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What about 9/11?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “I’m constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud.”
            </p>

            <strong>
             Cryptome: Yes, Wikileaks is a clever intelligence front
            </strong>
            . And jokes about it to conceal the truth, "we would welcome CIA funding," laughs Assange. In turn, Wikileaks accuses others of being clever intelligence fronts, in particular snitchy Wired, bitchy Mother Jones and crotchety main stream journalists except for those recently lending les mains sales to its bombshelling stunts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wikileaks defends its clever ruse by slipping into its resucitated and amazingly bombshell-bastic, vastly expanded "about" web page:
           </p>
           <p>
            "It's probably pretty clear by now that WikiLeaks is not a front for any intelligence agency or government despite a rumour to that effect. This rumour was started early in WikiLeaks' existence, possibly by the intelligence agencies themselves."
           </p>
           <p>
            That quote likely refers to John Young of Cryptome who compared the start-up's ambition to raise $5million in the first year as being possible only through complicity with someone like George Soros or the CIA. Still true. Wayne Madsen, among others, asserts likely spy association. Madsen, an early supporter later disaffected, knows the lay of spy land.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://cryptome.org/0002/wikileaks-feed.htm">
             https://cryptome.org/0002/wikileaks-feed.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The founder of Cryptome was first asked to lead Wikileaks, but declined. He writes:
           </p>
           <p>
            Assange is a narcissistic individual," claims Young. "Wikileaks is willing to sacrifice Bradley Manning and anyone else to advance their own interests."
           </p>
           <p>
            In a posting to the nettime mailing list, Young added:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The free stuff is meant [to] lure volunteers and promote high-profile public service, lipsticked with risk, with the enterprise funded by selling costly material sold on the black market of worldwide spying in the tradition of public benefit ops, ID, spies and ever more spies. No better customers for illicit information that [sic] those with depthless pockets.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Soros and the Kochs have their lesser-known Internet promoters backing Wikileaks generously. And they expect good return on their investment, not just the freebies used to attract attention."

            Just looked up Ausbitbank and see last posted 2 months ago. I joined voat because of what he researched. His discovery has to do with the DOJ. My interest is not verifiable research its personal. Having to do with pizza - I canceled cable tv and threw out my tvs a couple of years ago. My Twitter archive from then, if they are saved somewhere, will read that I was cluing in to mind control. I started researching that. Then because I drive country roads in the DC area I started seeing kids I thought didn't belong to the people they were with. I am not a religious person but the only thing I decided I could do was pray. Every house I pass connected to what I observed every car, every motel anyplace I see these loud dissonances, I don't know what else to call them, I give up a prayer. I started doing praying for all the road kill I drive past over the years so that part is habitual. But when I tweeted something that I learned from Ausbitbank my computer went nuts. My phone went nuts. I went off grid practically for almost a month. So with that background. Connecting to the current Nordstroms fracas which has really pissed me off as a missed opportunity to talk about the economy, bring people more united, etc I tweeted a vent storm yesterday. After sleeping on it, realizing that Nordstroms recently, just recently ,moved into the Minneapolis market. Stay with me now. It occurred to me perhaps the Trump boycott bs about this retailer is that he knows something about the money behind it, the people behind it and this is a way to agit, innocently so to speak. Think about it, the Governor of the state is a Dayton, big retailer money, the state is now basically a Muslim run place. So the boycott could easily be a hack of sorts. There are more dots to connect but I will leave it here. Because while I respect the commitment to links and hard investigative evidence. That is denying the incredible wisdom of the neurons in the guts of healthy people. I can state I am emphatically one. I have No doubts about pizzagate. I am Worried about both Julian and his children. Remember, his lawyer is dead. Did they murder the wikileaks heartbeat all at once? Blockchain account aside. It has been said that the gut brain has more neurons than the head brain (recent discovery). I do not like to put links into discussions that are so off topic and I do not have a pizzagate link for you. But Alberto Villoldo is a good author who goes into the gut brain. There are many. the point is - all is not as it seems. Micromanaging Trump moves may take way too much time. Dissecting the meaning may require distance to see the forest by getting out of the trees. I am an Independent and I think Trump is the best hope of getting out of this rabbit hole. Really that's all I ask of his Admin. He's showing how filthy that job is.

            If by tweeting this article they are endorsing the commentary that Pizzagate is fake news ... and by tweeting Ben Swann's video also endorsing that Pizzagate needs be investigated  ... then they are talking out of both sides of their mouth. And if they are out there trying to discredit the very people who read their leaks and investigate what is in them, then aren't they shooting themselves in the foot? This tweet could very well be tongue in cheek. Does anyone know much about the Merkel story? Maybe that will shed some light on the tweet.

            NO!!! It's just a "vast right wing conspiracy". None of the things the Clintons and her associates have been accused of....FOREVER, are anything more than politically motivated /s.

              Yeah, I mean I think something's up with WL, and it's rather suspicious at times, but definitely that's not the point of this tweet.

              Hey I just posted the article and said it was tweeted by Wikileaks. Personally I'm in two minds about what's going on with Assange, I find the vault 7 stuff off-putting. I hope and pray he's alive and they're not compromised but it's hard to know what to think.

            Wikileaks Twitter links to this article with the text "Investigation by Atlantic Council finds English speaking populist-right trolls behind Merkel #FakeNews "
           </p>
           <p>
            Looks to me like they posted this to show the "trolls" behind Merkel's fake news, not agreeing with its remarks about PG.
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words, they're erratic, but don't look compromised just yet IMO.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I'll laugh if all this speculation and "Vault7" is actually Hillary's deleted emails.

              Valid point. Maybe Assange or someone with control of the account stumbled across it and was feeling salty enough to Tweet about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, the same account did Tweet Swann's PG video, and did Tweet PleadingTheYiff's post about Silsby (though this article flames him), so to now say this article = PG is fake makes no sense, unless you think the account was hijacked since the Swann post.

             This seems like a reasonable explanation, but I think the article is basically wrong and an attempt to smear The_Donald and Pizzagate.  It sounds exactly like armyseer's attempts to smear PleadingTheYiff and others.

            Something is off. If PG is fake news, why no MSM coverage? Wouldn't they be all over this? Perhaps it's a leak of what was planned.

            This might just be a 140 character problem. Hard to swallow that WikiLeaks would ever promulgate a story from the Atlantic Council. Plus, "English speaking alt-right trolls" sounds tongue in cheek to me. Not to mention that we English speakers have our own globalist monsters to expose; what could be less alt-right than a bunch of Americans or Brits trying to interfere with a German election?
Nevertheless, we don't need WikiLeaks anymore; we have verified emails; we have critical faculty; we have a moral compass. Ignore the plight of our children at your own eternal peril. If you don't pick a side, the side picks you.

            Of course everyone involved had plenty of time to scrub they're electronics when there was more than ample evidence for an investigation. I saw comets Instagram feed before it was made private, combed through the followers and following, and since then many many other feeds and have never seen anything like what we found there. One pizza shop up in the Pacific North West sizzlepie is way into satanic, more from the death metal cult / hipster side of things, but is still no where near as creepy as comet and company, the stuff there was incredibly inappropriate, was easy to see what they were into. Webb has suggested in recent days CPP / ja is into post organ harvesting body disposal and using remnants on the pizzas. These big names denouncing it, all seem very blatant about it, "they" keep trying to drag "us" away from CPP, just makes me want to know why even more. Personally, I think it's sooo Jeffrey Dahmer level shit involving so many high ups the spooks are scaring people off of this. I think the had a full service operation, ja being pump sending little boys and girls too the elite and members of all the houses, Congress and the white one. There's tunnels every fucking where there that the secret service uses to move the elite, or anything they don't want seen, whether CPP specifically is connected to the tunnels is irrelevant, as Webb described it looks like a rat line, lots of connections to trafficking out of Haiti. Lots of evidence of Satanism, but not the hipster heavy metal kind, more the real witchcraft / voodoo kind. Connections to the WH and possibly false flags / crises acting. There's the appx fifteen properties, several suspicious. The numerous aliases. I personally think everything is what it looks like it is, he's into a little bit of everything, trafficking, organ harvesting, snuff and torture, film production of snuff and torture, catering of pizza in more ways than one, he catered pizza to Tony podestas, the guy with the dahmer art and the "torture chamber" in his basement, ritual cannibalism and satanic worship for life extension and power. Direct and indirect connections to George Soros and his open society. There are substantial clues to all these things and much much more. You don't see any of these things investigating normal people. The biggee to me, that would be big enough to shut up even the AJ's of the world, is the false flag end of things. The trafficking they can isolate and send a few people up the river and call it solved. But if some major events were staged, faked, or planned by our government, even just the crises acting thing alone, and any of that comes fully out,  that connects directly to the President, several threr letter agencies, probably some members of the Senate ie CES and NP, as a vast conspiracy to create firearms restrictions. That's the one that would get the spooks hanging around. Not protecting CPP from defamation.

            As scary as it seems, the Hannity interview could have been faked. I thought a few items in the interview were strange (like the handshake). This video explores some of the audio and video technology available to make it easy to convincingly fake an interview:

            To any lurkers skeptical of PizzaGate you need to remember Hillary Clinton has actually, no joke, been tied to a convicted human trafficker/missionary named Laura Silsby.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is crucial because Haiti is the human trafficking capital of the world. Do you doubt other missionaries could be associated with human trafficking? Doubt no more:

              "to do some trolling"........Hillary got a human trafficker out of jail because.......what? I can't figure out any other reason she got Silsby out of jail than Silsby was, duh, a human trafficker.

             <p>
              That's like Hillary getting someone out of jail because they murdered someone. So yeah please elaborate.

             They hashed it "#fakenews" because the article is claiming people are spreading fake news about Merkel.  The article also claims pizzagate is fake news.  And the message the person tweeted with the link implies they agree with the article.

              No, whoever is controlling the twitter account is claiming people are spreading "fake news" about Merkel.  The title of the actual article they linked: "How a fake story about Angela Merkel led to a far-right cluster on Reddit."  This is rather surprising, to see them promoting an article smearing The_Donald and calling pizzagate fake news.

            Yeah right, the first one was edited. The second could be edited but is not worth trusting because they edited the first one already. They might just have upped the tech or looked for errors.

            No way that is proof enough. The only proof which is enough is something Assange does that without doubt states he is alive.

            These people are so pathetic. They are scrambling to hold onto their power, and have been completely exposed.

            We need to keep hammering them as hard as we can, they are already beginning to crack, and they cannot hold on much longer at this rate

             Yes. Eventually someone--whether its Alefantis, one of the Podestas, Huma Abedin, Weiner--will reach their breaking point and make some kind of glaring mistake. We can only hope that this mistake will pull out the Jenga piece that makes the whole thing fall down.

            Seems to me the vault7 stuff is intended to distract from Pizzagate while seeming like Wikileaks is active again (which it is not).  Wikileaks is now controlled opposition.  Julian is likely alive but being held captive.  The interviews he's done recently could have been CGI.

            I'm feeling discouraged.  It seems like they are going to continue saying fake news while catching "underdog" trafficking rings.  I'm glad those rings are being busted of course, but I'm starting think they are busting them to "throw us a bone" :(

             "I'm feeling discouraged." If you had any basic critical thinking skills just the thought of believing something as ridiculous as pizzagate would make you cringe and you wouldn't be in the position of "feeling discouraged" by now.

             Of course its all distraction. 
Do you really think they will take down the big fish? With all their resources, money,  power,  influence?  Of course not. Im being realistic.  The reason why this shit continues to keep going and has gotten more nefarious and worse is because these elites think and gave themselves the belief they are completely above the laws. Untouchables.  Pizzagate is real. 
Before it i dont think we have ever seen the press and government and even the vatican throw such a spin on such allegations with a narrative like fake news. And then all the pieces star to come together. And you then wonder why the elites are starting to worry.

              So we are just supposed to accept this?  It's so messed up on so many levels.  The money corruption - whatever - I can overlook the elites being above the law for that.  I mean it makes my blood boil considering their wasteful stolen luxuries but I can still cope.  I CANNOT cope when it comes to these children.  It's not so much about the elites being punished, so much as it's about these horrors continuing.  I can't look in the eyes of my children without thinking of these horrors.  It breaks me.  Do you know how sweet and bright and innocent a 12 month old is?  I watch mine make new discoveries daily and say new words and giggle and walk and suck his thumb and meow at the cat and point and say sky and flower.  Children are sacred and precious.  I just can't accept that this is going to continue on this scale indefinitely.  😢😢😢😢

               The politcians have made themselves believe in their own bullshit.  Think of it this way. 
If a woman is willing to have a abortion and its protected by the government then whats the harm of using orphaned children for their own sick pleasure? Nobody wants those anyways except sadistic pedophiles and Satanist who need actual children to sacrifice to their deities. Thats what these people think. The kids are like a thing,  a commodity. Not even really human.

                 Yes I do agree on that we cannot just tolerate it or accept it as a norm .
But we must also be realistic.  Even if we take down all key players, child abuse and exploitation of children will 
Continue.

                  Of course.  But we know of these large horrible rings here and in the U.K. etc.  the scale of these rings is baffling and so much bigger than random child abuse cases.  And the perpetrators are the very people that are supposed to protect us and make life better for the people

              They know that the masses, even in their current dumbed-down state, would be so enraged at the idea of politicians raping, torturing, killing, and EATING kids, that they would storm their mansions and their country clubs and kill every single person they could get their hands on. It would be a mass blood lust.

               Not true, Hillary was the end game. Her presidency would have been the complete transition to the new world order. Thus why they went all-in so hard on her.

                I tweeted a few @ podesta soros and Hillary so I think that might be why.  I also got into an argument with someone about muslims in Germany, Sweden, and France.  But I didn't say anything hateful - just stated facts about crimes there and immigration numbers there

             I don't think Yiff is a shill. His Silsby stuff sparked this movement way early in the process and his article on it on his site still holds up as some of the most convincing connections of trafficking.

            The writer of the article clearly put in a lot of work and is on to something about how info spreads on the internet. With that said, the narrative constructed in this article is filled with half-truths, omission of facts, and massive personal bias.

            It is beneath Wikileaks to link to garbage like this, but it doesn't surprise me. They've been acting very out of character since mid October, thus all the conspiracy theories about Assange. I don't trust them.

             My worry is they release something pizza-related that turns out to be false, thus undermining any real evidence from Weiner laptop. The vault7 stuff is really sensationalist and out of character.

               I don't think anything is clear anymore all of this stuff is mind bending.  It seems to me that making assange disappear and replacing him with a lookalike or some video trickery is a very dangerous tactic, starting a disinformation campaign about his safety with online conspiracy communities seems much safer but I can't rule anything out.  I have to say in November I was sure he was dead but I did buy into the Hannity interview as real pol.  All we can do is wait for the next leak and see what happens

            I'm not a Trump supporter or a member of the alt-right.   However, I've read the leaked emails, seen the child-abusing instagram pictures, examined the creepy art, followed the trail of child trafficking "charities," and I know about the pedo logo changes.  I don't think the moderators of the alt-right subreddits fabricated all that evidence.  At this point, I believe that pizzagate exposed something nefarious and I want to the government to release the contents of Anthony weiner's laptop.

             I am in the exact same place - I was never a Trump supporter, but it seems pretty clear to me that there is something very real behind the conspiracy.  It's really annoying for me to see all these people saying that Pizzagate is an "alt-right" owned conspiracy that only they would believe.

             I interned for a lawyer and he always said it was easier to convince a jury that an accused was guilty of something based solely on circumstantial evidence (associations, preferences, lifestyle, job, etc) then with one instance of smoking gun proof.  why?  He said because it's too hard to fake, whereas you could easily set someone up (entrap) one time for something by planting drugs, CP, domestic abuse complaint or whatever.

              Exactly, you can't fake dozens and dozens of circumstances that make people look this guilty... one piece of hard evidence can be both planted and faked. And often is... people go to prison on circumstantial evidence often.

               This is widely cited and very true.  Most people are convicted on circumstantial evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               HOWEVER, and this is the most important part... there has to be proof of a crime.  You can't convict someone of murdering a person who you can't identify as missing.  You need to have a victim/crime relating to that evidence.

             I am skeptical of the proof that's been given so far, but what convinces you that his reddit AMA live video was faked?
            </p>
            <p>
             I would more likely believe he's in custody somewhere and they allowed him to give a limited interview while still preventing him from participating in more leaking.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I really don't know what to think now, everything seems like it could be a trick.

              He also did a live AMA on Reddit. I don't see how anyone could fake that. He's alive. He also stated specifically that the people pushing the "assange is dead / WikiLeaks is compromised" agenda are people who want to discredit WikiLeaks.

              I was skeptical of the interview when we know that facial video editing software like what was used in
              <a href="https://youtu.be/f06ng5cII8o">
               this superbowl commercial
              </a>
              exists, but together with live blockchain reading on Twitch, the conversation on current events, and the spot on voice--I'm convinced he is alive and did that interview.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I'm not convinced of is whether they were actually in the same room during the interview or that Assange is even in the embassy at all. I feel he would be smart enough to give us some sort of clue that he is indeed compromised, but for now I am simply waiting to see what unfolds before I put my trust back into WL.

              Don't know for sure about that. I read things about the reporter and Assange not looking at eachother.

              The RT was obviously editted. The other one could really well be also faked.

              I think that all these hints from Wikileaks are going to be a distraction from the real issues. It might release 911 info or something huge to take away from Pedogate. We should all be on our toes in regards to anything coming out of Wikileaks now after reports of JA being taken away. The fact that he is being ousted soon anyway leads me to believe they are controlling the whole narrative already. They think we are all dumb but some of us have awoken! Lastly, didn't one of the whistle blowers from /pol/ talk about watching what Germany is up to and that we should look at Germany?

                It would distract everyone wouldn't it? Who would be at fault? It would be Republicans and take the heat off the democrats. It would also help them show why trump is "after them" wouldn't it? The distraction would have to be something huge to pull all of the media away.
