            I tried to post an article here about John Money:/v/pizzagate/1972526 and the moderator deleted it. This is the guy that pioneered this changing a boy into a girl: a young boy had a botched circumcision, lost  his penis and the parents went to this John Hopkins "sexologist" who removed the boy's testicles ,put him on  hormones,did "social experimentation" by having the young boy's twin brother simulate sex with him, took pictures of it, tried to talk the parents into creating an artificial vagina ,touted the research but didn't disclose how later on the brothers both committed suicide.
           </p>
           <p>
            " The idea started with a sexologist in 1955 named John Money. He proposed that if a boy were raised as a girl they would fundamentally be female, and that there are no intrinsic differences between the sexes — contrary to biology. "Posted from

            Dr. Eowyn post. When the boy grew up he chose to revert to being a man but still had significant emotional problems culminating in suicide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Side note: Dr. Money took his money and invested in art a la Podesta :http://www.moneyscreek.co.nz/pages/johnmoney1921.html, "In the late 1950s, as a diversion from gender research, Dr Money organised art exhibitions at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore to showcase the work of emerging artists. One of those artists was Lowell Nesbitt and the two became friends. Dr Money got in on the ground floor of Nesbitt’s career and collected his work for the next twenty years."

            True hermaphroditism and its variations is a genetic defect.  It is rare and must be diagnosed based on acceptable medical/scientific standards.  Any surgical and/or medical interference by physicians that is incompatible with the medical/scientific acceptable standards of diagnosis and treatment should be banned.  Period.  You are either genetically born with it or you are not.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a medical professional, it is incomprehensible to me that physicians are permitted to do so, incomprehensible to me that these physicians agree to do so, and incomprehensible to me how all of this actually started, exploded, and is now becoming the norm.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the vast majority, we are either born a male or female.  If a parent interferes with the gender identification on their child's birth certificate from birth until age 18 by seeking and obtaining hormonal treatment and/or surgical intervention, this is 100% definitive child abuse.

            There are humans born with both sex organs and they are truly transgender

            In the past usually the Doctor would do surgery at birth, picking the gender for the child.  Some of these kids grew up thinking they were in the wrong body, never knowing they had been born with both male and female sex organs.  Many of these kids are born with confusing sex genes and kids without both sex organs can be born with confusing sex genes
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome
            </a>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXXY_syndrome">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXXY_syndrome
            </a>
            They might be XXY, XXXY, or other variations.  Since a female is XX and a male is XXY this creates a genetic confusion.  Even if born with only one set of sex organs they may feel they are a different sex.  However the parent is not in the child's body and has no more right than the Dr to pick a sex or push a child a certain way.  These kids are born with a disability just like kids born with an extra chromosome 21 causes Down's syndrome.  Different outcome, but none the less a big problem for those born with these different gene counts and sometimes both sets of sex organs.
All that said, there does seem to be a genuine transgender ideology agenda to expand what is truly a medical problem into a social problem and kids are paying for it.

             What you are referring to has nothing to do with trans issues. People born with both sex organs are a minute proportion and they REALLY object to being used as fodder by trans activists.

            I heard from a lawyer that California has a bill to require all employers to require their employees to affirm transgender ideology (men=women, respect pronouns or you're fired) and have on-site placards affirming it. It's expected to pass the state senate easily.

            And remember the narrative/lecture we all got about transgenders? How transgenders are gentle little snowflake forest creatures who would NEVER hurt anyone? Well, it's true story time. Was walking down the street about a week or so ago, and heard angry voices in the back of a neighborhood bar. I turn the corner to look and a transgender was threatening a girl trying to leave the parking lot on a bike. The forest creature transgender had biceps like Mike Tyson back in the day and was getting rough. Screaming out charming names like "c#nt", "bitch", and whore, a guy from the bar ran out and told the transgender to get his/her hands off the girl trying to leave and said that she had the right to leave. Well, the transgender ignored him and again started grabbing and manhandling the girl. He intervened and I left after making sure everything was okay.

            Yes, it's child abuse.  The trans ideology is also homophobic and entrenches rigid stereotypes; that is, that if you like pink you must be a girl, and if you're a tomboy you must be a boy.  Rather than freeing up our children, it simply tightens the stranglehold of patriarchal stereotypes.   Nowadays, if a little boy shows any signs of being empathic, sensitive, gentle and kind, parents are lead to believe that he must be a girl trapped in a boy's body.  Countries which are the most homophobic actually pay for gender reassignment surgery in gay kids.  They'd rather that kids do some serious self-mutilation than be themselves if they're gay.
           </p>
           <p>
            Blanchard and Bailey did the definitive studies on trans women.  They find that they fell in either of two categories:  they were either self-loathing gay men who were extra feminine (these are the ones who transition early ie Janet Mock) or they were men who got turned on by the idea of dressing as women ie fetishists such as Bruce Jenner, who wore his daughter's underwear (these are the ones who usually transition in middle-age).   Trans women display high narcissistic tendencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Being a female or male is not 'in the mind'; it's biological.  Gender dysphoria would be absolutely terrible to experience, but it is a mental condition and should be treated as such.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most children who experience gender dysphoria grow out of it.  That has been proven.  The fact that the trans lobby is condemning these kids to a lifetime of puberty blockers and other life-changing hormones, as well as surgery that can kill them (yes, people have died after sex reassignment surgery) is certainly child abuse.   Suicide rates for post-surgery are exactly the same as those for pre-surgery.  This goes to show that surgery doesn't help.

             You just suggested boys are as a rule not empathetic or kind.  Everything you see around you is exclusively because of men.  Check the funding of breast cancer vs. prostate and show some fucking appreciation.  Without women voting, by far the worst thing to ever afflict this nation, none of this nonsense would even be entertained and you can take that to the bank and deposit it into your husbands account.

              No, I suggested that boys CAN BE and ARE empathic, kind and sensitive.  It is the world we live in--ie patriarch--that, to maintain hegemony, seeks to uphold the notion that 'real' men don't cry, are tough and keep a stiff upper lip.  Trans theory buys into that.

               Youre a fucking lunatic for even saying hegemony as if MALE AND FEMALE COULD EVER BE IN COMPETITION.  If your standard of a successful society is the number and variety of female employment or ANYTHING besides overall prosperity and BIRTHRATES you are on the side of evil.

              4. There are no cases in the scientific literature of gender-dysphoric children discontinuing blockers.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Most, if not all, children on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones (estrogen for biological boys, testosterone for biological girls). The only study to date to have followed pre-pubertal children who were socially affirmed and placed on blockers at a young age found that 100 percent of them claimed a transgender identity and chose cross-sex hormones.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              This suggests that the medical protocol itself may lead children to identify as transgender.

           <p>

             <strong>
              There is an obvious self-fulfilling effect in helping children impersonate the opposite sex both biologically and socially.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            This is far from benign, since
            <strong>
             <strong>
              taking puberty blockers at age 12 or younger, followed by cross-sex hormones, sterilizes a child.

              5. Cross-sex hormones are associated with dangerous health risks.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            From studies of adults we know that
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the risks of cross-sex hormones include, but are not limited to, cardiac disease, high blood pressure, blood clots, strokes, diabetes, and cancers.
             </strong>

              6. Neuroscience shows that adolescents lack the adult capacity needed for risk assessment.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Scientific data show that
            <strong>
             <strong>
              people under the age of 21 have less capacity to assess risks.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              There is a serious ethical problem in allowing irreversible, life-changing procedures to be performed on minors who are too young themselves to give valid consent.
             </strong>

             <strong>
              7. There is no proof that affirmation prevents suicide in children.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Advocates of the transition-affirming protocol allege that suicide is the direct and inevitable consequence of withholding social affirmation and biological alterations from a gender-dysphoric child.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            In other words, those who do not endorse the transition-affirming protocol are essentially condemning gender-dysphoric children to suicide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet as noted earlier, prior to the widespread promotion of transition affirmation,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              75 to 95 percent of gender-dysphoric youth ended up happy with their biological sex after simply passing through puberty.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, contrary to the claim of activists,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              there is no evidence that harassment and discrimination, let alone lack of affirmation, are the primary cause of suicide among any minority group.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            In fact, at least one study from 2008 found perceived discrimination by LGBT-identified individuals not to be causative.

              Over 90 percent of people who commit suicide have a diagnosed mental disorder, and there is no evidence that gender-dysphoric children who commit suicide are any different. Many gender dysphoric children simply need therapy
             </strong>
            </strong>
            to get to the root of their depression, which very well may be the same problem triggering the gender dysphoria.

              8. Transition-affirming protocol has not solved the problem of transgender suicide.

            <strong>
             <strong>
              Adults who undergo sex reassignment—even in Sweden, which is among the most LGBT-affirming countries—have a suicide rate nearly 20 times greater than that of the general population.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            Clearly, sex reassignment is not the solution to gender dysphoria.

              Bottom Line: Transition-Affirming Protocol Is Child Abuse
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The crux of the matter is that
            <strong>
             <strong>
              while the transition-affirming movement purports to help children, it is inflicting a grave injustice on them and their nondysphoric peers.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              These professionals are using the myth that people are born transgender to justify engaging in massive, uncontrolled, and unconsented experimentation on children
             </strong>
            </strong>
            who have a psychological condition that would otherwise resolve after puberty in the vast majority of cases.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Today’s institutions that promote transition affirmation are pushing children to impersonate the opposite sex, sending many of them down the path of puberty blockers, sterilization, the removal of healthy body parts, and untold psychological damage.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              These harms constitute nothing less than institutionalized child abuse. Sound ethics demand an immediate end to the use of pubertal suppression, cross-sex hormones, and sex reassignment surgeries in children and adolescents, as well as an end to promoting gender ideology via school curricula and legislative policies.

            Excerpt (bolding mine)

            "Transgender ideology is not just infecting our laws. It is intruding into the lives of the most innocent among us—children—and with the apparent growing support of the professional medical community.
           </p>
           <p>
            As explained in my 2016 peer reviewed article, “Gender Dysphoria in Children and Suppression of Debate,”
            <strong>
             <strong>
              professionals who dare to question the unscientific party line of supporting gender transition therapy will find themselves maligned and out of a job.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I speak as someone intimately familiar with the pediatric and behavioral health communities and their practices. I am a mother of four who served 17 years as a board certified general pediatrician with a focus in child behavioral health prior to leaving clinical practice in 2012.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the last 12 years, I have been a board member and researcher for the American College of Pediatricians, and for the last three years I have served as its president.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also sat on the board of directors for the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity from 2010 to 2015. This organization of physicians and mental health professionals defends the right of patients to receive psychotherapy for sexual identity conflicts that is in line with their deeply held values based upon science and medical ethics.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have witnessed an upending of the medical consensus on the nature of gender identity. What doctors once treated as a mental illness, the medical community now largely affirms and even promotes as normal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s a look at some of the changes.
           </p>
           <p>
            The New Normal
           </p>
           <p>
            Pediatric “gender clinics” are considered elite centers for affirming children who are distressed by their biological sex. This distressful condition, once dubbed gender identity disorder, was renamed “gender dysphoria” in 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2014, there were 24 of these gender clinics, clustered chiefly along the east coast and in California. One year later, there were 40 across the nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              With 215 pediatric residency programs now training future pediatricians in a transition-affirming protocol and treating gender-dysphoric children accordingly, gender clinics are bound to proliferate further.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Last summer, the federal government stated that it would not require Medicare and Medicaid to cover transition-affirming procedures for children or adults because medical experts at the Department of Health and Human Services found the risks were often too high, and the benefits too unclear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Undeterred by these findings,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the World Professional Association for Transgender Health has pressed ahead, claiming—without any evidence—that these procedures are “safe.”
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Two leading pediatric associations—the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Endocrine Society—have followed in lockstep, endorsing the transition affirmation approach even as the latter organization concedes within its own guidelines that the transition-affirming protocol is based on low evidence.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              They even admit that the only strong evidence regarding this approach is its potential health risks to children.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The transition-affirming view holds that children who “consistently and persistently insist” that they are not the gender associated with their biological sex are innately transgender.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              (The fact that in normal life and in psychiatry, anyone who “consistently and persistently insists” on anything else contrary to physical reality is considered either confused or delusional is conveniently ignored.)
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The transition-affirming protocol tells parents to treat their children as the gender they desire, and to place them on puberty blockers around age 11 or 12 if they are gender dysphoric.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              If by age 16, the children still insist that they are trapped in the wrong body, they are placed on cross-sex hormones, and biological girls may obtain a double mastectomy.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              So-called “bottom surgeries,” or genital reassignment surgeries, are not recommended before age 18, though some surgeons have recently argued against this restriction.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The transition-affirming approach has been embraced by public institutions in media, education, and our legal system, and is now recommended by most national medical organizations.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              There are exceptions to this movement, however, in addition to the American College of Pediatricians and the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice. These include the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, the Christian Medical &amp; Dental Associations, the Catholic Medical Association, and the LGBT-affirming Youth Gender Professionals.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The transgender movement has gained legs in the medical community and in our culture by offering a deeply flawed narrative. The scientific research and facts tell a different story.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are some of those basic facts.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <strong>
              <strong>
               Twin studies prove no one is born “trapped in the body of the wrong sex.”
              </strong>
             </strong>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Some brain studies have suggested that some are born with a transgendered brain. But these studies are seriously flawed and prove no such thing.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Virtually everything about human beings is influenced by our DNA, but very few traits are hardwired from birth. All human behavior is a composite of varying degrees for nature and nurture.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            &lt;snipped&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            But
            <strong>
             <strong>
              in the largest study of twin transgender adults, published by Dr. Milton Diamond in 2013, only 28 percent of the identical twins both identified as transgender. Seventy-two percent of the time, they differed. (Diamond’s study reported 20 percent identifying as transgender, but his actual data demonstrate a 28 percent figure, as I note here in footnote 19.)
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            That 28 percent of identical twins both identified as transgender suggests a minimal biological predisposition, which means
            <strong>
             <strong>
              transgenderism will not manifest itself without outside nonbiological factors also impacting the individual during his lifetime.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that the identical twins differed 72 percent of the time is highly significant because it means that at least 72 percent of what contributes to transgenderism in one twin consists of nonshared experiences after birth—that is, factors not rooted in biology.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Studies like this one prove that the belief in “innate gender identity”—the idea that “feminized” or “masculinized” brains can be trapped in the wrong body from before birth—is a myth that has no basis in science.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              2. Gender identity is malleable, especially in young children
             </strong>
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Even the American Psychological Association’s Handbook of Sexuality and Psychology admits that
            <strong>
             <strong>
              prior to the widespread promotion of transition affirmation, 75 to 95 percent of pre-pubertal children who were distressed by their biological sex eventually outgrew that distress. The vast majority came to accept their biological sex by late adolescence after passing naturally through puberty.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            But
            <strong>
             <strong>
              with transition affirmation now increasing in Western society, the number of children claiming distress over their gender—and their persistence over time—has dramatically increased.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            For example, the Gender Identity Development Service in the United Kingdom alone has seen a 2,000 percent increase in referrals since 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              3. Puberty blockers for gender dysphoria have not been proven safe.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Puberty blockers have been studied and found safe for the treatment of a medical disorder in children called precocious puberty (caused by the abnormal and unhealthy early secretion of a child’s pubertal hormones).
           </p>
           <p>
            However, as a groundbreaking paper in The New Atlantis points out,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              we cannot infer from these studies whether or not these blockers are safe in physiologically normal children with gender dysphoria.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The authors note that
            <strong>
             <strong>
              there is some evidence for decreased bone mineralization
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , meaning an increased risk of bone fractures as young adults,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              potential increased risk of obesity and testicular cancer in boys
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , and
            <strong>
             <strong>
              an unknown impact upon psychological and cognitive development.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            With regard to the latter, while we currently don’t have any extensive, long-term studies of children placed on blockers for gender dysphoria, studies conducted on adults from the past decade give cause for concern.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, in 2006 and 2007,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology reported brain abnormalities in the area of memory and executive functioning among adult women who received blockers for gynecologic reasons.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            Similarly,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              many studies of men treated for prostate cancer with blockers also suggest the possibility of significant cognitive decline.
             </strong>
