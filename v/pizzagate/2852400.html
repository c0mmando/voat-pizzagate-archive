<p>A couple of days ago  <a href="https://voat.co/u/IIJOSEPHXII">@IIJOSEPHXII</a> asked the question “Ping Pong Parlours popping up around the UK. Should we be worried?” and linked to this Table Tennis England website: <a href="https://tabletennisengland.co.uk/programs/ping/ping-pong-parlours/">https://tabletennisengland.co.uk/programs/ping/ping-pong-parlours/</a> </p>
<p>Have a look at that image on that page. Something just seemed \'off\' to me though I couldn\'t place my finger on what. </p>
<p>I also know that James Alefantis and his \'friends\' have visited Newcastle in the UK in the past  \'teaching\'  young people how to move around the ping pong table, with a paddle in one hand and a beer in the other. I wrote about that visit here:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2414932">Video of Dr. Pong Berlin includes James Alefantis in Newcastle. The weird world of Pongress and photos of Pope with ping pong paddles.</a> </p>
<p>Alefantis and his cohort are most probably CIA. And they have been studying youth culture for years now, as <a href="https://voat.co/u/Asolo">@Asolo</a> explains in this comment re Dr. Ping Pong and the Berlin Wall : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2414932/12017077">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2414932/12017077</a> .  Alefantis even posted on Instagram an image of the pub calling it “Home”  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1673732">James Alefantis posted a pic of a stand-alone old buidling calling it &quot;home&quot;. Does anybody recongize it?</a> </p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://voat.co/u/rickman">@rickman</a> 3 months ago posted a possible link between Alefantis and another sport : football  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2670432">Alefantis and his football friend Chopra</a>.  It\'s quite possible he was on to something. Here\'s why...</p>

<p>First, the UK pizzagate was originally about pedophilia in football : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1452660">[Breaking] Peadophile crisis sweeping British football - 350 Victims come forward </a> . </p>

<p>Well, let\'s get back to the present day and that Ping Pong Parlours website. One of their partners is the <strong><a href="http://www.jackpetcheyfoundation.org.uk/">Jack Petchey Foundation</a></strong>. They support programs for young people 11-25 in the London and Essex areas.</p>

            One of these places opened up in my local shopping centre. I was immediately suspicious. It was a former childrens clothes shop and it had been stripped bare. Very little work, if any, had been done to it. They just put some ping pong tables inside and put a sign up.

            The ping pong parlour that popped up near me closed and removed all their stuff a couple of weeks ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the football story that broke in late 2016 was a psyop by the media and government to distract from pizzagate and paedophilia which I think still infests the game. The pedo coach in question had already been convicted of the crimes some years ago, so I think it was just a case of them filling news reports with a scandal  instead of pizzagate to make it look like something was being done about organised crimes against children at the highest levels in this country. The signs are all there with England players enjoying downtime at this years world cup on infatable unicorns - symbolic of the pedo cult.

            <p>
             Unicorn denotes christ...the chained unicorn or tamed unicorn ...riding on it ..symbolises the capture of the Christ system..its a double book entry system..with clie t accounts being the trust accounts set up at berth...we ride these accounts as trustees bring holders of the birth certificafe ...they r child accounts that we lend to the pedo empire and deep state to run their debt state..
Via a mutiheaded hydra beast psyop operation...keeping us in a beast state..
Look.at the football stands of any premier league or football match...if that isnt a mind psyop i dont know what is...week in week out programmable drones that are trustees to the child accounts..
Instead of claiming the property back ...they are mind c9ntrolled to consume and increase debt in its name ..feeding it to the templar banking debt record system..
            </p>

             This is why the unicorn is important to them..it is being used as a hammer to our child like minds..
The unicorn symbolises the rhino....heavily armoured ..used like a hammer ...its client savings in christ accoutns need to be tamed by mass mind psyops so that the sociopaths can feed on this debt energy...we lend to their banking system..
My two cents..
We r caught in this puppet show ..we r the audience ..we r the puppets...we r the script (scrip..money) writers , they just pull the strings ..

               Thank u 
But in the case of reducing the debt..we will realise that we r the light that creates the shadow..
We fund the war game..and all we have to do is light the peace game...
It will be more efficient than the banks we use Today..
....when we loan (the light ) them all our money and assets ..they act as our fiduciary but inside the war debt game..
When we decide to use our assets...to reduce debt ..we will relise with confirmation from the US tressury ..that we have been the fiduciary all this time..as surety over the whole game...
They will then have to discharge all bills in the name ..whichbis a roman trust ..with us as beneficieries..
We will also be able to charge corrupt officials ..send thrm to laboir camps..with charges payable to the US treasury..
There is no slavery only voluntary servitude..we volunteer to play the shadow game with our own consent and energy...when we decide we want to play a shadow gsme of peace...they will have to oblige..
That is the contract the covenant ..the blood covenant..
All debts will be fore given..whether inside the war or outside of it
..we choose how we use the blood covenant ie the double book entry system..aka Christ..
The re turn of Christ ..till then we run the accounting system dba the anti Christ

            Very hard to find anything on the leopards  a ping pong team in UK  Been searching.  These guys
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://tabletennisengland.co.uk/performance/history-of-the-leopards/why-are-we-the-leopards/">
             https://tabletennisengland.co.uk/performance/history-of-the-leopards/why-are-we-the-leopards/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The story of the Leopards dates back to the early days of the English Table Tennis Association (ETTA) in 1937/38, when the King agreed to become Patron of the Association.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ETTA crest, which had previously featured a rose, was changed to three lions in a passant guardant position – that is to say walking, with heads turned to face out of the crest.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a familiar symbol of England, but not many people know that in British and French heraldry, a lion passant guardant was historically referred to as a leopard – so the ETTA crest was called the three leopards.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the ETTA became Table Tennis England in 2014, we wanted to ensure this important part of our heritage was upheld and enhanced.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whats so important about leopard and ping pong/table tennis.  This is a thing now since 37.  Spnsorship/Patron   by the King.

             Leopard can change it's spots, where as a lion can not. At least in public, or bush, view.

              Old lie, kind of. That is the whole point of the camouflage. Big cat sits. Others move around. All others might see is slow stop and go motion of big cat. Very hard to determine. More to the point of this conversation would be, "where did that enter the European language?"

              True.  I have a feeling some royals and UK elites are involved with these school ping pong groups.  There are connections I am sure.  This sport is becoming a thing all over the world and there are some very salacious things given the name ping pong.   Greece has not escaped the ping pong fad.  Hmm.  Greece. Who do we know that is Greek...........

              A 33-year-old ping pong instructor has been accused of “indecent acts” against two underage girls, who were students of his. According to the police in Thessaloniki, the 33-year-old is facing sexual abuse and molestation charges.

            It sets up UKPingPong as an enforcer and arbiter of child abuse laws, very similar to what Child Protective Services does.

Working with young people is key for the expansion of table tennis and, with our 
many programmes, Table Tennis England try to give opportunities for young people 
to participate and help them on their way to achieving their sporting and social 
ambitions.  A
dditionally Table Tennis England is very proud of its ethos of inclusivity 
throughout our sport and recognizes the key part that vulnerable adults have to 
play.  It is very important that support is given to the volunteers, staff, players and 
parents by wa
y of good practice guidelines and this 
document,
Table Tennis 
England’s Safeguarding Guidelines
,
is part of the practice.
Table Tennis England takes it
s responsibility for the duty of care towards all of its 
members very seriously and work very hard to en
sure people’s welfare is a high 
priority throughout all of our programmes.
It is important that people are aware that Table Tennis England’s Safeguarding 
Guidelines have been written and put together with inclusivity built in and not as an 
addition.  Howe
ver, we all need to understand that sometimes individuals can be 
disadvantaged by their additional vulnerabilities and backgrounds e.g. for some 
disabled people and some Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups.
Disabled people may be more vulnerable becaus
e they may:
•
Be more isolated from society as a result of their disability
•
Have additional needs requiring support
•
Use different forms of communication
•
Not be believed
•
Have medical needs that may be used to explain abuse
People from BME groups may be more 
vulnerable because they may:
•
Be experiencing racism and racist attitudes
•
Want to fit into society and, therefore, not ‘make a fuss’
•
Not communicate in English 
–
it may be their second language
Table Tennis England, therefore, can make this document availa
ble in different 
formats to meet the needs of the individual
.  If you would like to take advantage of 
this please speak to Table Tennis England’s Safeguarding Manager whos
e
details are 
on the website 
www.tabletennisengland.co.uk
Always remember whatever we do as staff or volunteers:
THE WELFARE OF THE CHILD IS PARAMOUNT!
These Guidelines have been put together 
in consultation with groups and 
people 
both from within and outside of the sport but Table
Tennis England would 
2
particularly 
like to 
acknowledge the support given by the Child Protection in Sport 
Unit (CPSU
and the Ann Craft Trust
).
1.
INTRODUCTION AND PRINCIPLES
•
For the purposes of these guidelines and Table Tennis England’s procedures 
the term 
young person refers to anyone under 18 (The Children’s Act 1989 
and 2004).
•
The definition of a
n
‘adult
at risk
’ is a person who
is
18 years or over 
who has 
needs for care and support (whether or not the local authority is meeting any 
of those needs) and, i
s experiencing, or at risk of abuse or neglect.  As a result 
of care and support needs the person is unable to protect themselves from 
either the risk of, or the experience of, abuse or neglect. (Care Act 2014).
•
Table Tennis England recognis
es that child a
nd vulnerable adult abuse are 
very emotive and difficult subjects for anyone to have to deal with and can 
occur in many everyday situations including the home, school and sporting 
environments.
•
Table Tennis England believes that all young people and vulner
able adults 
have a right to have fun and be safe in the activities they choose, and 
parents/carers should have confidence that the clubs and peo
p
le within table 
tennis will fulfill their duty of care.
•
Table Tennis England is fully aware of its responsibili
ties and the need to 
safeguard against individuals who may abuse their position within the sport.
               <br/>
               By implementing these guidelin
es Table Tennis England recognis
es the rights 
and needs of both young people and disabled 
adults
and other
s
who may be 
particul
arly vulnerable.
•
There are some individuals who will seek employment or voluntary work in 
order to gain access to young people and vulnerable adults in order to harm 
them, Table Tennis England will uphold all employment checks and 
regulations to try and li
mit these individuals access to our sport.
•
It is the responsibility of the child protection
and adult safeguarding
experts 
and statutory agencies  to determine whether or not abuse has taken place 
but everyone working within table tennis has a duty of care
to safeguard the 
welfare of 
all
vulnerable people
whether children or adults
at all times in our 
sport.
•
Coaches, officials and volunteers working within table tennis who have 
regular contact with the most vulnerable within the table tennis community 
have 
a key role to 
play in identifying and recognis
ing when abuse may be 
occurring whether that be inside or outside of the sport and Table Tennis 
England will commit to providing training and updates to support them.
•
Table Tennis England will commit to the 
following:
ü
To appoint a designated Safeguarding Manager
ü
To a
ppoint a Case Management Group to support the work of the 
Safeguarding Manager
