            I absolutely hear what you are saying and maybe it's just too much to take in all at once but climate change/global warming is as big scam on us as global pedophilia/ satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            there is so much going on with pizzagate and pedo gate that can help us to understand, if we are ready to, what happened with the climate change issue. I am older and in the sixties and seventies the buzzword was ecology. it was a really important topic and a really important movement and everybody knew it. Add to that that for the most part, we still believed that what "good" people told us was truth. When Al Gore went on his speaking tour and brought all his graphs and pictures it absolutely had an impact on people .... because we believed him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now,  I would hope that some of us would understand that graphs can be created or of thin air and a selection of photos combined with passionate rhetoric, is more than powerful and convincing.  Then you tell the lie often enough and it becomes the truth. when two people believe something passionately and each of them tells 10 other people passionately and those 10 people tell 10 more comma the ripple effect is beyond powerful period while this is going on Al Gore continued pushing the issue as did other leaders that we believed told the truth period so love these people we're scientists, well-known and well-respected scientist. How did they get them on board? well, they could have threatened to take away their funding. they could have told them that they would take their jobs period they could have told them that their families we're going to be at risk period they could have been told that their well-being would be at risk N and if we've learned anything else and pizzagate it is that they could have been stung buy a pedophilia setup. old goodness and the good intentions and the wonderful hearts of people in the ecology movement were co-opted and used too forward a horrendous agenda. Itactually a very brilliant skin because it played in two the wonderful hearts and realistic impulses of the ecology movement and ratcheted up 1000%. they created fear porn period they created Hysteria.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many reasons why. one of them is to control the narrative. one of them is to distract us from other things that are much more important and are actually real. it creates a common enemy, which is not them. Innocence the enemy becomes our cells. the root of the whole thing is quote follow the money quote. this was all about carbon taxes and the beauty of the Diabolical scheme is this taxation can be huge, global comma and unending. it was one huge important issue that could pull the entire world together to help create a global government comma known as the New World Order period. similar to the war on terror. Another diabolically brilliant scam. The war on terror is everywhere and nowhere and it never ends.
           </p>
           <p>
            We Now know how much the government and people we have trusted lie to us. It's almost as if they lie more than they tell the truth. part of my background is in climatology so I have had the advantage of understanding ahead of time what climate and weather long-term and short-term or all about currently historically. As this unfolded in the early stages their were leaks that came out about data that have been changed a very large scale of deception that was pretty widespread. it was very quickly buried and the people involved or silenced and some were killed. When I say silence I'm talking about what is known as a skill. you simply ruined somebody's life and career. If you try to go back now and dig out all of that past work proving that this was a huge conspiracy it may be impossible to do period That's because the people perpetrating this hoax are the ones who control the media and the search engines and the algorithms and everything else period
           </p>
           <p>
            Are there issues having to do with pollution and the extinction of animals deforestation and old things that were part of the original ecology movement are absolutely true and they need to be addressed.
           </p>
           <p>
            we have all been made fools of for a very very long time period that is a tremendously hard thing to face period while I have always understood the situation with climate change Hysteria I have certainly been sold on other topics and I was angry about that period really angry. but it woke me up to what was going on because I said to myself if they are lying about climate and they are lying about whatever other huge thing it was what else are they lying about. The answer is they are lying about everything. I don't know how far down the rabbit hole you are yet. If pizzagate is your first step into the muck comma or into the sunlight if you look at it the right way in terms of dealing with reality rather than being caught in lies comma the thing to be learned from pizzagate, as it relates to what I'm talking about right now is generalizing understanding of the tools they use to control the narrative and control us as people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not sure if this makes any sense but I can tell you that when I started down the rabbit hole after 911 there was a point when I begin to see how deep and wide all the lies were and I had to stop for about four months because my entire worldview head completely disintegrated. I felt like I was in free fall period but then I came back eventually with an understanding that while I didn't know what reality was I knew reality wasn't and that was a huge step for me and has made it easier for me to see all of the lies. and there are many many more than just pizza gate and climate change. I would go into them with you but I'm not sure again where you are in this and people can get very overwhelmed. All I can say is if you get to a point where you like to see what else we've been lied to about it's almost as simple as going online in to YouTube and type in the word hoax. I absolutely never believed that Sandy Hook was a hoax period just to prove to myself that it was not hold I went to YouTube and I watched every stupid and crazy Hulk video on it that I could find. It honestly didn't take me very long to come to the conclusion all of that was a lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have to be gentle and forgiving with ourselves.good people are trusting because good people are trustworthy. We cannot believe that other people would do these things because we say to ourselves, no one would ever do that period what we really mean is that we would never do that. These people are psychopaths they are not us.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't know what we don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hang in there, we're all going to make it through all of this. We're going to link up and walk out of this hell together.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl; dr.  Climate change doesn't exist, basic ecological concerns do.

             I will not discuss NOAA data in this forum. Let's stick to the subject. Pizzagate has taught me misinfo and disinfo run heavy interference on only one subject. Compounding mis-dis-info on 2 subjects is pointless.

                "Which means"... nothing. The word "Pizzagate" is showing up everywhere, related or not, to serve many purposes. The bs will always be with us, so the pizzagate truth will just have to overpower it.

                 Which means... everything and nothing, just because a word shows up everywhere, doesn't mean anything. Actions speak louder than words. 911 is everywhere except in the MSM, but nothing has been done for 16 years, except for burning women and children alive with drone hellfire missiles.

                  I disagree. 9-11 "conspiracy theory" didn't get the same traction. Pizzagate "conspiracy theory" has inspired a "Fake News" phenomenon like never seen before, not only in all forms of media, but in casual conversation, from sitting around the bar, to standing in line at the grocery store.
