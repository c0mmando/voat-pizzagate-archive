            Lol "news?" you mean "social engineering" becuse that is 100% exactly what it is without a doubt it is only new to people who are to ignorant to see through it. My eyes were opened IMO back when sandyhook was covered and the anti gun propaganda begin it was at that point that I realised the news was just a tool being used to manipulate the conscious of american citizens to allow them to enslave us. IF you think about it even more thats what 9/11 was the push to et people scared enough to willingly trade their liberty for what they were told would be security.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean think about it how the hell can the CIA and the FBI have the ability ti monitor and look at EVERY americans information etc to supposedly combat terrorism yet cant find these fbi and politicians and police officers raping murdering killing and enslaving innocent kids?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is because it is not to combat terrorism it is to keep an eye on any civilian operation that could come forth to challenege and threaten whatever plans they have for the masses. Look at the number of lead activists who have had the FBI pay them a visit to their door to sk them about what they believe there thoughts etc with no warrants.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have kept this and even worse a secret for years and we have to ask ourselves if our government can have MILLIONS of innocent people murdered under known lies and false pretenses and enslave rape torture abuse and beat children to death in secret underground chambers throught the world for their personal amusement while manipulating the news to alter peoples individual perceptions of reality what wont they do?
           </p>
           <p>
            They loose trillions of dollars of tax payer money that they steal from us after our 40 hours of work to fund these hidden torture and rape facilities the government is EVIL its no longer a "joke" the government or the U.S government is currently a terrorist organization hellbent on destroying people all over the worlds lives for the amusement of an elite few. They all need to be brought down executed and destroyed and UNTIL I see these child raping animals prosecuted to the same extent of a law a man sent to jail for 3 years for "stealing a steak" from wal mart was I will continue to see it as such.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have allowed ourselves to be enslaved and deluded by lies. The funny thing is as crazy and dramatic as my post seems it is the absolute truth of our reality.

             Great post, agree 100%. I honestly don't know whether people have it in them to fight back, the government's brainwashing and docility programs have been really effective. We should be sharpening our pitchforks, loading our guns, and forming state militias right now. Instead half the country is still doing shit like watching garbage on tv and caring about celebrities. The other half is still hoping and praying that this can be fixed through a legal process/Trump, which is either incredibly naive or will be the greatest miracle in the history of this country.

            Saudi Arabia has been cooking the books. Saudi Aramco is over valued by $500 billion. That's why they want to sell Saudi Aramco to you suckers in America. And those fucking assholes who think they're pension management wizards are stupid enough to buy it too. I mean who doesn't want to crap in gold toilets all their life? Would you go back to plain ol' porcelain if you had to?

            A couple of posts ago I said collapse won't happen until peak oil kicks in by 2020 or so. Well, as Naomi Klein once said, This Changes Everything. So, Europe and Saudi face imminent collapse and the U.S. hits the $20 trillion debt blackmail wall this summer. This will make the Jewish wailing wall seem retarded. There will be much gnashing of teeth and renting of hair this summer, so when the elite pedophilia hits the MSM this fall, all hell is going to break loose. Just remember I warned you in the Spring. Better get the food rations in order.
