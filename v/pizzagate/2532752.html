<p>&quot;On Wednesday 11 January 2016, Melanie Shaw, the whistleblower on the horrific abuse of children which occurred at the then county council-run Beechwood Children’s Home in Nottinghamshire in the late 1980s, was given a two-year custodial sentence in a secret court hearing.
The nature of the charge against her is unclear and that information is refused when requested of court staff. The case took place late yesterday morning but it did not appear on any court lists until the hearing was past.</p>
<p>Melanie Shaw did not appear in person in court for this hearing, which was conducted by video link from her prison, as has also been the case with previous of her court ‘appearances’. She states that without fail, whenever in the past she has given testimony by such video link, she has been cut off on the pretext that “you were shouting”, which she denies.</p>
<p>The effect of this is to prevent her testimony from going on the court record, as well as to prevent her as defendant from hearing certain deliberations and assertions being made in the courtroom.</p>
<p>In addition, UK Column News is very confident that at this particular secret hearing, no member of the public was present, and particularly not any of the supporters who have been following Melanie Shaw’s case very closely. The public is therefore entirely dependent on any transcripts—accurate and complete or otherwise—which may be produced in order to find out what was said at the hearing...... Melanie Shaw is one of the few child abuse whistleblowers who is prepared to name politicians as having been among the abusers of her fellow inmates, some of whom she asserts were murdered on site at Beechwood. Her reminiscences date from 1987, in which year the Cabinet was constituted of these politicians until the general election that May and of these politicians thereafter&quot;</p>',

            Here is an interview with Melanie from 2015.  She's been jailed yet again since then.  Note the wonky eye sign of ritual abuse/mind control.  Start at 7:33 for the horrific beginnings of her ordeal:

            This sounds like SRA Satanic Ritual Abuse.  They are doing this everywhere in hopes of creating more of their own.  Also to messing with the minds of our children.  Also they have to perform their Satanic Rituals in order to advance.  May has probably participated in some of these horrors.  This is why they are Locking Away those that Speak Out.
