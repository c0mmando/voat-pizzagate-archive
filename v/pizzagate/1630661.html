            Where are the upcoming pizzagate arrests? The thought of you people not only believing pizzagate to be real, but that actual arrests are gonna be made based on this ridiculous conspiracy theory, makes me cringe.

            look man, I was completely civil to you. You have not extended the rest of us the same courtesy. If you disagree with some aspect of the pizzagate/pedogate investigation or evidence, why don't you explain it in a logical fashion and cite exactly what you are attempting to refute. What you are instead doing amounts to childish name calling. If you think everyone here is so stupid, then why don't you actually attempt to explain your views. As I said before, we have an excellent executive summary post in this subverse which is fully sourced. If you want to engage in a civil, logical discussion, I'm all for it, but that is not what you are doing.

            you aren't "dropping logic" on anyone LOL. If you want to have a civil discussion about the mountain of evidence that comprises pizzagate, a good start would be for you to actually read the fully sourced executive summary post and explain exactly where and why you disagree. But instead, you resort to name calling and childish behavior when it's obvious you barely even have an understanding of the situation at hand.

            I think the evidence will be too damning for that narrative to go far.  Many of us have heard it said that there are undeniable photos of Hillary Clinton &amp; Huma Abiden with a minor... not to mention Weiner's "Life Insurance" files. No amount of cries for 'tax returns' or 'Russian hacking' can distract from that!

            And CNN I hope you are reading this. In my religious beliefs, we believe that when Jesus is resurrected that the most evil and vile of people will be thrown by God himself into a Lake of Fire and burn for eternity along with your god Satan. Just think about that for a second, is this sick crap worth being burned for all eternity over?

            Wives Are Fair Game. Mrs. Tapper, bless her heart, has provided AWESOME AMMO to counter this. Just emphasizing lostinthevalley's post, but this puts Old Jake right in the center of the PG action, which is maybe why he has visibly become Mr.Angry during the last months.  The crazy dame really thinks it's the best goddam restaurant in DC -- that's gotta be grounds to commit her as certifiable, right? He likes the place too, takes his kids to it all the time, maybe trying to catch a glimpse of the president or something. Endless Memes are possible -- just think of all the incredible DC restaurants, and she picks a dive with Sex Stains posters as a great place for kids. Priceless.

            And in the interview, AJ didn't interrupt him and talk over him like he does to literally every other guest he has on.... very strange interview.  Made me lose a lot of faith in AJ, honestly.  I stopped watching his videos for a while, but have recently started watching some.

            Do we have anyone here with any professional journalism knowledge? I have known three people in that field in my life. Two were students who changed fields before ever getting a job/finishing school and one is a small time local news anchor (in politics). I don't still know any of them. I'm wondering if at some point there is a wall that real journalists hit when they try to climb the ladder.

            Good! It'll be the nail in CNN's coffin! They've been covering up the criminal activities and being on the wrong side of this will be the end of any credibility they might have with that one person still watching in San Francisco.

            Of course, a lot depends on the evidence. Obviously, it has to be solid to bring an indictment, but those emails better be pretty explicit. Then there's Assange. All flashing neon arrows keep pointing back to him. What was that evidence he had that was supposed to be released on Election Day? It was supposed to be guaranteed to get Killary some jail time. I hope some nice embarrassing film surfaces. That's always good for a laugh when they've been denying that anything took place and then someone posts that video that shows them in the act. I suppose CNN could play it backwards ... or throw some underage kids in the pool to distract and entertain us adults. Can't wait to see CNN go down with the rest of these pedos!!!!

            And Alex Jones too... up until his JR podcast he was silent on PG since the CPP false flag.  He was literally in tears on a show leading up to the election talking about how evil the Clintons are and talking about what the NYPD found on Weiner's computer... then the false flag "shooting" at CPP and he interviewed the slimey lawyer that happened to be there with this family at the time... and AJ never really spoke about it again.  And he has been talking about the elites satanic / pedophiliac practices for years, but really stopped talking about it for several months.  I know he is friendly with Trump, so I think he was told to stop talking about it too.

            I'm sure he is too. Maybe a little too busy, demanding and or even a bit of a perfectionist, but all in all, a pretty good father. What I meant was that he can be accused of many things, but being a bad leader isn't one of them. Bottom line is: He's perfect for the job.

            although it seems just like cnn may be cover up for some they know about, but they will bring the word out which then makes it public and make people think. The arrests will drain the swamp and they know it will, but it will back fire as some people who dont know about it may come forward and prove it true.  with that many arrests already happened people will know its not fake and go search for real news. For any person to ignore or put a spin on pizzagate are cover up child crimes and support child crimes.

            ON the morning show here today, a segment was on the leading girl on the wizard of oz, saying she was 16 and sexually assault many times everyday while making the movies by the older small people and was scared to say anything so she took drugs etc. its a start the word is getting out, 
Cnn can try to spin the story its  not going away untill all lthe truth is told

            The proof all the citizens around the world have collected, photos, links, plus the FBI/NYPD/WIKILEAKS etc., videos and info on Weiner laptop is going to be the confirmation of everything thats been going on.  All we needed was Sessions to be confirmed.

             Maybe that is why Trump was so quick to do seemingly 180 on the Clintons, saying how much he respects them - sarcasm, with a hint 'I will get you, but I don't want you to know before the day it happens.'

            My God, Read their language. CNN is not even pretending any more that it is a news organization. It is openly acting as the mouthpiece of an enemy government. Aren't there any laws about this? Could their accreditation be taken away? Or how are they different from a partizan political blog/vlog? Only by sheer size?

            I knew that this is what they would try - they will try to make out like he has gone full Hitler and is just rounding up any opposition and putting them in jail. We should try and warn people in advance via social media not to trust what they hear, or to make sure everyone has heard in advance that high profile arrests will be for pedophilia. If they get half the country believing that Trump is bringing in some kind of tyrannical totalitarian government it will not end well at all for anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Surely they could arrest some Republican pedophiles too, there must be quite a few, and that might make it harder for them to argue it's not about pedophilia and child trafficking.

             This is exactly what BadGuacamole on Youtube was saying just the other day. Some things are about to seriously go down quickly, and his real name and location will probably be released pretty soon as a result. For some of these people that are speaking out on Youtube that aren't as big as the big names, we really, and I mean REALLY, pray for their and our own protection cause we know good and well, shit is really about to hit the fan.

              My dad was a Vietnam Vet, and he's spoken out a lot about some of the sick things he saw while deployed in Vietnam. Everybody in those days were in to the drug trade, prostitution, human trafficking of both adults and children as young as 3, and this was just the Commanding Officers. The same thing, I believe, is going on in the Middle East where we as Americans are occupied, and until Sessions opens up a can of whoop ass all over these assholes, it's going to keep going on.

            I think the play is to let the media twist in the breeze for about two days. Make all the high level arrests in a big show of force, just like the article says. Don't release evidence, just start grabbing political opponents right and left with announced charges and minimal else.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the media is apoplectic defending these creeps for a couple of days, leak all the hideous stuff they have and damn the accused and the media establishment at the same time. Mainstream media would never recover.

            I don't know if you're versed in social media, but snapchat had an illuminati page which basically made a joke out of the whole 'secret societies' topic, oh and at the end there was a slice of pizza with the all seeing eye in the center of it. Predictive programming to ready the masses?

            1,) I hope this is true.
2.) I don't care if it is a frame up, fuck the dems
3.) I don't care about President Trump's tax returns, he's not obligated to provide them... he should have just said "no" to begin with.
4.) I sure as fuck hope he does have ties with Russia, we need to super cop up with Russia to eliminate the scourge that is "radical Islamic terrorism".

            It's never a good idea to put everything on the table upfront. Judging by their posturing and tight lips I'm willing to bet they have more then a few aces up their sleeves. The emails were likely just a taste

            I love how "fake news" bounced off and stuck to them. Eventually, Donald Trump, himself, said directly to a CNN reporter that his organization is "fake news." Since then they're trying to use "alternative facts" as their preferred reality-distortion term.

               They never thought leak could take place. It did, and now they are exposed. They can never regain secrecy again. Their legacy media is a dinosaur media as effective as acwater pistol puncturing armour plates of a battle tank. They are pathetic. Honestly, does anyone with an active brain cell listens to what Megyn Kelly has to say when she is there giving that Psychopath a free pass? What about that sad crew from The View? Or Wolf Blitzer? Jake Tapper the shill who loves to dine at Comet. Joke.

                I think the Megyn Kelly interview was not what it seemed, particularly considering her audience, it was more of an opportunity to expose people to the story and start looking up stuff about the guy, coming from a mainstream media that hardly even mentions him, he fell right into it

            CNN and MSM are not news organisations and should not be treated as such. They work for George Soros and his people; the Clinton Family, Carlos Slim, Frank Giustra, the Rothchilds, Rockefellers, Bush Family - to name a few - and there's PizzaGate mud on all of them.
            <br/>
            Best we can do is to boycott MSM.  Those wanting real news get it from InfoWars, Brietbart, Zero Hedge, Sean Hannity etc.
            <br/>
            Be the difference we need in this world and turn off the MSM - the Megan Kelly, Jake Tapper and Rachel Maddow 'shows' of this world. Best to feed yourself the best and not be fed poisonous propaganda rubbish.

            I think they will have to arrest corrupt media personnel rather quickly. Once the media changes their tune, we are okay. Until then this can get ugly.

            Lol, but the evidence is there so they will completely discredit themselves. The weird part is there are people that only listen to them and are very disconnected. But hey, that will not continue to work. And doesn't matter if the bad guys are in jail.

            If that's true then it's time to flood social media with, "CNN Covering for Pedophiles."  If we plant the seed, people will be more skeptical.

            Been thinking the same thing for months...in addition to letting Sessions, NYPD &amp; others handle most of it (to give appearance/assure to ppl its not a coup)  ... i think we may see some pics/video or other irrefutable evidence...In addition to this: The dems will say "see -remember we told you that the Russians may plant child porn on peoples computers?"

People are not that stupid (I hope) and will see right through the bullshit.

            I want to know why Tapper's wife Jennifer put Buck's Fishing and Camping  (owned by Alefantis) as her favorite date night restaurant of all the great restaurants in DC.  (These are millionaires folks.)   And why she put Comet Pizza as one of her two fav places to take her kids.  Please let Tapper be on the list as a co-conspirator.

             fuque that! put him on your twitter list, FB, op cit, etc ......... this should be plastered all over the place! That guy is really a warhawk. It looks like Fox News in reverse. And for his Wife, bless her heart, like you said, of all the restaurants in DC, to post Comet Ping Pong as her bestest????? ....  --  that is Total Gold. That pins Tapper directly to the local center of PG. Total Gold. Hit him hard! Make him react. Make it large. Make it artful. A source of Memes directed to CNN and the "best restaurant in DC....."  Just get a load of that ART on the walls.

            Team Trump is most assuredly expecting this.   My gut feeling is that some soul wrenching photos or videos involving the arrested will leak at about the same time.....and the narrative will immediately shift from Dictator Trump to public hangings.

              Russian hackers flew the children into the basements of the people involved, and forged the videos/pictures. Considering the current state of journalism, maybe we'll see a theory like this atleast by someone?.

             Yes yes...they must certainly have it. Soon it will finally be proven that people like Hillary, Obama, the Podesta brothers and James Alefantis are part of a global elite satanic cult responsible for abducting raping and sacrificing children in satanic rituals in places like the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria. Can't wait dude.

             Yes, the Russian hacking claims were backed by zero evidence so they were treated accordingly.  PizzaGate needs solid evidence to be dropped to the public.

              They still carried on as if it was fact. Just keep repeating the lie on every station. Most are lazy and 100% rely on the TV "news" to inform them. Completely controled.

            That is extremely plain and obvious.. The Sheeples are so brainwashed that is the only way they will be able to interpret it. When you see the little tiny errors they were all upset about [supposedly] in regard to those nominated to the Cabinet.. as Compared to what intensity of crime we are talking about here ; their mind's will not be able to fathom it. They are so dejected, from the constant persuasion and mind control ..

            Does anyone think Bannon has the evidence that Andrew Breitbart was going to release before he was murdered. This would be god ammo against CNNs bullshit.

             This has been a frequent topic of discussion amongst my friends.  On the one hand, you would think it would have been leaked by now.  On the other hand, prior to Pres. Trump, even with solid info like Sheriff Arpaio and the forged documents..where do you take it?  The media and DOJ work together to crush you.  As an OG Birther, I want to know what the true story is with mystery man Bob Ama.
            </p>
            <p>
             IMO, we are in for a year, or more, of crazy disclosure.  And my guess on who might have some of Breitbart's black box stuff is Mr. James O'Keefe, his protege.
            </p>
            <p>
             As far as ammo against CNN, one pic or video of the accused raping a child will immediately destroy that narrative.  So, I expect that is what will happen shortly after the arrests.  And we know there has to be pics and video...whether it's for blackmail or sick trophies..it exists.

             He probably has "the videos" Andrew had - and remember Milo didn't give his pizzagate speech because "some people in Washington" (Trump) told him to hold off until the right time. Something big is about to drop I can feels it.

             I believe that Stephen Bannon is the man who silenced Milo and others from exposing Pizzagate too early. 
He understands the enemy, the problem is the Rothschild and Buffet's of the world are not stupid. Hell, they already have scapegoats to take the blame. Sorros is almost too easy now.
Slow and steady wins the race, while showing your hands only helps the clean up crew destroy evidence.

               Almost everything (literally... every.fucking.thing.) that these hacks in the MSM have become incensed over post-election has been entirely bullshit, lies which don't even hold up to the most simple scrutiny.  It's easy for CNN or MSNBC to spew their tired talking points calling Bannon a "white nationalist" (he's not) who's scheming behind the scenes and plotting some kind of coup (he's not) while Trump is restructuring the National Security Council to disinvite the Joint Chiefs of National Intelligence from their scheduled meetings (they aren't), and hope that people will just parrot their talking points without any actual looking into it themselves.

                After swearing in Jeff sessions, trump immediately signed an executive order to "protect the blood of our children" from "a criminal cartel that has spread  across the nation." I feel that's a good start!

               100% agree...and being egotistical is very common among successful men, and I have no problem with that in Pres. Trumps case.

                Absolutely right. Trump is a narcissist and so is Putin and many other great leaders. I'm sure he isn't the best husband or business partner or opponent, or even father, but he sure as hell can become one amazing POTUS. And it's looking better by the minute. I can't wait for the swamp to be drained!

            If CNN tries that it will be their utter demise, as well as all other 'news' outlets that dismissed it as 'fake news' with Zero investigation on their part.   I'm assuming if they actually Do make arrests..which I will believe when it happens...that they have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  Americans will not take Pedo-defenders lightly.....

               Don't forget the Roman Catholic Church and Vatican. Fuckin' Jesuit Satanist Pope Francis should also be hanged for treason and child sacrifice. He's hiding in plain site, chanting to Lucifer in public, on camera and even saying that Jesus' crucifixion was a failure. What a piece of trash that maggot is.

                   Meh. Even if that were true, he still is a blasphemous Pope, calling the crucifixion of Jesus on the Cross a failure. Did you even watch the videos, watch the second one on the list first, you might start to understand. The Pope is just as fake as fake news. And I'm a Christian as well, so I'm not just being religiously discriminative when I say that this Jesuit is very very dangerous. He shouldn't be a Pope, heck, he shouldn't even be in the Vatican at all. Did you ever read the Order of the Jesuits' oath btw?

                    I did watch the videos. Not to be insulting but they looked like the typical conspiracy BS type thing. I'll go back and watch again when I'm home. Not sure which of the second two I watched. 
Does the oath start with "1, _ now, in the presence of Almighty God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, the blessed Michael the Archangel, the blessed St. John the Baptist, the holy Apostles...."  ?

                     They're not conspiracy theories. The longer video, the ones that's 46 minutes long, if you follow the leads, meaning if you research what for example, an ex-jesuit priest reveals about the Vatican having been overtaken 500 years ago and the New World Order agenda, you find out that it's all real. At 7:08, this ex-jesuit priest called Alberto Rivera goes on to explain who and how it happened. If you research his name, you find out that he was later found dead, poisoned ( by the CIA) for coming forward. He also supported an ex-nun that had escaped as well and went public with her story. It's all real.

             Good thing is they have lower ratings than Nickelodeon... so hopefully not many people will actually see their cover-up - but their small viewership will eat that story up hook, line, &amp; sinker.

             We need to make an effort to get public businesses to turn off CNN if we can  (the gym, restaurants, bars, etc.)

              then what the fuck are you still doing on here? You repeatedly post in the pizzagate subverses, and nowhere else on Voat, for what purpose? just to harass the people that disagree with you? you specifically said in one of your other comments "there's no point in talking to people like you" yet you continue to do so. If you don't want to be here, just leave. We've heard your point of view, and you're certainly entitled to your opinion. But you've expressed it already, multiple times at that. Enough.

             By delegitimizing his presidency this looks like the whole thing is one power grab.  Cleo will be happy.  This will be when the fascists took over from the good progressives.  The icing is now human trafficking will be associated with "the good guys."  There will be all kinds of they did nothing wrong arguments in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why antifa is out.  They can't change anything but they can frame the future.  All the legitimate fascists are really helping Cleo.
