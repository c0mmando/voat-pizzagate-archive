            I went to the "other" Racine thread and found a bulleted list of points, most of which had nothing to do with Racine.  The ones that did are addressed below.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing stated in this thread is definitive evidence pointing to Racine, Wisconsin as the "hub" of the operation, as has been asserted.
           </p>
           <p>
            No wonder you guys haven't posted any links! You don't have any.
           </p>
           <p>
            My comments follow yours:
           </p>
           <p>
            Knights of Pythias held a big parade many years ago. It was held in Racine, Wisconsin, and the downtown Racine YMCA building was sold to the Knights of Pythias to be used as their castle. -- So? Charleston, SC is Ground Zero for Scottish Rite Freemasonry in the U.S. (33rd degree) I could use this same point to assert that Charlotte is the hub.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of Racine's historic and prominent figures were members of Knights of Pythias, Masons, and secret clubs and societies. -- That applies to just about EVERY city in America!
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin's past Mayor, Gary Becker, and prominent figures have been convicted of crimes involving minors. - Criminal mayors are EVERYWHERE. Ever hear of Rahm Emanuel? Daly? DiBlasio?
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin has allegations and reports of widespread human and child trafficking. -- Allegations and reports" from whom? Link?
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin has allegations and reports of widespread criminal corruption, racketeering, and other crimes among local officials and their associates, including blackballing and threats against local witnesses, and widespread local propaganda and censorship to cover up the truth. The local law enforcement refuses to investigate, and the local DA is leaving office after being involved in a drunk driving hit and run incident including allegations of obstruction and special treatment. -- Again, this applies to MANY cities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even IF the above were valid points, correlation does not equal causation.

             I think there is a drug problem in Chicago and the drive by shootings is to cause as many casualties as possible for organ harvesting.  The travesty is that there really is no impetus to stop all the shootings and murders.  I believe that to be Chicago's problem.  Slow response, blind eyes, and if you do see you're afraid to talk about it.  It's a toddling town.

              Good idea with so many murders they get a lot of organs to sell on the black market. There might be cops driving around shooting poor blacks in the inner city just to get their organs to sell. Or they could be foreign shooters brought in for just that purpose. Every weekend dozens of murders in Chicago make for a profitable business.

               And a poor family is easy to prey on and will probably organ-donate their deceased child's body parts for less.  This really needs to be investigated, but if people hate the police, which the media is teaching them to do, obviously they won't be willing to talk to the authorities if they hate the authorities, especially if instructed not to do so and get some money for not doing so.

              Well, the top of the pyramid is in the middle.  Maybe that's Chicago, though I'm hearing Racine Wi is the real heart, home of Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus.  I tried to post the links, but VOAT search wasn't working.  Type in Racine and two stories should pop up.  Racine is only 30-40 minutes away from Chicago.
