            I literally cannot visit the UK at this point. I'd be the crazy guy getting into some shouting match with a migrant, quoting the Quran right back at him, telling him that Muhammad was a PEDO who had a fucking six-year-old wife, Aisha, and that he and his mud culture should just fuck right back off to their hellish wastelands that they came from. I hate imagining places like England, France, and Sweden be turned from beautiful white countries into brown, crime-ridden Muslim rape-holes.

             Well....it's now or never, I'm afraid.....it will certainly get even worse. Muslim birth rates are much higher than those of white Brits and other Europeans, and Britain has already started to accept certain aspects of sharia law.

              I wonder if Brits are aware that over 60% of Pakistanis are inbred, and that inbreeding causes people to be ultra-violent and irrational. No, they probably see the situation as the migrants being that way because the evil white Brits are oppressing them simply by being white and existing on this planet.

               Yep. Think of all the "Colonial Studies" courses at British universities.
              </p>
              <p>
               Until a couple of years ago - five or six years ago -
               <strong>
                there wasn't even a law in Pakistan
               </strong>
               that said raping minors was a crime (!). And like in Afghanistan, still today rich or powerful people like to surround themselves with child sex slaves quite in the open. (Since nobody cares about rape laws anyway.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Add the prevalent Muslim notion that Western girls/women are all sluts ("white trash") it shouldn't  come as surprise that there has been a child rape epidemic among Pakistani men in Britain.

                Let me get this straight. Muslim men commonly rape children, fuck their own family members, mutilate women's genitals, beat women, AND kill people with guns and cars, but white Europeans are seen as the "trashy" people? Wow. Fucking hell that is insane. Honestly, Europe really fucked up by opening their arms to Islam. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who says that Islam is not a hateful ideology is fucking 100% wrong, and Muhammad was A FUCKING PEDO.

                 Yep. Because they allow having sex before marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What is really evil is that girls and women in Muslim countries cannot report rape. They might be killed by their own relatives. Which is at present a big problem for former Turkmen sex slaves of ISIS.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Or they won't find a husband because they lost their virginity. Or they will be thrown in jail for sex out of marriage. Or they risk  being raped again by policemen when they go to the police. The list goes on and on....
                </p>
                <p>
                 And the Western left leaning crowd and MSM are actually implicated, because they do the cover-up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Numbers of rapes reported to the police have risen in European countries like Sweden in Germany? Oh well, that's only because women don't like Muslims and it's more likely they will report a Muslim perp than a European...  This is a notion you will find in every MSM European newspaper commenting on the rising numbers of rapes.

                  Well sign me up for the Fourth Reich, I guess, because I must be going full Nazi over here. This shit makes me absolutely fucking sick to my stomach. I can't stand Islamic beliefs, or their shitty excuse for "culture." People try to tell me how beautiful and historic it is, but when I think "Islam," I think of honor killings, rape gangs, brutality against women and weaker people, beheadings, their shitty autistic screeching language, and Sharia Law, which outlaws all forms of, y'know, FUN.

                 <p>
                  Any European who has lived within the Westernized system their entire life should be ABSOLUTELY FUCKING ASHAMED for being accepting of an ideology that literally wants them dead. Muslims, both "moderate" and otherwise, hate Europe, and they hate anyone who won't bow down to their SHITTY MUD-FUCKNIG WAYS.

            It is ridiculous and depressing that left leaning people in Britain still refuse to talk about these crimes and label those who do 'racists'.
           </p>

            While most of the perps are male, many women in the Pakistani community share the view that these girls are 'white trash'.

             I dont repeat it much because its only hearsay that i havent seen in any media reports, but they say on some trials of the paki pedos that their womenfolk came to the courtroom in force, angrily demanding the cases be dismissed bc its 'their culture' , Wonderful job on the moral relativity front, post modern Leftists.

              Recently, I've began focusing more and more on the role women play in endorsing and covering up sexual violence. The whole system of abuse wouldn't work if women weren't implicated as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              The female Labour MP Naz Shah (from a Pakistani family) 'shared and liked a post tweeted from a parody account of newspaper columnist Owen Jones. The post read "Those abused girls in Rotherham and elsewhere just need to shut their mouths. For the good of diversity".'
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Shah">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Shah
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              A Labour MP who 'dared' to be quite vocal about sexual violence crimes committed by Pakistani men, had to resign from her post as Shadow Minister for  Women and Equality. Her name ist Sarah Champion:
             </p>
             <p>
              'In August 2017, Champion resigned from her post following criticism of an opinion piece she wrote for The Sun that discussed what she termed the "problem" of white girls being raped and exploited by British Pakistani men.'

            They're just protected by the elite and most likely procure children for them. That's the job of gangs in ghetto areas everywhere. They all work in collusion with the Cabal.

            You guys don't think enough on this. Political correctness, lmao. That's the reason they give you; its not the real reason as to why this took so long to come out.

             Exactly. The real reason is because these low-level street gangs all answer to a higher organization, who take their orders from the local politicians, who take their orders from the higher-level politicians, who take their orders from the Global Rothschild Banking Cabal. All of these groups, big and small, work to carry out the orders of both Lucifer and the NWO.

             Thank you for the link. A couple of weeks ago I read about Peter McLoughlin's work, but I didn't know that he wrote a book. I think it is a
             <em>
              must-read
             </em>
             for everyone interested in the child trafficking epidemic in the UK.

             ? What do you post on social media? Do you keep quiet to avoid stigma, or do you push the boundaries? Here are some strategies:
            </p>
            <p>
             -Ask questions like Q rather than making statements
            </p>
            <p>
             -Play them at the same game, make it look like you are standing up for minorities e.g. talk about stigmatising Asians when the correct term is Muslim; highlight Sunni muslims persecution of Ahmadis; use the term radical Islam
            </p>
            <p>
             -When you receive blowback, ask 'what do you know about Islam' 'what do you know about the reason that Sikh girls were targeted by Sunni muslims' 'what do you know about modern slavery - where does it exist still'
            </p>
            <p>
             Q has given us a way to spread a message whilst fighting censorship. It is a modern miracle
Good luck

            This is exactly what Soros, Clinton, Obama, Zionists, had in store for the U.S. and it is already happening in places like Detroit and several others. If Trump administration will at least keep these cultural rape gangs out of here I will be grateful. Immigration and building a wall seems to have slid off the radar though so I don't know what will happen with all this.
