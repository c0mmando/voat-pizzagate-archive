            There was a girl found just outside St. Louis tied to a tree a few years back, exactly like what Comey described happening in NC, where they just barely saved her in time. Also look into whether Devlin of St. Louis IMOs had more than two abducted boys. If you watch the documentary Missing in Missouri, that should point you in the correct direction. Also, Ricky Mccormick who was found dead with a still undecipherable code in his pocket may be relevant to a very specific aspect of pizzagate, but thats all I can say.

            For me, personally, this is the link that seals the deal. What are the odds that a random pizza place would be linked to Ephebophilia?

            I believe they are using pizza places as fronts to do this. It's happened before, the pizza connection in which the mafia used pizzerias as fronts in order to Lauder money and drug trafficking. It was all over the US and stretched to Italy. I'm still researching it, but below is the link to my thingy. 
Also, one of the families in it, later on, was convicted on trafficking a minor... Hillary is connected to the family. In fact the Clinton Foundation is, I'm pretty sure they got donations from one of them but I'm not too sure. I plan to continually update. 
It also involves Soros and Armenia... The Armenian mafia trafficked women and children, and Soros has his OSF in Armenia. I believe HRC helped overthrow some government thing with the help of Soros there. Anyway:

            It all makes me wonder about a now closed pizza place in my little downtown area. A few years ago they opened up, named "Pi" like one already mentioned but not the same one.
           </p>
           <p>
            First day opening and I was sitting in the town square with my dog right across the street. My dog hates all children so I had him right in front of me while I read a book sitting on a marble seat thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hear a baby cooing and my dog starts snapping. Look up and a man had placed his child who was just learning to walk right in front of my dog. He was standing about 10 feet away watching as his baby grabbed at my dog and my dog growled and snapped. He was smiling as if his child almost being bit by a dog was amusing and didn't make a move to get his child until I told him to do so. He acted very annoyed with me for not being pleased that a toddler was swinging it's arms at a strangers dog, a dog that was securely in my lap.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything about it was weird, and I thought wtf kind of man would put his child in a dangerous situation, see the danger happening, and then act all uppity when told to remove his child.   Well turns out he owned the new pizza place. It closed down after about 6 months. Weird because the pizza was good and they always had customers(they brought out samples to people in the square for a few weeks after opening, but I didn't go there after what happened).
           </p>
           <p>
            I still see that man around the square, always alone, just checking people out. His look and personality are very different from what we have around here, he's like the shyster merchant type. Would fit in well as the doorman of a strip club or something similar. I just wanted to get that off my chest because it has bothered me since it happened but since pizzagate I have suspected something weird. /end blog post

                I'm not sure it's the same chain. I checked Yelp for an old review but it's not even listed. Though there is one which looks like that chain 45 min. away in a large city but it's app/delivery only. The one near me was sit down with a large patio on the square. Now I really wonder. I'll have to do a little digging since it was several years ago.

                  Will do. The design was similar, simple and floating but I'm not certain the circle around it was there. They might have left the circle off for the building logo because the design of the square is historic and no outlandish or modern designs are allowed. But maybe it was on the menu that way.

            I hope this qualifier doesn't sound insincere but I am really, really not a racist. In fact by voat standards I'm a raging SJW. That being said I have lived and worked in the Middle East and
            <em>
             holy freaking moly
            </em>
            , you would not believe the rates of child sex abuse there. Pretty much everyone, once they feel comfortable opening up, has a story about at the very least being groped as a kid. A ridiculous amount (especially of the girls) were raped as kids. I think it's due to a few interrelated factors - restricted access to healthy, consensual sex, and also a culture where women and children are not respected very much or listened to. There's a great Iranian movie called "Hush, Girls Don't Scream" which you guys probs don't need to watch as you're depressed enough over pedos already, but it shows a really prevalent situation where having being raped is considered to make a person total trash so even if it happens to a kid the parents often (more often than not) will cover up for the abuser and tell the kid to stfu so word doesn't get out.

              Ex-Muslim here. Lots of people want to ape Mohammed's life. Do X because Mo did.  However none that I know would want to hurt or have malicious intentions.

               thank you! I have a muslim friend, also, who i do not think could hurt anyone. i think there is a big call, upon all religions and cultures, to seriously review some of their customs. there are wrong things, in just about every one of them, that are not what any God would want, and surely something we can all agree on... I personally think, there is divine element to the exposing that is going on now. life, is alive, and doe not like what is happening to children, and so many other predatory behaviors, being carried out by people in positions of trust. Religions  need to speak up, for children, not condone anything, that is against them. when they do, they perhaps really will start to become holy places.
