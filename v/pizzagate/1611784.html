            I have used several of the info wars products for the past few years and I love them. They do work and I actually reversed nerve damage with DNA force which I was not expecting. Maybe try the products before you make a judgment on them.

            It is true that NASA had one program for the public and then the DoD has their own space "secret" program. That isn't even controversial. I put secret in quotes because it was secret but they didn't go to great lengths to keep it that way.

             I believe he was referring to the actor who went in and "shot" comets computer. That story is very sketchy. Also, Alex had a guy on his show that was defending comet and said he was in comet when the shooter came in and he never heard a gun shot.

            Wow I love this. Alex Jones did great! The video has been mirrored and I think he's going to have a lot more followers now. Almost every comment I've been reading in comments on these videos are how awesome this was and one person even said this will probably be the best episode that Joe Rogan has ever done! He read thru Podesta emails too. The only thing I wish Alex Jones would have not done was talk about aliens. That's not the right kind of audience for that audience and I read how some people thought that sounded crazy. But, he did so good with everything else that most looked past it because he was knowledgeable about everything else. People also said that they got to see Alex Jones loosen up and laugh and be like a normal guy and said that he seems very genuine. There were 70,000 viewers LIVE. They got to hear about Pizzagate AND the evil corruption regarding the Clinton Foundation. Joe Rogan was interested. I think he's going to make his followers very curious now. Rogan believes Pizzagate needs to be looked investigated and not just be called a conspiracy theory. Of course there were the usual people like always that say Alex Jones is a zionist 🤔

            I feel yesterday was a great day because the hashtag #howsexislikepizza back fired and was hit with tons of Pizzagate info and memes. I posted probably 20 to 30 lol. But I've had people reach out to me for more information about Pizzagate now so it reached new people! There were hundreds arrested in California for child trafficking as well as adults and children saved. NYPD doubled their officers for the child trafficking department. Jason Chavets and mah man Trey Gowdy have permission to go after Hitlery. George Webb was on Jeff Rense's podcast again. I think there were more big things but I can't remember so I feel pumped. Now I pray Wikileaks dumps some good juicy documents since he gave out insurance keys yesterday! 🙌🏻
