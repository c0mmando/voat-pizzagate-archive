            India always seems to have horrid gang rape stories. Something like that should be rare, India has these stories often.

             Sexual abuse of children by MALES -- heterosexual males as studies have shown since the 1970's -- is NOT  RARE
anywhere.  It is Grandfathers, fathers, uncles, male cousins -- and male friends of the family who sexually abuse children.  Take a look at the list of male violence and sexual crimes I've just passed on to another poster above ... just since the beginning of this year.

              it is common where abrahamic faiths are practised. india is a non abrahmic hindu country, pedo stuff doesnt happen there. these are fake stories just hard to believe for abrahmic faith holders because it is unbelievable how a non 1st world country can be more civilized as far as kids are concerned. just get over the unbelief. it is a religion thing.

               what -- 
You're confused -- 
No where on the globe are we free of male-dominated societies -- 
Rape is common as is sexual harassment as you might have noticed in our own nation
being uncovered and unraveled right now.
Gang rape -- and the Cosby-style drugging of women has long been a favorite of misogynistic males who
like to sexually abuse women -- is prominent as well in the US.  Very common among our athletes -- 
we all recall how "sports builds character" ...

            This is pure evil. The hindu government/lawyers are to blame for trying to stop these monsters from being charged. They are sick in head and need to be punished. Off with their heads!

             So it didn't happen, right.... you just proved yourself wrong!! If prostitutes in India, are 2$ an hour, than there's proof right there that, rape and murder is like walking your dog down the street.So how is this fake news?? You proved yourself wrong, run along now, go read a book or do some actual research Sherlock.

              didn't prove anything wrong. cheap prostitutes don't mean  "rape and murder is like walking your dog down". that is a ridiculous connection. keep your bias out smarty. stay logical.

            fake news/falseflag easily evident from the involvement of women activists which are wholly unnatural to Hindu culture, and second fakenews because of religious overtones of the article. 
this is an attempt to provoke a muslims hindu fight. elections coming up soon in india.
second this serves to keep the women empowerment/feminism agenda going
third it helps distract indians from looking westwards towards pizzagate
           </p>
           <p>
            the 2012 nirbhaya gangrape case also served similar political agendas and was fakenews/false flag

             What evidence do u have that it is faked..
The story of the 6 year old girl out alone ..grazing horses doesnt seem true to me..
..
Maybe she was used as a child prostitute by the temple priest ..sold by the poor immigrant family...
..something went wrong and the child died..
..the hindu lawyer backlash and political support from both sides of congress and bjp...at the beginning ...points to some internal conspiracy to hush up what could be a child prostitution ring

              what was the evidence of syrian chemical attack being staged? hindu culture does not have pedophilia traditionally. these BRUTAL HORRIFIC rape STORIES are MADE in the leftist bastion of JAWAHARLAL NEHRU UNIVERSITY in NEW DELHI. This is then telecast through LEFTIST NEWS CHANNELS. ALL THIS IS GLOBALIST MONEY working. THESE INTELLECTUALS ARE GLOBALIST PAID SCUM.

               I dont think pedophilia has anything to do with religion..its to do with how far one takes is sociopathic nature or reptilian nature ..the beast self ..which is influenced by the environment as well...
India is rife with pedophilia..the police are involved in child prostitution rings..pilgrim centres like thirupathi are known centres of child trafficking..
Mumbai red light district is rife with child prostitutes trafficked from nepal..as there us no law and order in india it is an open secret..
As for leftist ..its the same ..its to do with sociopathy..religion is a convenient method for soviopaths to hide behind..
Google : kerala icecream parlour case
Politics which is another religion sponsors child prostitution rings becasue they have the power to cover up with the police who alwwys have an eye over the day to day runnings of prostitutions..
I know of a.corrupt tax consultant who goes to the temple everyday.. who launders money for criminals ..and corrupt police officers..
Goes to pilgrimage every year to thirupathi..driving an audi q7..
He is well protected because he has the goods on higher ups..

                you need to read the religious books of abrahmic faiths to see the institutionalized pedophilia there. Young children in india going into red light areas is because of over population and poverty not because of religious or cultural reasons.

                 Why di u think the govt allows for the red light district ..it is not in some cities and those cities like ones in thirupathi..run prostiution rings based out if lodges and homes ..the brokers are sponsored and used by police and vips..
Why is india poor..it has its iwn sovereign currency it can print any amount of currency to provide agricultural credit to the rural populace 
Utube : modern money theory wosley 
To understand sovereign currency..
The only problem with printing credit is to control the inflation arising from its amplification in the bamking system when deposits arrive in the bank accounts ...this inflation can easily be ring fenced by incentived to save and enticing the public to invest in long term credit structured and targeted programmes ..
Poverty is engineered since it provides strees on the rural publuc ..who r then forced into cities to earn a living ..with limitwd jobs crime and pristitition and money laundering take hold..
Bollywood is a giant money laundering operation that launders the proceeds of dawood and other govt sponsored gang culture
Including that of child prostitution..

                <p>
                 It is a lawless country..whether run by left wing or right wing ..its called wings because its that of the same roman eagle..

                 Religion has no say in it...take rrsponsibility for ones internal mind..if one wants to violate someones private space in a violent manner it is because he or she has allowed his mind to vear towards sociopathy...people who r sociopathic hide behind religion..
Last time i checked...the guy who crrated the new covenant ..nee agreement ..cursed people who abused children with a millstone around their neck.
The blood covenant is on the indian navy flag
While even today u have institutional child abuse in the name of religion...misinterpretd religion which is high science and heavily encoded ..a layman without guidance and language study cannot interpret the scriptures..
Here is an example of misinterpretatiin of religion practised in temples resulting in child abuse

                 U have thr public clearly showing ignorance of the law ..and thusbtheir ignorance...using culture practise to hide their siciopathic unempathc tendencies..condonig rape of 14 and 15 year old children..
If the new testament is brought on them they will all have a millstone around their neck..
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is no law and order in india ...however u paint it ..with a religious brush or political one ...it is an environment for siciopathy and actively amplified by politicians and police

                  - 90% rapes are committed by transgenders. they have sociopathic mental makeup and psycho sexual disorders.
so yes rape is a sociopathic crime.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  abrahmic faiths promote inbreeding marrying cousins this causes mental problems such as sociopathy they then become pedos and rapists. abrahmic faiths also have pedophilia in their holy books. encoding or no encoding.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  non abrahmic faiths do not permit marrying close family members.

                   Runnig away with a child less than age of consent is kidnap
..so like the neighbours u condone kidnapping ..and then rape..
Should u even be on this forum
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   U condone institutiinal child.abuse under the guise of religion
U apologise for.politicians an police who run child.rape rings
U condone first cousin marriage by its practise in non christian communities 
..and u blame abrahamic faith when the law which is the secular translatiin of abrahamic faith expressly forbids all the above...
The whole banking system is based on the christian law of not lending at interest ..it is based on insurance where the govt undrr rome and the blood covenant iNsures ur debt and covrrs for ur payment ...read the ruppee note or dollar note ..who is the surety ..it clearly says u havent paid ..u cannot pay with a promissory note...read  the cheque and the dotted line ..when u endorse or undrsign it ..u as a roman trustee of the blood covenant under stands it ie stands as surety and records the amount as a liability record in the templar war banking system ..via the registered name of the system ie the holder of the registered property of Rome is the roman trustee of the blood covenant .. acting as the book keeper of rome
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Google : what is namium
Its an instrumrnt of debt ..
When u are born ur mother does labour ..as u are not able to pay her back..for this original sin ..Rome saves u by registering a debt recording account .ie savings account..to record the credit entry of ur debt to ur mother ..
Ie saved.inchrist..
Christ is a double book.entry system..where all sins ie debts are accounted for.. 
Saved in christ..
From the advaita..devi ..mother ..
U on earth are the book keeper of the dvaita ..debts ..debits and credit entries arising from ur souls debt to devi or mata..or kali ma..worshipped as black madonna by the templar preisthood..running the banking system.of ur mothers claim on ur labour credits..
Rome and its preisthoods take upnthe recording of debts.to the matriarchy ..this is why they wear frocks and secular priesists ie lawyers wear womens night gowns..they have taken up the mantle of woman hood in trust law..
Whe u loan ur credit to the banking system u increase overall debt in the roman system..this is the equivalent of u being an enemy of ur own estate ..ur name being the estate made for u by ur mother who is the trustor of the marriage and thus its assets ..the child..acting through the name.

                    old man is talking about same age couple running away. lets say girl is 14 and boy is 15. So hold your horses before jumping the gun. it is a mutual thing. the reporter is misquoting him.

                   <p>
                    where does the abrahmic faith forbid pedophilia? it infact even encourages child sacrifice check out abraham sacrificing isaac/ishmael to god. the sacrifice of their first borns. what is that?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    yes the whole banking system is a sham and it is no surprise it comes from the abrahmic faith.

                   Christianity strictly forbids marriage of cousins..the matriage gets nullified if it ever takes place...
....in kerala there is institutionalised child abuse right in the open in temples..that is becuase they have misinterpreted the concept of devi and its realisation...
Transgendersnare encouraged in india ..a whole sub culture is created..thisnis so that men can sell there body for sex ..there is more money to be made per hour than it pays to work manual labour in the cities per day. So men who have a tendency towards homosexuality see it as an income path in the cities...
In kerala there is a system called murrapennu where first cousins are arranged and set for marriage way before age of marriage..so u are wrong about non abrahamic faiths ..
Why r u indians obsessed with religion anyway whether it be christianity hinduism or islam..none of u have any morality which explains the lack of law and order in the country..
Religion is just a cover to express a holier than thou attitude in india..its all a show.....the caste system itself shows the whole country is living in a concrete bubble of ignorance..
First understand that u r being fooled by the roman system..then u can see the log in ur eye before u complain about the spec in ur neighbours..
U r under abrahamic faith system.whether unlike it or not ..
The reason why sex with children below the age of puberty is illegal is because of jewish contract law which says that children are not of cintracting age...even sex is a business transactiin and u have to be of age where u can stand under the terms of conditions of any business contract..
Talmudic law is not torah...hence likenin hinduism u see the condoning of child sex since it is not overtly and strictly forbidden..
Get out of ur i am better thhan though attitude..in Rome everyone is equal and a shudra..a voluntary shudra thankfully..and they have given a remedy ..which is so simple a mind that waste its time complicating things will find it difficult to understand..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In the child abuse ritual practised in kerala can u see why and how the concept of devi has been misinterpreted..its to do with child ego..look at the ritual and explain it or are u only an expert in abrahamaic faiths

                    i agree about christianity not marrying within cousins. which is a positive feature like that in non abrahmic faiths such as hinduism which has a full gotra system (detailed system of who can marry who and who cant marry who).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    the contamination of non abrahmic culture has been going on for a few hundred years now funded by the same globalists so it is no wonder these deranged activities such as cousin marriage are now seen including animal sacrifice like which happened in Nepal.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Transgenders are encouraged worldwide like the LGBT community like the LGBT community in the west. The goyim must be kept in disarray by the rulers.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    no morality compared to what ? abrahmic faiths or their bosses the satanic child sacrificers? you must be joking. The faultlines of religion and caste have been imposed on the Indians over the last millenia. The society is trying to push back and that is to its credit. Search on google for 7 vows of marriage in non abrahmic faiths marriage is not a business deal but a sacred union above all business contract.s.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Yes so get rid of the abrahmic laws globally only then will civility morality and peace return to the globe.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Never seen jews having sex with underage boys in synagogues? They have one face for the public and another for their own people. You are a goy and you see the public face. The satanists are jews zionists and the bankers are jews zionists. You have it completely upside down, calling good evil and evil good.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    What are you doing on pizzagate community if you don't know about the connection of zionism satanism and child sacrifice and pedophilia?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Surely in Rome you have the caste system in full operation with the queen awarding knighthood(kshatryias) regularly and barons(vaishyas) all exist. Yes those not awarded are all shudras. Who will be thankful for this system? No way!!! end this shit system. this system needs to die.

                     The caucasians running the abrahamiac faith ar ethe false preisthood ..the edomites ..serpent seed warned about in the bible...the bible clearly interprets the payment system ie the world as the property of satan..
So the true jews are not the ones u see in front of the propoganda babylon box..the true hebrews are the lost tribes ie the blacks of alll countries ..incluign black palestines not arab palestines being the true hebrews ..
The tribe of judah is likely either the blacks of england ..the daalits the descendent of chola rulership..are another tribe..
Utube : rajadhiraja ii presbyter john wang khan
Vaishnavism is the indianised version of the kabbalah..
Christiniaty is the accounting system of dvaita from advaita ..
Ur soul occupying ur vessel is an earthly test to see whether u can leave this earth ..christianity is the accou ting system.of this test...u cant get rid of it ..it has been practised for eons even before the holy roman empire run by the edomites or caucasians manipulated by the serpent seed which i think is the turco mongol race..
U caanot remove Rome ...its like saying u are gonna run a company without an accountingndepartment ...the trustee of that department needs to change ..the true trustees are the chosen people ..the melanated races ..the dalits of india ..west and east

                      yes it is the false priesthood and blacks are possibly the real jews.
yes you can get rid of it and this evil will be removed - people ideas and institutions. it is a must for a peaceful world.   no thanks for the offer of accounting for my debts and sins and ensuring a place in heaven for me. i'll skip the offer.

                       Inccrease the debt then ..fund the debt currency system..
Others with knowledge will reduce debt and turn the US treasury into their debtors...
We choose peace or war ..we choose to be the sivereigns or debtors ...
Im out of the game pretty soon..

                hindus buddhists are mainly vegetarian. plant food lowers sex drive. hindus follow krishna, story is pretty close to christian(a)s! they are anti muslim, muslims have animal food based diets --&gt; high sex drives and pedo culture at places. christians and hindus are potential allies. imagine adding 1 billion more english speaking bunch to this fight. it will be a major boost.

                the whole story is made up on a writers laptop then executed in real life. the motive is to have this story out which brutalizes the emotions of anyone reading it. Rape is just what fit the bill in this story.
               </p>
               <p>
                the purpose to brutalize the emotions is to polarise the voters of india on religious lines.
               </p>
               <p>
                this article is for domestic consumption. to again polarise them on gender lines, push feminism.
               </p>
               <p>
                a divided population is easier to handle for those in power. the powers dont want voters united pointing fingers at their shoddy governance. they want the population cheering them on to be their saviours!
               </p>
               <p>
                US intervention is not the goal. While the Syrian chemical attack staging focused on crimes committed on children in a preplanned fashion to brutalise the emotions of readers and demand an action as desired by the writers of the story the same way this rape story was staged by focusing on crimes commited against a child (whether real or fake) in a preplanned fashion to brutalise the emotions of readers to NOT demand an action from the government but to HATE EACH OTHER on both RELIGIOUS and GENDER lines.

              This should be the one place to report these crimes. Just keep an eye on the submission rules. It’s our defense from attacks. The main attack is through fake or crappy posts that black pill our allies, pollute our agenda, or to makes us look like bigoted idiots.

              I respected your post very much. Deleted posts are still viewable, I think. Check your profile. If there is something good there, copy/paste and repost. Just link everything up good. We want to catch all of these monsters.

            India is a mess.  We know this from other posts on here.  Raping of women is a sport, no matter the age.  BO HRC and Trudeau have both just left there after making a visit.  Why did they not speak out about this and demand that it stop?  I have not heard a peep out of them.  There are little children getting trafficked and raped there every day.  Outrage is a joke.  Policemen are involved all over the world.  There are pedophiles that have infiltrated LE the world over.

             Hi -- just back for a brief visit to see if anything is going on here ....
            </p>
            <p>
             For about 2 months or more now I've been picking up reports on male violence on Yahoo.....
MALE Violence HERE has to become an issue for discussion in our own press.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just look at this -- and actually there were many times when I was too busy to pick up the reports!
I didn't ignore reports that were about females, but there is nothing by females on the level of what males do.
It's just extreme violence all the time.  And, as far as I can see, by putting such financial stress on society and 
limiting education for citizens and care for the sick, our fascist government has been encouraging this male 
violence......
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically just since January of this year ...

              </p>
              <p>
               HI -- just happened to see your name on this message ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Just came in to see how you're all doing here at VOAT -- and reactions to drugging of 
children separated from their families at the border -- and torture of other youths held in
detention centers in Virginia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, did you see the article up now on Yahoo about young teenagers and toddlers being transported
by airlines under "control" of four adults -- pretending the teenagers are sports players?
              </p>
              <p>
               Hope that ALL OF THE AIRLINES STOP doing this favor for government --
This is government by criminals, fascists -- 
We need this WALL to fall on Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you're around -- reply if you can as I'd like to hear your views.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks --

                Votscam I hope you know that Bush and Obama and Clinton as presidents knew this was going on.  This is not something that started with the Trump administration.  I did not vote for Trump but am waiting to see the outcome.  Obama and Clinton did a lousy job and Bush even worse.  They did not protect our children.

               i was referring to "raping is a sport" comment. from what i know prostitutes in india are available for $2+/hour this bit of your comment makes no sense.

                I am talking about family members and since some are dirt poor they can’t pay the $2. They have been raping women tourists so it’s not about the $2. It is about the power.

                 dirt poor people don't have the guts to rape wealthier tourists. probably false flag events or the rapists are well off but then they can always get a russian prostitute who are common in india. still doesnt make sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                 oh yeah the PPP GDP in india is around $6000 so that is enough to get a prostitute.

                   assumptions? like what? quoting from the article "The victim was from a nomadic Muslim family and all the eight people arrested in the case so far are Hindus." -- Looks like obvious Hindus Vs Muslim riot firing up material. straightaway that is fake news. globalists trying to provoke riots like they tried with antifa in US.. it is way better to use throwaway accounts.

                    Rape fulfils a very different need than having sex with a prostitute for money; it’s ridiculous to suggest that these rapes are false flags because prostitutes are available cheaply

                     fake news/falseflag easily evident from the involvement of women activists which are wholly unnatural to Hindu culture, and second fakenews because of religious overtones of the article. this is an attempt to provoke a muslims hindu fight. elections coming up soon in india. second this serves to keep the women empowerment/feminism agenda going third it helps distract indians from looking westwards towards pizzagate

                    <p>
                     the 2012 nirbhaya gangrape case also served similar political agendas and was fakenews/false flag

               Well From the Title of this post, I'm going to say this Is more important because it was Police Precinct Gang Rape, and ritualistic Murder.  Cuz Ya know, BlackMail Is how you run the world.  Let me Guess, The girl Died From strangulation? If she wasn't She was stabbed.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              People Get raped everyday, everywhere.
              <strong>
               The fact that this is connected to Trade craft Taught By certain Government contractors overseas, and At home, Is what makes It Relevant.

              Now admittedly, I know nothing about this other Than the title of this post. But I would truly be shocked if I were wrong.

               this rape report is staged like the Syrian chemical attack. if this was pizzagate related it would be reported more on lines of how Peter Danglish getting arrested for pedophilia in Nepal was reported. These women activists coming out and media using punch words like "brutal" etc just give it a staged event fake news ring.

                Well your comment motivated me to read the article... That being said, I'm not sure how you came to your conclusion, Or what you're even insinuating. I have no clue what you mean by the

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 "Rape report was staged."

               </blockquote>
               <p>
                What rape report? You mean the article Reporting on it?
               </p>
               <p>
                Are you saying there wasn't an 8 year old that was  gang raped and killed? I mean, We have no reason to assume that based on this article, But I understand Events are staged all the time in america, But I'm not familiar with India Propaganda tactics... So perhaps you have justification to assume "The rape report" is staged....
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 But I'm having trouble rationalizing your comparison To the Staged Chemical attacks in syria
                </strong>
                ...
               </p>
               <p>
                Are you insinuating that "the staged Rape report" was a false Flag attempting to Get the U.S to intervene?  If so, I'm not sure what that even  means.
               </p>
               <p>
                All of that being said, Your account is 13 hours old, and by all accounts you made the account to reply to my comment... So assuming you're not a shill,
                <sub>
                 No offense... I mean, There was nothing shilly about your comment,  but again, 13 hour account
                </sub>
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm legitimately interested In how, and why you came to your conclusions...Obviously You were confident enough in your proclamation, To Make an account and post refuting mine.
               </p>
               <p>
                So I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just asking you to elaborate... If you want.

                 the whole story is made up on a writers laptop then executed in real life. 
the motive of this story is not rape, the motive is to have this story out which brutalizes the emotions of anyone reading it.
the purpose to brutalize the emotions is to polarise the voters of india on religious lines. this article is for domestic consumption. to again polarise them on gender lines, push feminism. a divided population is easier to handle for those in power. the powers dont want voters united pointing fingers at their shoddy governance. they want the population cheering them on to be their saviours!

                 US intervention is not the goal.
