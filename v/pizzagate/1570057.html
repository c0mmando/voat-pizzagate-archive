           <h2>
            CONCLUSION BY: TAVARES De ALMEIDA
           </h2>
           <p>
            From everything that was gathered, the facts point in the direction that the death of Madeleine McCann occurred, on the night of May 3rd of 2007, inside the apartment 5A, of the Ocean Club resort, occupied by the couple McCann and by their three children;
There is a coincidence between the marking of cadaver odour and blood, according to the Laboratory Report (partial) annexed to the 'Autos'.
Such markings, occurred behind the sofa of the living room (cadaver and blood odour/DNA), which proves that indubitably such piece of furniture was pushed back by someone, after the death of Madeleine McCann occurred. Because of the weak (small) vestiges recovered at such place, it is to admit as a strong hypothesis that the same was subjected to a wash, at the time the death occurred.
In the same way, the soft toy used by the dead child, found at the head of the bed where she usually slept (see photos about the initial forensics) reveals that someone put it there in a moment posterior to the death, once the bed doesn't have cadaver odour. This is, there occurred an intentional modification in order to simulate a 'picture' that doesn't correspond with the reality;
It must be added that the cadaver odour signalled a strong odour in the bedroom where the McCann slept, which can indicate the moving of the corpse from the actual death scene (living room) to the non visible part of the bedroom;
Furthermore a strong reaction for cadaver odour was made on Kate's clothes, which can indicate that she was in touch with the cadaver;
There was also a strong reaction of cadaver odour in the car used by the McCann (since May 27th 2007), which in conjugation with the blood dog and the forensics present in the 'Autos', that indicate the presence of Madeleine McCann's DNA in the booth of the car, are in order not to exclude a strong hypothesis that this car may have been used to transport the cadaver, 24 days after the death;
It can't also be neglected the indication of the cadaver and blood dog, on the car key, having the laboratory confirmed the existence of Gerald McCann's DNA. This last signalling was obtained by the dogs after the key was put far away from the car and in a place not visible.
From everything that was exposed from the AUTOS, we conclude that:
A) The minor Madeleine McCann died in the apartment 5A of the Ocean Club resort, on the night of May 3rd of 2007;
B) It was performed a simulation of kidnapping;
C) In order to avoid the death [alarm] of the minor before 22H00, it was created a situation of the children's surveillance by the McCann while the children slept;
D) Kate McCann and Gerald McCann are involved in the occultation of the cadaver of their child Madeleine McCann;
E) At this moment, there seems that there aren't strong indicia that the death of the minor didn't happen due to a tragic accident;
F) From what was obtained until now, everything points out that the McCann, as self-defence, didn't want to deliver immediately and voluntarily the cadaver, existing a strong possibility that the same was transported from the initial place of deposition. This situation is susceptible to raise questions about the circumstances under which the death of the minor occurred.
So we suggest that the 'Autos' be sent to the EX.mo Sr. Procurador Geral da R'ublica [General Attorney], in order to:
G) New interrogation of the Arguidos Kate and Gerry McCann;
H) Evaluation of the measure of restraint to be applied in this case;
On the course of the house search to the residence of the McCann, a manuscript was found, a sort of diary, already photocopied, possibly authored by Kate McCann, and admitting that the same may contain elements that may help to reach the material truth of the facts, WE PROPOSE THAT:
I) The photocopies of such document to be presented to the M.Mo Judge regarding its apprehension, if legal, translation and eventual recovery of elements to bring into the 'Autos' for future investigation.
IMPORTANT NOTE: THESE WERE THE FINDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION....

            Researchers need to reconcile their theories with the cadaver and blood dog evidence. I agree the efits look like the Pedosta brothers. I don't know if the McCanns gave people access to Madeleine in the apartment but if you read the files, she is dead. There is a man named Robert Murat who is shady, allegations of a 9th Tapas member who is being protected, allegations Gerry and David Payne are paedophiles, etc. Yes Gerry knows she's dead-he has obvious tells. I think they were left to cover up what happened to Madeleine. I believed it had been an accidental overdose of a sedative by the selfish parents, but am beginning to think she was killed and not by the parents directly. The evidence has to be fit into the pizzagate theory and connections have to be made to the players. I've pasted a copy from a Madeleine FB page I follow.

TAVARES De ALMEIDA : Madeleine DIED in Apartment (Aug 16th, 2010)
Clarence Mitchell worked hard for his pieces of silver, or tainted gold.. The Ambulance chaser quickly WHITEWASHED the damning words said by Tavares de Almeida that Madeleine died in the apartment.
Goncalo Amaral , we had to be quickly reminded ,was the bad guy here, and ONLY he, we must not stray from the McCanns goal of destroying Amaral and the reason why. There were and are no others who thought the poor, poor Mccanns could be involved in the disappearance of their ‘ she was so special ‘ daughter.
Lets remind ourselves of what really happened in Lisbon before the ‘Paint’ had time to dry back in the U:K:
Madeleine McCann died in an accident in her family's Algarve holiday apartment and her death was covered up by her parents who then concocted a tale of kidnap, a Portuguese court was told.
Kate and Gerry McCann, aged 41 years, were in court to hear how the detectives leading the investigation into Madeleine's disappearance believed they had lied to hide the truth.
“She died in the apartment as a result of a tragic accident and the parents simulated an abduction after failing to care for their children,” Tavares de Almeida, former chief inspector at Portimao police station during the initial months of the investigation, told the court in Lisbon.
“These were the conclusions of a police report signed by me on September 10 2007,” he added.
The allegations against Kate and Gerry McCann, both 41, were presented in court on the first day of a hearing to challenge the publication of a book written by Algarve detective Dr.Goncalo Amaral.
Lawyers for Dr.Amaral, who co-ordinated the TEAM that made the McCanns arguidos – suspects – in their daughter’s disappearance, called witnesses to support the claims outlined in his book. The McCanns arguido status was lifted after ten months in July 2008 when the Attorney General ruled there was no evidence against them.
We must remind ourselves here ABSENCE of EVIDENCE is not EVIDENCE of ABSENCE.
Gerry himself has told us many times ‘ There is no evidence’ There is no proof’
‘There is nothing to show Madeleine has come to any serious harm’
The Attorney General has agreed, to agree with Gerry.
However, and there is ALWAYS an however
The McCanns came face to face with Dr.Amaral for the first time since they were officially made argiuidos in September 2007, four months after their daughter vanished, nine days before her fourth birthday.
Dr. Amaral,aged 50, helped co-ordinate the initial investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3 2007 while her parents dined with friends at a tapas bar nearby. He was removed from the case, which remains unsolved.
His book, entitled “The Truth of The Lie”, published in July 2008 claims that Madeleine died in the apartment and questions her parents’ account of events that evening.
It became a bestseller in Portugal selling more than 200,000 copies and went on to be published in six languages and made into a documentary film.
The documentary is clear and precise, Dr.Amaral proves how an abduction described the way the Mccanns tell their version would have been impossible. No wonder Gerry McCann made his own documentary showing his own VERSION of events.
The actress who played Kate Mccanns part was ALSO so unbelievable, that even Gerry McCann left her out of his ‘PLAY’.
After a year long campaign the McCanns succeeded in getting a temporary injunction banning further sales and it was withdrawn from shelves last September. The couple are suing for libel becuase they believe that the book is damaging the search for their daughter by asserting that she is already dead.
(They do not mention their concern for the Gaspar statement, but concerned they must surely be)
They are expected to ask a judge for around £1million in damages which they will use to pay for their own continuing hunt for their daughter, who they believe was kidnapped and could still be alive and being held somewhere.
The McCanns are now of course directors of the FUND and a link to this FUND by PAYPAL still remains at Leicestershire Police station. The same Police station that held back the Gaspar statement from the investigation.
We must remember also, Dave Edgar said Madeleine is in PDL living in a HELLISH Lair and still Gerry says ‘There IS no evidence she has come to any harm’
In fact Gerry has made no attempt himself to go in search of this HELLISH lair where his TOP MAN claims she is being held.
Strange you would think NOTHING would keep him away.
Mr de Almeida told the court: “We have always spoken of a tragic accidental death – not homicide. The McCanns did not kill her but they concealed the body,”
Mr de Almeida, was also removed from the the case in September 2007, said the decision to designate the McCanns 'arguidos' was made by police after sniffer dogs brought to Portugal from England had carried out their searches.
Giving evidence, Mr de Almeida said that the dogs had identified blood and the scent of a human corpse inside the McCanns’ holiday flat.
The animals also reacted to traces on a piece of cloth in a villa rented by the McCanns after they left the apartment and in the boot of a rental car hired by the family several weeks after Madeleine disappeared.
Many reasons have been given as to this odour in the back of the car, the twins dirty nappies , rotting meat and spilt fish oil.
(Not a very good example coming from two NHS doctos, no wonder the hospitals are rife with SuperBugs......) ..
Mr de Almeida also complained that Portuguese police efforts to investigate the McCanns had been frustrated by their British counterparts. “We were told that the UK would not accept any investigation of the McCanns – there was a lack of cooperation,” he said.
But later he said that the theory that the parents had covered up Madeleine’s death as outlined in Amaral’s book was one reached by British police on the ground in Portugal too.
“THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING INVENTED BY AMARAL,” he insisted. “It was a conclusion reached by the team of Portuguese investigators as well as BRITISH POLICE.”
A third witness said the turning point of the investigation came following a tearful call from Mrs McCann who, after a dream, told police where to search for her daughter’s body.
Police Inspector Ricardo Paiva, who acted as a liason between the McCanns and Portuguese police in the days following their daughter’s disappearance told the court he had received the phone call in late July 2007.
“Kate called me, she was alone as Gerry was away and she was crying,” he said. “She said she had dreamt that Madeleine was on a hill and that we should search for her there.
(According to Gerry , Police Inspector Ricardo Paiva, is a liar...Gerry can see into Kates head and no, she never had such a dream, to Gerry everyone is a liar who WILL NOT believe his version.)
“She gave the impression that she thought she was dead – it was a turning point for us.”
The senior detective said the land was searched but nothing was found. “That is when we decided to send the specialist dogs in. BRITISH POLICE informed us about how they could detect the scent of death.”
He admitted that the police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start of the investigation. “They disobeyed our request to keep quiet about the details of their daughter’s disappearance while we conducted our investigation. Instead they turned it into a media circus and that gave rise to some suspicions.”
He said that the McCanns should have faced prosecution for leaving their children alone. “They should have been pursued for neglect. People have been arrested for far less – even in the UK.”

            I really want this case solved badly. One question I've wondered though is how would the kidnappers, Podesta, have known about her eye abnormality beforehand? I don't think they did. But the whole case is so confusing. I think she's still alive but in Europe locked away but coming upon the age where 16 or so is too old and I really hope she's found before then. I feel for the family they've been through hell and back.
