<p>Okay, so when I read about this plot involving Dr. Jennifer Pena, I was skeptical. I still am. Why am I posting? Because if it were true, it would be an important story.. Then there\'s keeping everyone in the loop as to what may go viral. But the biggest reason is the evidence that\'s come out against Dr. Pena. According to the records, she\'s a liar who has used false allegations in the past. Then there\'s her admitting she\'s a member of Skull &amp; Bones. That\'s noteworthy. But I was unable to unearth evidence of a connection between Dr. Pena and Allison Mack. While it\'s stated in the report, I would like independent facts before I got crazy and say that this happened. But I do think part of it happened and that\'s why I\'m presenting the report, and the evidence that some mighty good investigators have unearthed. </p>
<p>Hete\'s the original story targeting Pena as the source of the allegations against Ronny Jackson: </p>

<p>According to four administration officials, allegations against Jackson were brought by VP Pence‚Äôs Army Physician Dr. Pena
   Dr. Pena, officials contend, has held a long-time grudge against Jackson because of his continuing promotions in the White House

   The Secret Service does not corroborate Sen. Tester\'s statements</p>

<p>Yup, there\'s the Skull &amp; Bones admission! She must have been a lot of fun to be locked up in the empty coffin with! </p>
<p>All of the above was why the allegation of being a honey pot might be true. Her character is less than sterling. So here\'s the article whereby the plot is exposed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://impiousdigest.com/montana-senator-jon-tester-linked-to-vile-honey-trap-plot-against-president-trump/">http://impiousdigest.com/montana-senator-jon-tester-linked-to-vile-honey-trap-plot-against-president-trump/</a></p>
<p>May 1, 2018</p>
<p>Montana Senator Jon Tester Linked To Vile ‚ÄúHoney Trap‚Äù Plot Against President Trump</p>
<p>By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers</p>
<p>An intriguing new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that a ‚ÄúHoney Trap‚Äù plot initiated against President Donald Trump had as one of its main leaders the Democratic Party US Senator from Montana named Jon Tester‚Äîwhose purpose behind was to eject from the White House its personal physician US Navy Admiral Ronnie Jackson in order to replace him with US Army Doctor Jennifer Pe√±a‚Äîwith Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a being a known close associate of the just captured Hollywood actress Allison Mack arrested for her sex trafficking crimes‚Äîbut whose plot failed and led to Trump to declare this past weekend ‚ÄúTester started throwing out things that he‚Äôs heard. Well I know things about Tester that I could say too. And if I said them, he‚Äôd never be elected again.‚Äù [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] ... </p>
<p>Raising ‚Äúalarm bells‚Äù among SVR intelligence analysts about the Bronfman sisters meeting with Senator Tester, though, this report says, was that they were accompanied to this meeting by Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a, who was then the personal physician to Vice President Mike Pence‚Äîand with all of these women being members of what is called the NXIVM cult sex group.   
</p>
<p>The sex cult group NXIVM has long been linked to the Clinton‚Äôs, this report notes, and whose leader, Keith Raniere, forced his sex slaves to receive a brand on their bodies, along with his ordering them to donate millions to the Hillary Clinton campaign‚Äîone of whom was US Army doctor Jennifer Pe√±a who, in 2010, was embroiled in a sordid sex scandal that caused her US Army evaluators to write about her a warning that she ‚Äúwas well-known for her lewd, hypersexual behavior and sexually-explicit comments‚Äù, and who was further known to ‚Äúhave a history of making false allegations against men‚Äù‚Äîbut that astonishingly, just two weeks before Trump took office, saw the Obama regime appoint her to the White House Military Office, who then assigned her to be the physician to Vice President Mike Pence....</p>
<p>SVR intelligence analysts writing in this report state that this was, in fact, a typical ‚ÄúHoney Trap‚Äù operation whose purpose was to oust Admiral Jackson from the White House‚Äîwith his then being replaced by NXIVM sex cult member Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a who was next in line for this post‚Äîand that should this have happened, would have seen her, without a doubt, concocting stories claiming that ‚Äúeasy target‚Äù Trump had tried to rape her, at the least.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, again, I have no independent proof that Pena was associated with NXIVM and I would like some. But her being a member of Skull &amp; Bones is disturbing as is her background. It was enough for me to have my doubts about what her motivation truly was.</p>',

           Yup, there's the Skull &amp; Bones admission! She must have been a lot of fun to be locked up in the empty coffin with!
          </p>
          <p>
           All of the above was why the allegation of being a honey pot might be true. Her character is less than sterling. So here's the article whereby the plot is exposed:

            Montana Senator Jon Tester Linked To Vile ‚ÄúHoney Trap‚Äù Plot Against President Trump
           </p>
           <p>
            By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
           </p>
           <p>
            An intriguing new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that a ‚ÄúHoney Trap‚Äù plot initiated against President Donald Trump had as one of its main leaders the Democratic Party US Senator from Montana named Jon Tester‚Äîwhose purpose behind was to eject from the White House its personal physician US Navy Admiral Ronnie Jackson in order to replace him with US Army Doctor Jennifer Pe√±a‚Äîwith Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a being a known close associate of the just captured Hollywood actress Allison Mack arrested for her sex trafficking crimes‚Äîbut whose plot failed and led to Trump to declare this past weekend ‚ÄúTester started throwing out things that he‚Äôs heard. Well I know things about Tester that I could say too. And if I said them, he‚Äôd never be elected again.‚Äù [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Raising ‚Äúalarm bells‚Äù among SVR intelligence analysts about the Bronfman sisters meeting with Senator Tester, though, this report says, was that they were accompanied to this meeting by Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a, who was then the personal physician to Vice President Mike Pence‚Äîand with all of these women being members of what is called the NXIVM cult sex group.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sex cult group NXIVM has long been linked to the Clinton‚Äôs, this report notes, and whose leader, Keith Raniere, forced his sex slaves to receive a brand on their bodies, along with his ordering them to donate millions to the Hillary Clinton campaign‚Äîone of whom was US Army doctor Jennifer Pe√±a who, in 2010, was embroiled in a sordid sex scandal that caused her US Army evaluators to write about her a warning that she ‚Äúwas well-known for her lewd, hypersexual behavior and sexually-explicit comments‚Äù, and who was further known to ‚Äúhave a history of making false allegations against men‚Äù‚Äîbut that astonishingly, just two weeks before Trump took office, saw the Obama regime appoint her to the White House Military Office, who then assigned her to be the physician to Vice President Mike Pence....
           </p>
           <p>
            SVR intelligence analysts writing in this report state that this was, in fact, a typical ‚ÄúHoney Trap‚Äù operation whose purpose was to oust Admiral Jackson from the White House‚Äîwith his then being replaced by NXIVM sex cult member Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a who was next in line for this post‚Äîand that should this have happened, would have seen her, without a doubt, concocting stories claiming that ‚Äúeasy target‚Äù Trump had tried to rape her, at the least.
           </p>

           So, again, I have no independent proof that Pena was associated with NXIVM and I would like some. But her being a member of Skull &amp; Bones is disturbing as is her background. It was enough for me to have my doubts about what her motivation truly was.

            What I have is that the CIA is has been connected and obviously behind every major cult. They seem to use it to test their extreme mind control, seperation of victims from families and overall manipulation of others lives. Seeing that actors are being used and CIA runs media, I have a feeling the connection will be made.

            EEK.  Looks like Ranier's relatives are as afraid of him as others.  They have written a letter asking him to be kept behind bars he has been harassing a family member for some time.

              The funny thing is that the letter is bothering me.  Would people of that stature and wealth send a scrawled letter like that?  That's they only thing.  Could be real.  He is a sociopath.  That is for sure.

               They would if they thought they were invincible. And the converse is also a legitimate question. Would someone submit to a court of law a letter that wasn't authentic?. Again, it depends on the individual.

                That's always the question.  We have to ask so many times if things are truthful or not because of the nature of this research.  Since Frank is mentioned in the article I have a little more faith.

            It'll turn up.  She's connected somehow.  Let the autists aut or whatever they do.  This is another plot.  Only an Obama administration troll could figure out a way to get this troll a YW clearance.  She's going bye-bye.  Don't think for a second that she didn't pull every trick in the book around him.

             Yes. well, even if the one big allegation about this being a honey trap is in error, there's enough evidence that is known to question what the hell is going on. In addition, if her association with NXIVM is validated, it answers my question as to what the cult's goal was. I've asked that since day one, and it seems to be (again, assuming this is true), that they have well-placed, branwashed zombies in place to do their bidding. So if it means destroying someone's life with a lie, hey, no problem!

             Well, I can't say I ''knew'', but I did suspect it. It's why I kept asking what their goal was?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, sex slaves re nice, but it couldn't be the reason Raniere was doing this. Why have daycare centers? Why have Gaelen at the headquarters? And the psychological experiments, it all spells having  master plan. So if this is true, I have some sort of tangible answer to my question. THIS is what the goal was. To have these people in places to do his or his friend's bidding. I don't know about you, but I don't know any people willing to destroy someone's life with a lie. But it seems that, even without believing the honey trap story, it's what she was willing to do when she put passed on inaccurate stories to Tester.

               Five? The story broke in 2007. Here's one of them:

               </h1>
               <p>
                Why should we pay attention to this psycho factory? Because it has well-placed, well-heeled members and appears to be actively pursuing an entr√©e into political fund-raising. Stone, paid by NXIVM, had funneled at least $20,000 to the state GOP; the heirs to Seagram‚Äôs fortune are devotees; and, per the Post, Richard Mays ‚Äî a Clinton friend and one of Hillary‚Äôs top fund-raisers ‚Äî is an ‚ÄúEspian‚Äù as well, having taken so-called intensive classes with Raniere. The Aleksey Vayner type who preaches that suicide can be good (if you‚Äôre a counter-constructive person, removing yourself from the planet is a constructive act) becomes just a little less hilarious when you realize he‚Äôs got the ear of people with actual policy decisions to make.

               So there are your ties to Skankles. And remember, he'd already been convicted of a pyramid scheme in Arkansas under
               <s>
                Sick
               </s>
               Slick Willy and merely paid a fine. What other deal was cut that allowed him to keep his freedom? Then there's this articles claim about Mays being involved and him being the Cannibal Queen's top fundraiser. And the NXIVM ties to Albany? Elliott Spitzer was governor then. Another democrat, he resigned in 2008, amidst a prostitution scandal. According to Wikileaks:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>

                 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer_prostitution_scandal
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                On March 10, 2008, The New York Times reported that Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer had patronized an elite escort service run by Emperors Club VIP.[1] The ensuing scandal led to him receiving criticism and ridicule in the media, and eventually Spitzer resigned as Governor a week later on March 17.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               So what was this Emperors Club VIP? And how does it figure in to what was going on?
              </p>
              <p>
               And absolutely, Manson was  a prototype as was Jim Jones. There obviously is a process to this brainwashing, but there's also a method to the madness. As always to whose benefit was it to keep this cult propped up and operating?

             It's in the story I have linked. This one:

             </p>
             <p>
              An intriguing new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that a ‚ÄúHoney Trap‚Äù plot initiated against President Donald Trump had as one of its main leaders the Democratic Party US Senator from Montana named Jon Tester‚Äîwhose purpose behind was to eject from the White House its personal physician US Navy Admiral Ronnie Jackson in order to replace him with US Army Doctor Jennifer Pe√±a‚Äîwith Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a being a known close associate of the just captured Hollywood actress Allison Mack arrested for her sex trafficking crimes‚Äîbut whose plot failed and led to Trump to declare this past weekend ‚ÄúTester started throwing out things that he‚Äôs heard.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <h1>
             with Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a being a known close associate of the just captured Hollywood actress Allison Mack
            </h1>
            <p>
             Then there's this from the same link:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Raising ‚Äúalarm bells‚Äù among SVR intelligence analysts about the Bronfman sisters meeting with Senator Tester, though, this report says, was that they were accompanied to this meeting by Dr. Jennifer Pe√±a, who was then the personal physician to Vice President Mike Pence‚Äîand with all of these women being members of what is called the NXIVM cult sex group.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So she was in this meeting with the Bronfman sisters ... and she's friends with Allison Mack? Yeah, we've read how NXIVM operates. Can't be she was a close associate of Mack and not know about NXIVM. It's not plausible. Mack was even tweeting about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's the part I can't confirm. I did put the link and said it's ''an allegation'' and not fact. But given that twitter exchange where so much came out about Pena, I felt that it was enough to cast her in a different light than how she's being portrayed. Just because she's lied once, doesn't mean she'll do it again, but I really doubt her ethics because she's been involved in a number of things.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think if some genius comes up with an affirmative connection, then there'll be more weight given to this, but there's no doubt something was going on.

             I found this and it says Pena is a known associate of Mack, but how is that so.  I will keep looking, but it says so in this article.

               You embarrass yourself every time you touch a keyboard. Everything I do is to find the pedos and out them. Are you for or against that mission AWS? Do you believe all pedophiles should be hung and disposed of

            Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  AFAIK, Skull &amp; Bones is all male and always will be.  I do not doubt that Yale has a sinister sorority for the distaff side, but that is another story.  If Dr Pena really was in Skull &amp; Bones, he would have had a penis and a male name at that time.

              Fifteen Yale seniors are tapped annually to join the ranks of Skull and Bones, their names published in the Yale tabloid Rumpus at the end of every school year. The class of 2010 included more ethnic minorities than Caucasians; 2011's delegation included two gay students, plus one bisexual and one transgender. Last year, women and men were equally split, according to Yalies familiar with the members.

             As for the honey trap allegation, as I stated pretty clearly, I posted about it only because of the evidence showing Dr. Pena to be less than truthful. I do not have any supporting independent evidence, but the proven charges against Dr. Pena are extremely disturbing and lead me to speculating that she could very well be involved in something along those lines. That is not evidence, that is my opinion. I understand the difference and I'm waiting for someone to either corroborate this or prove it's fallacious. o
