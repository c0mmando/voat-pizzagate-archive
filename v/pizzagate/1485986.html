<p>Q: Does this prove Koppel consumes Pizza?</p>
<p>A: No definitive proof so far that I have seen. But it casts a cloud. What it shows is he may have seen or been aware of Washington DC and other national players involved in Pizza culture. What it shows is he bears scrutiny and questioning. He should answer for what he may have seen or knows about.</p>

<p>What we know is people involved in this stuff never stop. They are every form of narcissistic psychopath and more. They are addicted to adrenaline, dopamine and other substances.</p>',
