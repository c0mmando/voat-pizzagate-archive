            I think it's pretty well established at this point that neither video likely depicts audio or video of JP. Someone posted yesterday more important info on this. I searched late into last night looking for connection to heavy breathing / CPP and have found none.

             From what I've seen so far of that information you mention, it doesn't seem that it's been proven that it's someone else. And apparently from what I've seen now in another video, the possibility of a connection between the video and heavy breathing is the similarity between the performance lights in the fatherhood video and in a recorded performance of heavy breathing.

              That's correct, there are stylistic similarities. I was trying to find more direct connections, ie does the worldcorpo guy do video work for musicians, bands, music videos, etc, do they have mutual friends on social media etc... Haven't found anything yet. Remember we initially thought bc of the similar lighting that the vid was possibly in CPP somewhere, now we know it probably wasn't. At this point there doesn't seem to be any direct connections, just coincidences. Plus these aren't JPs kind of people.

             This is speculation. You could say that you "think" or "assume" it is a MK Ultra experiment in action. But, that's a reach. Stick to the facts please! It's a sick adult tormenting a child in what appears to be a shower with lights/music blasting.

              subjects are first “de-patterned” by manipulating their individual mental states and altering their brain functions. This is done through E.C.T (Electro Convulsion Therapy), the administration of drugs, hypnosis, sensory and sleep deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other various forms of torture.

             <p>
              As a result, and as a creative way to deal with extreme trauma, the victims’ brains would develop Multiple Personality/Personalities Disorder (MPD), or more colloquially, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID); which is when different dissociative parts of a single brain view themselves as separate persons. They are encouraged by their handler/programmer to go to that “happy place” where they cannot feel physical pain anymore. And that is exactly the desired final outcome of our planet’s decision makers – mentally controlled slaves to be used and abused.

             I understand about the "fatherhood" video. What's been confusing is "each day I grow some more."
