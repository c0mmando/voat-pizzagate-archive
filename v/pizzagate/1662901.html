             The same Comey who may have won Trump the election. Again, it's impossible to tell what's happening and whom to trust. It's possible Comey is one of the good ones and is just being tossed around like a doll by TPTB, and pulled that shit near the end to get Trump into office to save his soul. Or he could be a traitorous pedo-enabler. Who knows?

            I'm still on the fence about DTJ, and one of the main reasons for not being a full on supporter is his connection to Epstein. The general consensus, that I've seen anyways, is that they were only loosely affiliated and that Trump cut ties as soon as all the allegations broke out. That's great and all, but a look at that "little black book" shows Trump (and even his wife at the time and Ivanka) featured pretty prominently . Not to mention a quote from Trump stating that he's known Epstein for years, he's a great guy, and he like younger women as much as he does. The last part seems innocuous enough, but given the fact that Epstein was later convicted as a sexual predator makes it seem a little ominous. If Trump is as brilliant of a tactician as many claim he is, it doesn't seem too far-fetched to think he could effectively divert and whitewash his ties with Epstein. Not saying Trump is guilty but I think this connection could be explored and looked upon with a little more scrutiny.

            That's mighty generous of you. Or one could say a cabinet position is a mighty sweet reward for going with the flow. U S Attorneys have tremendous latitude and a conviction rate of over 95%. Yet he let the state of Florida give him the biggest sweetheart deal possible. On top of that, he didn't even fulfil his obligation by informing the victims of the terms of the plea agreement which opened the US Attorneys office to lawsuits by the victims which are now currently in motion. Nah, this dudes dirty - or at least willing to let the dirt go down. And it's important to remember, this is the guy who prosecuted the Cali cartel, and last time I checked, they were a bit more intimidating than Derschwitz and crew.

             Epstein is a MOSSAD agent, and you may or may not be aware but they got America by the balls. Its why theres all this talk about Russian meddling but SILENCE on any Israeli interference. Even though they own 95% of the media networks, and are quietly working on doing the same to the legal apparatus, its why they slithered their way into boards in places like Harvard and suddenly Jewish admission rates to legal programs shot up five fold. The child trafficking is just another facet of their take over, and arguably the most important one. The blackmail network.

             This is the pedophile cartel were talking about. We had a great convo on this before. At first glance it looks horrible, at second glance it means he has great info on what the situation is OR it is still bad. We will see.

              Sorry dude, it just looks bad. This guy was the US Attorney for the Southern District. That's practically a demigod. He had so many resources at his disposal and so much discretion that he could have destroyed Epstein, Black and Dershwitz and still had juice to spare. Thing is though, you don't get handed a position like that unless you are already on the team.  It was actually the Palm Beach PD that made the case against Epstein, and they came up with damn good stuff, including 40 victims who gave statements and could have been called to testify. That's just one local police department.  An investigation by the US Attorneys office would have uncovered stuff we couldn't even imagine. But no........This guy has great information, but he chose his side a long time ago. My advice, stop looking for white knights.

             No. He is a Jewish shill. He was hand selected. He has likely dabbled in Pizza. The entire him versus the media thing is bullshit. The only real thing that will destroy all of these politicians is Pedogate.

             He is probably one of the biggest players. He test rides the 'presidential models' on the island. He flies around and compromises those overseas. The Epstein trial begins in March. It could get embarrassing for a few of these guys...

            the deal was struck by the FLA fbi office, which the clinton's created to insulate Haiti from the other fbi offices. Epstein negotiated 5 CONTACT felonies down to a non-contact misdemeanor of 'solicitation of a minor'. this was Bill Clinton paying for his party time.

              ] It surely is an Xd chess move. If you think about it, think about the position that lawyer was in, he was in no position to take down a CIA/Mossad blackmail operation that would lead to the biggest conspiracy of all time. Pray for Trump. Trump saves humanity or we are all done for. No longer will we sit around letting psychopaths and satanic pedophiles rule over us under the guise of law.
