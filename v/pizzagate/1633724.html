            I think that depends on how much incriminating information you have and how you go about releasing that information and the legal consequences of said information.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will say from my experience that I have seen some low-level censorship first hand. I am an admin for a public FB Pizzagate group (it was the other admin's idea to do that and it is her group). I stopped posting to that group whenever I noticed FB was removing almost all of my links and labeling them as spam.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the Support Inbox:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Your Posts Were Removed
            </p>
            <p>
             CLOSED
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And then:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It looks like the post you shared may contain spam, which doesn't follow our Community Standards. If you think your post shouldn't have been removed let us know by filling out this form.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And all I posted were non-spam links such as Youtube videos on pizzagate or some blog post or even Breitbart news articles. It was already case-closed so I didn't bother protesting it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also noticed that several other members had their posts auto-reported by FB and I had to manually allow them back in the group.
           </p>
           <p>
            So now I only share things in FB groups that are closed, which gives me some protection from the above mess but there is the occasional auto-report..
           </p>
           <p>
            So even at this lowly level there is some targeting going on if you post in places like FB.

            The only dangerous thing is you are so going to be deleted by these mod gods.  VPN is important  as well as DuckDuckGo browser or TOR. Goodbye, thank you for visiting and never mind you are trying to keep kids safe from pedos , you broke some damn Rule between 1 and 4.  Don't  worry, for the next two weeks they will tell you what rule you broke and after that none of your business why you were deleted.  Have a nice day. Again, thanks for stopping by.
