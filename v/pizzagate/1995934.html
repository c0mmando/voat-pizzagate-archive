Many of Heavy Breathing\'s facebook posts are liked by a record label known as \'Eolian Empire.\' Eolian Empire has even commented on one of their
posts: <a href="http://archive.is/D8gad">http://archive.is/D8gad</a>  As you can see from the comments, it seems they know heavy breathing very well. But let\'s take a look at Eolian Empire\'s facebook page...</p>
<p>In their facebook page you can see numerous photos with them hinting that they kill babies: <a href="http://archive.is/OcCgB">http://archive.is/OcCgB</a>
The picture has a sign with the words &quot;47 babies were killed today by Eolian&quot; with spikes going through the bodies of toy babies. What kind of sick person would put that on their facebook? Also, read his reply to another in the post where he says &quot;they wouldn\'t shut up.&quot;</p>
<p>In another photo, protestor\'s are holding up signs saying that \'Eolian kills children\' and \'Eolian Butchers lives babies: <a href="http://archive.is/NA97T">http://archive.is/NA97T</a></p>
<p>Here\'s another photo that alludes to baby killing: <a href="http://archive.is/9u3ms">http://archive.is/9u3ms</a></p>
<p>It seems that these are staged photos by them, and not real protests, like an album cover, but why are they so obsessed with referring to 
themselves as baby killers? Why do they make photos of protests calling them baby killers? </p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at some of the bands in their record label:
Tiny Knives Band is a band in the Eolian Empire Record Label. One of the female members in this band was accused of being a rapist by her ex, she admits it herself in a facebook post that she is being accusing of rape: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tinyknivespdx/posts/10155134452773858">https://www.facebook.com/tinyknivespdx/posts/10155134452773858</a>
She also claims in that post that she wanted to be pen pals with her ex\'s daughter, which could possibly indicate that she may
have raped or touched her ex\'s daughter, which is why her ex now calls her a rapist.</p>
<p>Look at this disturbing picture of one of Eolian\'s bands in their record label: <a href="http://www.earsplitcompound.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/REDNECKeyes-e1387239273353.jpg">http://www.earsplitcompound.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/REDNECKeyes-e1387239273353.jpg</a>
The singer of this band known as &quot;redneck&quot; acts as if he\'s possessed on stage and covers blood on his face.
Here\'s video of this sick band: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOlL4DTQ3xk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOlL4DTQ3xk</a> 
He falls on the ground acting as if he\'s possessed by demons. These are they type of people in Eolian\'s record label...</p>
<p>Heavy Breathing can\'t possibly be the the only band involved with pedophilia. I believe it is some kind of larger network involved
with record labels, and Eolian Empire could be one of those record labels.</p>
<p>My theory is that this record label recruits satanic bands that are also involved in pedophilia and baby killing. This would also explain why the record label is close with heavy breathing, the band that played at comet ping pong.</p>

            I just checked out all of their photo's and every last one of these sick fucks have dead eyes, no souls, evil. There's more photos about them saying they kill children/babies. I can't even report the photos!? How is this ok???? Anyone of those people could be pedo's/child killers. Always be on high alert.

            Democrats have been sadistically joking about baby killing for a long time. Baby killing has become their sacred cow. They are fine with abortion, so baby killing to them is just one big abortion rights joke. That's not to say that they don't really do this, just that they will use abortion rights as their excuse for the "jokes." I've seen comments on anti-abortion pages about creepy stuff regarding Mary aborting Jesus even. Satanists seem to be pretty prominent in the fight against children being around and alive for longer than they are useful to them.

             They are Narcissist so they like to band together, exchange Narcissistic attention (cross-projective identification) and find victims for the group to prey on.

             Can we just temper the whitewash, broad rhetoric about "Democrats joking about baby killing and abortion?" Just b/c one is "pro choice, does not mean they condone "baby killing," nor even that they take abortion lightly. Some ppl may may sick jokes about abortion, which albeit crude and juvenile and not your brand of humor, it doesn't mean baby sacrifice is ok by them. Someone can be pro-choice and still believe in limitations, regulations and a serious decision discussion between a woman and God. That's why it's "Right to Choose."

            I would not be a bit surprised if they have done this.  I am so tired of these sick morons. They need to be taken away in handcuffs. HB needs some of their own medicine.

               Yeah I know ironic sounding nickname. It's a man in drag who worked as a bartender at CP (I like to refer to it as what it really is for) has an Instagram where he liked to check in at Comet Ping Pong and whore for the place with his photos promoting the events.

               It's the bartender at CPP and the context was that was his drag character's Halloween costume.
              </p>
              <p>
               Specifically he was going as the Stephen King character Carrie which explains why he was covered in Blood.
