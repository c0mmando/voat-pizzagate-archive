<h3>Folks 2013</h3>
<p>From <a href="http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/folks/">http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/folks/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the artist, his paintings depict “a world romanticized as one of tranquility, decay and destruction – parentless, ageless youths roam an endless playground in pursuit of a remedy to their youthful ennui [compare this to the work of<a href="https://archive.fo/JdPGj"> known pedophile Hakim Bey</a> and his <a href="https://archive.fo/ZUpRp">Temporary Autonomous Zones)</a>. The locations are reccurring places that I visit in dreams. The scenes are set at dusk or night. To me, night represents the unknown, where the possibilities are endless. Things are out of focus, unclear; and everything is easier on your eyes.”</p>
<p>The title “Folks” is inspired by both the classic daily comic strip &quot;Peanuts,&quot; whose original title was “Li’l Folks”, and the  Chicago street gang Folk Nation.  “Peanuts is a world where parental figures are not seen, and the characters look like children, yet act like grumpy old people. The gang is a very similar youth-oriented creation, living outside normal society with their own brand of language, style, rules, and images,” writes Jackson.</p>

<h3>Pan\'s Pipes 2013</h3>
<p><a href="http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/pans/details.html">http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/pans/details.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artists Ryan Hill, Erick Jackson, and George Jenne investigate the counterculture vocabulary they grew up with to create the exhibition Pan\'s Pipes. With the goal of creating the psychological feel of headshops and other illicit spaces where teens go to escape the realities of family and school, the artists create new works on paper, sculpture, and a unique installation. According to the artists, these kinds of spaces were a combination of sights, sounds, literature, and even smells that would stimulate feelings of the fantastic and the forbidden. Posters, comic books, slogans, drug and sexual imagery are the inspiration for their works.</p>
<p>The exhibition encompasses two galleries in Civilian, including a &quot;black light&quot; store space and a large backroom filled with dozens of images, works on paper, sculpture, and found objects. While the artists do not literally create a headshop, their work explores a visual culture that once embraced other-ness and a kind of subjectivity rejected by mainstream culture. The work is both surrealist and psychedelic, combining imagery and objects to create psychological moods, dream states and poetic thinking.</p>

<h3>Nightscaping 2010</h3>
<p><a href="http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/nightscaping/details.html">http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/nightscaping/details.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nightscaping is a new series of paintings by Washington, D.C. based artist Erick Jackson influenced by Charles Schultz\'s Peanuts characters and the school of Romanticism. Drawing from his academic background (Rhode Island School of Design), his rock musician sensibility (Apes, Midnight Kids), and his lavish imagination, Jackson creates this new suite of paintings based on the techniques developed in his last exhibition All Night Flight, a series of 68 color pencil drawings. The paintings in Nightscaping continue this trajectory and were germinated during the blizzard of 2010, when much of the East Coast was blanketed in snow.</p>
<p>According to the artist, &quot;my paintings begin in a sort of beautifully, apocalyptic land where the smoke, or in this case snow, clears and kids start poking their heads out to see what\'s going on.&quot; Ever inspired by the romantic notion that a gifted, perhaps misunderstood loner, creatively following the dictates of his inspiration rather than the mores of contemporary society, is to be revered and celebrated, Jackson marries his childhood memory with an imagined, other world.</p>
<p>The paintings are heavily influenced by Charlie Brown holiday specials, specifically The Great Pumpkin, &quot;where kids are having a Halloween party in what looks like a bombed-out house.&quot; The paintings, according to Jackson, &quot;are set in a pleasant world where parentless youth roam an endless playground created for their amusement. I try to imagine that I\'m creating a set for an (as of yet) unmade movie. The locations are reoccurring places that I visit in dreams. All of it happens at night. Night equals the unknown where the possibilities are endless; things are out of focus, unclear and everything is easier on your eyes.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>All Night Flight 2009</h3>
<p><a href="http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/allnight/details.html">http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/allnight/details.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For All Night Flight, Erick Jackson has created over 60 color pencil drawings plus a large-scale drawing installation of imagery plucked from adolescence and psychic memory. From B-movies, rock music culture, and late night 1980’s cable television shows, Jackson takes us through his fecund memories and imagination, presenting an aesthetic disappearing from our contemporary vernacular.</p>
<p>Drawing from a freakishly strong memory, for months Jackson researched movies and television shows for visual equivalents of memories of exact moments lodged in his mind since childhood. The pungent seventies aesthetic of the occult; endless car chases; and bizarre children’s shows of a psychedelic era shaped the artist’s young mind, depositing fertile material to draw from in the present day.</p>
<p>According to the artist, &quot;certain stills from these works have been etched into my psyche and reappear in my artwork and music again and again. Themes of the anti-hero, danger, paranoia and beauty have remained consistent in my mind and they have defined my likes and dislikes. These impressions are not necessarily drawn from ‘spooky’ images but they were based in fear and wonder. Certain things just freaked you out as a kid and made you want to know more. It is this longing to know that continues to enrich the mystery.”</p>
<p>For the exhibition, Jackson departed from his laborious painting style to the flexibility of color pencil to create an expanding body of fluid, saturated images uniquely framed and positioned on the gallery walls. From depictions of phantasms to night marauders to skateboarding and life post-apocalypse, Jackson lives up to his image-maker reputation in this ambitious exhibition.</p>

<h3>Vlad\'s Crib 2007</h3>
<p><a href="http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/saltonvlad/saltonvlad.html">http://civilianartprojects.com/exhibitions/saltonvlad/saltonvlad.html</a></p>
<p>Vlad\'s Crib</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Known for his hyper-colorful, fantastical, narrative painting style, in this new series the artist presents a looking glass into the bachelor pad of a fictional, preternatural homeowner. From the drum room, to the arcade, to the sauna, this guy knows how to live.</p>

           <p>
            The title “Folks” is inspired by both the classic daily comic strip "Peanuts," whose original title was “Li’l Folks”, and the  Chicago street gang Folk Nation.  “Peanuts is a world where parental figures are not seen, and the characters look like children, yet act like grumpy old people. The gang is a very similar youth-oriented creation, living outside normal society with their own brand of language, style, rules, and images,” writes Jackson.

           <p>
            Artists Ryan Hill, Erick Jackson, and George Jenne investigate the counterculture vocabulary they grew up with to create the exhibition Pan's Pipes. With the goal of creating the psychological feel of headshops and other illicit spaces where teens go to escape the realities of family and school, the artists create new works on paper, sculpture, and a unique installation. According to the artists, these kinds of spaces were a combination of sights, sounds, literature, and even smells that would stimulate feelings of the fantastic and the forbidden. Posters, comic books, slogans, drug and sexual imagery are the inspiration for their works.
           </p>
           <p>
            The exhibition encompasses two galleries in Civilian, including a "black light" store space and a large backroom filled with dozens of images, works on paper, sculpture, and found objects. While the artists do not literally create a headshop, their work explores a visual culture that once embraced other-ness and a kind of subjectivity rejected by mainstream culture. The work is both surrealist and psychedelic, combining imagery and objects to create psychological moods, dream states and poetic thinking.

           Nightscaping 2010

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Nightscaping is a new series of paintings by Washington, D.C. based artist Erick Jackson influenced by Charles Schultz's Peanuts characters and the school of Romanticism. Drawing from his academic background (Rhode Island School of Design), his rock musician sensibility (Apes, Midnight Kids), and his lavish imagination, Jackson creates this new suite of paintings based on the techniques developed in his last exhibition All Night Flight, a series of 68 color pencil drawings. The paintings in Nightscaping continue this trajectory and were germinated during the blizzard of 2010, when much of the East Coast was blanketed in snow.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the artist, "my paintings begin in a sort of beautifully, apocalyptic land where the smoke, or in this case snow, clears and kids start poking their heads out to see what's going on." Ever inspired by the romantic notion that a gifted, perhaps misunderstood loner, creatively following the dictates of his inspiration rather than the mores of contemporary society, is to be revered and celebrated, Jackson marries his childhood memory with an imagined, other world.
           </p>
           <p>
            The paintings are heavily influenced by Charlie Brown holiday specials, specifically The Great Pumpkin, "where kids are having a Halloween party in what looks like a bombed-out house." The paintings, according to Jackson, "are set in a pleasant world where parentless youth roam an endless playground created for their amusement. I try to imagine that I'm creating a set for an (as of yet) unmade movie. The locations are reoccurring places that I visit in dreams. All of it happens at night. Night equals the unknown where the possibilities are endless; things are out of focus, unclear and everything is easier on your eyes."

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            For All Night Flight, Erick Jackson has created over 60 color pencil drawings plus a large-scale drawing installation of imagery plucked from adolescence and psychic memory. From B-movies, rock music culture, and late night 1980’s cable television shows, Jackson takes us through his fecund memories and imagination, presenting an aesthetic disappearing from our contemporary vernacular.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drawing from a freakishly strong memory, for months Jackson researched movies and television shows for visual equivalents of memories of exact moments lodged in his mind since childhood. The pungent seventies aesthetic of the occult; endless car chases; and bizarre children’s shows of a psychedelic era shaped the artist’s young mind, depositing fertile material to draw from in the present day.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the artist, "certain stills from these works have been etched into my psyche and reappear in my artwork and music again and again. Themes of the anti-hero, danger, paranoia and beauty have remained consistent in my mind and they have defined my likes and dislikes. These impressions are not necessarily drawn from ‘spooky’ images but they were based in fear and wonder. Certain things just freaked you out as a kid and made you want to know more. It is this longing to know that continues to enrich the mystery.”
           </p>
           <p>
            For the exhibition, Jackson departed from his laborious painting style to the flexibility of color pencil to create an expanding body of fluid, saturated images uniquely framed and positioned on the gallery walls. From depictions of phantasms to night marauders to skateboarding and life post-apocalypse, Jackson lives up to his image-maker reputation in this ambitious exhibition.

            i'm starting to think the OP is trying to keep this investigation on heavy breathing for a reason. let's stay focused on these creepy musicians instead of devoting our
energies elsewhere. who's paying you? you sure spend a lot of time on this band.

            how do you know she rapes babies "at night"? you sure know a great deal about her, maybe you're trying to keep people focused on  her because YOU have something to hide.

            This whole thread just tickles me to death. The amount of time you've devoted to "decoding" the "secret messages" the band is sending out and all the analysis of everything they've done, digging through tour diary archives, mining stills from videos, people commenting about trying to interpret the "hand signals", the paintings, the music, the speeches. It's just beyond hilarious. You're SO desperate to believe it's all true and you're going to be hailed as hero true detectives, but the reality is, as far as this band's involvement in an alleged pedo ring, it's a total farce. Everyone who actually knows them personally knows this to be true. None of the people they know have turned away from them. The opposite has in fact, occurred. We come here and read this stuff and laugh at you, but at the same time, I feel sorry for you. That you've been duped by neo fascist right wing agitprop trolls into playing along and wasting your lives trying to prove something that's just not true. You could be volunteering with at risk youth, or helping the homeless, or any other number of things that would have an actual positive impact in society, but instead 
you're combing over everything this group of artists and musicians has done, trying to cram it into a narrative that someone else created probably as a political smear campaign. It's tragicomic. If you took away all the threats and harrassment that's come with the whole thing, it'd be a big piece of performance art. Or a joke and ya'll are the punchline. Merry Christmas. 
I'll wear your coming insults and downvotes as a badge of honor. But I hope this sinks in with some of you.

            Here's some art Erick Jackson did in 1994 for another music band he was in "The Golden Touch-Hits the Sweet spot" Click on the more images to see the label design of a baby in a cut open skull.
           </p>

             https://www.discogs.com/Golden-Touch-Hits-The-Sweet-Spot/release/5317018
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            A band both Schmid and Jackson were in, in 1999, called BST Payback and how they describe themselves;
           </p>
           <p>
            Dragon: BST Payback can be typically found in swamps and marshes, although they can be found in subterranean lairs also. BST Payback always seeks to lair in deep dark caves. They are abusive and quick to anger with an instinctive cunning and malevolence that makes up for their lower intelligence. They are extremely selfish and resent intrusions. The diet of BST Payback is fish and mollusks. When they get meat from land, they like to let it soak in ponds near their lair before consuming it. The breath weapon of the BST Payback is not that of fire. Their breath weapon is spitting acid.
           </p>
           <p>
            SIDE B:
           </p>
           <p>
            Price of Rock: BST Payback is the rock that levels by itself, supports like a solid, fills inaccessible voids, requires no labor, is non-toxic, and comes in two forms: excavatable or nonexcavatable, unless you use a jackhammer. BST Payback allows you to design and select tunnel and mine supports using theoretical and empirical methods that take account of interaction of support and rock mass, rock failure with time, tunnelling speed, existing support, and grouting. Utilize BST Payback correlation formulae to determine rock mass strength, deformation and creep.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a new band in Washington DC called Payback but it doesn't have any members from The Apes.

             It's not a "baby in a cut open skull".  It's a baby in the womb.  It basically shows the female reproductive system with ovaries and fallopian tubes.  The babies head is at the cervix.

             The last image is also bizarre.  Repeated 7" at end of each song(?).  Reads like someone is giving strong hints of abuse!

            Excellent work, as if Heavy Breathing wasn't bad enough.  "What's that you say, a self-published work of fiction from 2005 about a multi-generational Satanic incest cult in Portugal by Ronald Charles Wolf?"  Bang, that's fairly incriminating for everyone associated with Heavy Breathing, including Comet Ping Pong, fucking degenerate bastards.

             I just realised, the cult is in Portugal, where Madeline McCann went missing. Portugal, Praia de Luz specifically is meant yo have a high concentration of pedo's. Why is this?

            , at .25 speed reveals several very disturbing images.  There is an image of what looks like a boy with blood on his butt being restrained on top of a table at 10 seconds and another boy hog-tied to the headboard and footboard of a bed at 14 seconds... I would post some archived snapshots of this but I don't want to be accused of posting CP.

             There are over 2000 frames so there are many duplicates, and quite a few completely black screens before and after fade out transitions. I was motivated to do this because there was a rumor going around that there was a shipping container picture in the video at some point. It's not there.

             I learned how to do this directly in VLC media player from this video on youtube. You can do it yourself if you feel unsafe downloading the zip file, or if you are skeptical of my listing.

              Nice man - that it super helpful!  There's definitely a few I didn't notice even playing it quarter speed on youtube.

              Here is an album compilation of frames I picked out from your master album:

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              And... one of those frames I missed was this:
              <a href="https://i.sli.mg/DF2MtS.jpg">
               https://i.sli.mg/DF2MtS.jpg
              </a>
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I can't believe that image almost freaks me out more than the ones of the of the boy hog-tied to a bed.  The eye in the picture above clearly has Coloboma!   Check this thread out:

              That was me thinking there was a shipping container 😬
             </p>
             <p>
              I thought the person in a cage was in a shipping container.  I sat there for 2 hrs pausing and every so slightly moving my mouse then screen shotting then starting the whole process over again all the way through the video.  There were images that I'd see but could never get paused just right to capture them.  The person in a cage  was one of them.
