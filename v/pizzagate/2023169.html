<p>HELP ME FIND THE LAW THAT SAYS BLOOD DRINKING IS A CRIME :)</p>
<p>&quot;The two most important factors for determining whether a particular set of beliefs and practices constitute a religion are:</p>
<pre><code>belief in a supernatural being, thing or principle, and
acceptance of canons of conduct which give effect to that belief, but which do not offend against the ordinary laws.

<p>From the OTO:
&quot;8. How far away do you feel the Gnostic Catholic Church is from securing 
denominational status and being legally recognized as a religious entity in this country? 
And what are some sure steps that we can take in this direction? 
!
I can’t really say how far away we are - we need to have a constructive and ongoing dialogue 
with the Government, and I think it may take some time to a) get across who we are and what 
we do, but also b) develop our own facilities to meet their established indicia and criteria.  You 
see, religion is treated strangely in Australia - this is due to section 116 of our Constitution which 
I want to quote to you: 
“The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any 
religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test 
shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.” 
So, when we were litigating a few years ago and an argument was put forward that Thelema 
was an unlawful religion the Judge threw it out immediately.  And the taxation office recognises 
us as a non-profit religious institution.  However, recognised denominational status is handled 
by a separate limb of government.  These things take time - it’s about fostering a mutual 
understanding and dialogue.  And we have to take the high road and be realistic. 
What we can do now is establish our public Temples - as I’ve authorised this year, as you would 
know in Adelaide and in Fremantle.  Your readers can look at the websites: 
<a href="http://www.egcfremantle.com/">http://www.egcfremantle.com/</a>
<a href="http://www.egcadelaide.com/">http://www.egcadelaide.com/</a>
!
The Temples need vocationally driven Clergy - as we have in Adelaide and Fremantle - who can 
reach out to Congregations spanning all ages, a broad and diverse Church, of OTO members 
and others, with Clergy who are able to meaningfully engage with their congregation.  To truly 
function as Priests and Priestesses within communities - to be there for their community.  This is 
entirely distinct to treating the Mass or the Church as an insular OTO local body event.  And it’s 
an entirely different class of Clergy I am talking about here.  Where we are operational I want to 
build Churches and family friendly ecclesiastical communities.  I see enormous potential here - 
we need to grow into it, but this field of Our Lord is fertile and just waiting for us to cultivate over 
time.  We also need a quality episcopate and we’re doing what we can to up the education 
across the Board.  So, I lean heavily on Bishop Tau Amrit who is coordinating EGC operations 
and managing our online EGC eLearning portal.  And every second year we now have an EGC 
Retreat really just for the Clergy of EGC, recognised or novitiate.  These plans will develop over 
time but work in tandem with the recognised denomination work.        &quot;</p>
<p>HELP ME FIND THE LAWS ON BLOOD DRINKING AND WE CAN GET THE BALL ROLLING. If you research this as much as I did you can see the 2008 jailing of Legg and Devine for religious vilification of this child sex cult (Christian Prosecution) judgment and the wording for the first time in history these pedophiles are a religion thereby giving them tax exempt status. Jailing Christians for not loving pedophilia is therefore a very profitable enterprise. Read the first judgment here:
<a href="http://www.theyfly.com/articles/gaia/oto_reasons.pdf">http://www.theyfly.com/articles/gaia/oto_reasons.pdf</a></p>
<p>NB: The ATO says a court must recognize them as a religion adn that happened above. Legg and Devine were jailed in a subsequent case for contempt of court for refusing to comply with pedo cover up orders in the document above.</p>

            Details on all UK OTO kingpins here. Guess what in the UK they are not a charity or a religion, and have totally failed to get any recognition under their Tax / Legal system. But of course Australia leads the way in normalization and pedophilia the last few decades, with America now rapidly catching up.

            UPDATE:
OTO Australia are on the run, redacting their own December 2007 press release from their OWN WEBSITE otoaustralia.org.au/legal and lashtal.com now ( or "database down") because their own testimony proves the magistrate partner in their tax fraud fake religion via religious vilification lawsuit scam  Magistrate Harbison who jailed legg and devine for 9 months without them being in the court room contrary to her fake case law she published saying they were present - THAT IS REFUTED by the Age Newspaper and the OTO itself!
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's what triggered them to do their takedown of their own content that incriminates the deputy president of the Victorian Civil and Administrative appeals Tribunal Miss Vanity Phone Extension 66666 exposed in my Jim Fetzer Interview:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Both the OTO (the applicant) and a 3rd party observer the Newspapers are saying Magistrate Harbison is publishing fake case law. Also legal observers are having a go at her jailing christians for not loving satanic pedo sex cults for her breaches of the Victorian Charter of Human Rights alone:

            Here's another interesting press release.

           <p>
            OOPS OTO blogs referred to what used to be on the OTOAustralia.org.au website they censored because of my activism - proving it was OTO pedo cunts trolling the 8ch.net thread that tipped them off to this intel gain
            <a href="http://www.aletheuo.org/essays/speak.html">

            )
           </p>
           <p>
            How did the OTO know FOUR VICTORIAN POLICE + NSW GLLO NAZI HOMOCOP pink-triangle.org wearing Officers did a kidnapping of the satanic pedo haters and sent them directly from the paddy wagon to jail without a proper trial as they were already tried and found guilty in abstentia without a proper chance to mount a defence. They challenged jurisdiction and have since been vindicated by this NSW Supreme Court case law.
Were the police in direct contact with the OTO whilst they hunted them down? This is interesting eh?

             Here's what they redacted in text form. Notice they say Legg and Devine were not present in court contrary to the case law on austlii.edu.au

            <p>
             Who are dishonorable liars? The OTO or the Magistrate Harbison that jailed Legg and Devine for 9 months - 3 served? Either way the whole things a sham.
            </p>

             Australian OTO Legal News: December 2007 Press Release
            </p>
            <p>
             Two Australian residents who were found to have religiously vilified the OTO and its members in Australia have been sentenced to nine months imprisonment for contempt of court after failing to comply with orders issued by the Victorian and Civil Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) to remove offensive materials from their US hosted website.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vivienne Legg and Dyson Devine had posted a document authored by Reina Michaelson, a child psychologist, in which she made comment that an abusive network operating in Victoria, in which children were sexually abused and killed in a scenario of satanic ritual abuse, appeared to be the OTO.
            </p>
            <p>
             The OTO acted to defend itself, its members and Thelema against this vile and unsubstantiated slur.
            </p>
            <p>
             OTO officers Steve King, David Bottrill and Brent Gray appeared as litigants on behalf of the OTO and successfully sued Legg and Devine for defamation, and also filed complaints of religious vilification against them and Michaelson, whose document was also posted on her organisation's website.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a VCAT case settled last year Michaelson admitted she had not produced any proof that any OTO members were involved in such practices and acknowledged the offence caused by the release of the document. The settlement is located at:
             <a href="http://www.otoaustralia.org.au/OTO_final_terms.pdf">
              http://www.otoaustralia.org.au/OTO_final_terms.pdf
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Michaelson also removed the document from her organisation's former website and published a statement (see bottom of
             <a href="http://www.csapp.org.au">
              http://www.csapp.org.au)
             </a>
             ) on her new website claiming that the document was placed there without her knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
             On 27 July 2007 Legg and Devine were found guilty of religious vilification and ordered to remove the offensive materials from their website. They failed to do this and contempt proceedings were initiated.
            </p>
            <p>
             To ensure their appearance before the Tribunal four police officers from Victoria travelled more than 1500 kilometres to New South Wales where Legg and Devine live, and brought them to Melbourne.
            </p>
            <p>
             Released on bail overnight with orders to appear the next day, they failed to take the opportunity provided by VCAT to comply with the Tribunal's orders and on the morning of Wednesday 28 November 2007 Judge Harbison found that their contempt was deliberate.
            </p>
            <p>
             She sentenced Legg and Devine to nine months imprisonment with no minimum period.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sadly, the internet has become a haven for bigotry, ignorance and hate but on a few occasions the perpetrators of vilification are able to be bought to task for their actions.
            </p>
            <p>
             We applaud the decision by Judge Harbison to jail Legg and Devine who clearly felt that the due process of law did not apply to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Australian OTO is proud to have been able to defend its members and Thelema against these vile slanders and hope that others benefit from the action it has taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             The OTO was once again ably represented by Cathryn Prowse of DLA Phillips Fox who was joined on this occasion by Dr Ian Freckelton, newly appointed as Senior Counsel. The Australia OTO wishes to thank Ms Prowse, Dr Freckelton and all those who have previously provided us with assistance and representation. We also thank the numerous Thelemites around the world who have supported and encouraged us throughout these litigations - we will keep you posted on future developments.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then the OTO Child fuckers threatened their death in prison whilst they were in jail:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             For the case law put "Legg Devine" into austlii.edu.au
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's the picture of the OTO pedo cult child art classes they run.
            </p>

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Truth news censored content - I bearly said anything about the OTO child fuck cult, just mentioned the legg devine lawsuit and how they were denied natural justice or a trial and that's it. The radio host who made the interview in Thailand under Thai law was sued by an Australian court, so they could take his parents house.

             If you saw my Jim Fetzer interview and the blog post that's based on they were writing letters to the VCAT pedos YOU DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION FUCK OFF and I rehosted those letters on my blog - and they were jailed for being right about that. They were jailed for not participating in a court that legally had no jurisdiction.  The state is liable for illegal unconstitutional kidnapping and depravation of due process for a child sex cult, especially with the 2017 Supreme Court of appeals ruling they were right back then, VCAT and the OTO child sex cult's use of religious blasphemy laws had no jurisdiction in NSW.
            </p>
            <p>
             That flawed case law got them all to write off their places of child sex magick worship as a tax free haven, no property tax. That was the motive for the judicial corruption. The persecution of Christians with flawed judgment got a pedo cult tax free status. It's fucken disgusting.

             That proves the motive for the OTO suing Legg and Devine. TAX EXEMPT STATUS.
And read the document on their website they forced Reina to sign to say the court accepts the child sex cult is a religion hence gave them what they needed to get tax exempt pedo cult status

             I just found a interesting video last night where I heard it the first time and I was going to go looking for written confirmation. Good work organic one. OTO cunt gets grilled by masons but can't give up the biggest secrets. he did give up the intel about 501c3 however. I was listening to it last night and that's where I got my first confirmation of the 501c3, but you beat me to the disclosure. GREAT WORK!

             Masons and OTO are one but for legal reasons they are saying they are separate because we are kicking the formers arse hard. Yep everyone needs to go after their US tax exempt status for the same reason. I"ve seen video of US prosecutors say Alister Crowley / OTO is a child sex cult to get convictions against a few perps. How the fuck can the IRS do this. Ah yeah, the IRS loves faggotry and pedophilia can be the only reason and that would explain this:

            1) This is a really good initiative
2) Im in Australia, BUT
3) I have a personal approach that in order to reasonably protect myself from scrutiny/harrassment from the Elite, I focus my efforts on the USA / UK arms of the Paedostocracy, and therefore generally abstain from Australian based activism
           </p>
           <p>
            so
           </p>

             I triggered the oto fags in alt.magic - but just go on facebook and tell all the truthers there. I got banned from Facebook by the boylover Garry Burns who just took down activist-news.com's Facebook page and he made a video telling everyone to fuck Facebook. May as well get some mileage out of them before they go under.

             He messaged me and seemed polite and not bitter, so he's still on voat just not pizzagate. Do an act of good will and unban him. Taking out posts if they are put in the deletion log (not shadow deletions) I an live with.  I don't know why he was banned. All I know and think he wrote a well worded article on the OTO and should be part of our community.

            <p>
             The court case he was talking about is this one, before me. I've found the motive for it. TAX EXEMPT STATUS - TAX LOOPHOLE. Normally religions have to be listed by the attorney general here to get tax exempt status - but having a court say you are a religion is the loophole they used:

              https://www.ag.gov.au/FamiliesAndMarriage/Marriage/Pages/Recognisedreligiousdenominations.aspx
             </a>
             Here is the cash in form they use to add tax exempt properties etc (their own houses) to the fake religion scam by Supreme Court ruled constitutionally invalid case law.

               has seen the light, well the Cakes of Light. Cakes of light are the product of Spirit Cooking. I.e. baked shit, blood, piss, semen. When you see that spirit cooking bitch linked to Hillary Clinton also has the logo of Thelema behind her artwork, we know now the pizzagate pedos are in the OTO child sex cult.

            The worlds best selling book describes it well at Acts 15:29  to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!

            All this has started me thinking.  The Body and Blood of Christ.  That is considered Communion in the Catholic Religion.  Bread and Wine.  The Bread is the Body  The Wine is the Blood.  I have not taken Communion for decades since I do not go to Church.  But now I am thinking that we were pretending to drink the Blood of Christ.  I wonder when this started because it sounds sick to me.  I always thought of it when I was little as being close to him.  Now it is macabre.  I am going to research this further.  Whoa.

            So is killing children and now we got them admitting on camera children must partake in orgies. I'm just trying to force the ATO to have a stronger case against the ASIO OTOAustralia.org.au religion of child fucking headed up by one of their own operatives david bottrill.
It wasn't me to call David Bottrill ASIO first. his cover is an immigration manager but some court transcritps earlier gave away some stuff  about him being on a mission in turkey and got redacted in the Legg Devine ACT case (not victoria case - they were being sued by two states they didn't live in at the same time - neither had jurisdiction - then jailed by Victoria for challenging their jurisdiction and not showing up - they were vindicated in the NSW Supreme court of appeals this year). NSW OTO founded homocops concieved by Dr Gregory John Tillett who wrote the history of the OTO downunder, yes the Special gay child fucker Police (

            Australian OTO Legal News: December 2007 Press Release
           </p>
           <p>
            Two Australian residents who were found to have religiously vilified the OTO and its members in Australia have been sentenced to nine months imprisonment for contempt of court after failing to comply with orders issued by the Victorian and Civil Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) to remove offensive materials from their US hosted website.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vivienne Legg and Dyson Devine had posted a document authored by Reina Michaelson, a child psychologist, in which she made comment that an abusive network operating in Victoria, in which children were sexually abused and killed in a scenario of satanic ritual abuse, appeared to be the OTO.
           </p>
           <p>
            The OTO acted to defend itself, its members and Thelema against this vile and unsubstantiated slur.
           </p>
           <p>
            OTO officers Steve King, David Bottrill and Brent Gray appeared as litigants on behalf of the OTO and successfully sued Legg and Devine for defamation, and also filed complaints of religious vilification against them and Michaelson, whose document was also posted on her organisation's website.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a VCAT case settled last year Michaelson admitted she had not produced any proof that any OTO members were involved in such practices and acknowledged the offence caused by the release of the document. The settlement is located at:
            <a href="http://www.otoaustralia.org.au/OTO_final_terms.pdf">
             http://www.otoaustralia.org.au/OTO_final_terms.pdf
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Michaelson also removed the document from her organisation's former website and published a statement (see bottom of
            <a href="http://www.csapp.org.au">
             http://www.csapp.org.au)
            </a>
            ) on her new website claiming that the document was placed there without her knowledge.
           </p>
           <p>
            On 27 July 2007 Legg and Devine were found guilty of religious vilification and ordered to remove the offensive materials from their website. They failed to do this and contempt proceedings were initiated.
           </p>
           <p>
            To ensure their appearance before the Tribunal four police officers from Victoria travelled more than 1500 kilometres to New South Wales where Legg and Devine live, and brought them to Melbourne.
           </p>
           <p>
            Released on bail overnight with orders to appear the next day, they failed to take the opportunity provided by VCAT to comply with the Tribunal's orders and on the morning of Wednesday 28 November 2007 Judge Harbison found that their contempt was deliberate.
           </p>
           <p>
            She sentenced Legg and Devine to nine months imprisonment with no minimum period.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly, the internet has become a haven for bigotry, ignorance and hate but on a few occasions the perpetrators of vilification are able to be bought to task for their actions.
           </p>
           <p>
            We applaud the decision by Judge Harbison to jail Legg and Devine who clearly felt that the due process of law did not apply to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Australian OTO is proud to have been able to defend its members and Thelema against these vile slanders and hope that others benefit from the action it has taken.
           </p>
           <p>
            The OTO was once again ably represented by Cathryn Prowse of DLA Phillips Fox who was joined on this occasion by Dr Ian Freckelton, newly appointed as Senior Counsel. The Australia OTO wishes to thank Ms Prowse, Dr Freckelton and all those who have previously provided us with assistance and representation. We also thank the numerous Thelemites around the world who have supported and encouraged us throughout these litigations - we will keep you posted on future developments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the OTO Child fuckers threatened their death in prison whilst they were in jail:

           <p>
            For the case law put "Legg Devine" into austlii.edu.au
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the picture of the OTO pedo cult child art classes they run.

           </p>
           <p>
            Truth news censored content - I bearly said anything about the OTO child fuck cult, just mentioned the legg devine lawsuit and how they were denied natural justice or a trial and that's it. The radio host who made the interview in Thailand under Thai law was sued by an Australian court, so they could take his parents house.

            All their worried about is loosing tax exempt status ?  What about the reason for the loss of said exemption.  Like the email hacking stuff. The Dumbacrats claim the hacking of the emails was the crime. NOOOO.. Whats in the emails is the crime.

            Anyone know what happened to that Australian woman, Fiona Barnett, who was an alleged victim of elite satanic ritual abuse?  She was quite vocal up until 6 months ago where she suddenly stopped Tweeting and updating her web site.  She made a couple of posts on Voat too.

             she had a whole thing about bond university being a pedophile complex. Then i found a bond university Asian graduate prosecuting my mate for disrespecting the religion of OTO child sex and boy murder. Maybe she is legit.
See the Jim Fetzer interview for details on me doxxing her or the other pizzagate thread.

            See my comment please.  My eyes are tired from reading both reports.  It asks the question whether it is really a crime to dink blood.  Can you be charged just for that alone.  Wonderful Addition to the Post  Upvoat

            IS it against the law to drink blood even in Australia?  I looked up some articles and found blood drinking, and when they were arrested it just said they were arrested.  It involved usually some violent act in how they got the blood so I was wondering if the charges were for the act and not the blood drinking.  The stories were sick.  Also laws differ from country to country.  There was an instance in Chna were it said arrested for blood drinking, but not Australia.   Am still checking.  Magnificent write up.  Upvoat
