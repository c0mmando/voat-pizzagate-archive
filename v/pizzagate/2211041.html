<p>Here is Obama at Martha\'s Table: <a href="http://marthastable.org/obama/">http://marthastable.org/obama/</a></p>
<p>and an article about an event with Prince Charles in May 2011:</p>
<p><a href="http://seedlingprojects.org/blog/lunch-for-today-food-for-the-future/">Lunch for Today, Food for the Future</a>  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a rousing keynote by His Royal Highness Prince Charles. Seedling Projects collaborated with Bon Appetit Management Company and D.C. non-profits, with the generous support of Kaiser Permanente, to produce a lunch that continued the conversations sparked by the panelists and speakers over a family-style meal. </p>
<p>Hand-decorated bay leaves. The children from E.W.

The leaf decoration, coordinated by Farm to Desk D.C. coordinator Peter Nalli, was integrated into a lesson on herbs.  </p>

<p>This all rang a bell with me because I did a post a while back about a murdered Washington DC actress who happened to meet Prince Charles during that visit in 2011:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1655747">The actress murdered in Washington had some connections that may of interest after all. THEARC, and even a Prince makes a brief appearance.</a> </p>
<p>And within that post, I made the connection with THEARC.  Of course, Septime Webre (good friend of James Alefantis) is heavily involved 
with them: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/on-mississippi-ave-se-a-place-of-light-and-learning/2012/11/20/610f4c68-334b-11e2-bfd5-e202b6d7b501_story.html?utm_term=.05c816c297e5">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/on-mississippi-ave-se-a-place-of-light-and-learning/2012/11/20/610f4c68-334b-11e2-bfd5-e202b6d7b501_story.html?utm_term=.05c816c297e5</a></p>
