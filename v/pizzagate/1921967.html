            Wow ðŸ˜‚ I'm going to send him this link. Just kidding lol. I agree tho. Even Wikileaks said the FBI are going to spill now like Niagra falls. What was so irritating is that so many democrats were talking crap about their homie Comey. They were saying how it's his fault that Hillary lost blah blah blah. Who wasn't on that list? But, many wanted him gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once Trump fired Comey, the democrats milked it all they could, trying to say how wrong our president was and that he did it because of the Russian investigation. That's the only reason these bastards are on the news acting like they are on Comey's side. Behind the scene, I've heard that many are glad and want him gone.
           </p>

            Even Steve Pieczenik said people in the FBI are against Hillary and want to clean out the corrupt deep state. He has friends as well as connections that are in the FBI. He goes on Alex Jones. Right before the election he said that they, including him, had formed a soft coup against Hillary Clinton. So now that Comey is gone, they will have more freedom. This guy knows his stuff.  This is just a small part of his bio....

             Steve Pieczenik is the first pychiatrist to ever have served as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. He served four presidents as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Bush Sr. and was a Senior Policy Planner under president Reagan. Dr. Pieczenik worked directly with, and reported directly to, Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger.
