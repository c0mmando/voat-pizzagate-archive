<p>The lady on the audio is saying that she adopted two kids in Indiana and now lives in Texas. She actually adopted these kids because she married their father.  The bio mother was killed in a medvac helicopter crash (she was a surgical nurse).  The lady in the audio thinks the mother may have been KILLED due to the fact she and someone else on the helicopter, possibly the pilot, were both raised in a cult and were going to try to speak out about the abuse taking place.</p>

<p>Apparently, this cult lives on or has ties to many acres of land in Paoli, Indiana which is in Orange County </p>

<p>She mentions there are like shacks or something on these properties where people can come and abuse the kids.  She also mentions underground tunnels to different houses. I haven’t even listened to the whole audio yet because I stopped to search the helicopter crash and see if this was legit.  She also mentions....kids were TRANSPORTED by the helicopter to the land.  
</p>
<p>The mother/ nurses name was Sandra Pearson and she was in fact killed in a helicopter crash.  Helicopter info:
operated by Missouri-based Air Evac Lifeteam.  The base at Rush Memorial Hospital had been in operation only since February, according to Air Vac.  Air Evac\'s other Indiana bases are in Brazil, Evansville and Paoli. The company, which has its headquarters in West Plains, Mo., has 79 bases in 13 states. 
(ALL NEED TO BE LOOKED INTO)</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the same AirEvac. Air Evac Lifeteam is now a subsidiary of AMGH (Air Medical Group Holdings),[3] along with EagleMed, Med-Trans, and REACH.[4] Although a subsidiary of AMGH, Air Evac is still considered an independent provider. Air Evac is also the largest membership-supported air ambulance service in the country. What a “novel” idea also to use them if you want to harvest organs...medical team, helicopter...trying to find actual NAMES of owners, but coming up short.</p>
<p><a href="https://lifeteam.net/">https://lifeteam.net/</a></p>
<p>The lady in the audio also mentions her daughter saw a Haleigh Cummings....I wasn’t sure what the heck this was about then found this...she is a missing girl from Florida.  I haven’t checked yet, but I’m sure Air Evac is more than likely located in Florida</p>

             Great info and thanks.  I found this old thread. I’m going to dig further and see if any of these people have connections to Paoli or Air Evac as well.

             Lokk, I can help you as I live 3 minutes from Paoli and we are VERY small towns---everybody knows when u fart kind of town- BUT   This little girl is only 16 and she has not gotten a new name.  If ANYONE in the high school gets wind of this she will suddenly go from a victim to the worlds biggest slut simply because kids are cruel..especially in small towns where they haven't anything else to do.  PLEASE remove her name.  Her brother is 19 and may be able to handle it better but she is still in school and YOU EXPLOITING THEM IS NO LESS AS EVIL AS THE PEDOS because YOU are now the one causing harm.  If this kid gets bullied and kills herself are you going to still be gloating because you were A handy"SLEUTH" and were able to find their names?  Give yourself the pat on the back you seem to so desperately deserve and TAKE the kids names down.  It is not a question of your right to do so and yes, it is public information but the key is MOST PEOPLE DON't know and won't know if you take it down. Why would you exploit a CHILD that has already been through hell?!  so if you need inside Paoli info
