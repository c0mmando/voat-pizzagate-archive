<p>The Sacrifice - Bohemian Grove 2018: It has been well over three decades since the membership attempted this. Three decades of wanting to do so but afraid of the authorities who were anxious to learn any details about the two previous times it has known to have happened. It was fitting that it happened in that special room with the initials to begin the name. The two organizers of the sacrifice are two of the very top officials of the organization that resembles that room name. They brought with them, a special guest. For one of the very few times ever, a woman was allowed inside the grounds. The foreign born escorts are actually ensconced in a secure area that is not within the camp itself. The only sex workers allowed on the grounds itself are the young men. The special guest is A+ list in every sense of the word. All of you know who she is. She has also engaged in some of the most bizarre sex acts with each of the two men mentioned earlier. She has traveled the world with these men, separately and together, engaging in sex acts while pretending to be compassionate. Brutalizing young girls and women to fulfill whatever sick desires they have, knowing they do so with impunity because they are above all laws in those places. They control the law. They control the news. They control it all. The power has gone to their head. The A+ lister has always felt a connection with the event because it is one originally established for artists and still pays lip service to that original mandate. She brought two tweens with her. One male and one female. She began by drawing blood from herself and spreading it over her body before spreading it on the tweens. The tweens were then pricked with a needle and some of their blood was drawn which was then marked on all those who wanted to participate. Those who were chosen to participate then were allowed to explore the tweens how they wanted while our A+ lister encouraged them and participated herself. When every man had finished what they had started, two large men came into the room who had not been there previously and took the tweens away. Most people assume they were set aflame in the annual ritual. Some people think they were given as trophies to a member who has been a long time supporter and has a fondness for young boys and girls.</p>

            What happened to the thread labeling? No "unsubstantiated", or "possible disinfo"? Threads were removed for being hearsay, as if that is a reason to remove a thread. Mods continue their control over this sub.

            My vote is for Angeline Jolie too. Alleged SRA (Ritual Abuse) victim Cathy O'Brien, describes being trafficked to Bohemian Grove, and taken to a room there known as the "U.NDERGROUND Lounge" (play on the name United Nations). This fits in perfectly with this blind's description of "...a special room with initials to begin the name."
           </p>
           <p>
            My guess is at least one of the powerful men Angelina was working for is Antonio Guterres, current Secretary-General of the United Nations. Fits perfectly with the blind's description of "..two of the very top officials of the organization that resembles the room name." Guterres was formerly the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR) from 2005-2015. In 2012, Guterres appointed Angelina Jolie as a Special Envoy for the UNHCR. Long story short, both these people are clearly in a  position of extraordinary power where they can travel the world limitlessly. They both interact with refugees all over the world, who by definition are desperate men, women and children, clearly easy to take advantage of by those with dark intentions. So beyond-horrendous if Angelina and Guterres really are using these positions of power to abuse children.

            I feel sick even looking at her.  She’s so tall and skinny like a vulture, creeping around, looking for children.  Same as Madonna, al pretending to care about children.  This world is so sick.

             Respectfully, I do not think she is talking about ritual abuse or Satanism. It sounds most like she is talking about  consensual bondage.  The subtitles are lying about  what she is actually verbalizing... not cool. IMO, I see zero evidence of her involvement

              </strong>
              In 1999 an anonymous source Secretly Filmed Angelina Jolie, then aged 23, speaking to two close friends about Illuminati initiation rituals she had recently taken part in while attempting to establish herself in Hollywood. Her friend, speaking in halting tones, describes viewing the footage, saying: "I only saw that film that she [Angelina] bought over that night. People who are, like, darker… It’s great to be able to see everybody’s sexuality, but it’s so weird when you just… I have the most amazing compromising pictures of people."

              Cathy O'Brien described a secret room at Bohemian Grove with this name. Since "initials" literally "begin the name" of the room (referring to the clue provided in the Blind), makes sense it could be this.

               I don't know if she's transgendered or not, but we absolutely should care if we've been presented with transgendered females presented as biological females (and transgendered males presented as biological males) by the elite for decades as part of a plot to gaslight and manipulate us as they try to carry out their demented agenda.
              </p>
              <p>
               We should also care that the elite have been abusing their children by forcing them to grow up as the gender they are not, pumping them full of hormones from a young age (possibly even in the womb), mutilating them, and requiring them to live as people they aren't.

                Transgenderism is happening biologically and I don't believe its used as a weapon. I do believe our toxic food system with all its poison and hormone disruptors and mimickers is likely the cause or part of the cause

                Yes, I agree with all of your points, but it's getting tiring when people comment on threads and all they're concerned about is the trans issue. There is a psyop right now where they want you to believe that
                <em>
                 everyone
                </em>
                is, and that's simply ridiculous.

            This is Beyond Sick.  These Over-Bloated Self Loving Narcissists will be brought down.  They will be made to grovel and beg for mercy when people find out what they have been up to.  I am not surprised at the name.  She has stolen children from Africa just like Madonna.  These people think Everything and Everyone is theirs for the taking. I blame that on their fans and the American People that bow down to their  Pedowood Stars.
