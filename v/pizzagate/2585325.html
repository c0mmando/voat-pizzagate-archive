<p>Relevant to Pizzagate as article directly addresses the Tuscon child trafficking story as another &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and Pizzagate is the &quot;forebearer&quot; of the group of nutjobs.  There are some pretty big, gaping holes in the story, and the 4 word name guy seems &quot;off&quot; ( he is not a Vet, if I understand correctly).  Not much is known, but in 2015 VOP <em>seemed</em> to be attempting to do good work: <a href="http://www.azfamily.com/story/30331814/veterans-group-aim-to-help-homeless-vets">http://www.azfamily.com/story/30331814/veterans-group-aim-to-help-homeless-vets</a> Did VOP guy turn?  Set up?  Trap?</p>
<p><strong>This is where it gets important</strong> - Tuscon.com is a Gannett property.  Gannett is USA Today and a zillion other properties.  There is a reason they are in every hotel, every morning, for free.  Just like CNN is anywhere and everywhere.  This messaging will be pumped out to mass eyes and ears.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett_Company">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett_Company</a> - Gannett is a couple miles from the CIA.  Always has been.</p>
<p>So if we apply that logic, their #1 goal was discrediting Pizzagate, which we all assume is real.  Why would they conflate Pizzagate with the human trafficking story which was already discredited?  It\'s NEWSPORN.  Discredit.  Control the narrative.</p>
<p>From this article, 2 days ago:</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of allegation wouldn’t have had any power, though, if it weren’t for its antecedent, Pizzagate, and the wild story that grew out of it.</p>
<p>Pizzagate was a conspiracy theory that, boiled down, said Hillary Clinton and members of her campaign were trafficking children for sex from the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria.</p>
<p>It turns out, the pizzeria doesn’t even have a basement, as a North Carolina man found out when he showed up armed with an AR-15 to liberate the captive kids and fired a shot into the ceiling.&quot;</p>
<p>Sound familiar?  Maybe, just maybe the VOP guy is the Edgar Maddison Welch of Tuscon.  Maybe Craig got in for a close look and backed off?  Not everything is what it seems.  You cannot always decide true/false in a matter of days.  Long game.  Not internet time.  The eye-in-the-sky could have been watching the entire time and these do-gooder dufus walked stumbled across this during surveillance.  Lots of things happen.</p>
<p>&quot;..the Justice Department has been quietly arresting thousands of pedophiles under Trump’s tenure.</p>
<p>Craig Sawyer has been a believer in Q Anon and he played a role in supporting Lewis Arthur’s Tucson pedophile-ring conspiracy.</p>
<p>Sawyer, a former Navy Seal, has established a group called Vets 4 Child Rescue, which purports to interrupt child trafficking, and came to Tucson after hearing about the alleged sex-trafficking site here.</p>
<p>KGUN 9 interviewed Sawyer and treated him as if he were an expert.</p>
<p>Sawyer declared himself a believer but noted that he had been misinformed — he thought children had actually been found on the site.&quot;</p>
<p>See how Gannet is conflating actors and narratives?  Discredit by weaving the narrative.  Let\'s see what happens.  At this point, anyone aligning with the viewpoint of state-controlled propaganda, in particular this article, should be suspect.</p>

            I’ve always had a weird feeling about Craig Sawyer. Like he could be another Jerome Corsi, but for Pizzagate. Especially since Infowars is going in the same direction. I finally opened my eyes when it comes to Alex Jones.

            This independent journalist is on scene.  He is posting his day with Lewis Arthur and VOP. This is a teaser showing the fully developed buildings in the wilderness with a guard tower, brightly painted kids room, solar panels, electronics room full of cds. Look at his channel to see more.

            It is also worth noting that after Spirit Cooking broke the shills on 4chan (mostly shareblue at this time) all went quiet and the rumor was they were given orders to go silent and await instructions. About 3-4 day later the pizzagate started.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spirit Cooking actually got some people to not vote for Hillary. It was obvious that they support this degenerate artist. With Pizzagate, I don't know if any voters were actually converted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course there are more important things than elections but in this case I do think Pizzagate was a way to neutralize/distract from Spirit Cooking and also it serves as kind of an "acid-test" like, XYZ person, do you believe Pizzagate is real or not? That is a way to telling whether or not someone buys into MSM.

            I wrote this elsewhere but nobody seemed to care... IMO Pizzagate was pushed by ShareBlue and other groups as a way to deflect/distract/discredit Spirit Cooking, which was plenty gross and easy to confirm, but not as shocking or upsetting as pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying pedophilia doesn't exist and all the evidence around comet ping pong paints a really gross picture. I don't know how much of it was staged and how much of it (Like JA's instagram pictures). You can't easily stage that sort of thing so my guess is that Brock who runs ShareBlue who is JA's ex boyfriend knew that JA had a "pedo" sense of humor (and may or may not be one, I dunno) and thus he was like "okay great, I'm going to pick him to be the target because I know he's smart enough to not have any real evidence"

            Meanwhile the public sees it as the "children trapped in a pizza basement" narrative.

            You are totally wrong he is the co founder, and his team found the thing, he is not off and I say fuck all the time too he works and has a great track record you do know people are fully behind him right. VOp had a huge team out there....Shillman is ignoring what was found and changing the story they have hundreds of witnesses and tons of early footage that shows the locals, the pics, the bunker, the rape trees, the knife, the hair dye etc. also they found a trafficking map and a lot hasn't hit the airwaves yet.

            This was a much more appropriately put together post on this theory than the previous post I just commented on. Mature and concisely done, although I hope not true. It's hitting the heart so  I am trying to have a faith that more positive awareness will come of this and not this theory presented, but if so, I would still hold ground and not jump of the angst cliff...

             Factually inaccurate though. And also speculation with no basis in fact. Why don't ya'll investigate something before talking about it everyone is changing their story on everything and ignoring what was found, Meyer has like a dozen people around him a whole team for the most part. their are a ton of volunteers. Did you even watch the early videos? Man, You can't deal with dense people.

             That is absurd, Are you shills? No facts presented, none whatsoever relevant to the evidence. Shillman already scrubbed his first vid where he said 3rd party admitted the cops never came out he was way after the initial discovery and the meeting took place not at a site but gas station too bad its archived and saved and the Hagmann vid is still up. He is lying claiming VOP called him...not true. Also he called the FBI why did he call the FBI? why hasn't he mentioned any of the evidence other than the bunker? Condoms, rape trees, DARK hair dye, bloody childrens clothes, human trafficking map, docs, comb with blonde hair.  Oh yea and Tranny Cowboy hat guy on video admitting he built it then denying it and firing warning / marker shots witnesses everywhere.

                 Yea keep at it, I background checked this guy days ago I watched as many vids and saw the spergy crap that shill video had concerning the supplies and fight, go smear people's character somewhere else. Did your precious saintly FBI and police arrest Meyer? No i find it funny your type are using "radicals" aka FBI agents like Santelli and his ilk to smear gandhi types that UNARMED ANTI VIOLENCE and have good motives. You support violent assaults on fat do gooder civilians like Jeff Kagan, why don't you attack him common asshole. Show your colors, even the daily "Kos" reported the incident to attack the Bundys who were in the right. BTW Meyer stayed after going up there with a group talked with the cops etc. supporting the Bundy fight but advocating peace..."oh dear lord the horror" Smearing him as crisis actor Welch, and that faked stunt. You are really on my nerves you know that? Everything you say makes no SENSE and is entirely contradictory.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Welch "violent gunman"
Meyer "Unarmed peace advocate"
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bundy Ranch FBI plants starting crap and tha dude lying about being a "Ranger"(was a vet had ptsd though Ryan whatever his name) and Santelli's crew...wow
                </p>
                <p>
                 BTW his "record" isn't his its other same named people its called bleed over, check SSN, and addresses, age, and arrest photos....OH THATS RIGHT YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm sick of people mouthing off, knowing nothing.

                 Snopes, MSM, Infowars, "Open Secrets"-Zionist operations etc. All attacking JUST LIKE MCMARTIN, FINDERS, PRESIDIO, AND PIZZAGATE...

                  I agree. The Bundly's got a raw deal. I have written reams of paragragraphs in support of the Bundy family.

                  I believe Meyer has helped a lot of people and will probably help more people. I also believe he is full of shit, unhinged, and probably still doing drugs.

              You bit the Q bait hook line and sinker. Considering this you cannot be taken seriously. I will read your post and see what it says. But from now on anything with "Q Shit Anon" gets my down vote.

              I have been warning people about the unhinged leader of Veterans On Patrol. He is as destructive as QAnon to our cause. He did exactly in this situation what he did the last two times he climbed a tower and dared the cops to "come and get him." He discredited our cause. Him and Q both have to be flushed out, AND MAINLY, we can't embrace these people in the future because more of them will be sent our way. I'm tired of you gullible mother fuckers creating confusion.

                 QAnon wasn't the point of the article.  The controlled narrative using Pizzagate as a discreditor, and tie it in with QAnon, Tuscon, etc.  If anything, the article SUPPORTS your position in some regards.  But alas, you didn't read it.

                  I said "pizzagate has been real for thousands of years." Are you deaf or playing biatch games? Pizzagate was real before the term "pizzagate" was even coined. Basically its called "organized and institutionalized child rape." Are you deaf or just a little man child?

                    The problem with "Q" is that there is no intel agent named Q. Its a bunch of larpers and the control changes hands every couple of months and the content shows that. The first couple of Q fakers were actually sort of interesting and led to a few interesting things. The new controllers of Q were more interested in making money and it all crashed.

                      The measure of a man's character is not what he does right, or how he acts when things are going great, but how he deals with his mistakes. Food for thought.

                        Your Q branded thread went over like a shit pile of bricks. Pull head from ass, look around, find mirror, look at self, correct errors. Right now you are just an arrogant mother fucker making himself look bad. Is that who you want to be?

                            In order for you to become what you think you are, you would first have to have what is known as an "ego death" and its more painful than battery acid. I went through it.

                            Its obvious to me that you are not there and probably never will be. An ego death is not for the faint of heart, and most people don't understand what that means, and never will.

                            That ego is eating your ass alive. This Monkey is the ego and it enslaves most people. In order for you to become this bad dog, which is what you want to be, you have to get rid of that Monkey on your back. The ego thinks its hot shit, and its nothing.

                             I lost most of my ego a long time ago.  I'm stuck in a bizarre confluence of life circumstances which puts me in a very, unique position vis a vis Pizzagate/Deep State, which you will never remotely understand from a front row seat POV.

                             If I suffered from an over-inflated ego, I would be arguing my position.  Which I am not.  I have no need to defend my position, or defend myself to you.  Your concern-trolling is weak, at best.

                              I spent 7 years fighting to stay alive from this pizzagate shit. I was doing this before the word Pizzagate was even born. There ain't much you can tell me about this shit that I don't already know. I had to stop because I had three surgeries from this shit.

                                 You conveniently ignored #1.  Would you like to show me how smart you are about whipping up wildcat handloads for the .44 Mag?  Or how about optimizing terminal ballistics in .308 optimized for free floating barrels?  And I'm positive you can give me some pointers on the best maintenance regimens on high power precision rifles. Come on....out with the knowledge Mr. Knowitall.

                You inflicted this community with Q Stupidity and now you have to live with the results of your actions. You were a big Q Supporter and now that mustache lost its flavor right? I hope you learned something. If you want to be of value to the community you need to use better discernment, and most of all, let it be known when you realize that you got spoofed into a fake situation. People will respect you for that, and right now, hmmmmmmmmm

               I grew up with wild pigs. The whole southern United States is full of wild pigs. They stink, they are mean, they tear up land and property, they can kill you if they want to, they will eat damn near anything, and they taste pretty good.

                 “Obviously, Tucson is a desert. We don’t have a lot of shade, so these kinds of camps are very common,” a police spokesman said, explaining the underground portion of the encampment. As for the straps, the spokesman said: “We see those in every homeless camp we encounter. They look the same as other straps that were holding up parts of the structure.”

                 Laurie Mazerbo, chief program office of Our Family Services, a nonprofit that helps homeless families and the victims of human trafficking in the Tucson area, said that the encampment “looked a lot like any other camp we see in our desert” for homeless people trying to escape the heat.

He announced via Facebook Live on June 2, three days into the child sex-trafficking panic: “At 1900 hours Veterans on Patrol is trespassing the United States federal government from the property that the Cemex Corporation has handed over to the cartels.”

             Well, child trafficking is real in the area. Also the rape of women and children who pay coyotes to get them across the border.

             If these news outlets would be legit, they would write that it couldn't be substantiated that the actual camp served these purposes, but take the opportunity to publish articles about the human trafficking and child rape problem.

              Back in the days of the Wild West when people were traveling from East to West everybody used the same trails. Good guys, bad guys, families, etc...
             </p>
             <p>
              I see this situation much the same. I would imagine that cartel dope runners, innocent families, child traffickers, all using the same trails and waypoints to some degree. They get mixed in with each other and bad things happen.

            The Deep State propaganda arm is reinforcing that Pizzagate is a CONSPIRACY THEORY.  Imprinting.  Repetition.  Refreshing.  Convince the masses it isn't true.**
