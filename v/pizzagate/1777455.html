<p>From Becki on YouTube:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On March 25, a rally was held in DC on behalf of the children being trafficked. I would have loved to have been there however there were complications with my ID and travel. Its just what happens when you\'re in immigration proceedings.</p>
<p>Howard very kindly agreed to read the speech I prepared on my behalf. After he agreed, he told me that he did not like to speak publicly. I have so much respect for this man because he always puts others before himself, especially when it comes to the safety of children.</p>

<p>Becki goes into detail here about her experiences, and what it\'s like when these children grow up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Becki responds to the recent claimed from the alt community that pizzagate has been debunked. As a survivor of ritual satanic sex abuse from early childhood into her teens, Becki is heartbroken about the community turning its back on the children. Only someone who hasn\'t experienced what they go through could do that, she explains.</p>
<p>She talks about what it\'s like to be a survivor, the sleepless nights, the nightmares, depression. She talks about what children involved in these sex abuse rings go through, how she was picked up after school on a Friday, and taken to &quot;a house&quot;, where she was abused &quot;without a break&quot; until Sunday. The children don\'t know this whole time whether they would leave intact, or in a body bag. She says she felt she deserved it due to the fact that she witnessed her parents hurting other children, yet she did nothing to stop them. She talks about not feeling bad for herself, but for the other children. So she would beg the adults not to hurt them, she would offer herself instead, as a bargaining chip to save the others form being hurt. She said they could do whatever they wanted to her. And they did.</p>
<p>Becki says that people want to focus on Clinton and Podesta, but not the children, they don\'t want to hear what the children go through, how they cope when they grow up, what life is like for them.</p>
