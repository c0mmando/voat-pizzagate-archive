<blockquote>
<p>After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Hawn says she set up the Hawn Foundation to help children be more resilient and deal with a changed future.</p>
<p><strong>“Some of them will be the leaders of our country, that’s why I created the foundation</strong>,” she says. “I would say for the love of children.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>That\'s a bit worrying, don\'t you think?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>She wrote a curriculum called the MindUp Program, which was published by Scholastic, and has been in use in the U.S. since 2003 as well as in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Serbia and Mexico.</strong> There are 1 million children in the program. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seriously?  I\'d love to check out her academic credentials.</em></p>

<p><strong>Based on the pillars of neuroscience, awareness, positive psychology and social-emotional learning, the program also encompasses lessons for administrators, teachers, parents and therapists.</strong> </p>

             It's more advantageous to stay together and to present a pseudo"family image" especially when it's necessary to sell a project. Like the majority of Hollywood couples they have an open marriage.

              Exactly.  I wonder if they have taken this to the disgusting level instead of trying to help kids, they are making money from it by having sold out.  We know there is no way Kurt could have escaped the clutches of Walt Disney.  There is a book that tells about how he was really into Bobby Driscoll when he was young and then lost interest in him and he did not get any more jobs after that.  He was in Song of the South and the voice of Peter Pan.  There was someone in the book that said they were paid $100 to have sex with Walt and that he had an apt. just to go there with rent boys.  So maybe Kurt went there too with Disney.  I can't wait til that place is taken down.  We need to work towards that.

               In April 2007 on the Jimmy Kimmel Live talk show, actor Kurt Russell, who was promoting his new film Death Proof, confirmed that the last words Walt Disney wrote before he died were “Kurt Russell.”
              </p>
              <p>
               I wonder how many Disney fans know that Kurt’s brother, Bryan, who was about a year older also acted in Disney films. Both were in their early teens and each stood 5-foot-1 and weighed 95 pounds. They sometimes auditioned for the same projects. Bryan was a Disney contract player appearing in The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin, Emil and the Detectives, Babes in Toyland and Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar

                Oh My God!  I had forgotten that.  I find it amazing that he divulged that on Live TV.  I am sure Kimmel enjoyed hearing that.  I can't stand Kimmel.  I shudder to think why those were his last words.  When I was young I imagined that Walt was such a wonderful Grandfatherly Type.  Little did I know that some day I would come to hate him and wish for his disgusting deeds to be told to all that held him so high.  Disgusting Scumbag.
