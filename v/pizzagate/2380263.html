            Don Miller, as per the article, was a collector of artifacts and involved in Haiti Outreach Organization.

            Haiti Outreach apparently is tied in a shipping container company [Container 2 Clinics/ C2C], which loops back to Alefantis. Shipping Containers used in Haiti for Maternal / Child Organization linked to Alefantis

            Can the community dig into this connection again? Don Miller was raided by the FBI a year ago and has recently died. I wonder what the raid was all about? Indiana man who was focus of FBI artifact raid dies at 91

             Indiana's controversial collector, Don Miller, dies
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Others will note his philanthropy, demonstrated during numerous trips to Haiti and work as a financier on local development projects.
            </p>
            <p>
             But many more will remember him for his artifacts. After all, it was Miller's antiquities collection, nearly unfathomable in size, that catapulted him to notoriety and created the controversy that would dog him through the last year of his life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Miller, 91, died Sunday, nearly a year after federal agents surrounded his rural Rush County home and began removing thousands of exotic artifacts as television helicopters hovered overhead. Officials at the time cited a desire to catalog the pieces and return them to their countries of origin.

             That is not a shipping container company.   It's a charity that operates three health care clinics in Haiti.  They are now called Care 2 Communities.
             <a href="https://care2communities.org/our-work/clinics/">
              https://care2communities.org/our-work/clinics/

            </p>
            <p>
             And this organization was never connected to Alefantis.   The woman who started this organization was a college acquaintance/friend of someone who sometime after college opened a restaurant where Alefantis later worked.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's it.   That's the whole connection.  There's no indication this woman even knows Alefantis.

            <p>
             The raid was about whether he acquired his artifact illegally.  Google "illegal artifact trade" you'll see there's a lot of laws about removing cultural artifacts from their country of origin.

             There is a Shipping Co.  on the pier/docks of Port au Prince that I discovered maybe 8 mos. ago.  It was so much research and I could not get enough help, but I really think they were a perfect set up.  They had cold storage and a Fed Ex connection there as well.  Plus for some reason they also rented out little places nearby.  Perfect for a horrid set up between sicko and victim.  These places are easy to find, but hard to research.

              Hard to research -- my thought as well.
I just simply don't have time. Work 12hr/day, newborn at home, and homework ----- I can't be the researcher for this one but I can point interested researchers in the direction of a funny smell.

               You sure do have your hands full!  Thank you for what you can do.  Everyone gives what they can.  It is all appreciated.  Remember that the little one you will be raising will be Red Pilled.  She/He will start out with what we are now only learning.  I have read recently that many are deciding not to have children, to not bring them into this present world.  We need them.  We need to have a new future of already Red Pilled children.  They are hoping we will start pulling back, not procreating.  We will only be doing their work for them.  So, hopefully people will pile on and help out.  Thank you for opening the door.
