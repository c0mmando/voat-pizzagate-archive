<p>The first connection found was a corporation called <strong>Seven Seven Wholesale Inc</strong> registered to the 1307 4th St address of the warehouse property in which the Finders document describes a search yielding a sauna, hot tubs, lots of “computer goods” , lit staged rooms, a theater, and a library containing books on “mind control”, as well as a Satellite dish on the roof. The date of the warranted search, according to the FBI file is FEB 5-6 1987. (pg 237)</p>
<p>Seven Seven was founded in 1986! So unless they were founded at a different address, and just later moved to 1307, they are a finders FRONT. </p>

<p>Their website : www.77wholesale.com takes you <strong>to a completely blank page</strong>, but the site is not down. Anyone ever see this before? Could it be encrypted or cloaked and still operating? </p>
<p>I also remember J Epstein being associated with some Jewelry Business LLCs. They\'re probably a good front as they deal with high values and un-trackable items.

              I found an interview with Marion and I hope it helps. She mentions lots of Intel going through her compound and another Compound called Free State. She goes on and drops interesting names.

             Incredible work. Boys organizations seem to be a trend here.
            </p>
            <p>
             From the church located at 1525 Newton St Nw, Washington, DC 20010:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              St. Stephens &amp; The Incarnation Church in the 60's and early 70's held
              <strong>
               Boys Club #10 on the top floor. It was run by DC Metropolitan Police. The top floor held pool tables, ping pong tables, an activity room and office for staff
              </strong>
              . The area where the stage is now was also used as a half court basketball court. The basket hoop was at the opposite end of the stage. Rev. William Wendt opened the church to everybody who came; hippies who needed a place to stay and sleep

            Ok so what I know is the owner of the where-house is a wealthy Jew with direct connections to the military industrial complex. I suspect ownership of this building has changed ownership on paper only.

              full of school busses

             . Thought one was weird but two is sketchy. What are you using the busses for? It would suggest a large operation...

               Me neither. The site is pay for access, and I did not sign up.  I do believe the number came up from the newspaper site metadata, and that what we would find, could well be a coded add for their "services."  Really appreciate you helping me dig on this

                I will dig some more when I get home.  I recognize the wedding picture with her Dad?  I swear I have seen "that" picture a few years ago, and swamp related. The guy with glasses is a swamp creature I just can't remember where I have seen him before.

            units on that strip all have to do with importing something. The pictures of the floor plan are odd, 2 floors, 2 sets of stairs shown on second floor but 3 sets of stairs on ground level floor indicating a lower floor but none listed as part of unit. Also freight elevator, nothing seen on roof so mechanical must be under first floor.  I suspect basement is accessed from another unit.

             I think you're right. Shows stairs and a freight elevator on the first floor (going down?)... and basements (like garages) aren't considered rentable square footage so it can be omitted from RE docs.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is from the for sale brochure so would they just then build out the basement &gt; buy next door &gt; tunnel over &gt; cover entrance 1 &gt; sell building &gt; continue below and next door? Ugh...
            </p>
            <p>
             The DC House/Apartment Buildings also had plans and discrepancies regarding a basement level.

             Epstein and Wexner had a jewelry store in NYC connected to them too. Accounting-wise, like art, this would be a good cover for larger transactions, few employees, and pawned product.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the case of 77 Wholesale Inc, if you're a $.5 -1.5 M Jewelry business wouldn't you have a nice storefront, or at least jewelry in your name? Nope :  "NON-DURABLE MERCHANDISE"

            Pinging you Goats who seem knowledgeable about The Finders case, before this submission gets lost to time. I have found a whole mess of evidence surrounding their known locations- and suspicious activity which seems to continue to occur after the 86/87 investigation around them. As you can see I have tried to organize it by ADDRESS, and though it may be a painful read for someone just being introduced to the case, I figure you goats might be able to skim the info for anything notable or related to your own digging.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am starting to see connections everywhere, so I sincerely appreciate your help validating some of my suspicions. Thank you!

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             FYI
            </p>
            <p>
             St. Stephens &amp; The Incarnation Church in the 60's and early 70's held Boys Club #10 on the top floor.  It was run by DC Metropolitan Police.  The top floor held pool tables, ping pong tables, an activity room and office for staff.  The area where the stage is now was also used as a half court basketball court.  The basket hoop  was at the opposite end of the stage. Rev. William Wendt opened the church to everybody who came; hippies who needed a place to stay and sleep(basketball court and stage), people from the poor peoples march, a Troup from Lorton prison on Saturdays, migrants in DC protesting for better working conditions, etc.  It was a time whereby anyone could show up.  Rev. Wendt actually lived with his daughters on Newton St., in a house next to the church.  It was a white house with a large porch.  The area where housing  now exist was a combination of playground, full basketball court and parking on the Newton St side and parking on the Center St and Meridian Pl. side. It also had a carriage house that wasn't used and was falling apart.  Houses existed next to the apartment 1440 Meridian Pl., just before church parking. Note: Center St was open and a drive through from Meridian Pl to Newton St. back then.  Lived on Meridian Pl.

            <p>
             I also got to learn a little bit about the history of the church.  Including that they
             <strong>
              had involvement in a gay liturgical union back in the 1970's,
             </strong>
             a full 40 years ago.  Talk about being ahead of the curve and right on.  They have a HUGE history of community involvement in some pretty amazing ways.

            Dear Friends and Family, I am updating my facebook status- not David Pettie or Shanna Pettie, so from now on, please communicate to me as Shanna Bressan! It's a new day, it's a new dawn, it's a new life for me, and I 'm feeling good! Carlo and I celebrated our one year anniversary in December. Many changes- Carlo and I have enjoyed hiking and biking in Italian Alps, Norway, Denmark, and USA. We loved seeing family and friends and exploring beautiful mountains,forests, oceans and cities. Last summer, we hiked 400 miles and biked 400 miles. I am excited about being healthy - physically, emotionally and spiritually. We hope to travel every year. Carlo made 2 wonderful videos with music-which I will post-of my gifts and our wedding and first year of travel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Otherwise, we are based in lovely Maui. The family compound here is always evolving. Aaron experimented with permaculture in a new orchard. Katheryn and her husband now have a 2 month old baby, Luke, and are building a tiny house on the land here in Maui. Katheryn, Aaron, Andrea, Gordon and Mom are all getting healthier and more fit on every level every day.

            The (two) Residential Properties at the end of the block back up to a large forested Whitehaven Park. From recent GPS sat maps it seems there is a community garden behind the units, reminding one of the Mothers pushing healthy eating habits, and the raw fruits and vegetables the children claimed to be surviving off. Whitehaven is attached to Glover Archbold Park making up quite a large swath of open forest land miles of hiking routs including Glover Archbold Trail. The park borders Georgetown University, Guy Mason Recreation Center and contains tunnels that lead to the Canal towpath.

             On Dec. 15, a D.C. police detective observed a clearing in the rear of the 3900 block of W Street NW where "several round stones had been gathered" near a circle, as well as evidence that people had gathered there, according to the document, which stated that "this practice is sometimes used in satanic rituals." Armed with that information and the report from Tallahassee police of the allegedly abused children, D.C. police sought search warrants for the Glover Park residence and the warehouse.

            RECENT PLAN CHECK for PROPOSED ADDITION OF A CELLAR/ BASEMENT
            <strong>
             April,2,2014
            </strong>
            :
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked for recent activity and found a Plan check document for the renovation and building of a CELLAR/BASEMENT Level. Besides the obvious suspect nature of a basement unit, they have two Unit 7s which are the same square footage but on different floors. Perhaps they wished to make one of these units disappear off the records.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The building itself actually has some grisly history dating back to the 1980s, when members of an obscure cult called the "Finders" allegedly used it and the adjoining unit to the west as a site for "brainwashing" rituals, according to a 1987 Washington Post article about the arrest of two of the alleged cult members. Others, like a college professor who briefly lived at the house, according to the Post piece, said the residents were "a close-knit group" of feminists who were discriminated against because of "their life style."
            </p>
            <p>
             The rear of the property is bordered by Whitehaven Parkway, “offering a view that is hard to come across in the city,” she said. The building is located near Wisconsin Avenue and one block from a Metrobus stop.

             Seventy miles south of Washington, DC, is the town of Culpeper, Virginia, a pretty little burg of 10,000 with views of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The solid, red-brick corner house at 409 Macoy Avenue seems transplanted from another planet.

             Pettie, 42, is launching a unique clubhouse--she calls it a social laboratory--for freethinkers. After she gives you the grand tour, curled up over steaming cups of tea in the cozy Biographies section, you ask her to clarify.

             "It's a global, live-in or live-out, mutual aid society for experimenting with how to live well in a godless world." Sounds good. Who's invited? She rattles off: "Skeptics, free inquirers, perspectivists, agnostics, Franklinites, infidels, eupraxsophists, sinners, secularists, postconventionals, and other persons with a good sense of humor--a/k/a perspective."
