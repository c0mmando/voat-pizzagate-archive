            It doesn't look to me that this is directly PG related? asking because of possibility of including this in TIMELINE OF PIZZAGATE RELATED CENSORSHIP

             I was the biggest skeptic of him, and he still is too suspect to me.  But he might be realizing he could be censored too eventually.

            Alex Jones still pisses me off. His coverage of the pizzagate suspicions was extremely weak, and then he sensationalized the hell out of it, added in a bunch of BS and made the whole investigation look bad. When skeptics attack pizzagate, they are going to be attacking people like him because he sets himself up as an easy target to refute. He's been doing that with other conspiracy theories for years. Half-truth and half BS mixed with hysterical meltdowns. InfoWards as a whole this past year also completely sold out when it came to the higher notion of not falling for divide and conquer, instead they have been milking it for all it's worth. I think Colbert is a douche, but I don't need some controlled opposition piece to tell me that.
