They review Comet Ping Pong &amp; Pizza, fair enough--they\'re a pizza restaurant being reviewed in the pizza review section of a pizza-related website.  On that section of the page: <a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/best-pizza-in-dc-2017">https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/best-pizza-in-dc-2017</a>, they review many DC pizza restaurants; however, there is a cartoon graphic before their Comet Pizza review &lt;reviewhttp://brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Internet-Pizza.gif&gt;, so I thought I\'d research which other restaurants had graphics before their reviews.<br />
    The first pizza restaurant review with a graphic preceding it (after Comet) that I came to on BrightestYoungThings.com was Menomale Pizza.  Here is the graphic: <a href="http://brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tumblr_lzphbt6hIo1qcr7fqo1_500.gif">http://brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tumblr_lzphbt6hIo1qcr7fqo1_500.gif</a>.  As you can see here, the logo for Manomale (or Man on Male?) pizza is this: <a href="http://menomale.us/wp-content/uploads/meno-newlogo-1.png">http://menomale.us/wp-content/uploads/meno-newlogo-1.png</a>.  Here is their website address: <a href="http://menomale.us/wp-content/uploads/meno-newlogo-1.png.">http://menomale.us/wp-content/uploads/meno-newlogo-1.png.</a>.<br />
    What are the odds, that of 27 restaurants reviewed, the 1st one preceded by a cartoon graphic of kids playing with pizza is Comet Pizza, so, looking for a pattern, I check the next DC pizzeria reviewed by brightestYOUNGthings.com restaurant, whose review is preceded by a cartoon graphic (incidentally, of kids playing with pizza), and that &quot;pizzeria&quot; has an FBI known pedophile symbol as their logo?  Look again: <a href="http://menomale.us/">http://menomale.us/</a>.  This isn\'t damning, but fuck an aye, I think this is a bread crumb worth following.
    The 3rd restaurant who\'s review is preceded by a cartoon, pizza-related icon is: <a href="http://www.wiseguynypizza.com/">http://www.wiseguynypizza.com/</a>. Here is the cartoon  &quot;pizza time&quot; icon: <a href="http://brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/orig-20114131.gif">http://brightestyoungthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/orig-20114131.gif</a>.  I haven\'t looked into this site, beyond watching intro clips where they draw a pedo symbol in pzza sauce, (could be nothing).  Anyway, the cartoon graphics only single out 3 restaurants here that should be investigated.<br />
     Finally and again, here\'s the original pizza review from BYThings article to check for yourselves <a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/best-pizza-in-dc-2017">https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/best-pizza-in-dc-2017</a>.

            So you're saying the logo for 2 separate or connected restaurants both use pedo-logos? I guess you are. Does that mean these people associated with these sites are engaging in pedophilic practices, not at all. But there are essentially 3 pedo "map legends" in the FBI file-a heart w/i a heart, a spiral'd triangle and a "comic sans" spiral.  3 symbols total  that we can legitimately confirm are associated with pedo trafficking and they happen to come up.  So strange.

            Why do all these restaurants have online stores? I had never seen this before this investigation. Could they be selling something else?

            What is with all these Pizza places being all Pedophile?  Is it money laundering from their child trafficking?  Is it they have to give these Satanist Pedo fucks day jobs, that they have to be seen doing something other than sitting around waiting to kill another kid?  Is it that Pizza places are sooooo numerous that you can just open one and slap a pedo symbol out front and your in business?  No one pays attention to Pizza places just to many of them out there?  Is it that seeing kids around a pizza place would not be out of the ordinary?  Is it that they are just lazy as hell and when one person came up with the idea and it worked all the Pedoś wanted their own Pizza joint?

             Nice work, it looks like the merger of a pedo-swirl and a baby....or a swirled turtle if I'm being objective.  But where there's smoke there seems to be fire in this pedo-gate business.

            Fair enough. Thanks for your take.  I'm an attorney and they teach us the best way to come to the truth is for one person to argue that something's true and for another to argue that it is not. Maybe a hacker smarter than me will find something more than circumstantial evidence....if I can even call it that at this point.

            I know what you mean, I could care less about what the gif's were, I would've left them out, but I tagged them for context.  But if you go to the restaurant review list on brightestYoungThings.com (BYE), those lame pizza cartoons are, in my opinion, "sign posts" to signal those restaurants that are pedo fronts.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't scour the internet for FBI pedo symbols, I saw the cartoon gif in front of Comet's review on BYE's site, looked at other reviews w/ cartoons before their reviews and the NEXT one had one of the four FBI pedo symbols, that I was looking for, on its homepage.
            <br/>
            It's almost so obvious it's like a psy-op bunch of bullshit. Because at this point in history, I can't imagine a DC pizza restaurant that would be stupid enough to keep their logo anywhere near a pedo-symbol, given the strength of this movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is all speculation, but it struck me as a strange coincidence...As a matter of fact, one could look into the other 24 pizzerias that weren't preceded by a cartoon pizza .gif and let us know if there's one of the 4 FBI pedo symbols on their homepages.That would be fascinating to know.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I'm wrong, call me a horse's ass, but I'd bet you won't find pedo symbols on the homepages of any of the other 24 sites reviewed in the above mentioned page's article on BYE, beyond the three I've named, whose reviews are preceded by cartoon pizza gifs. 
If I'm proved wrong, good--that probably means less suffering kids. God bless.
