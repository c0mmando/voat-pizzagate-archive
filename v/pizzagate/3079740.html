<p><strong>Store\'s \'family-friendly\' status is being seriously called into question</strong></p>
<p>DETROIT (ChurchMilitant.com) - Despite selling itself as a family-friendly business, Walmart is now selling statues of Baphomet, a satanic idol.</p>
<p>Walmart\'s corporate mission promises &quot;to save people money so they can live better.&quot; This claim reflects the ideals of Sam Walton, the company\'s founder and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, who wanted to &quot;give the world an opportunity to see what it\'s like to save and have a better life.&quot;</p>
<p>But the store\'s &quot;family-friendly&quot; reputation is being called into question lately by its line of satanic products, including statues of Baphomet, &quot;Church of Satan&quot; goblets, Baphomet pendants, pentagrams, pillows and clothing with satanic insignia, cards, posters and many other items that normalize satanism and include among their selling points &quot;Used by modern-day Satanists.&quot;</p>
<p>Satanic Products <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search/?query=baphomet">https://www.walmart.com/search/?query=baphomet</a></p>
<p>It\'s unclear how long Walmart has been selling satanic items. Walmart\'s reputation has recently taken a hit, the store slammed by pro-family activists last week after Walmart aired a pro-gay ad featuring two homosexuals on a blind date. </p>
<p>In Episode Two of a video campaign titled &quot;Love is in the aisle: A dating show at Walmart,&quot; Andy and Pat, two gay characters, meet at Walmart for a blind date. They shop for scented candles and cast iron pans, tell each other mediocre jokes and appear blithe and harmless. </p>
<p>The American Family Association (AFA), whose mission is &quot;to strengthen the moral foundations of American culture,&quot; expressed surprise that Walmart would promote the campaign: &quot;In a move that most Christians probably never expected to see, retail giant Walmart has posted an online video that normalizes homosexual relationships.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At least with a company like Amazon, we knew they were liberal from the outset,&quot; AFA continued. &quot;But this seems more like a betrayal from a well-known friend. Sam Walton is probably turning over in his grave.&quot;</p>
<p>The AFA has taken action to oppose Walmart\'s promotion of the LGBT agenda by creating a petition urging the store to remain neutral on controversial issues. The petition, addressed to Walmart President Doug McMillon, can be signed here.</p>
<p>Baphomet is a demonic symbol that was adopted by Aleister Crowley, an English occultist, and Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan. It\'s often used by satanists to represent their beliefs. In 2015, The Satanic Temple unveiled a giant Baphomet statue in downtown Detroit in an event billed as the &quot;largest public satanic ceremony in history.&quot; At the moment of unveiling, two homosexual men dressed in leather lewdly kissed in front of the statue, and other sexual activities took place on the lap of the horned statue.</p>
<p>The Devil In Detroit Video  <a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/the-devil-in-detroit">https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/the-devil-in-detroit</a></p>
<p>The Baphomet model sold by Walmart is priced at $31.24 for the 10-inch version, and $449.99 for the 3-foot version.</p>
<p>The product description reads:</p>
<pre><code>This Oversized Baphomet Statue stands at 35&quot; tall, 17&quot; long and 13.5&quot; deep approximately.This Oversized Baphomet Statue is made of designer composite resin and crushed stone, hand painted and polished individually. Designed by Maxine Miller, this statue weighs about 35 lbs. Baphomet contains binary elements symbolizing a reconciliation of opposites, emblematic of the willingness to embrace, and even celebrate differences across individuals. This Baphomet statue boasts of immaculate details from the throne of Earth\'s Geographical Globe the statue rests on, the writings of Solve Et Coagula carved onto the hands, intricate details of the angelic wings and many other features that complete this statue. This Baphomet statue is sculpted in oversized proportions.
</code></pre>

<p>Solve et coagula (&quot;dissolve and coagulate&quot;) is a Latin phrase associated with medieval alchemy, but today denotes occult practice and ritual.</p>
<p>Walmart itself links Baphomet to the Church of Satan in its product description: &quot;Baphomet has been connected with Satanism ... primarily due to the adoption of it as a symbol by the Church of Satan.&quot;</p>
<p>Walmart adds a disclaimer: &quot;We aim to show you accurate product information. Manufacturers, suppliers and others provide what you see here, and we have not verified it.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Walmart\'s website, &quot;Strategic decisions in the business are a direct manifestation of [our] mission statement.&quot; </p>
<p>Members of The Satanic Temple, self-described &quot;Civic-minded Satanists,&quot; argue for &quot;religious reproductive rights,&quot; code word for abortion. Their protests of pro-life rallies outside Planned Parenthood clinics can take bizarre forms, e.g., multiple protests in Detroit involving unclothed men in diapers and S&amp;M gear wearing baby masks gyrating, pouring milk on themselves, or self-flagellating, in what they call &quot;radical political dramas&quot; to protest the &quot;absurdity&quot; of the pro-life position. Other Detroit protests have involved ritual milk baths.</p>
<p>The Satanic Temple members also promote &quot;After School Satan clubs,&quot; an extracurricular program designed to teach public school children about their beliefs. The program claims to promote &quot;free inquiry and rationalism,&quot; but critics claims it\'s merely a way for satanism to infiltrate the public schools and indoctrinate children with anti-Christian propaganda.</p>
<p>School Satan Clubs <a href="https://afterschoolsatan.com/#https://afterschoolsatan.com/">https://afterschoolsatan.com/#https://afterschoolsatan.com/</a> </p>
<p>Church Militant reached out to Walmart Corporate representatives with the following questions:</p>
<p>Why is Walmart selling this product, as it appears connected to the diabolical?</p>
<p>Would Walmart remove it from its stores?</p>
<p>How do Walmart executives reconcile Walmart\'s motto: &quot;to save and have a better life&quot; and the sale of this product? Do they think promoting Church of Satan statues will help customers have a better life?</p>
<p>What do you think Sam Walton would say about the sale of this product in his stores?</p>
<p>Walmart representatives have not responded as of press time.</p>
<p>The reaction on social media has been largely negative. </p>
<p>&quot;Now available at... WALMART?!?!?&quot; asked one Twitter user with incredulity.</p>

<p>&quot;Well when you make $25,149 per minute, nothing is sacred,&quot; another responded.</p>
<p>&quot;DO YOU MIND TELLING US WHY YOU\'RE SELLING THIS [EXPLETIVE] ON-LINE?&quot; shouted one commenter. &quot;Continue to do so and lose shoppers. THIS IS DOWNRIGHT DESPICABLE.&quot;</p>

            Remember a while back and there was a post about Sam Walton’s daughter who now runs Walmart and she had an altar in her backyard and is an occultist. The yellow line star thing that is the symbol beside the Walmart sign is the Jewish star aka the star of Saturn or Remphan. Walmart has a long history of treating its employees like shit and cutting hours back when workers get close to getting benefit entitlements. Avoid this store as much as possible.

             My oldest had a job in electronics. Part time as he was going to collage. I get a call from a manager. He is attempting to call him into work. I am a contact if he doest answer his phone. I tell him he is in class and wont be able to. Dude tells me he would still like to talk with my kid. My kid quit the next day. My reply back at him was a bit vulgar. Fuck Walmart. That symbol in the logo is a puckered asshole. Prove me wrong.

             I went there once even though I swore I wouldn't.  My Mother wanted a gift card for her Birthday.  Who turns down their Mother?  What a mistake.  It was a zoo of weird strange animals and they screwed up the gift card.  I told my Mother I was not ever returning and I have kept my promise.  I hate that place.  My husband (who as you know recently passed away) and I gave up some things so we wouldn't have to stoop to ordering from places like Walmart and Amazon  We are promoters of fair pay and benefits for our people.  Yes now I do remember the altar.  I shudder to think what she puts on it.  Horrors.

              They can post whatever they want. It's like amazon's third party retailers, nobody screens the items before they get listed

               I don’t know about Walmart, maybe you do but you’re dead wrong regarding Amazon. I know this first hand. Everything gets screened but if you’re companies AI algorithm is not set to detect certain keywords then they do slip through.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let’s say it’s an innocent coding deficiency, matter of adding keywords like “occultism” to its source code in order to flag the items for human review. If so then one expects them to either remove the offending items or put out a statement and basically tell everyone “we don’t give a f as long the money comes in”. I’d be interested to know what would happen to their customer base which are predominantly Christians.
              </p>
              <p>
               Walmart is not doing anything criminal, nobody says that. But here on pizzagate sub we concentrate on SRA and satanism is directly tied in. So if a gigantic retailer starts selling items from the satanic church then that’s a red flag for us.
              </p>
              <p>
               I’m not sure why this is offending you.

                   Seeking attention? 😳 Butthurt? 🤣 it’s an open forum, you stated BS publicly, regarding Amazon screening items and I called you out. Interestingly you have not once responded to my post at all. You just took the “offending” part and you keep going. Typical shilling. I get it man, we all have to do what we have to do. Have a good day.

                Explaining how it works isn't an excuse, get your head out of your ass. If you don't like it then complain to walmart customer service and maybe they'll take it down.
