            This one submission, along with it's comments and links. has more exposure of these issues than Msm in a month it seems. I appreciate the efforts and concern of all here and condemn those who are supposed to be doing this.

             Thanks!  I'm so sick of knowing how much info the MSM covers up through distraction and omission.  They're no better than a reality show at this point.  I'm working a new sub:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/QRSP">
              QRSP
             </a>
             , as a research site for Qdrop related info as well as linking in really detailed info like what's found here on this thread.  It gives a good picture of how deep and wide this crap is for someone who had not been following the PG sub.  ALOT of good work there.  The key is to make it more accessible in one spot, that's why I consider the QRSP site to be more of a 'satellite site' or resource for all Qfollowers and Qrelated boards, (as well as the PG site, though I had not explicitly included that aspect in the description) rather than a discussion site (we have good discussion sites already).
            </p>
            <p>
             I was waiting to get more info put into it before really making posts announcing it.  Anyone who finds great links for me, I welcome them to post them on the site just so I can include them into the system of indexes.

             Setting aside the disclaimer about the good people doing good things among the often cited 'few bad apples' argument, the truth is the world of international charitable foundations has had it's ugly corrupted side exposed over the years. Sex trafficking is one aspect, child sex tourism is another, as is money laundering and meddling in politics.  I haven't researched Live Aid and We are The World.  As far as I recall, back then people didn't discuss organ harvesting, child sex tourism, human slave trafficking... look how far we've come.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Bob Geldof was, in a sense, the pioneer of a new breed of celebrity “missionaries” with his efforts to end the Ethiopian famine. Yet, as American journalist David Rieff has noted, Live Aid’s donations to NGOs such as Oxfam and Save the Children also facilitated the displacement of 600,000 people by the autocratic Mengistu regime, resulting in an estimated 100,000 deaths.
             </p>
             <p>
              Three decades after Live Aid, it is clear that celebrity efforts to “save Africa” have often done more to reinforce negative media stereotypes about the “dark continent” and to portray its one billion citizens as helpless victims in a new “white man’s burden”. The Economist, for example, depicted Africa as a “hopeless continent” in 2000, with its then Africa editor, Richard Dowden, penning an equally prejudiced cover story.
             </p>
             <p>
              Often naive celebrities have burnished their own reputations as new missionaries of a troubled age: Geldof and Bono are seeking to “end poverty”, George Clooney is “saving” Darfur, Madonna has adopted children in Malawi as if buying new pets, while Prince Harry is on his way to Namibia to “save” the black rhino.
             </p>
             <p>
              This cult of celebrity has often led to a dangerous dumbing down of serious issues, brushing aside other innovative and resilient grassroots efforts.

             Thee also was a dead baby found in one of the girl's gym or duffel bag.   They tried to keep it quiet.  The girl was taken to the hospital.  Very secretive about this.

             Oprah Winfrey's school for girls in South Africa is being rocked by a fresh scandal as police investigate the body of a newborn found in one of the student's bags, police said today.
            </p>
            <p>
             The baby's body was found last Wednesday in a bag the 17-year-old girl brought to a hospital where she was being treated for excessive bleeding, police Lt. Col. Lungelo Dlamini told ABC News in a statement.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is believed that the girl, who has not been identified, gave birth at her school, the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, which is located outside Johannesburg.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wonder how that happened?  Hmm.  At Oprah's Refined School for Girls.
