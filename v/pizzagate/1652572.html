He sounds like he really knows what he\'s talking about, and sounds like he has had a lot of support from the tech sector in creating his software, Thorn Spotlight (He describes it as a neural-network software designed to locate kids gone missing or being found on the Dark Web). As a side note, neural-networks are how Google\'s AlphaGo program works, that beat one of the world\'s leading Go players. It\'s actually one way that researchers have been attempting to produce good artificial intelligence (AI). But I digress. </p>
<p>I\'m making this post because of something interesting that caught my eye. At minute 10:05 of the video, he makes great praise of John McCain, saying that McCain provided a lot of support. Since my few months here on Voat, I remembered seeing some posts on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> that talked about McCain might be tied to the Clinton Foundation and Soros, such as <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1568686">this post here</a>. </p>
<p>I guess how this ties to pizzagate is due to how people have been accusing McCain of possibly being tied to pizzagate. From the video, Ashton Kutcher seems to know a lot about how things work, from children being abused and trafficked from foster care, to how software is developed and supported (can confirm, am a software developer). To me, he seems really genuine.</p>
<p>So that begs the question, how deeply tied was John McCain to the founding of Kutcher\'s company and his software? If he was heavily tied, does that exonerate McCain, or does that condemn Kutcher? (And after watching the video, it\'s hard for me to believe Kutcher is developing software for the bad guys intentionally). Maybe McCain did it to keep a &quot;good boy&quot; image to support an endeavor that fights trafficking, not knowing it would yield any fruits because he was thinking, &quot;come on, it\'s Ashton Kutcher&quot;? </p>
<p>Just wanted the community\'s input on this as well as bringing Ashton Kutcher\'s endeavors to the spotlight.</p>',

            McCain's wife is well known as a pill popper... lots of mental problems etc... she also runs one of the largest child trafficking charities of the southwest. Look into her organization:
            <a href="https://www.mccaininstitute.org/humanitarian-action-mission/">
             https://www.mccaininstitute.org/humanitarian-action-mission/
            </a>
            ......
            <a href="https://www.mccaininstitute.org/human-trafficking-advisory-council-highlight-cindy-mccain/">
             https://www.mccaininstitute.org/human-trafficking-advisory-council-highlight-cindy-mccain/
            </a>
            Why are all these politicians involved in these trafficking organizations... I almost feel it's a trap, if someone stumbles across trafficking and they report it to these organizations, instead of helping the child they take out the person who found out the truth? Blackmail them? Nothing isn't right here....

            So Ashton Kutcher is a baby fucker? Noted. Come on guys. What have we learned about pizzagate? If someone puts on that they are helping children, they usually are abusing them. Remember Laura Silsby?

            His Butterfly Effect movie is creeptown central. A video game called Life is Strange was made based on that movie of his, and the plot is so close to Pizzagate it's scary, and the game is rife with illuminati symbolism like the pyramid / eye.
