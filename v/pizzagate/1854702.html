            i doubt he was gonna prosecute anyone for anything, 
he was just there as a gatekeeper and for the big paycheck, same reason all of them are there,
if you wanted to have a functional system, you would never put a single guy in charge of anything

            robert, when things are true you dont usually have to spam them. I take you aren't very familiar with truth and how it works. you can't force others to accept YOUR truth and they won't unless it is a UNIVERSAL truth.... you just let it out and it takes flight.

            Comey and the FBI cannot indict. The FBI is analogous to a police department. It gathers the evidence and turns the matter over to the Dept. of Justice  which has the final say so as to which cases to pursue.  Think of the DOJ as your local prosecutor receiving the cases from the police dept. When Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton, Comey took it upon himself to exercise prosecutorial discretion that was not his to exercise. Perhaps he was justified inasmuch as Lynch had compromised herself  to the degree that a Bar complaint should have been filed and her license suspended. She should have been fired on the spot by Obama but fat chance that. Separate story. Anyway, Comey announces in effect what his recommendation would have been on Hillary's email investigation had he been able to under normal channels. Whatever his recommendation, under normal circumstances Lynch could have followed or rejected his recommendation. Not that she wanted to prosecute Hillary.  So now we have Comey compromised as well. Hillary gets a free pass once again.

            As to Epstein, rumor has it that Epsteins dream team went fullbore defense by digging up dirt on virtually every one connected to the case and a settlement agreement was reached that swept so many matters and perps under the rug the likes of which has never been seen in American jurisprudence. This resolution was  conceived no doubt by the wily potential co- defendant Law Professor Dershowitz of Harvard (who by his own admission made the acquaintance of Epstein via Lady Rothschild btw). So the agreement is unenforceable under public policy but who is going to challenge it? Especially when amends are being made to the young ladies in civil court.
           </p>
           <p>
            At first blush it was hoped that Acosta would be compelled to reveal the Epstein shenanigans when he was being questioned for his position in Trumps cabinet. But it didn't happen. Was Trumps selection of Acosta a reward for caving in on Epstein? An insurance policy that if questioned,would guarantee that a plausible explanation would be given? Who knows. These folks protect one another, that's politics. Thats all there is folks.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can only hope that Sessions reopens the Hillary email investigation. And we can hope that the emails on Weiners lap top reveals fresh evidence re  Epstein cohorts but I'm betting nothing happens. Inertia is a very powerful force.

             IMHO not shit will happen, TRUMP has already signaled his intention, if you COVER-UP the child-fuckers you get promoted to the highest positions of USA power. Nobody in DOJ or LEO is going to go after MOSSAD child-sex slave OPS, because they know its a career ender.

             Trump's early knighting of ACOSTA for keeping his siamese twin Epstein out of jail, is tell all too all who study this shit. Not unlike Clinton Pardoning Marc-Rich, here Clinton has Pardoned EPSTEIN by promoting ACOSTA, telling all JUDGES in the USA how to play  the game under the new Trump-Rules.

             Ha Ha Ha.  This is a good one.  Comey has been beside the Clintons right from the start.  He did not question why Bill and Loretta met on the tarmac, He worked for HSBC and his brother Peter still does, that's just for starters.  Not to mention his years at Lockheed.

             Wow, show totally that Voat is owned by the Trump Mafia.

             Truth be told is that this video is 100% correct, and that Comey could very well be a good guy, and the Clinton owns' Trump and Clinton put Trump into office. Comey didn't have a clue.

             Jews own &amp; created the FBI, now they need a new Jew to run the place.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem is like the fall of the Roman Empire, the Romans got rich fucking/enslaving the 'goy', but then eventually when there was only a few rich left the rich fucked each other, which is what you have now team SOROS fucking team KOCH; Kushner declaring War on all Goyim Rich on earth ( Arab lands Oil, or minerals like North Korea )
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI was created to be a Praetorian Guard to protect the elite Jew, the FBI knows who butter's their bread.
