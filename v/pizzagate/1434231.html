<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8673">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8673</a></p>
<p>And this is the email with that attached photo of a mom and two kids eating pizza, supposedly this was soon after they were rescued from North Korea:
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Riunr">Politico says</a> Doug Band, John Podesta, and Bill Clinton went to North Korea to get back &quot;Americans Laura Ling and Euna Lee, both of former Vice President Al Gore\'s Current TV&quot;. The women had traveled to China and wound up in North Korea like you do.</p>
<p>So in this email chain is Doug Band (under two different emails?), Huma Abedin, John Podesta, whichever Podesta was at ICI, Sean Gallagher (secret service), Justin Cooper (the aide and Clinton biographer, not the child actor). And then there is Zach Schwartz of Shangrila... he\'s not even the head of Shangrila, a movie production house that doesn\'t even have a Wikipedia page, that seems to be a tiny side project of Steve Bing, a big Dem donor. So, if we want to be as postive and trusting as possible, this was some sort of Argo-style mission where they needed to fake making a movie to save some spies caught in North Korea. Or some journalists that got baited by some Chinese guides into crossing the border accidentally so they could collect something from North Korea in return if you want to be even more trusting.</p>
<p>I don\'t know, but this email chain happened in 2009 (Wikipedia says Comet Ping Pong was established 2006, so keep in mind it came before Schwartz\'s movie).</p>
<p>In 2011, Zach Schwartz produced the film A Girl Walks Into A Bar (which you can find here: <a href="http://www.56.com/u56/v_NTg4NjUwMDU.html">http://www.56.com/u56/v_NTg4NjUwMDU.html)</a>).
Steve Bing is also cited as producer on A Girl Walks Into A Bar. Another producer is billionaire Richard Rosenblatt, who made Myspace big in its best times. Schwartz is &quot;co-producer&quot;, which probably means he put in less money, but more time and effort.</p>
<p>At around 41 minutes, there\'s a scene set that shows a &quot;Pink\'s Donuts&quot; that also sells hot dogs, chili dogs, and burgers. Outside, there\'s a big line of people buying food from the front of the building. </p>
<p>Another James Alefantis restaurant, Buck\'s Fishing and Camping, right near Comet, also combines donuts with foods you would not expect them to be mixed with: oysters and steak. (<a href="https://i.sli.mg/7ofgmk.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/7ofgmk.jpg)</a>) This restaurant has been around since at least 2009 according to its website. </p>
<p>The film cuts to the inside of the donut / hotdog place, where elites are checking their clothing and other belongings (phones [see: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/LuAA8x.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/LuAA8x.jpg</a>], wallets, or whatever) in, to go into a back room and play naked ping pong. A couple walks in and gives their clothes over to Rosario Dawson while they talk back and forth about how Dawson is drinking white wine now but can\'t give up chocolate. Then an older man walks in and says his wife isn\'t coming because she\'s upset with him. He says she bet on a horse named &quot;fluffy banana&quot; at the track. He says &quot;Who the hell names their horse that, huh? I mean, it kinda makes you wonder, right?&quot; Indeed. Dawson agrees. </p>
<p>Then Zachary Quinto (Spock in the Abrams 2009 Star Trek) shows up with an actor I can\'t ID. Dawson says they can\'t come in because it\'s closed for a private party (&quot;members only night&quot;), which Comet Ping Pong is known to do.</p>
<p>The other robber whips out a gun and says it\'s a holdup and he and Quinto don black ski masks and demand all the wallets from the clothes of the partiers.</p>
<p>And to tie it back in again to Comet, for some reason Quinto messes up while putting on the mask and ends up covering the mouth hole with his glasses so it looks like a plastic bubble. While wearing this he looks through the curtain into the naked ping pong room (<a href="https://i.sli.mg/T4Z0bB.png">https://i.sli.mg/T4Z0bB.png)</a>).</p>
<p>ASIDE, SORRY: Besta Pizza, Buck\'s Fishing and Camping, and Comet Ping Pong are supposedly under Alefantis\'s Big Cheese, LLC. 
But I\'ve also seen something showing Andrew Kline was involved and controlled Besta (Portuguese for &quot;beast&quot;) pizza in 2006 through Uptown Pizza LLC. <a href="http://sli.mg/A45Xa5">http://sli.mg/A45Xa5</a>
Of course, Nancy Pelosi has Goat Hill Pizza, so pizza places are very common to own among pols.</p>
<p>And now look at this picture of werkinonmahnightcheese (Jeff Smith) where he\'s got a mask on that covers his mouth with plastic (is this some sort of sexual gear or something? is it to mask your voice at a masquerade? are there people that get to wear these at naked ping pong and just watch?): <a href="https://i.sli.mg/mDdhxk.png">https://i.sli.mg/mDdhxk.png</a>
This werkinonmahnightcheese guy was the guy who called that metal room on the Comet Ping Pong instagram a #killroom <a href="https://i.sli.mg/SsfZcD.png">https://i.sli.mg/SsfZcD.png</a>
He\'s got his own <a href="https://i.sli.mg/0AY10T.png">https://i.sli.mg/0AY10T.png</a>
Here he offers to mail something to someone who wants a dish overnighted: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/x4lSTQ.png">https://i.sli.mg/x4lSTQ.png</a>
Here he shows the back of your standard, stereotypical pedo van: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/O9g35o.png">https://i.sli.mg/O9g35o.png</a>
He\'s the guy who made this child casket: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/rlK7lh.png">https://i.sli.mg/rlK7lh.png</a>
Wonder what\'s in his &quot;coffee table&quot;...DON\'T OPEN IT. Also, what\'s //ee// ? That a chan board? <a href="https://i.sli.mg/XlH9Oq.png">https://i.sli.mg/XlH9Oq.png</a>
He liked this: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/sdnZNZ.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/sdnZNZ.jpg</a>
Does he work at this Pajama Factory? Somebody else jokes this is a killroom for some reason? <a href="https://i.sli.mg/cpvEHR.png">https://i.sli.mg/cpvEHR.png</a>
&quot;for my violent life&quot;... hope he\'s frontin\' <a href="https://i.sli.mg/8liTgr.png">https://i.sli.mg/8liTgr.png</a></p>
<p>Anyway, other robber gets a look of the naked ping pong and says &quot;now I see the big picture&quot;. He proposes taking pictures and blackmailing everybody. Rosario Dawson says &quot;blackmail never works... I tried it once in high school&quot;. There\'s a big dust up. Quinto sees his gf in the naked players and she says &quot;this isn\'t me&quot; and &quot;I\'m so ashamed&quot;. He explains that he\'s not really a robber, just forced into it by the other guy. Then it cuts to black and I dunno what happens exactly because I haven\'t watch the whole movie yet.</p>
<p>There was a promo contest for the movie in which people were encouraged to film themselves playing naked ping pong. They get movie stars Carla Gugino, Rosario Dawson, and Danny DeVito to talk about how great naked ping pong would be:
<a href="http://www.traileraddict.com/girl-walks-into-a-bar/featurette-naked-ping-pong-contest">http://www.traileraddict.com/girl-walks-into-a-bar/featurette-naked-ping-pong-contest</a></p>
<p>I guess it became a meme among leftist elites, because the pornographer daughter of two pornographers and admitted child sex abuser Lena Dunham put a naked ping pong scene into her HBO show Girls:
<a href="http://tabletennisnation.com/entertainment-news/nude-ping-pong-on-hbos-girls/">http://tabletennisnation.com/entertainment-news/nude-ping-pong-on-hbos-girls/</a></p>
<p>Here\'s 50 Cent doing nude ping pong even earlier than this movie: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfk_6qAmZJQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfk_6qAmZJQ</a></p>
<p>This Dr. Pong place in Berlin that is connected to Comet Ping Pong has this trip advisor review:
We had 4 days in Berlin which were excellent. The highlight of the trip for my 16 year old son was nightly visits to the Dr Pong bar at 21 Eberswalder Strasse (<a href="http://archive.is/OKLXW">http://archive.is/OKLXW)</a>). The bar is very basic but the atmosphere is very friendly with players of varying ability. Bats and balls are provided by the friendly american owner.</p>
<p>Their manifesto seems like an oblique description of an orgy:
<a href="http://www.drpong.net/manifest.php">http://www.drpong.net/manifest.php</a></p>
<p>As with the ping pong place in the movie, there is definitely clothed ping pong going on that is open to the public on many days, and legit food/drink sales, too.</p>
<p>More loosely related, but a big thing I haven\'t seen enough traffic on: this October 24 2016 shared birthday party between Tony Podesta and James Alefantis! Let\'s see if they try to make these two seem less close in the future.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Finally, on the subject of making art that could expose what you\'ve actually been doing...</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/t8Is1N.png">https://i.sli.mg/t8Is1N.png</a></p>
<p>This quote appears in the X-Files episode &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;: the Cigarette Smoking Man\'s backstory is told. He kills JFK and it shows pretty much the whole thing. He kills MLK Jr. and we see the whole build up but we don\'t have to actually see MLK die. Then the RFK assassination is only portrayed obliquely. CSM (Cig Smokin\' Man) sees RFK come on the TV and start saying the Aeschylus quote from this cometpingpong instagram picture and CSM says it along with him.
So what does CSM do in his spare time? He makes coded novels (roman a clef) about the stuff he does because he wants recognition but he can only get it indirectly through art.</p>',

Steve Bing is also cited as producer on A Girl Walks Into A Bar. Another producer is billionaire Richard Rosenblatt, who made Myspace big in its best times. Schwartz is "co-producer", which probably means he put in less money, but more time and effort.

           Another James Alefantis restaurant, Buck's Fishing and Camping, right near Comet, also combines donuts with foods you would not expect them to be mixed with: oysters and steak. (

A couple walks in and gives their clothes over to Rosario Dawson while they talk back and forth about how Dawson is drinking white wine now but can't give up chocolate. Then an older man walks in and says his wife isn't coming because she's upset with him. He says she bet on a horse named "fluffy banana" at the track. He says "Who the hell names their horse that, huh? I mean, it kinda makes you wonder, right?" Indeed. Dawson agrees.

           I guess it became a meme among leftist elites, because the pornographer daughter of two pornographers and admitted child sex abuser Lena Dunham put a naked ping pong scene into her HBO show Girls:
           <a href="http://tabletennisnation.com/entertainment-news/nude-ping-pong-on-hbos-girls/">
            http://tabletennisnation.com/entertainment-news/nude-ping-pong-on-hbos-girls/
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Here's 50 Cent doing nude ping pong even earlier than this movie:

           This Dr. Pong place in Berlin that is connected to Comet Ping Pong has this trip advisor review:
We had 4 days in Berlin which were excellent. The highlight of the trip for my 16 year old son was nightly visits to the Dr Pong bar at 21 Eberswalder Strasse (
           <a href="http://archive.is/OKLXW">
            http://archive.is/OKLXW)
           </a>
           ). The bar is very basic but the atmosphere is very friendly with players of varying ability. Bats and balls are provided by the friendly american owner.
          </p>
          <p>
           Their manifesto seems like an oblique description of an orgy:
           <a href="http://www.drpong.net/manifest.php">
            http://www.drpong.net/manifest.php
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           As with the ping pong place in the movie, there is definitely clothed ping pong going on that is open to the public on many days, and legit food/drink sales, too.

           More loosely related, but a big thing I haven't seen enough traffic on: this October 24 2016 shared birthday party between Tony Podesta and James Alefantis! Let's see if they try to make these two seem less close in the future.

           Finally, on the subject of making art that could expose what you've actually been doing...

           This quote appears in the X-Files episode "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man": the Cigarette Smoking Man's backstory is told. He kills JFK and it shows pretty much the whole thing. He kills MLK Jr. and we see the whole build up but we don't have to actually see MLK die. Then the RFK assassination is only portrayed obliquely. CSM (Cig Smokin' Man) sees RFK come on the TV and start saying the Aeschylus quote from this cometpingpong instagram picture and CSM says it along with him.
So what does CSM do in his spare time? He makes coded novels (roman a clef) about the stuff he does because he wants recognition but he can only get it indirectly through art.

            Were they in North Korea without reason, or were they there for a purpose and the government decided to screw them?  I only ask because Ling's sister (Lisa) has actually been in NK to film a documentary about how lousy the eye care is in the country.  Of course, it is conveyed to the brainwashed populace that Dear Leader made the foreign eye doctor appear out of thin air to help his denizens.  But great info, nonetheless.

            He is listed on wikipedia as

             personal assistant and counselor to President Bill Clinton
            </a>
            until 2013. If you look at the Epstein flight logs this guy was with Bill C on almost every flight. He also apparently made a bunch of trips to Epstein's island.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Clinton Global Initiative was his baby, and worked for the Clinton Foundation. There was some conflict between Band and Chelsea Clinton so he resigned from the foundation in 2015.

            Just a little additional info/correction. The adult woman who was in the pizza.jpg pic is journalist Laura Ling who was "investigating" human trafficking. She was subsequently arrested by the North Koreans along with a handful of other people. Bill Clinton subsequently traveled to North Korea, and negotiated her release. Many believe that the pizza.jpg pic is a catalogue picture. These pedos will take innocuous pics with the children, then they shows the pics to buyers in order to show off the product.

             this

            page of Dr Pong (Berlin)'s menu is a drawing of a child, whereas one of the offerings on the page is described as "Sticky as a long, slow summertime fuck" - I observe that some of their cocktail/snack descriptions are also risque/tongue-in-cheek but that does seem a bit much...

            Also the

             photos
            </a>
            page featuring a drawing of a baby, while the photos themselves (can only see the thumbnails) feature adults smoking, looking fucked up, and as mentioned the general vibe of the place seems to be a smokey dive bar, opens in the evenings only, profanity used in the menu, in other words quite clearly a place for adults and NOT welcoming to children...One has to ask why they would use illustrations of young children on their stuff. (the first and last images used are of a person in a wrestling mask, and a drippy hotdog in a bun, respectively...just saying.)

            Tempted to go by there there tonight and ask if they sell pizza...
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: The item described as "Sticky as a long, slow summertime fuck" is called "Andro 'S��kind" where presumably the two missing characters are those not feasible on a non-German keyboard. The first German word I can think of that fits that description is "Süßkind" meaning "sweet child". Other German speakers are of course welcome to offer suggestions but that does seem like the most likely translation.

            I took a closer look at this Dr Pong. Here are a couple observations:
            <br/>
            This article advertising a ping pong paddle is especially interesting:
            <br/>
            "Whoever wants to pimp his equipment a bit can buy the paddle bag "Andro Süßkind". It's on the menu and is described as "Sticky as a long, slow summertime fuck". Very graphically phrased; the thing must be really good."
            <br/>
            You can read that in this Hipster-Tourist brochure:
            <a href="http://www.in-berlin-brandenburg.com/Location/Bars/Dr-Pong.html">
             http://www.in-berlin-brandenburg.com/Location/Bars/Dr-Pong.html
            </a>
            <br/>
            Apparently these reviewers are too overwhelmed to think about it.
            <br/>
            The company 'andro' is a manufacturer in Dortmund.
            <br/>
            They actually have ping pong paddles for sale:

            "Sweet child" is NOT in the catalogue.
            <br/>
            "Sweet child" doesn't even really fit in that list.
            <br/>
            I asked their customer service about it, and this was the answer:
            <br/>
            Hello,
            <br/>
            thank you for your inquiry.
            <br/>
            Andro does not produce the requested paddle.
            <br/>
            Friendly greetings from Dortmund.

            Ich habe mir dieses Dr Pong mal näher angeschaut.
Hier ein paar Befunde:

            Insbesondere dieser als Ping Pong Schläger beworbene Artikel ist interessant:

           <p>
            ‚ Wer meint, sein Equipment ein wenig pimpen zu müssen, kann bei Dr. Pong den Schlägerbelag „Andro Süßkind“ kaufen. Der steht auf der Getränkekarte und wird beschrieben als „Sticky as a long, slow summertime fuck“. Sehr anschaulich formuliert; das Ding muss wirklich gut sein.‘

            Offenbar sind diese Werbelinge aber überfordert, mal ein bisschen nachzudenken.

‚Süßkind‘ passt da irgendwie so gar nicht rein.

            The quote is from Greek playwright, Aeschylus, (The king of tragedies, no less).
"God, whose law it is
that he who learns must suffer.
And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget
falls drop by drop upon the heart,
and in our own despite, against our will,
comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God."
           </p>
           <p>
            Bobby Kennedy quoted this when he broke the news of Martin Luther King's death in a speech made in Indiana.

            Also, I believe Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping was opened in 2003. Comet Ping Pong came along in 2006. 
Nalu diner came along in 2012.

            </a>
            This is an interesting one because it is in Berlin, Germany, and hasn't been mentioned much. Also, if you read the introductory message it would appear that Mr Alefantis has been living something of a double life, for it states that he moved to Berlin with Oliver Miller in the early 2000's and that James grew up in, amongst other places, Indiana and Hawaii.
            <a href="http://www.nalu-diner.de/">
             http://www.nalu-diner.de/
            </a>
            This is the first direct link I have found between Alefantis and Hawaii (for those not in the know, Hawaii is mixed up with this whole Pizzagate thing in various ways, and Berlin is heavily linked to paedophilia).
In various interviews, Alefantis claims to have grown up on the East Coast, only mentioning places like VA, NY, DE and DC. He was also in a relationship with David Brock for 10 years (I may be wrong, but it seems to have been from 2002 - 2012), and has been heavily photographed on the east coast, particularly in DC.
Something isn't right about all of this. It's not adding up.

            Nice break down. I know the movie and TV industry is used for "plain sight" communications if you can figure out the keys and codes.

            On another related note, I would advise everybody NOT eat the food at any of these places that maybe suspect. 
There is a strong indication this maybe how they are disposing of the bodies. On another note, this could yield a means to obtain strong DNA evidence. We should have some boots on the ground stopping in on all suspect locations and grab a slice of meat lovers and take it to the lab and see if human DNA comes up on the samples. If thats possible.

             There was a satirical movie made in the 1980s called 'Eat the Rich' which had exactly this plot, except it is the exploited servants who are serving the bodies of dead rich people to other snobbish elite who, unknowingly, pay top dollar to eat their butchered associates.  No idea who made it.  Maybe some peon who escaped the industry and made their own "plain sight" version  on the elite's beloved theme. Eat the Rich became a popular cult movie in the 80s.

               I'm sure they make these them selves as an inside joke of sorts with some form of communications to it.

               There is also a movie about the 2016 election, can't remember what its called but it centers around corruption, cops, election fraud, media addiction, murder and prostitution. An almost mad max type movie. Some of the content was remarkably predictive.

            Very much enjoyed this post and the observations made. Informative stuff. Where did you get the legal name of werkinonmahnightcheese? I have noticed that the series of instagrams of jimmycomet and werkin guy that at one point jimmycomet has a german instagram "folgen" rather then the english "follow." jimmycomet goes to germany. Then werkin guy comes to america. Connection to taking a coffin-looking piece of furniture through customs??? already sealed up???

            When I saw the pic of Tony Podesta and Alefantis at the birthday party -- I wondered -- this could be father and son!! Funny, there is a woman on youtube who says stuff like that, (rise together channel -- I think she fell over the cliff a while back, sheesh) "Benjamin Fulford is really the grandson of David Rockefeller", --

            -- and if you look in the sidebar there are other connections she makes. Crazy lady with weird ideas about the new world order and who is behind it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your connection with the X-Files is like a fine piece of work. Great thinking. If you haven't seen this video of G. Edward Griffin, it is quite interesting. "The Quigley Formula" --
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynVqPnMQ2sI">

            </a>
            -- he talks about how Prof. Quigley wanted to bring out the truth of their secret society. He thought it was just a fine and dandy society. It was about forming a world government. Thanks for your post.

             This says he's "Jeff Smith". Could be fake name, especially since it's so common.

            <p>
             Remember that Dr. Pong in Berlin is connected to Comet Ping Pong in DC somehow, and that Dr. Pong has an American owner. So there must be some sort of back and forth... probably some more to be found in legal documents / ownership documents.

             She was dating a dude that was into it, there's some movie around it where it became hipster and artsy. If you really want to go there as what's a bit off about it, just start looking into ASMALLWORLD which is an elite private members only club which have even kicked out certain celebs that fell into a bad spotlight. Then check out the Nestle empire spawn who is known as a "Jetrosexual" who ran into multiple "off the books" settlements for who knows what. The entity runs through Delaware too, one of those massive tax havens that the elites use to move money around.

             I am sure they somehow can! Women can be very good at rationalizing weird things, how far they go with it, who knows. Depends on the individuals. One thing for certain, they all know to keep it covered up, so they all know its wrong!
And they are putting a lot of effort into normalizing pedophilia.

            Wow amazing investigative work my friend! Kudos to your valiant efforts. May all these pieces fall into a much bigger puzzle showing the fall of all who engage in such sadistic and perverted acts!

            Great post friend.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for putting this all together, it's a lot of work. I've went ahead and archived everything here, and followed all links fairly deeply (wget).
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you've put together an extremely solid case for investigation at the very least.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a lot of leads to follow  based on this, so thanks. Will look into some of these leads.

              There was an email from the Hollywood leak that showed up in a t_d thread when all the Podesta stuff was being released.  It had probably over a hundred recipients, including podesta.  I wonder if your find could connect to those recipients.
