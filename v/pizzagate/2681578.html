            So in 1982 Vaz was a prospective Labour Candidate for MP of Richmond &amp; Barnes (Parliamentary constituency) and the solicitor for Richmond (London borough). The 1982 Elm Guest House scandal of elite politicians and celebrities abusing young boys was in Barnes (district in Richmond).
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though locals were upset about goings on at Elm Guest House, Vaz claimed he had no knowledge.

            "VAZ FORTUNE PROBE Anti-fraud police confirm they are looking into allegations made against Labour MP Keith Vaz and his unexplained £4M wealth" April 2018
           </p>
           <p>
            'COUNTER-fraud cops last night confirmed they were looking into allegations against shamed Labour MP Keith Vaz.
           </p>
           <p>
            The National Crime Agency said it was taking questions over his unexplained £4million wealth “very seriously”.
           </p>
           <p>
            They made the revelation to Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has demanded a probe into how Mr Vaz has amassed such a large property empire on an average annual earnings of just £90,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Mr Vaz’s current salary is £77,379. He has declared outside earnings of just £11,950 since 1997 in addition to rent worth around £10,000 a year from one of the flat he owns.'

            Keith Vaz was the chairman of a committee set up to look at the laws of prostitution in the UK. He was highly in favour of decriminalisation of prostitution, a law which has proven unworkable and unsafe for women in countries like Germany.  He had the support of George Soros and Open Society, as well as all the pimp lobby groups using 'sexworker collectives' as a front.  When Keith Vaz, married father of two, was found to be raping Eastern Eurpean boys for money, he was forced to stand down from chairing the committee.  And, yes, when you're paying for sex it's rape. It's not consensual if you're paying for it.

            Yeh this is all well known stuff in the UK if you read and follow politics. There's a large number of right wing (despite being in either a left or right party) elite group that control, coerce and plot together to get people off the hook. The system is corrupt, has been for a long time. Career politicians are rewarded for staying quiet or giving false stories. The BBC is now right-wing controlled Tory centric bias so will push any story against the opposition to maintain control of the elite establishment so stories are not correctly reported on as always have a spin and agenda bias. You can write books on the corruption, its all there, it gets reported on. But done so in such ways that the masses are conditioned to thinking its ok, or it is normalized and just accepted thats corruption is the status quo. Ask one British person is UK politics corrupt, 90% will say yes. Its accepted and right now in UK media the focus is on demonizing Corbyn who is literally the only party leader who has ever shown a slight bit of hope for removing this corruption in the UK and has a massive movement of people who never used to be into politics or joined a party, quite like what the qAnon movement is doing, he is waking people up to the surface corruption and getting them politically aware. I feel hopeful.

             UK govt. is so corrupt. Didn't know this one, a probe into Vaz because of the rent boy scandal was suspended because of his 'ill health'.  Meanwhile he was on trips to India and Saudi Arabia, still an MP, and out and active in London. Finally there was a new Commissioner of Standards and the probe was back on:

            </p>
            <p>
             Reminds me of the child abuse prosecution of Vaz's associate Lord Greville Janner, which was called off because of Janner's alleged dementia, even though up until then he was active in the House of Lords. After public outcry it was to resume, but then Janner died. Looks like Vaz helped kill a probe into child abuse allegations about Janner back in the 90's:

            The mad world of Louis Minster- the man who denies he is there
           </p>
           <p>
            For those following the Richmond child sexual abuse scandal a most extraordinary phone conversation has just taken place between my colleague Mark Conrad for Exaro News and Louis Minster, director of social services at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr Minster was in charge of the council’s social services council at the time it is alleged boys from Grafton Close children’s home were taken to Elm Guest House in Barnes and sexually abused by VIPs, including the late Sir Cyril Smith in the early 1980s. He was the boss of John Stingemore, the head of the home, who has already been arrested by the Met police as part of Operation Fernbridge
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr Minster is in a bit of the trouble. The 81-year-old ex director now living in retirement in Malta first claimed he had never had heard of the scandal when first approached by Exaro. Then it emerged he was briefed by Terry Earland, head of children’s services and now Richmond’s own files showed he twice unusually pulled the file of  a 14-year-old boy in care who had knowledge of child abuse at the time. Yet he knows nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Naturally we would want to ask him about these discrepancies. So when rung up in Malta he pretends he isn’t there and he isn’t Louis Minster. When rumbled he doesn’t want to answer any questions. Listen to the amazing interview at Exaro News (
            <a href="http://www.exaronews.com/articles/4950/ex-richmond-boss-louis-minster-denies-being-louis-minster">
             http://www.exaronews.com/articles/4950/ex-richmond-boss-louis-minster-denies-being-louis-minster
            </a>
            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps it is about time he was questioned by the Met Police. Then he won’t be able to dodge these questions and pretend he is someone else.
