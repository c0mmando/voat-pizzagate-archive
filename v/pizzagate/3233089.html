<p>To give that story credibility I believe a David Cypkin and a Lesley Abravanel Andersson were involved in helping to shape the story. Both hate Trump and post about him constantly online. Both took photographs nearly a year before the mail bomb hoax. Despite these two things, they BOTH decided to sit on the pictures for several months until the story broke.</p>
<p>Oh and it just so happens David Cypkin and Lesley Abravanel Andersson have known each other since at least 2011 judging by their Twitter.</p>
<p>+++++</p>
<p>Onto PG. Lesley Abravanel Andersson is a journalist who has worked for Blackbook magazine as the Miami Listings Editor and the Miami Herald. She focuses on culture, art, music, food, nightlife. She also has a blog called <a href="https://thesavvygadfly.com">TheSavvyGadfly</a>.</p>
<p>Andersson is married to a Magnus Axel Andersson. Magnus Andersson\'s career specialities are <strong>logistic, freight forwarding and cruise ships.</strong> </p>

<p>One of the stars of Miami nightlife that Andersson has written articles about is Michael Capponi. This is a quote from a 2015 article that talks about Capponi back in 2000:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Only 27 at the time</strong>, Capponi had already found great success in his short life as perhaps the area’s top club promoter, having been a major fixture on the scene since <strong>he was just 16 years old</strong>. Page Six’s Richard Johnson called him “The <strong>godfather of Miami nightlife</strong>” while the Miami Herald had already anointed him “The SoBe Prince.”</p>

<a href="https://punchdrink.com/articles/the-quick-rise-and-tragic-fall-of-beds-in-clubs-bed-miami-supperclub-amsterdam-duvet-new-york/">Michael Capponi and Oliver Hoyos article</a></p>
<p><strong>Oliver Hoyos is an Austrian count, born to a line of wealthy European bankers</strong>. In the late 90s he flew <strong>Michael Capponi</strong> out to Amsterdam to experience something called SupperClub. A nightclub with beds that was influenced by <strong>ancient Greek and Roman</strong> dining concepts. SupperClub was </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the gay-friendly, retro-futurist, three-roomed spot that became famed for its dominatrix waitresses with trays of slurpable oysters served between their legs, performance artists, pole-dancers, <strong>fortune-telling penis “readers” in the bathrooms</strong>, a cross-dressing American maitre d’ named “Howie”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oliver Hoyos, with $700,000 came to Miami and opened B.E.D.(Beverge, Entertainment, Dining) in 1999. In 2000 Michael Capponi joined the business. Lesley Abravanel Andersson writes about B.E.D in her blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>South Beach halcyon-era celebrity haunt B.E.D. ( Beverage. Entertainment. Dining), the place where, on any given night you could spot Jay Z, Beyonce, Britney Spears, Diddy/Daddy/Puffy, Justin Timberlake , Cameron Diaz , Leonardo DiCaprio, or Pitbull lounging on a bed next to you.</p>

<p><strong>Recap: Wealthy European bankers offspring from Amsterdam bringing ancient Greek inspired nightclub to Miami that becomes popular with PG related celebrities. With the help of a Miami nightclub legend thats been in the business since he was 16</strong></p>
<p>++++</p>
<p>Now onto the more shady things.</p>
<p>In 1999 at the same time 27 year old Michael Capponi was in Amsterdam with Oliver Hoyos learning about different club cultures, he was also helping out in Kosovo after the war. That\'s right. You heard me the first time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conceived in 1999 when Founder/Director Michael Capponi got his feet wet helping the victims of the Kosovo crisis.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Michael Capponi\'s non profit org <a href="https://www.globalempowermentmission.org">Global Empowerment Mission</a>. </p>
<p>Conceived in 1999 after the Kosovo war. Founded in 2011 in response to the Haiti tragedy. Both these events have become infamous in being exploited by sex traffickers of women and girls.</p>

Back to the <a href="https://punchdrink.com/articles/the-quick-rise-and-tragic-fall-of-beds-in-clubs-bed-miami-supperclub-amsterdam-duvet-new-york/">Michael Capponi and Oliver Hoyos article</a></p>
<p>Everything was going well for Hoyos and Capponi until one of the managers killed customer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the ensuing fracas, Adams slammed the man against the club’s elevators, accidentally causing them to open, and sending the clubgoer headfirst down the shaft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoyos freaked out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His empire becoming too much trouble for him to rule over any longer—not to mention the possibility of lawsuits growing ever more concerning—Hoyos immediately closed New York and Atlanta’s B.E.D. for good and sold his interests in the Miami locale. He went back to Europe to stay at a friend’s house in Spain where “I basically sat still for six months not even speaking,” he recalls. “After shaking probably three millions hands in the previous decade, I’d lost my social battery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One accident caused him to sell up everything? Now hear his next move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hoyos now lives in Frankfurt, Germany</strong>, where a few years ago he opened a popular fast-casual joint called <strong>Burger Baby</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all from the article back in 2015. So what is Oliver Hoyos up to these days?</p>
<p>+++++</p>
<p>From Lesley Abravanel Andersson\'s blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOME isn’t in a single location. Members pay 5,000 Euro a year to join. Membership is limited to 2000 members, and that covers “Top Shelf Everything.” So many questions here, including why EURO and not dollars, but we’ll get to that in a minute. Four times a year, you and your lucky plus one will be met at an appointed location and transported via chartered flight and limousine to a certain party where your money’s no good because you already paid for everything in your membership</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this club so secret? Why is it not in America? Why Euros?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither Miami nor any American cities are in their plans for the next 4-8 years, earlier if Trump is arrested,” Helen Clarke HOME\'s social secretary said. “I’m not kidding. This is the reason they are NOT making plans for American parties.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Another recap: A wealthy European bankers offspring with business ties to someone oddly interested in war-torn countries and survivors of disasters, runs popular celebrity nightclub, is now starting a private club where the location is secret and always changing and far away from the eyes of the American government. All because Orange Man Bad.</strong></p>
<p>Does anyone of this sound on the level?</p>
<p>++++
In 2017 <strong>Markus Oliver Hoyos</strong> registered two companies in London. Home Events Limited and Home Nominees Limited. Now I understand what events mean. But what does nominees mean? Who are the nominees for the HOME event? What are they nominated for?</p>
<p>Markus Oliver Hoyos at Companies House - <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/RfwObQzfarHqlsrs-TJqm_raiYI/appointments">https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/RfwObQzfarHqlsrs-TJqm_raiYI/appointments</a></p>
<p>This development in 2017 and Lesley Abravanel Andersson\'s 2018 blog post confirm the creation of a HOME club event. But I\'ve had no luck finding out anything else about this private floating party because its such a generic name. I wonder if that was the point.</p>
<p>+++++
Going back to Magnus Andersson the guy who works with freight ships and cruise liners. The company he spent many years working for is Carnival. They own several cruise brands. &quot;This year a federal judge threatened to temporarily block Carnival Corp. from docking cruise ships at ports in the United States as punishment for a possible probation violation.&quot;</p>
<p>Carnival - <a href="https://floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2019/04/11/oil-dumping-may-lead-carnival-ships-docking-ban-judge-says/3435796002/">https://floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2019/04/11/oil-dumping-may-lead-carnival-ships-docking-ban-judge-says/3435796002/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carnival has been on probation for two years as part of a $40 million settlement for illegally dumping oil into the ocean from its Princess Cruises ships and lying about the scheme, according to court filings.</p>
<p>Despite this, prosecutors say ships have dumped gray water into Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park, prepared ships in advance of court-ordered audits to avoid unfavorable findings, falsified records and dumped plastic garbage into the ocean. The company has acknowledged these incidents in court filings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>+++++</p>
<p><strong>Final recap: European bankers offspring, popular with PG celebrities, is running secret VIP parties that require chartered flights to get away from Trump, and has ties to someone uncharacteristically interested in Kosovo and Haiti. Promoted by journalist whose husband has long career with shipping and cruise liners accused of dumping waste into the oceans and falsifying documents.</strong></p>',

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Carnival has been on probation for two years as part of a $40 million settlement for illegally dumping oil into the ocean from its Princess Cruises ships and lying about the scheme, according to court filings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite this, prosecutors say ships have dumped gray water into Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park, prepared ships in advance of court-ordered audits to avoid unfavorable findings, falsified records and dumped plastic garbage into the ocean. The company has acknowledged these incidents in court filings.

            Looked up Lesley Abravanel Andersson on fb and was surprised to see the pedo symbol on the first page as an icon for one of her follwers.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Clicked on the icon and it took me to some one named
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mgarabo">
             Maria Elise's fb page
            </a>
            with the pedo symbol prominently displayed on the front page.  Another photo of the pedo swirl on the photos section with the words "Light it up Blue" - some organization that looks like it's "raising money for autistic kids"... but the first thing that came to mind was the fact that many child abusers, molesters and rapists purposely harm disabled children because they are not able to speak.
