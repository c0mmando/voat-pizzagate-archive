<p>I was reading the Biltmore Estate <a href="http://archive.fo/vsbIi#selection-1649.0-1657.17">Wikipedia</a> article, and noticed it mentions the estate and surrounding woods are the setting for a children\'s book series called <strong><em>Serafina.</em></strong> </p>
<p>The popular three-book <a href="https://twitter.com/DisneyHyperion">Disney Books</a> series is <strong>used by many schools, and includes child abduction, soul stealing, and the apparent engineering of &quot;people.&quot;</strong>  
</p>
<p><strong>This is very occult and creepy, and for what it\'s worth, may contain potential, subtle clues to some of what may have gone on, and/or goes on at the estate, and in surrounding areas.</strong></p>

<p>The main character Serafina looks pretty much like a human being, but was created unnaturally, in some way or another:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.fo/Tbacw"><strong><em>Serafina and the Black Cloak</em></strong> <strong>- Study Guide</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serafina is a different looking girl. She has only has four toes on each foot, and she is missing bones. The missing bones give her the ability to squeeze into very tight spaces.  Serafina also has large amber eyes </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>her father tells Serafina the story of how he found her. She is not his biological daughter. The news upsets her and leaves her confused. </p>
<p>The Man in the Black Cloak...takes another child....[further on it] starts to speak to Serafina. It wants her to put it on. She does for a short while. <strong>The cloak offers her power and fame.</strong>  When she puts the hood on, she sees all of the people the cloak has absorbed.  Instantly, Serafina takes off the cloak.  The Black Cloak fights Serafina...She finally manages to destroy it and when she does, all of the absorbed people appear.  She recognizes Clara and Nolan. A Russian girl who had also disappeared is there, too. </p>

           The main character Serafina looks pretty much like a human being, but was created unnaturally, in some way or another:

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Serafina is a different looking girl. She has only has four toes on each foot, and she is missing bones. The missing bones give her the ability to squeeze into very tight spaces.  Serafina also has large amber eyes

          <p>
           And:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            her father tells Serafina the story of how he found her. She is not his biological daughter. The news upsets her and leaves her confused.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Man in the Black Cloak...takes another child....[further on it] starts to speak to Serafina. It wants her to put it on. She does for a short while.
            <strong>
             The cloak offers her power and fame.
            </strong>
            When she puts the hood on, she sees all of the people the cloak has absorbed.  Instantly, Serafina takes off the cloak.  The Black Cloak fights Serafina...She finally manages to destroy it and when she does, all of the absorbed people appear.  She recognizes Clara and Nolan. A Russian girl who had also disappeared is there, too.

            Interesting with regards to karma. I'm a former Zen priest with a heavy interest in rebirth and karmic cause and effect. Lots of theories about one simple little word. If these 'elites' think they can somehow escape their own personal 'karma' they're deluded. Some shaman folk in Taiwan will 'take your karma' for money, it is possible for a short time, the Zen transmission of dust ritual is essentially a fundamental shift of karma. You wouldn't find out about that in books or the internet, only certain orders know how to do it. But it's temporal. What you do, you pay for. It's that simple.

            Is it a coincidence that there was a WIZARD OF OZ theme park just to the north-east of Asheville??
For those unaware, Wizard of Oz programming was/is probably the most prevalent programming script for mind controlling children in the MK-ULTRA/Monarch programs. Fritz Springmeier has written extensively about this in his books.

            One final comment. There are extensive bridle trails on the Biltmore estate open to the public. Hmmm, might there have been some hunting parties back in the day???

            My father was an aircraft mechanic for the small fleet of executive aircraft for a major oil company. When I told him what I was researching  he responded by telling me how one of the pilots told him (back in the 1960s)  that part of his job was to fly bigwigs to North Carolina for sexual encounters with 12 year old children. He is 90yo now and couldnt remember  where other than N.C.

             Wow, unreal. Any chance he would recall who some of the men were? Absolutely sick these people are. Virginia and the Carolinas seem to have always been hotbeds for this kind of stuff.

            Q has started posting Pizzagate findings which he is attributing to the Anons and the swimming pool was featured last week. While we should get credit at times ,  Q might be  avoiding association with us to avoid further criticism from MSM,  which is wise. Q has already been lumped with Pjzzagate in general by MSM.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q has a much, much larger audience than us  so we shouldnt care, whats important is the public being educated.

            I came across an article (cant remember where) describing very unpleasant paranormal experiences at the Biltmore especially at the swimming pool. First time visitors to the pool not knowing what we know found themselves so stricken with anxiety, they would vomit and flee the place.

            It's not so much the law of karma as it is Masonic "fair game" doctrine.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's considered dishonorable to cheapshot someone.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you tell someone what your going to do to them before you do it,  giving them fair warning,  and the opportunity to stop you,  you have done your due diligence and it's a fair fight.

           <p>
            You have rendered them. "fair game" and can do whatever you warned them about,  even kill them.

             That art is a great find in terms of symbolism!  Actually the author Robert Beatty is not that man.  The author is from North Carolina and in 1995 founded an information management company that contracts to military, aerospace, and others, Plex Systems, Inc.:

            And someone in the thread reminded everyone of the email about "kids being in the pool for entertainment" think differently about that email yet? Realize the full gravity now? We can't let these evil bastards keep doing this.

            it's also magik ritual to create a story of yourself and bring it to life.  You are suppose to be creative and go into detail and really immerse yourself in its reality.  It's about programming your subconscious mind to direct your life in the way you want it to go.

            In my opinion, these cult members are having artists paint renditions of photographs that they have in their private collection as to allow their "artistic tastes" to be displayed and discussed.  Perhaps even in some cases these are paintings that are documenting activities that the owners wish to remember on a regular basis. What better way to relive a private secret without risk of incrimination than having a painting of it in your dining room? After all, it's just art right?
            <br/>
            Edit
Maybe we should track down the owners of the art.  Like the piece that appears to have taken place in the Vanderbilt estate pool. Is that one owned by someone with a connection to the property?

             Or you know pedos like looking at pictures of naked kids at all times and this is the best he can do openly.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am not a pedo but I am a sex addict and check a fappening blog that posts pictures at least 4-5 times a day from my phone....I don't think podesta can keep actual child porn on his phone....

              The problem with your theory is the detail put into the painting. How often do you create faces from imagination? This "art" is a reflection from the eyes the artist. The painter has an entire series of these torture based pedo paintings. I'm sure she imagined all of those violent scenes. 
  The practice of having an artist paint a moment in time you would like to freeze forever isn't a new practice. Have you taken a look to see what kind of visual reference an artist might use while painting scenes like these that include subjects with detailed faces?
 Also, your fappening logic kinda proves my point.  You have an addiction so you feed your addiction. If a person is addicted to raping and hurting kids they are going to be fighting the itch all day every day as well.  It's harder to scratch such an exotic itch whenever it calls. Which is why these weirdos need a gallery full of murder trophies. It holds them over until the next fix.

             Excellent comment - that's what I thought about the painting that seems to show Anderson Cooper at a child - the artist is about his age (I think) - at least he was an adult when the painting was done, not the same age as the child in the painting.

             Serafina's mother's character is a "human/catamount" person.   From the

              study guide

             in the OP:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              There is a woman who seems to need help. Serafina goes to assist her and when she does, she finds out that this is her mother. She is a catamount and when the Man in the Black Cloak took her, he only took the human part. The lioness was her cat part, and the cubs are Serafina’s half-siblings.
             </p>
             <p>
              As the story ends, everyone goes back to the estate. However, Leandra, Serafina’s mother, chooses to stay in her cat form. She goes back to take care of her cubs. Serafina tells Braeden about her identity, and the Vanderbilts make plans to make the basement more comfortable for Serafina and her father. They accept her and her father as part of the household.

            Wow, so many mind programming characteristics in just the descriptions: the "splintered heart" immediately made me think of disassociating, or "splintering" of the mind via trauma. These people are so blatantly evil!!
