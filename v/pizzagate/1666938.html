<p>&quot; The group\'s stated aim was &quot;to alleviate [the] suffering of many adults and children&quot; by campaigning to abolish the age of consent thus legalising sex between adults and children&quot;</p>
<p>PIE became PAL, who published a magazine called &quot;Palaver&quot; which is now called Magpie. Palaver put out a publication called &quot;childhood rights&quot; that was merged into Magpie.</p>
<p>In 1973, Hillary Clinton published a lengthy thesis about &quot;Children Under the Law&quot; in the Harvard Educational Review. It was highly rated in the legal field of children\'s rights.</p>

&quot;Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[58] Her first scholarly article, &quot;Children Under the Law&quot;, was published in the Harvard Educational Review in late 1973.[59] Discussing the new children\'s rights movement, it stated that &quot;child citizens&quot; were &quot;powerless individuals&quot;[60] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[61] The article became frequently cited in the field.&quot;</p>

<p>However, there are several reviews of the thesis that offer quotes from the original, such as this one.

<p>&quot;She suggested abolishing the legal status of minority, and that all procedural rights guaranteed to adults under the Constitution should be granted to children whenever the state moves against them. She made the point that the legal reasoning that characterizes as &quot;minor&quot; everyone under 18 or 21 was artificial and simplistic and did not take into account the dramatic differences in competency among children of different ages. Hillary argued in favor of creating a scale of graduated maturity, through which the increasing competence of children would be taken into account.&quot;</p>',
