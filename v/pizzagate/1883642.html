<p>Dr. Sava is also connected to Heather Podesta who is connected to D.C. Police as has been documented. Numerous independent researchers are on the ground in DC right now chasing these leads. Below is George Webb who is with JASON Goodman. They have been everywhere for three days getting statements and catching people in lies on the record. They were at Lou\'s bar, at Seth\'s house, at DNC headquarters, at location of shooting. </p>
<p>They just went the FBI headquarters and George stood in front and called out to Andrew McCabe (FBI director)to come speak to him about Seth Rich, Awan brothers spies, HRC, Russian Hoax. 
Ask McCabe about taking bribe money from HRC and placing him in Disrupt campaign. </p>
<p>They are on the way to meet with Liz Cronkin reporter who helped break the story of pizzagate and was fired at Townhall, now working with Dr. Corsi who is also on scene. </p>
<p>They also were in front of treasury where they stood on the street with veterans and gave a shout out to independent researchers, Voaters, Cynthia McKinney PhD, who first questioned Rumsfield on Dyncorp/CIA child sex trafficking and 6 trillion missing black budget money. And named many other journalists and whistleblowers. </p>
<p>They are heading to capital hill where ex-CIA director BRennan who was Obama crony and involved in spying on everyone including senators, Supreme Court Justices, etc. and most aggressively pushed the Russia story. He hated Gen. Flynn for telling Obama &amp; congress to stop funding &amp; arming Isis 2 years ago or there would be global terror. Obama fired him at Brennan\'s request. He is notoriously involved in history of CIA and spent most of his time in Saudi Arabia. Research him.</p>

<p>Wikileaks is tweeting out the Brennan files again because his emails were also obtained by simple phishing years ago.</p>

            This is unbelievable. This is Wasserman-Shultz and D-J. Spiers providing oversight to the capital police who were forced to take control of the Spy ring infiltration by Awan bros. They allowed foreign Intel agents access to top secret data based on multiple committees and got the TS clearance directly from whitehouse.
           </p>
           <p>
            The equipment she is talking about is US government blackberries &amp; laptops seized by Capital police after FBI did nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            For her to threaten is ludicrous her security clearance should be pulled immediately and why they are allowed to question much less threaten a police chief protecting national security is ludicrous.

            Great post! We always have to look closely to the 3 exterritorial states...Columbia, Vatican and the City of London. Everything what they do is pure corruption. And the men behind them, Synagogue of Satan, incest breeding fucks. I shit on their idols!

            I am dumbfounded how we continue to stand up for dead Democrats while actual living Democrats are for obstruction e.g. Chris Stevens or Vince Foster or Seth Rich.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Twitter, the liberal media is obsessed trying to stop this. Fox News has apparently apologized for pushing the story but Hannity has not, they are in full force attacking Hannity. The family wishes Hannity to stop or something. The family needs to be left alone or something. I 'm sure the media can shame with conspiracy theory all they want but the genie is out of the bottle. Solve it and make leftist heads explode. 10 months and no case is on purpose. Robbery where there was none. Democrats not calling for gun control. Media not interested in the case. Too many doubts to just say move along nothing to see here.

             I thought hannity was a lost cause a couple years ago. He's starting to redeem himself. I can't believe they're allowing him to report this. Mark my words, he'll be thrown off Fox news soon!

            If nothing else people, get your knees dirty and pray for the force of HIS angels to be dispatched alongside the sons and daughters of righteousness that have taken on this beast. Pray!!!

             As my Sunday school teacher says, praying is never the least you can do, but the MOST you can do. I agree with you. I believe strongly in the power of prayer. I'm praying with you brother or sister.

              Thank you, hoping this is the breakthrough we have been praying for. There are people across the globe who have been fasting and praying, once a week, for over a month and we will continue to do this until it is resolved.
             </p>
             <p>
              Every Tuesday sundown to Wednesday night sundown, partial, full, whatever fast the FATHER places on your heart.

            They can smell blood, it is there for someone to go down in history.  All they need is that one piece to tie it all together, and at this point anyone who doesn't think something seriously corrupt has happened is a fucking moron

            George Webb makes a reference to Catherine Austin Fitts who was a whistleblower as undersecretary of HUD in George H W Bush's administration. I posted this link recently to her presentation:
            <a href="https://secretspaceprogram.org/media/the-black-budget/">
             https://secretspaceprogram.org/media/the-black-budget/
            </a>
            It documents the criminal financial fraud in D.C. that funds the Black Ops and crimes against humanity, and how the coverup is linked to the Oklahoma City bombing and the 9-11 false flag. It is well worth your time, IMO. Watch it!

             Yes I have seen it thanks for posting it. Everyone should watch. There is an additional video I will post that documents how the US government is actually still sold out to the Vatican &amp; the Church of England. A whistleblower from the world bank went on record stating the stunning amount that is paid. Will find it jaw dropping.

            For those that seem upset at KimDotCom it is surprising. Realize that what he did was put the entire US government on notice including the "special counsel" who is supposed to be investigating Russia for hacking the DNC. Trump fired Comey because he knows it is a lie. KimDotCom stated through Attorney's that he has evidence that Seth Rich is the leaker because of corruption. Seth is murdered he named Special Counsel Mueller openly to provide safe passage to personally testify.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is offering to testify on a capital murder case of a political assasination in the US with direct evidence. If Mueller does not immediately stop the fake Russia investigation and realize this is a capital murder case it is over. He must do this. That will force pedogate, HRC emails, CIA lies, FBI collusion, all of it. Stick with it do not get discouraged. Kim is one part all of you citizens are the majority. DC is paranoid and being watched.

             It's absolutely IMPERATIVE that this is done properly and delicately. This could be the smoking gun that brings it all down. I mean let's be real here, if DC POLICE are responsible for covering not just one crime, (pizzagate), not just two crimes, (Anthony Weiner laptop) BUT 3 major high profile crimes, the truth about the coverup of Seth Rich's murder will most likely destroy everything, FAKE NEWS Russia Narrative will cease to exist and people will be going to jail. I am praying for the light to be finally shined on the hell hole called DC...

             Yup, you're completely right. People need to realize that KimDotcom is an adult, and he did what any adult in his position would do, and talked to LAWYERS before making his big statement. I'm sure he wanted to say more, but his lawyers told him what he could say without screwing himself over &amp; putting himself in severe, life-changing legal danger. Ignoring the advice of his legal council would be absolutely terrible idea. People who are criticising him need a crash course in how the real world works!
