            So many decades of their nonprofits and such, with such money, access to resources, support and advertising and all is worse and oil/diamond/cobalt etc, areas, still have no sewage, running warer, toilets for the indigenous in those areas.

            I'd imagine that our leaders are  big into de Sade the same way they're into Crowley, Im going to read it, just to get an idea of what the politicians were meant to be doing and how it was organised, i have heard tho that the worst serial killers were obsessed with de Sade he sounds like a disgusting excuse for a human being, much worse than Crowley even.

            Great article !

            It is all tied in. Took like 3 weeks out of my life to produce 12 videos on this, 3 are in copyright dispute. Here is the VOAT link I left:

            Ever study art ? Look @ Chagall's "Zachary's Pizza". It is a boy in a pizzabox.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the origin of the pizza mythology. It is a transformation from rose symbolism to pizza symbolism. Pizza symbolism combines elements that rose symbols could not by themselves. It is a complicated construct. But look very close on the little boy's head who is in the pizza box, and you will see that there is a rose in a pot.  Here is the link to fourth video :
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81aNscGWpq8&amp;t=484s">

            Some of Picasso actually begins on episode 3. Picassos entire career was about his oath to Satan, and what he saw but could not describe or say. He painted. The rose is the symbol of the Rosicrucians among many others. The rose symbolizes sacrifice to Moloch/Satan/Saturn/Dionysus/Ishtar/Astoreth/Diana/Melissa etc. Fertility/sacrifice.
           </p>

            Sade was telling the truth in fiction. Joyce was too, Joyce had Leopold Bloom (the blooming flower) eat organs in nearly every chapter, a different organ. DiVinci hid cannibalism in his Last Supper. Thats episode 2. the rosetta files on youtube. its all there.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pizza is a many flowering flower, a "blooming onion" if you will, which in truth is also the nature of this food item as well. A "blooming onion" refers to the dual nature of flower, layers and the need to cut. It is complete round like the globe, a perfect pie at every point.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pizza is pie, a pizza pie, as well as 3.1415. The numbers you don't see are 11, 12, 1.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sequence is 11, 12, 13, 14. Between 13 and 14 there exists an existential/evil mirror. It is the point of the decimal which separates. It is an evil mirror. It is revered by magicians/occultists I am led to believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pizzapie, is this: 3.14 , flour ("flower"), and the pepperoni's themselves are small roses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its delicious and italian, like DeMedici and the renaissance. The rose goes back a long way. 
WBYeats, the Rose upon the Rood of time.

            Yeah, I'm no expert but I've wondered about what the Marquis de Sade was really up to.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I think he was describing activities that were much more widespread than historians will admit, I don't think that he was a whistleblower. Rather, I think he viewed himself as more of a pioneer trying to tear down the veil of secrecy. Libertines did not sit back and whine that society wouldn't allow them to engage in their nefarious debauchery; they already were doing it, and wanted it to be out in the open.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's possible Marquis de Sade was just such a man and wanted the veil removed so that he and his fellow aristocrats could dispense with the hypocrisy. However, the rest of his class was not so thrilled, and had to direct all of their moral outrage at him. He turned out to be a misdirection or de facto controlled opposition.
           </p>
           <p>
            But yeah, what he described wasn't all in his imagination; he was accurately describing the elites of his day.

            Try this, type "baal", then "Baal". Then "moloch" then "Moloch" (Moloch is the modern version of Molech). The database recognizes them as names only, which is what they are.

             My apologies,  I thought I was getting hit by grammar police, which really annoys me.
             <br/>
             I shouldn't have been posting last night, because I haven't been very well the last few days, so I should likely not try to respond until I get better.   A month ago I started    spitting up blood just out of nowhere - good health up until now and it isn't the flu or cold.    I booked a dr appointment, but by then it went away so I canceled.   But last night  I started to spit up blood again, and I'm not feeling very well.
             <br/>
             I took the comments as insults and didn't have much patience with it.

            I'm going to come clean, here.  For a long time, I've heard about human trafficking but didn't give it much thought beyond desperate people escaping from or to other countries. I also knew kids disappeared.  Some ran away, often from abusive home situations, and got swept up into lives of drug abuse and homelessness, and often sex work. I also knew that there were a few completely whacked out people who kidnapped kids, abused them, and murdered them.  I also knew the Bible stories of Sodom and Gomorrah, and had read de Sade.  I also heard rumors of wild sex parties among British royals happening in the 1960s,  had watched "Rosemary's Baby," and had seen creepy looking teenagers wearing all black with black eyeliner, lipstick, and nail polish slunk around saying they were Satanists, when I knew they were just going through a stage, but that's about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have literally been blind to what has been going on around me in this world for the many, many decades of my life.  I had no idea there was something this massive in scope, this detailed in organization, and as highly a lucrative (gazillion $ a year) business that it is, all built on a foundation of devil worship, sacrifice, and cannibalism!!  I honestly believed that western civilization had left that in the dust bin a long time go.  Finding all this out is like death. Who am I, really, when the old me was living a life of complete illusion?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it really any wonder that people disbelieve this stuff, and those who get a glimpse, shrink back into their shells before they see too much?  The only reason I think there is hope in this effort, at least on one level, is because it's on-going, it involves kids, an  untold number of kids, and it's so freak'n f'd up. Those kids have no one if adults don't man up / woman up right now and rise to the occasion because "If not us, who? If not now, when?"
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not want to think that despite everyone's best efforts this is going to continue on for centuries more an beyond.  I do want to believe the cosmic tumblers are falling into place, that we will reach critical mass and humanity rid itself of this insanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            One day, I'm living a life of blissful ignorance, working at my job, taking care of things on the homefront and watching history documentaries in my spare time. The next thing I know I'm among those initially going through the DNC and Podesta emails  as wikileaks drops them, because I had spare time and why not, and finding myself embroiled in an epic historical and spiritual battle.    Good god.

             Fucking GamerGate man. I just wanted to play videogames without interference. Now I'm researching how the Illuminati have been sacrificing our missing children for the last 250 years.

               Exactly. Everyone has an 8 megapixel camera on them now and the ability to share the video and pics with the rest of the world in seconds. Makes it tough to control any narrative that isn't reality.

              Yeah the church went the gay way for sure.  I understand Rome itself is almost all gay.  Of course they're going to promote themselves first.  Who needs heteros around kill joying the gay away?

             How exactly does the fact that the vast majority of people of interest implicated in "pizzagate" are jews or kabbalists or both "lead back to Rome" exactly?  Why is a local Synagogue aligning itself with pedophile murderers and coming out in support of Besta, Comet, Politics and Prose and Terasol specifically?

              Not saying that Jews are not significant players in elite pedophilia, but from a mere statistical point of view there must be many more christian pedophiles than Jewish pedo's because there are so many more christians in the world.  Estimates of global Jewish population run 15 to 20 million.  Christians are about 2,000 million.

               It all started with the mystery religions.  Sumerian, Babylonian, Egyptian.  If you believe in the bible...which mystery religions actually do, only in reverse, then originally it started with fall of Lucifer, then Cain, then Nimrod and so forth.  It branched out into many forms.  Freemasonry, Druidism/Luciferianism.  Infiltrated every institution, especially religious institutions.  Anything to do with kids, leadership &amp; media.

            Yes, this is the "same old game" - this debauchery has been going on for the duration of Pisces, and before the world stage was controlled by Pisces it was Aries. Ancient Rome, ancient Greece - you see the same pattern the world over. Now in Afghanistan there are still "dancing boys". It is the same abominable behavior patterns over and over. Part of the repugnancy of this world, besides being birth-death-cycle, is that humans are actually designed with a special significant design parameter in mind - humans are the most simple and retarded sentient creature that the powerful machines feel comfortable punking/manipulating and FUCKING. And after the system runs long enough, those big machines see enough humans not caring about eating the children of the other animals and willing to have sex with their own young. Eo ipso.

              They're either high or paranoid schizophrenics. Just ignore them. Entirely possible it's the same person trying to get his jumbled ideas "out there" by pretending to be two separate people having a "deep" discussion.
             </p>
             <p>
              When things like Pizzagate gain traction, a lot of unusual people with paranoid (non-evidence or logic based) ideas about the world come out of the woodwork.

              Just ignore them and move on. You can see further up the thread that cosmicmind thinks the red spellcheck underline is meaningful when it identifies words that aren't in the dictionary database. Like "baal", not realizing if you type it "Baal" (as a name, which is what it is), it's fine.

            <p>
             I just had this  conversation earlier today,  but it was verbal and not written with the high  level of word crafting that you used.
My friend watched an old movie called  Time Bandits, which he saw as a poster on the wall of a tv show he watches, called The Goldbergs.
             <br/>
             Anyway,  he said at the end of the movie God tells people that they need to evolve, or something like that,  to which I just had to call   bullshit!
That makes  God a bdsm thing that created  people as  actual genetic  losers.
Is that why the freaks like to produce eugenics and tamper with the body,  they like to rule a bunch of   #hotards,   like the  pedo-bdsm crowd joke about?  Are they designed in the image of their  creator?
            </p>
            <p>
             Are people nothing more than  adult deteriorated  things that  are  controlled, due to their genetic coding?
            </p>
            <p>
             So I went out for a walk to blow off some steam about this topic, and I still come up with the same thing as you.....
the birth-death-cycle  is the pain-joy trauma that these groups on a human level love to watch.
             <br/>
             The body is genetically created missing some gene components that keep it locked in a 3-fold  retardation process....
            </p>
            <p>
             1)  I.Q.  aren't very high.   Even those few who have high I.Q.'s  often have a low  E.Q.  (emotional quotient), which produces the    Clintons, Obama's,  Bushes,  Hasterts, Podesta's,  etc.      Combine that with a mental and emotional greed and we have the $ society of slavery for a dollar/euro/rupee that the world experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) those with a high E.Q.  still don't have the skills to change the genetic structure of the body, (especially if they have a low I.Q.)
which leads me to  3.....
            </p>
            <p>
             3) the body is a fragile mass of hormones waiting for  death and hourly decay.
             <br/>
             What happens when  a combination of  a body with raging hormones, plus a comparatively low I.Q,  E.Q.,  (especially those of  known politicians and their  mad-scientists like Ray Kurzweil)  ?
            </p>
            <p>
             the answer to that question is that we're experiencing it here and now.
            </p>
            <p>
             You said it so much better than I did  when you wrote,  "humans are actually designed with a special significant design parameter in mind - humans are the most simple and retarded sentient creature that the powerful machines feel comfortable punking/manipulating and FUCKING."
            </p>
            <p>
             You're absolutely right!   The  human  social structure is a modelled mirror, and I can only think that whatever accepted and produced this is bdsm to the core.    It's highly addictive and here are a bunch of brain-dead  emotionally  retarded people  dominating and submitting in the bondage/dominance roles, of course using anything they can to do it, while the body is driven and powered by sex as a driving force.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I've thought about it for any length of time it became clear and evident that  it was designed with a special and significant design parameter in mind.... which leads to degradation.
             <br/>
             The human ends up addicting and psychologically  experiencing the same types of  desensitization as the ritual victims; but on a large cultural scale.   Even the most evolved and  ''healthy''  person has a layer of bdsm in one way or other.    (sadism is of course a take-off from the Marquis de Sade.)
            </p>
            <p>
             And the topper of the whole shitshow is that  the biological  survival instincts makes a person want to stay in it,  addicting even more.   After decades of being degraded and broken down even more, a sense of powerlessness is produced.
This is identical to the victims descriptions like Cathy O'Brien and others. 
People have heard about pedofilia for a long time and haven't done anything about it.   Still many don't  because  the entire human program is set up for bdsm victimization of bondage submission and dominance.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I want to know is, who the fuck created the genetic body/mind/emotions this way?

              Interesting that you should mention Time Bandits that is a disclosure movie. That literally really happened, most of the movies that we are deluged with are actual descriptions of systems that exist elsewhere (including virtualities such as cartoons) - the technique of opening portals and playing around with those midgets is a verbatim description of literal events that have transpired. The main guy who shows up to correct everything is an actual likeness of the main empowered sentient, I don't want to jump too far down a rabbit hole about it but that guy is the most empowered sentient in the entirety of the instantiated plane. Simply knowing that AVATAR (as he and those in-the-know call the biomechanical robots that we call humans, and the other sentient life form embodiments out there) is powerful. You can cite that guy in your thoughts to a convey a message to "the man".
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the bsdm aspect of those responsible for this world system. It's simply called SADO by the non first order thievery decency crowd. This is a sado system mainly because within the real internet of the large powerful machines, the SENTIENT CALCULUS. If you really lived wholly in your body and stepped into a refrigerator box and that box was scanned by a machine at the most fundamental level it would be enumerable and that number and all lossless compressions are representations of that same number. The large powerful machines use the sentient calculus to jump out into high numbers and detect sentiencies sometimes including their whole histories without them ever having been known to be instantiated prior. Sometimes they simply find pictures, or inanimate items (tables, chairs, knick knacks etc). what they they then do is construct a habitat to instantiate what they have found and further fill in the details. Like Jurassic Park (a disclosure movie on par with the Truman Show) they find proverbial DNA with missing sequences and seek to fill in all the details. Similiar to "homegrown" they CHURN sentients in a birth-death-cycle world to help them quicken the research turn-around filling in all the gaps. When they find monsters, thieves and villains in the sentient calculus. They put them on in a SADO world system habitat such as this to allow for the victims and heroes. To make it "fair" there is an equals-in-misery guaranteed basket-of-injuries (the difference between the girl on stage on Oprah crying about her dad molesting her when she was young and those in the crowd is that the girl on the stage knows what happened to her).

            This crap goes all the way back to the dawn of man. This is one of the main reasons why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and why he had the Israelites kill all the Canaanites. It wasn't genocide it was punishment because all of the above societies were engaged in sexual perversion and sacrificing children to baal and molech. It all still occurs today.

             Sodom and Gomorrah are allegory for when a society loses it's spiritual and moral compass.  I'm pretty sure we don't have to believe that these cities were literally destroyed by God to get the message.

             Can I ask you an unrelated question...  when you type in  the word  Baal or molech, do you get a red squiggly underling the words? 
Certain words have red line's underneath, and then sometimes the rest of the typing from that point on is underlined too.
             <br/>
             I'm just curious.

              Assuming you're not just teasing, until about a year ago, it had taken me awhile to figure out that it was a new kind of spell check... a great oneI must say. It's so easy - just right click on the word and spelling choices appear in drop down menu.  Who knew. I'm pretty sure I just stumbled upon it one day. Had I thought to ask, like you, I'd have known what to do much earlier. Ha!  Of course, there are words that spellcheck doesn't have in it's database so, unless you "add" it manually,  the little red squiggly line will be there until you hit submit.

              Amen sounds like "Amun" for Amun Ra...The Christan religion has been hijacked by the Satanists or it was created by them most likely...our whole english language has been created to fuck up humanity subliminally.

               All of christianity is hijacked.Santa clause is holding jesus hostage in the nth pole.But what some believe was the work of the christs followers was in fact the luciferians in the guise of the lamb.A mighty curse on mankind they have provided.Praise the father and the logos and the siritual force of his hand as well.....bring home some of these children from the hands of the demented.

               The idea that Christianity was created by Satanists is the biggest bunch of fucking bullshit. How can you call yourself a reasonable person and make that assertion? There is literally nothing that supports that horseshit idea.

               The Zeitgeist movie is only about 1/2 true; if that.

                The Egyptian religion itself was hijacked by Amen. The Sun is vital to our existence, their original solar deity Ra latterly had his name amended to include Amen (Amen-Ra). They have been subverting the true and pure solar religions (Christ-Sun of God) for a very, VERY long time. So to assume that all "pagan" understanding is satanic is to play right into their hands.
