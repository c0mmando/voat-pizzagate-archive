            Jones has already been cleared by the FBI because they were a set-up, unopened emails sent to him. Doesn't make him any less of a gatekeeper but it certainly shows there are people really out to get him.

             And as a gatekeeper, is this an out for the pedos? "Oh, the cp on my computer was inserted by 4chan people. Just like what happened to AJ" or something like that?

            Medical examiner confirms Sandy Hook dad died by suicide
March 27, 2019
           </p>
           <p>
            "NEWTOWN — The death of a Sandy Hook man who started a brain research foundation after his daughter was killed in the 2012 school shootings was ruled suicide Wednesday by the state medical examiner’s office.
The suicide of 49-year-old Jeremy Richman stunned Newtown and made national headlines as admirers struggled to understand how a scientist who was studying the roots of violence in the brain would take his own life."
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Avielle Foundation that Richman and his wife co-founded after their daughter’s death had an office in the old Edmond Town Hall."
           </p>
           <p>
            "A friend of Richman’s has launched crowdfunding campaign to raise $300,000 for the foundation. The effort raised $145,000 in the first day of the campaign.
“It’s hard to make sense of this, but his legacy and work must continue,” wrote the friend, Ron Conway, on the crowdfunding site, Go Fund Me."

             Check out the sus photos of Avielle. Tiny, blurred, only one showing her face. REALLY? Those are her "best shots?"  And of course, they had recently moved to Sandy Hook from CALIFORNIA. And, she had an older sister....

             “There is evidence of false identity. Sandy Hook appears to have been a virtual-reality event, which set up huge revenue streams of income for certain Newtown residents. Thus ‘Avielle Rose Richman’, for example, seems to have been Lenie Urbina, whose parents Curtis and Richmond Urbina are both directly associated with the Newtown area synagogue. They seem to have loaned their daughter—or at least a picture of her—for this event: the alleged-parents Jeremy Richman and Jennifer Hensel were thereby able to establish the ‘Avielle Foundation’ and its smart website on 14 December 2012, the very day of the ‘shooting.’ This aimed to raise $5m in the first year.” pg. 242

"“Grace loved owls, so that’s why we chose this theme,” explained Featherstone director Ann Smith as art camp children aged three to early teens sat in clusters on and around the porch, listening. “So these are in Grace’s memory.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Grace Audrey McDonnell, a lifelong (Martha's) Vineyard visitor and aspiring young artist, died in Newtown, Conn. in December 2012 at the age of seven. This summer, thanks to a gift from her parents Chris and Lynn McDonnell, 10 scholarships helped pay for Island children to attend art camp at Featherstone.""
            </p>
            <p>
             It marked the first gift from the Grace McDonnell Art Fund, based in Fairfield, Conn., Ms. Smith said. “We were honored and pleased that the McDonnells made this their very first gift,” she said, speaking to the Gazette later about the scholarship fund.

            There was another post on Voat yesterday that addressed the FBI warning Alex he was being setup for this. They must have been watching him in order to know that. If so, they should know who set him up.
