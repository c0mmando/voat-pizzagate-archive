            The swirl on the shirt is a dead give away. Pedo for sure. They should make a law that anyone caught displaying a swirl of any kind is automatically guilty of child trafficking.

             I think that's pushing things a but much.  I'll bet 100.00 if you did a brief dive on Joey, there are the usual indicators - kids' charities, haiti, foster, etc.

            You guys are going insane with the pedo symbol stuff, as if everywhere you see a swirl is proof of pedophilia. This is bullshit. The vast majority of child sex criminals don't advertise at all. All this does is discredit pedogate which is very likely the entire reason for threads like this to exist. The establishment wants to paint us as crazy conspiracy theorists and all this symbol talk plays right into that. Pedophilia is rampant and needs to be fought but this isn't helping anything except to make us all paranoid that every swirl means pedo.

             I have to disagree, and I am a firm believer that when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  First, note the huge amount of celebrities that have been identified wearing known pedophile symbols, usually in the form of jewelry.
            </p>
            <p>
             Secondly, the concentric triangle is NOT part of "Hawaiian shirt patterns".  Look
             <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hawaiian+shirts&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjumI-3193bAhVDgpAKHZWgALAQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=949">
              here
             </a>
             .  The shirt isn't - "welllll, maybe I can kinda see it."  It's pretty frigging obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
             Next, we aren't talking about any old actor.  We are talking about an actor who made his name appearing on a show with a lot of suspected weirdos.  Including the Olsen twins.  And that actor just appeared out of nowhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, do you or anyone you know wear any clothing or accessories with any of the known pedo symbols?  I sure don't.  And I know no one who does.

              I don't either but it does not IMO imply anything sinister about the wearer of clothing like that. To make that assumption is ridiculous and is the very thing we don't want pizzagate to be associated with. This helps the establishment much more than it helps us by making it appear as if we will label anyone a pedophile over a meaningless symbol. You have not convinced me at all that you are right if this is the only defense you have. Some pedos like to advertise but they are in a minority. It makes us as a group look like fools when we do this. I want no part of it. If you don't have anything except a swirl to paint someone as a Pedo, you should just not post anything rather than BS that anyone can see is nothing. I'm tired of beating this dead horse. I've made my point.

                I may have been a member here for only 19 days but I've been a truth seeker for fucking ever. I'm not lecturing you. I'm telling you the way I see it and the way I will always see it. There is plenty of hard evidence to be tracked down before we all go off with our butterfly nets chasing meaningless symbols and crying Pedo every time we see a swirl. Go after CPS instead of chasing symbols.

            People - WAKE UP!  This is a big name commercial, released a month or two ago, featuring a not-so-famous actor, WEARING A SHIRT W/ PEDO SWIRLS (very obvious), who gained his fame starring with the MK (Olsen) twins and Bob Saget.  This isn't a stretch.  This is in your face.

                Though, I’m puzzled as to the reasons why fake news sites always insist on using that particular typography and layout that’s so characteristic of fake news sites. If I ran a fake news site, I’d create one which didn’t look like a fake news site. Jus’ sayin’.
