When it comes to pizza gate, we know that its a satanic cult that loves its symbols. We also know that they traffic humans, blood and organs. We also know that they will go into areas that are hit with a disaster or war countries. What is the largest organization that is known as humanitarian and the first to respond? The Red Cross. The Red Cross is the symbol for the Knights of Templar.
I decided to search for a connection between the Red Cross and the Clinton Foundation. I found one link.
<a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/beneficiary-registration-kits-british-red-cross">https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/beneficiary-registration-kits-british-red-cross</a>
In 2013, BT committed to extending an existing partnership with the British Red Cross by providing $75,000 in funding to support the development of three Beneficiary Registration Kits (BRK), that are comprised of: mobile devices, plastic cards, and bar-code printers. The BRKs will enable Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies to distribute assistance during and following disasters in a more efficient and targeted manner. Using lessons from previous disaster situations, the BRKs will be prepositioned in three regional locations including: Panama for the Americas, Kuala Lumpur for Asia Pacific, and Nairobi for Africa. The BRKs will then be deployed to disaster situations across these regions as needed.
Beneficiary Registration Kits (BRK) &lt;--This is the only place I can find this phrase. I really don\'t know what this is or what the Plastic cards are used for. I can make a guess that its a field kit for setting up a quick communications network, but why not say this?
The important question to ask is why the link to the Red Cross in these 3 countries? When I google clinton foundation and any of those 3 locations, I find years of stories involving the Clintons involvement in there.
In Panama the Clintons pop up in lots of stories about their association with people in the panama papers. No big surprise, but I can\'t seem to search past these results, My google-fu is weak it seems. I was thinking this link would let them traffic through the canal, but it seems inspections or crew visas aren\'t needed to go through the canal.
Kuala Lumpur pulls up several bits of corruption involving the clintons. Also found out Hillary forced a change in power there during her time at the State Department.
in Nairobi for Africa I can\'t find a whole lot, but I did find a Podesta email trying to troubleshoot a problem there.
Anyone got any google fu tips on drilling deeper into these things? I think a lot of the core things the Clinton foundation does can be linked to these 3 places. Is this idea too much of a stretch or not clear?</p>',

           <p>
            The Red Cross got its name giving symbol from the inversion of the Swiss flag, in honour its founder, Henry Dunant. The origins of the symbol on the Swiss flag, white cross on red, can be traced back to the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_thousand_martyrs">
             Cult of Ten-Thousand Martyrs
            </a>
            , which predate the Knights Templar by approximately two centuries.

            Cards, cell phones, voting data - all a way to track ppl w/out saying we r tracking you.  Every time you fill something out it is entered into a database and used /sold.  When you fill out paperwork for benefits w/ Red Cross they ask about dependents/children.  This is a way to collect personal info and track ppl.  If you have "location" enabled on your cell, this makes it even easier.  Notice when you post, email, text it from your cell, it has your location.  I only turn mine on when I check the weather.

              Makes sense, though - "we will "help" you if you give us all of your info".  Living down here I Katrina land, it was common for ppl to have to ask for help.  I remember listening to the radio/news and families were separated when they were taking ppl from the Superdome.  That is one of the worst memories I have - listening to a father tell how his little girl was taken on a bus and he had to stay behind.  They only let elderly, women and children first.  The men had to stay and wait. It was so sad to hear him say that he had no idea where they had taken his little girl.  That stayed with me until a few months later when I heard him say that he found the little girl in Atlanta.  When a disaster hits, you have to make hard choices.  Thank God that we were able to leave before the storm.  Anyway, this is also a way to separate the parents from the children.  What a perfect disguise  - a charity.  I am not saying the Red Cross is bad, but who else has access to the info?  They use the data to "plan" in case of another emergency.

             Just after nine o’clock, community members are let into the school courtyard. The first thing they do is sit down and listen to Nepal Red Cross technical officer Sarita Dhungana. She explains how to use aquatabs correctly to purify water as well as demonstrates some good hygiene practices, such as the proper way to wash hands. She then moves on to explain how to use the tarpaulins and shelter kits correctly.

            The fact that there is very little info available on what the purpose of this arrangement is seems to be telling in and of itself. Definitely worth looking into further.

             I think the lack of interest is because there have already been a zillion threads about this. One problem with so many new members is that duplicate threads are swamping the forum. Probably 90% of threads.

            I think plastic cards are like debit cards with money on them to give clients. This is what they do for people in the US (for fire victims etc), so the cards would need to be printed and the money allowance issued to the card for each client.
