<p>Hey fellow Pizzagaters, Pedogaters, citizen journalists and anyone who doesn\'t like the idea of the elite fucking children for their own power pleasure.</p>
<p>There\':s so much I want to say but I will apologize in advance for the lengthiness of this post, but I needed it to be as raw as I am feeling. Please, please stick with this through and give me some constructive feedback.</p>
<p>This is relevant to Pizzagate directly because if it werent for this subverse and my own Pizzagate research, this would have never come to fruition.</p>
<p>I\'ve lurked this subverse for a LONG time. Since the original Podesta leaks and all the spirit cooking shenanigans were being uncovered. </p>
<p>Since then, things for me have been honestly very rough. Most people can identify with the fact that finding out the worlds elite and the seemingly unstoppable corruption that has engulfed the world is in large part due to psychopaths with a power fetish that goes beyond any human decency is pretty &quot;startling&quot; to say the least.</p>
<p>Seeing the placement of a false flag(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr_qRF-CVME">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr_qRF-CVME)</a>) ,</p>
<p>a fake Russian hack story(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2G360HrSAs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2G360HrSAs)</a>),</p>
<p>countless news entities supposedly &quot;debunking&quot; Pizzagate(<a href="http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/">http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/</a> ,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html?mcubz=0)</p>
<p>and seeing that God awful interview with Megyn Kelly softballing Alefantis(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omHKT9sqs48">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omHKT9sqs48)</a>)</p>
<p>this only proves we hit an unexpected nerve. A nerve that runs DEEP. So deep it infects both sides of the aisle in the US and UK, most of the banking cartels, the Church, etc </p>
<p>This kind of adversity and depth to such a sickening problem that should UNITE ALL PEOPLE on ALL FRONTS has been dismissed totally as nothing more than babbling of Alex Jones and the newly termed &quot;alt right&quot; which, to the MSM is nothing more than Nazis that want to watch the world burn. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y</a></p>
<p>These revelations have struck me so hard they took large pieces of my life away from me out of pure, crippling depression. I already had depression, and would have bouts of rainy days, but this effected me to the bottom dwellings of my soul. Through this search for the devil I had a brief detachment from my faith followed by becoming closer than ever to God - many don\'t agree with this sentiment, which is fine - -: so long as you don\'t fuck kids, k? </p>
<p>I used to be an avid BJJ and MMA enthusiast who was in shape for competing most days out of the year. I\'ve done grappling tournaments at expert levels(no ADCC or Worlds, Im only a purple belt) and I was well on my way to becoming a cage fighter. </p>
<p>A lot of different things played a role in my squandering of this potential - a major death in the family, and this were heavy pieces. </p>
<p>As I dug deeper into myself trying to find my way back to God, I realized that the people that have been integral in my life have all fallen victim in some way or another to rape/pedophilia. So much so that putting it all together has filled me with clarity and determination to make a difference in this area, even if it kills me. </p>
<p>To me, it doesn\'t feel like coincidence that I came to these revelations of family members and close friends being associated with this egregious subject. To me, it feels like God has shown me these things with the gift of conviction to end it. He has shown me these things and is saying &quot;Now what are you going to do about it?&quot;</p>
<p>That leads me to this. I have to work with what I got:</p>
<pre><code>I love MMA, and Im GOOD at it and Im young as fuck (21).

I am a good speaker when it comes to the things I\'m passionate about

I have a passion that burns me from the inside out to stop these people.

I\'m a fairly serious digital marketer.
</code></pre>

<p>My conclusion?</p>
<p>Cage fighting with a true purpose. None of this &quot;I love MMA let me test my skills and be the best EVER&quot; I believe that\'s fine and dandy - but it isnt my mindset and that\'s one reason I walked away from MMA(never BJJ though, that wasnt until pg) I am passionate about the sport but I couldnt see myself being the UFC world champion so I said to myself &quot;if I cant see that, theres no point&quot; because you will LOSE and BADLY to the guy who has given his all and MORE to be the BEST. The man that\'s hungrier gets it, not necessarily the most talented. </p>
<p>But all that has changed now. I don\'t care if Im champion, I don\'t care if I\'m the best - I want to fight and put my body on the line using a God given talent to help bring awareness to THIS. Because THIS MATTERS. THIS is what I\'m willing to die in the cage for. </p>
<p>Stopping these people is what I\'m after and using large stages like Bellator, Titan FC, and the UFC to promote the awareness of elite pedophiles around the world is my goal. I will die for this. This makes me hungrier than anyone else on a roster.</p>
<p>I pledge to take every chance I have at a microphone to praise God and bring awareness to this cause. Pedogate, Pizzagate, whatever you want to call it - we all want the elite pedophiles wiped from society. </p>
<p>I know I\'ll be mocked, with attempts to discredit me. I know the deep state will have me on a list somewhere. I know that I have a long way to go to get my fat ass back into shape (Ii\'d be fighting Heavyweight, or 205. Ive heard rumors of a new 225 weight class and that\'d be up my alley.) </p>
<p>I know this is going to be the hardest thing I\'ve ever done. But I want the people who have worked so hard on bringing this information to the light to be by my side. </p>
<p>I\'m going to start a cause/organization aimed at ending elite pedophilia across the globe and I\'m going to name it &quot;Tap out Pedophilia&quot; but I am open to suggestions for the name in the comments.</p>
<p>I will be starting a Youtube(vid.me?)channel going over different pieces of this investigation and the history behind it in a digestable and easy to understand format. While trying to build a following of MMA fans. </p>
<p>I will begin an instagram account dedicated to tracking my progress to keep me on track</p>
<p>I will create a Facebook page to be shared across the platform </p>
<p>I\'m an internet marketer on the side to try and pay the bills ao those wont ve a problem. If you need leads to your local business that DOESNT fuck kids, I\'m your man.</p>
<p>Some fight for fame and fortune, and I say that\'s great if that comes, but all glory would be to God and my goal is to make men like John Podesta infamous. </p>
<p>I\'m fighting for the victims of child exploitation around the world. You can\'t beat this fire inside me. Win or lose I will make a difference.</p>
<p>What do you all think? Any suggestions on improving this idea? I welcome any and all support. I know there\'ll be trolls, disinfo agents, but it comes with something as threatening to the deep state as this is.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>',

            I wanna say I'm really grateful for all of the support. It has boosted my motivation even more.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm running with "Tap Out Child Trafficking" as the name of the movement I'm attempting to start. I gotta thank Vindicator and Eyesopen for that awesome suggestion.
           </p>

            Working on creating my channel, special email, Facebook page, and Instagram. Tonight was my first night back onto the mats and I'm tired, but more excited to get back than I have been in a long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            God bless you all for the kind, motivating words as well as helpful suggestions and tips. I will be interested in networking with anyone who is familiar with Youtubing this subject so that I may bounce ideas around for formatting. Contact me if you're interested or refer me to whoever you think might be!

            I do have a question about your choice of name for the venture, "Tap out Pedophilia."  Being involved in MMA, you are no doubt aware that Tapout is a sports clothing company that caters to the MMA crowd.
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tap+out+clothing&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">
             https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tap+out+clothing&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web
            </a>
            This along with your statement that you are a digital marketer has me wondering whether you're associated with Tapout.  If not, I would guess it's probably best to avoid a potential legal headbutt over the name, especially if Tapout's owners don't share your views about pizza/pedogate.

             Tap and Out are separated for this reason (: if they were still somehow able to take legal action I would oblige and just change it to "Submit Child Trafficking"!

            Great post op. Thank you for your being so sincere. Maybe Tap-Out Child Trafficking to focus more on the children. Sorry about the death and your depression. I go through dark days myself. Your post has inspired me to do more. I can't to see your organization pop up on social media, I'll definitely be following. There are a lot of great citizen investigators on here that have incredible work. Good luck in all you do, and much thanks to you and all the good people on here.

            Thank you! I had  a purple belt the kwon do but, no fighter here. I respect your determination and willingness to fight for for lives of children. Children need to be children not objects, not art, nor enslaved.  The public does need a motto or something, some peopke are just gullible and think everyones going to help them with their kids, not hurt their kids. Coaches, Ckergy, child advocates, foster services... horrible. Systemic violence against children, let alone the pedophilia hidden within high society, we have come to learn. We can't swallow. We can't digest this, because of what we know.
 Ideas for you??? It's a great idea you have, and self defense is a great thing to practice.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was talk about the Gracie logo, errrrr...nobody knows. It has the boylover logo...or not?
But I took jujitsu, after I was assaulted, seriously assaulted. It was AMAZING!! I learned cool things, how to flip a 300lb man off my belly. Wow! Jujitsu is really really cool mathematical grappling. That was in Hawaii where there is abundant martial arts training, back in California I continued with two kwon do practice. What about demonstrations of form? I have seen the art of sword drawing, and that was actually the specialty of my######.Yeah , there are alot allot of fuct up people in martial arts too. Like the hardcore 5 blackbelts, secret fags that go out as chica at night in drag? Oh yeah, then I found that there's also fucking martimartial arts churches for gay fucks who can't get straight, or wanna be tranny. Cause all this was happening in my life. Like, oh cool! There's a church in gonna check out, with a really cool pastor. I be like, that's amazing your so faithful to God. Cause Im a total dumbfuk and DID not  see it commin.i guess I m mixing up advice with my experience. As soon as I said FORM, it all came back. But as far as your idea, a demonstration of FORM, might be less lethal for your health. I don't wanna see you get hurt because you are needed. Passion like yours is needed.

            Killing one gay pedophile at a time to make the world a better place. Trust me my sources in Australia when I was a bouncer that told me other real crime facts that panned out confirmed they used to sponsor children's hospitals before the police's war on the bikies to protect pedophiles. By sponsoring Children's hospitals they could find out who needs killing.

             This is vigilanteism and as much as I personally would like to ring the necks of every man that preys on a child I cant support this. But thanks for your comment, God bless.

            Very brave of you to come to this point in your life  ...Maybe you should reach out to Joe Rogan or someone who is connected to the MMA world and see if you can interview fighters and bring awareness to your YT channel

            Awesome Tapout! You're the Ben Hur of the new millennium. :-)  I think this would be a resonant symbol for victims about "fighting back".
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing you might consider: "Pedophelia" (i.e. falling in love with a kid) doesn't technically refer to something illegal, and many pedos consider it something they are born with and cannot do anything about. It gives them victim/protected status as "MAPs" (minor attracted persons) in certain circles. You might want to name yourself after something they
            <em>
             can't
            </em>
            argue with -- sex with kids -- the act, not just the attraction. Tapout Child Rape or Tapout Child Trafficking or Tapout Child Sexual Abuse. Just a thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ever try 5htp? It can really help with depression (don't mix it with prescription meds).
           </p>
           <p>
            One last tidbit: Once you start posting your YouTube videos, make sure you stay on the right side of Voat's spam policy. We've had shills use it to silence pizzagate researchers by getting their domain banned by spamming only their content. Voat only allows 5 out of every 10 posts to be linked to sites a user controls (your own content). Check out the FAQ at the veeeerry bottom of the page for more info.
           </p>
           <p>
            Carry on. We are rooting for you!

             This means a lot to me coming from you Vindicator. I REALLY like the idea of "Tap Out Child Trafficking" maybe even "Tap Out Human Trafficking" if I wanted it to be more broad, but I have to say while its all egregious I particularly become enraged over the innocence lost and lives destroyed before they ever begin.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have actually tried 5htp, but I had no luck. I've found an alternative that has helped me a lot in clearing the fog I can sometimes get lost in.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for the tips on the YT videos, once I get that rolling I'll be careful only to post them to voat once in awhile to keep you guys semi- up to date and anyone else will just have to subscribe.  The channel will predominantly be about digestable redpilling, I see too many George Webbs, by that I mean a kind of all-over-the-place very complicated red pilling. But to the inverse of that we have David Seamans that just talk over and over about the same things with some recent news thrown in here and there. (Ive since stopped watching both of them for different reasons, Webb being a shill, Seaman just trying to profit)  I want a happier medium.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks a million for your support Vindicator. God bless brother

            I am sorry to hear about the death in your family and your depression.  I know of this, for I have it in my family as well.  Your plans are many and big.  Don't start too big all at once.  Start big enough to be noticed and then add on.  We on here are committed to doing this for as long as it takes and some have been at this for years.  I hope you have a few people with you that will help get you started.  What you are planning is quite a huge ontaking, but you sound like you have a lot of spirit and heart.  We are here to help.

             Indeed, this is a long road ahead.  I just feel relieved to have this road because its the one that's best for my soul.  Thank you for your support, God bless.
