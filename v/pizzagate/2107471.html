<p><strong>Meet Joseph Safra, The Richest Banker On The Planet</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His name is Joseph Safra, he\'s 73 years-old and he\'s worth $13.8 billion, according to Forbes and is #52 on their list. Currently, he lives in Brazil, but he was born in Beirut, Lebanon to a Jewish banking family whose wealth dates back to the Ottoman Empire. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-joseph-safra-the-richest-banker-on-the-planet-2012-3">http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-joseph-safra-the-richest-banker-on-the-planet-2012-3</a></p>
<p><strong>The family\'s banking history originated with caravan trade between Aleppo, Alexandria and Constantinople during the Ottoman Empire.</strong> The Safras relocated to Beirut after the First World War because the city was home to a thriving Jewish community. After facing anti-Jewish riots in Beirut following the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, the family moved to Brazil in 1955, where they started working by financing letters of credit for trade in Sao Paulo.</p>
<p><strong>In 1956 the family divided their businesses, with Edmond settling in Geneva to set up a private bank, the Trade Development Bank.  His brothers chose to stay in Brazil.</strong> Edmond also founded the Republic National Bank of New York in 1966, which he sold to HSBC in 1999 along with its sister company Safra Republic Holdings for $10.3M  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2014/06/15/moise-safra-brazilian-billionaire-banker-dead-at-79/#2b471eee2f87">https://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2014/06/15/moise-safra-brazilian-billionaire-banker-dead-at-79/#2b471eee2f87</a></p>
<p>Joseph Safra   <strong>runs the Brazilian banking and investment empire, Safra Group.

<p><strong>in 2015, Safra Group acquired Chiquita , formerly United Fruit, which had ties to Dulles Brothers who ran the CIA and State Dept. during MK ULtra program.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiquita Brands International grows, procures, markets, and sells bananas and other fresh fruits under the Chiquita name and third parties. Chiquita\'s products are sold in nearly 70 countries. In 2015, a joint venture formed by agribusiness Grupo Cutrale and J. Safra Group acquired Chiquita which is now privately-owned with its principal offices in Rolle, Switzerland and Fort Lauderdale, North America.http://www.chiquita.com/about-chiquita/about-us</p>
<p>On May 3, 1998, the Cincinnati Enquirer published an expose titled “Chiquita Secrets Revealed” by Mike Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter. The articles detailed Chiquita’s complicity in international drug trafficking, bribing foreign government officials, suppressing the unionization of workers and poisoning employees with hazardous pesticides....Before Chiquita Brands International, the company started in 1899 as United Fruit Company. Both a representative of J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation and a law partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, <strong>Allen Dulles had economic and legal ties to United Fruit. From 1946-1950, Allen Dulles served as Director of the Council on Foreign Relations. On August 23, 1951, he was appointed Deputy Director of the CIA. Exactly a month before Allen Dulles became appointed the Director of the CIA on February 26, 1953, his brother, John Foster Dulles, became the US Secretary of State.</strong>
In 1952, democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz succeeded in passing the Agrarian Reform Act. Arbenz reimbursed the company at their declared tax value of the land. United Fruit lost millions of dollars. On June 27, 1954, CIA officers E. Howard Hunt and Phil Roettinger orchestrated the coup d’etat ousting Arbenz in a covert operation designated PBSUCCESS. Arbenz fled the country while United Fruit regained the land.
Corporate raider Eli M. Black renamed the company United Brands in 1970. Black mismanaged the company and eventually committed suicide by jumping out of his office from the 44th floor. The SEC was investigating him at the time for bribing Honduran President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano with $2.5 million. <a href="https://wearechange.org/blood-and-bananas-chiquitas-deadly-history-drugs-corruption-coverups/">https://wearechange.org/blood-and-bananas-chiquitas-deadly-history-drugs-corruption-coverups/</a></p>

One rumors have it involving gold smuggling.  Others rumors involve the Russians.  His wife, Lily, is a mysterious character, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highly secretive, Edmond J. Safra died in a pre-dawn incident when two alleged masked intruders reportedly got into the heavily-secure building in Monaco, and started a fire in or near his two-story penthouse apartment. His copper-domed dwelling is atop a six-story pink stucco building containing the branch of the bank he founded and of which he was the major owner, the Republic National Bank of New York and its subsidiaries such as Safra Republic Holdings of Luxembourg. He lived a short distance from the Grimaldi family royal palace and the Monte Carlo Casino. 
<strong>Safra was officially a resident of the tax-haven principality notorious for its gold smuggling and its shoreline docks and warehouses used to transfer contraband worldwide</strong>. [SEE FOOTNOTE ONE.] Ships, some reportedly without names or identification, load and unload there.

<p>The Safras are Sephardic Jews and strongly discouraged their brother, Edmond from marrying and becoming the 4th husband of Lily Monteverde, whose second husband \'committed suicide\', because she is an Ashkenazi Jew. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Safra">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Safra</a></p>',

            Highly secretive, Edmond J. Safra died in a pre-dawn incident when two alleged masked intruders reportedly got into the heavily-secure building in Monaco, and started a fire in or near his two-story penthouse apartment. His copper-domed dwelling is atop a six-story pink stucco building containing the branch of the bank he founded and of which he was the major owner, the Republic National Bank of New York and its subsidiaries such as Safra Republic Holdings of Luxembourg. He lived a short distance from the Grimaldi family royal palace and the Monte Carlo Casino.

             Comey or his brothers involvement in HSBC where they created 10,000s of 'private accounts' to launder just under $10,000 a time then closed them down straight after, so the amounts would not flag up as suspicious

            That is great work Commoner. I'm now beginning to think that there's no such thing as a wealthy person who is altruistic and not involved in some nefarious, illegal criminal acts.
           </p>
           <p>
            The brother, Edmond, supposedly died in a fire.  Whispers around Monaco were that he was found with two bullets in him.  A witness reported that two masked intruders had broken into the apartment. Rumours swirled that an incendiary had been thrown into his apartment from outside.  The nurse who died with him was found with her throat crushed.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was rumoured that Edmond had been pressed to allow his jet to be used to move money during the Iran-Contra affair.  It was said that he laundered money for Noriega and the Columbian drug cartels.  A few days before his death he was seen in Cannes arguing angrily with two Russians.  At Cape D'Antibes he was said to have met with Russian oligarch Berezovsky (who was complicit in funnelling tens of millions of dollars from Aeroflot, which was government-owned).  Edmond had worked with the FBI re. the Russians laundering money through his bank.  Word is that the Russians were none too happy about this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edmond had two nurses with him at the time, one of whom was Maher.  Maher lit a fire during the intrusion to let off the smoke alarms in an effort to alert someone and get help.  But Maher was set up as the patsy.  He was held and tortured for three days and forced to sign a French confession--although Maher spoke no French.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jean-Christophe Hullin, chief investigative judge on the case disclosed that a hush-hush, pre-trial meeting was held among himself, Monaco’s chief prosecutor and another member of the defense team headed by Griffith. The three allegedly agreed Maher should be convicted and get 10 years in jail. A jury of three judges and three laymen did just that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where there's money there's corruption and crime.
