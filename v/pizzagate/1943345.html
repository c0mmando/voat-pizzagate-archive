<p>Podesta\'s middle finger bears a deep scar where it appears chunks have been dug out, healed and re-damaged. Abramovich refers to \'cutting deeply into the middle finger &amp; eating the pain\'. Sacrificing fingers to satan appears common in rituals:

Michelle Remembers is a book about a child\'s memories of ritual abuse. She talks about people having their middle fingers cut off. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Remembers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Remembers</a>

I notice that every single article about Laurence Pazder\'s book Michelle Remembers refers to it being \'debunked\', \'discredited\' and a case of false memory syndrome. Pazder was later called upon to act as an expert in the McMartin Preschool trial. No wonder victims don\'t come forward--they\'re vilified by the judicial system and the press. They\'re told they\'re wrong, they\'re maligned and branded as \'attention-seeking\' and \'crazy\'. And their therapists don\'t come forward either:
“Good luck with your life,” said another child therapist, one of whose patients is among the children making such accusations. “My car was blown up ten days ago.”

Here is another article with firsthand accounts of child victims of satanic rituals. It talks about the therapists not speaking because of death threats and threats of violence towards family members. The children give personal accounts of rituals, being hung upside down, being forced to eat faeces and drink blood and urine. 
..they take little children and tie them up; put them In cages and tunnels; beat and torture them; turn them upside down and hold them in water; cut, stab and rape them; force them to eat their feces and drink their urine and blood; and disembowel, dismember and kill them while ejaculating

Lastly, the following mentions politicians being expected to do things before being chosen to be elected; a city under Washington DC where satanic rituals are performed; Jay Z and Kanye and other artists being raped, sodomised before being allowed to become famous.

            "Satan" and the "Devil" as well as "Hell" are the invention of the male mind and reflects their fear
and desire to control society via organized patriarchal religions, using the Boogey Men of their delusions.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Old World Religions are based in Nature --
           </p>
           <p>
            "Those in power get to rewrite history and the Old Religions the Shamanism of Europe which preceded Judaism, Christianity and Islam by thousands of years was demonized and the old Gods/Goddesses were then co-opted as 'Saints' or demonized, as well."
           </p>
           <p>
            "But, of course, there is no devil in the Old Religions and witches certainly didn't worship them.
He belongs strictly to the religions of the Bible.
He's their demon, their personification of evil, their shadow, and it is time for members of the 
Biblical faith to stop projecting him onto others and simply deal with their own darkness."

            Wouldn't surprise me if this was his/her job.  Want Ad: Are you an asshole with no moral compass or consideration for humanity?  Do you like to be a drain on society, and does it pleasure you to bring others grief?  Are you willing to do anything asked of you as long as you and yours gets some?  Do you have no ability to think outside your bubble, or foresight to see what impact you might have on the rest of society to support psychopaths running our world?  Well come on down to the Brock-Podesta-Clinton job fair!

            a non-healing incision or infection could result in missing 'chunks' or depressions near or along scars, left pinkie def looks affected as well... the drawings are stranger to me.... you could easily slot a finger ritually and have it close up with no scar at all... also i don't always see the band-aid, could easily be p-shopped?

            Actually, no. Podesta suffers from Dupuytren's Contracture and has had surgeries to free the tendons in his hand.
           </p>
           <p>
            Proof:

             Wikileaks email

            to the infamous Tamera Luzatto
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Subj: Dupuytren's Advance Info for John  Podesta
            </p>
            <p>
             Hi Tamera, On a routine visit to our Dr. Li, he gave me an abstract for a September N.Eng. J. of Med. article touting the success of a study injecting collagenase into Dupuytren's cords. Although not yet approved by the FDA, Dr. Li thinks this is big news and recommended I check it out with my hand surgeon as an alternative to my next surgery.

             Sorry to call you out on this Vindicator but Podesta has deep scars all over his hands.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at his
             <a href="http://tracytwyman.com/wp-content/uploads/podestahands.jpg">
              right pinky finger
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             That's not something surgery would do to address Dupuytrens Contracture. Also the band aid on his left middle finger is exactly where Abramovic tells her "audience" to cut themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then there's the fact John Podesta's altar ego is a guy named Skippy who we now know orders hits on people. Given John Podesta claims to be an Enlightened Progressive offing his enemies is definitely NOT de rigueur.
            </p>
            <p>
             John Podesta is a very sick man upstairs where it counts. Satan worship would easily explain many of his "life choices". Disturbingly John Podesta being a Jesuit could also explain many of the same things. Jesuit's are not Satan worshipers but the Pope gave them the power to do many of the same things.

             I'm surprised Vindicator you haven't looked at Podesta's hands more closely.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is a photo of his RIGHT hand:
             <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b84rd/john_podestas_right_hand_is_mutilated_with_scars/">
              https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b84rd/john_podestas_right_hand_is_mutilated_with_scars/
             </a>
             Whilst his right hand displays linear scars on the palm indicative of a fascietomy, the large part of the finger which has the skin completely gone does not.  In a fascietomy, the skin is cut in a zig zag, usually on the palm and sometimes a short way up the finger.  What a fascietomy does NOT do is take large chunks of skin off a finger and/or palm and not replace it.    Here are hands recovering from a fascietomy:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a photo of his LEFT hand:
             <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/3525866/posts">
              http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/3525866/posts
             </a>
             Note that there is a bandaid on his MIDDLE finger.  That finger or hand has no signs of having had a fascietomy.  A simple bandaid would not be used to cover the sutures if it had.
            </p>
            <p>
             And if you recall, Abramovich's line was "With a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of the right hand"--exactly the finger that has the bandaid on it.

              Thanks for all of that information, Piscina. I hadn't seen an up-close picture like that. That pinky looks like a skin graft gone wrong or a burn. Yuck. Having seen this up close now, I tend to agree with you...there is probably something more than Dupuytren's going on here. Although, the top comment in that Reddit post you linked does say it looks just like the commenter's dad's hands, who has Dupuytren's.

             True -- I often think that both Bill and Hillary were part of CIA's MKULTRA as children -- 
We very definitely know that Bill was involved in Operation Chaos spying on the left and VN protesters.
Both Bill and Hillary had fathers involved it seems in organized crime.
We also again saw Bill and Hillary working for and being protected by the CIA in the Mena, Ark drug running for the CIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             John Stockwell, ex CIA and whistleblower often refers to the CIA as "Catholics In Action."
            </p>
            <p>
             But again -- "Satan" and the "Devil" and "Hell" are creations of organized patriarchal religions --
the Old Testament/Hebrew was written to cement patriarchy and the New Testament/Christianity continued on with a violent god
and other held its control over nations via violence, Crusades, Witch Hunts.
            </p>
            <p>
             The RCC held Jews for 1,100 years in Jewish Ghettoes in the Papal States thus preparing the nations of the Papal States for the Germany Holocaust.  After WWII and the German Holocaust, the Catholic Church was called to "Confession" to their "co-responsibility and guilt" for the Jewish Holocaust in Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even after ALL Jews were released from the Jewish Ghettoes in France by the French, and in Italy by Italians ... the RCC went on another 100 years still issuing its vile propaganda against Jews and it was distributed by their vast propaganda network via journals and pamphlets.
