            Yes, Interesting, they are definitely trying to distort and bend the language into something less harmful. It may seem innocuous but the long term desensitizing effect eventually slides The Overton Window on your morality that much more ever so slowly year after year toward that licentiousness. Language is magick and words are spells.

            It's time we get  Heather Marsh back in here with her epic piece on how the Pedophile Information Exchange and the cultist child molesters around the world are using language to justify their actions and slowly turn the perception of the crime into an acceptable form of expression.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The propaganda arm of this international ring of torturers which attempted to normalize abuse of children and babies as ‘sex’ is still very apparent in the corporate media coverage of the CSA inquiry which depicts the torture and murder of children as “sex attacks on kids”, “child sex” or a “sex scandal”. Sex is not an attack. This is not sex. The fact that these people tortured and murdered children in their recreational hours does not make them simply pedosadists, or what corporate media still likes to call pedophiles in acquiescence to PIE’s demands that they be depicted as ‘child-lovers’. Their recreation may have revolved around torturing children, but their office hours as UK media and government establishment revolved around torture and mass murder of people from all demographics. It is not sufficient to call them psychopaths or sociopaths since very few of those seriously harm others and almost none to this extent. These people who want to be known as child lovers are death eaters. They feed on the agony of others. They torture and murder not because they have to, but because it feeds something in them. The only reason they are attracted to children is the increase in pain, horror, power, and taboo. They are no less attracted to mass slaughter than they are to the torture of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             The UK media depiction of the subjects of the so-called Child Sexual Abuse inquiry as paedophiles is a very deliberate propaganda exercise and attempt to manipulate public opinion. People who rape, torture and murder are not child lovers. The victims of these people were not only children. The phrase ‘paedophile’ brings the focus from the vicim to their assailant, and the pseudo-medical op-eds claim a right for understanding for death eaters, not the children. The use of the word paedophile individualizes the problem and is an attempt to pretend there are a ‘few bad apples’ instead of an entire ruling society complicit in the cover up and normalization of the torture and murder of others.

            I like how they try to tacitly authorize his pedo ways..like he has to fuck kids to be an artist..and her parents were filth allowing the old chomo near their daughter..she is trying to validate,that she was just a cum dumpster for sick old pedos,and now she is useless and wants to be validated by allowing it. Ick.and liking it...so the moral of that story is ..once a slutty piece of shit,always a piece of shit.

            This just disgusts me even more and deepens my feelings about him being a pedophile. She was looking for the father she never really had and he knew it.  If anyone still has doubts all I can say is This is as plain as the nose on your face.  She said he only valued her when he found she had left him to work for Fellini his idol.  Pervert.

             Even if true, having sex with a 16 year old does not make you a pedophile.
            </p>
            <p>
             One might have the view that sex with 16 year olds is a bad thing. On the other hand, most human societies historically allowed marriage (and sex therefore) at that age, so that would be a minority view.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even now most societies allow sex with 16 year olds.
            </p>
            <p>
             A pedophile is someone sexually attracted to girls who have not passed through puberty. Few 16 year olds would be in this category.

               We already have pretty good reason to believe he's a child rapist. 2.due to artificial hormones etc girls are hitting puberty earlier and earlier. That does not mean they are ready to consent to sex. Wtf

              The predilection is evidence......i.e. pedophiles who marry women who are skinny and look child like. Off topic, read years ago that Gwyneth Paltro's father was best friends with Steven Speilberg. She went on to marry Brad Pitt, who , I read , came home  from one of George Clooney's parties with a big black eye on the left side. Paltrow was said to belong to the sex club in hollywood. A family member who taught psychology with a sexual component at university level said women who have been abused have a high incidence of suicide, prostitution and alcohol / drug abuse. If a woman does not have to sell her body for money, she will be promiscuous. Our lives in formative years make us who we are. That is one reason the evil pedophiles like infants.This helps with the destruction of one of the most important institutions of a culture, family. I think this is very important to catholics/elites who choose our leaders.........they are satanic and destruction of the planet is their real goal. Nazis hate women and children...so countries which are fascist are the worst on women's rights..America has been behind many other countries which are not thought to be progressive on women and children's rights.

              Only thing is Trump probably just makes deals the whole time because he doesn't drink. Somehow I think that rumors spread about people in the jet set crowd, true or not, let Trump know what they were about before meeting them. If they had something on him, it would have come out by now.

              Yes you're on the money. Read this, it's pretty new I think, all about Trump/Khashoggi/Robert Maxwell/Ghislaine Maxwell/Jeffrey Epstein:
             </p>
             <p>
              "The late disgraced Mossad superspy and media mogul Robert Maxwell (Jewish name: Abraham Leib Hoch, of a Chassidic Jewish Czech family), the father of Epstein’s alleged child-sex procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, held a party on his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine (named after his favourite daughter), sometime in the spring of 1989. Guess who was at that party? Donald Trump. Also on board, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch[1], were Ghislaine Maxwell, former U.S. senator John Tower (of Iran-Contra scandal infamy), and other prominents, like ex-navy secretary John Lehman. Whether Epstein was at that party is anyone’s guess, but it’s certainly plausible, as Robert Maxwell had extensive dealings with bankers and financiers, including the Rothschilds, his “trusted friends” Goldman Sachs, and Lehman brothers. You’ll remember from the first part of this series that Trump’s yacht, Trump Princess, was purchased from Mossad asset and major Iran-Contra player Adnan Khashoggi. Maxwell’s £12-million yacht, Lady Ghislaine, was purchased from one of Khashoggi’s brothers. As we will see, Maxwell himself was a significant player in the Iran-Contra affair on behalf of Israel’s Mossad and, to some extent, the Soviet Union.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ghislaine Maxwell (right) with Abigail Klem, chief brand officer of Ivanka Trump’s clothes and accessories line, at the Felix Rey Valentine’s Day party at The Core Club in New York City, February 14, 2007.
             </p>
             <p>
              So now we have established not only a long-standing relationship between Trump and Epstein but also between Trump and two Maxwells—Robert and his daughter Ghislaine. Trump’s late father Fred personally may have known Robert Maxwell as well, as Fred was involved in major real estate projects that would have interested characters like Maxwell and his money-laundering thug pals in the Soviet Union, who laundered much of their dirty money through New York and Florida—two places in which Donald Trump has primary residences. Donald Trump and Ghislaine could be friends, business partners, acquaintances, or perhaps something more. The trio (including Epstein) has been spotted together on multiple occasions, including when golf magazine writer Michael Corcoran sat with Trump, Ghislaine, and Epstein on Trump’s private plane in order to conduct an interview.[2] In 2007, Ghislaine Maxwell was photographed with Ivanka Trump’s future brand officer of her clothing company at the Felix Rey Valentine’s Day party in New York City in 2007. Trump and Ghislaine may have been intimately involved with each other. Whatever the case, on board Lady Ghislaine that day in 1989, Trump was in the hands of a Mossad super cell."

               I think the catch 22 is that if Trump is outed, there will be attention from what he was outed from. Saw Gayle King interview Woody Allen's daughter on her morning show. She treated her like she was the criminal. She also openly grieved when Charlie Rose got axed...Now she is leaving the show reportedly because of the firings...now with the CEO of Les Moonves...maybe she is really leaving because of all the names of pedophiles  rapists coming out, it might not look good for another one due to association with Oprah. The picture of Oprah and the girl she was offering up to Harvey Weinstein  is damning ......plus her girl's school in Africa having pedophiles working for her. Procurers are an important component.

              Robert Evans basically made Roman Polanski famous. Robert Evans was/is a big-time Satanist type guy. He was also behind the murder of a huge Satanic leader from NYC/Hamptons. Look up "The Cotton Club Murder".
             </p>
             <p>
              Evans had his co-financier murdered. They were producing "The Cotton Club" together with  a big-time cocaine trafficker as well. Evans and the coke trafficker lady had him killed.  And the actor who played the son on Sanford and Son was the bodyguard of the NYC Satanic producer guy who got killed.
