            call Detective Patrick Hawthorne at (805) 388-5119 or call Crime Stoppers at 800-222-TIPS (8477)
           </p>
           <p>
            Should I call and warn them that Pizzagate is likely to rock up in their precinct - with torches and pitchforks?  Adrian can be investigated/warned as appropriate.  Thoughts?
           </p>
           <p>
            Call the local press?  KVTA?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't mind a large number of accidentally-connected people being inconvenienced by police contact if it stops just one of these dreadful "pizza related" incidents from happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not overly keen on the "wrong" Adrian getting beaten/shot/alternatively dealt with.  Or happy families being split up by suspicion.  Or other consequences for innocents.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, something must be done.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might stir the authorities to action or stiffen their resolve to do the right thing.

             Yeah these guys have resources and lucrative careers. The redseven one is involved in all sorts of youth activities. Although it's not concrete, I have a sneaky suspicion it's who I think it is.

            If Millenial blocks you you know you're on the right trail. That being said,  with much power comes much responsibility. And....I feel like people around here give too much away too soon. Maybe best to start subcommittees made up of vetted (as much as possible) individuals (Ie. no shills and shilly "moderators") and communicate through pm. (Then come together/report later when deemed appropriate.) And it might help protect potentially innocent people in this particular case (Ie going through the list).

            This. Zoolander is a slap in our faces, it's a comedy about how models are kidnapped and professionally brainwashed by the owners of the fashion industry to assassinate political leaders.

            Just thoughts:
1) we know the abusers wear costumes to render the story unreportable by the abused
2) Its pretty obvious to me some 'Furries' are involved
            <a href="http://archive.is/GcDJB">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In that link (and there's an older site archive too) you can see actual photos of furries. In most cases there is useful information in the photos - IDENTIFIABLE places and what look like some very SPECIALISED name tags.
           </p>
           <p>
            If your following the costume route I think this is relevant. Those costumes look very well made (expensive) and possibly unique / one of a kind bespoke work. If you notice the theme they are all CARNIVORES Wolves, lions etc. Even the friendly looking lion has devil horns.

            In Eyes Wide Shut, it was alleged that a fashion designer was the guy 'leading' the secret society's occult ritual (i.e. the guy in the red cloak, played by Leon Vitali).
           </p>
           <p>
            The worlds of fashion, music, entertainment seems to be prime recruiting/indoctrinating grounds for these groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, last scene in Eyes Wide Shut, it is implied that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman 'allow' their daughter to be taken by two old men, while the two main characters are thinking about 'f***'ing.  And of course, Stanley Kubrick's daughter was basically kidnapped and brainwashed by Scientology.

             Maybe the movie was based on "the clothing shop network" which is basically what we're investigating. The core of pizzagate. The clothing shop network was a brownstone operation where Jeffery Epstein and a clothing designer teamed together to gather and use blackmail evidence against the powerful elite of the world. No this isn't a pinky and the brain episode this is real. So certainly the angle taken in the movie, as well as connections to fashion design are interesting to me.

             No wonder Katie Holmes tried so hard to get their daughter away from him.  I know there are other stars that have tried to wrest themselves from the clutches of Scientology.  John Travolta is also suspect.  Remember when his son was found dead in the shower? Or I think that was the story.  Also he has had charges of sexual advances being made by him.

              I think the Fashion industry is inherently sick, the power struggles and egos in the profession and its promotion of vain aesthetics leads credence to the idea that this is the perfect place for grooming to occur, under the guise of modelling, of course. Terry Richardson springs to mind.

               Yes, the photographers have access to many young girls nowadays.  Many decades they used somewhat older models, but I think they started recruiting younger ones for their own sick selfish purpose.  There was a post on here about Dona Karen and her close alliance to Hillary.  Eye opening.

                Many people in positions of power feed off of exploiting those who need them to further their careers. Maybe because they were in the same position once and see it as reaping their rewards of revenge.

                  I think this is why many of us are not in these positions. It takes an insatiable desire of power and control of others to have such a drive.

                   I believe so.  I have not desire to have power of anyone else.  This is the problem we now have.  Too many people fighting each other to be the one to take power over all of us.  We now have to make sure they lose that power.  We now know who most of them are.
