            Totally agreed, but not really a red herring. Here's my take...we don't really know where he was born or who his daddy was.  But the fact that he submitted fake documents should have stopped everything right then and there...know what I mean?  Why even converse/deal with a fake persona?

            BC was always a red herring.  His dad wasn't an American citizen.  Therefore, legally he wasn't a NBC as required by the Constitution.   Whole thing was a scam and Republicans agreed to it because McCain had his own issues and they are part of the Uniparty.  They were fine to let Obama win.  All playing for the same team.
