            I apologize if someone else already made the connection, but there might be one between Kraft and planned parenthood. Kraft is one of the companies on the list of using HEK 293, and I am sure you all know that is distilled from kidneys of aborted fetuses.  Where do those fetuses come from? Some interesting side notes are that Reynolds cornered the cream cheese dairy operation after a fire took out the fake competition, called Empire, and handed it to newly formed Phenix cheese company, which merged with Kraft in 1928. Yes this is the same family as the Kraft that was just busted in a sex trafficking ring in Florida.

             GATES: When I was growing up, my parents were almost involved in various volunteer things. My dad was head of Planned Parenthood. And it was very controversial to be involved with that. And so it's fascinating. At the dinner table my parents are very good at sharing the things that they were doing. And almost treating us like adults, talking about that.

            My mom was on the United Way group that decides how to allocate the money and looks at all the different charities and makes the very hard decisions about where that pool of funds is going to go. So I always knew there was something about really educating people and giving them choices in terms of family size.

             ""This is a technology where we don't know where it's going to end. We need to stop this right where it is," says Nnimmo Bassey, director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation in Nigeria. "They're trying to use Africa as a big laboratory to test risky technologies."
            </p>
            <p>
             The experiment is a key step in the Target Malaria project. The project's major funder is the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which also supports NPR and this blog."

             One day the myth about the young programming microsoft wiz kids of the 80's will die too. (((Microsoft))) started with massive outside funding and bought up (not developed) products and used connections in the retail sales world to push their products over competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 80's and 90's software world was a cycle of upstarts (like Lotus and Novell) kicking Microsofts butt in software only to have Microsoft strong arm retailers and OEM's into not carrying their competitions products. Then when their competition had cashflow problems they would buy them up for a discount or just let them go bankrupt. You might ask, why didn't this violate the Sherman Antitrust act? Well it did, but just like today laws are selectively enforced.
            </p>
            <p>
             I remember the anti trust trials where Bill Gates was just too busy to testify, so they let him use Microsoft products to livestream himself into the hearings remotely. They literally turned antitrust legal proceedings into an advertisement for Microsoft.
            </p>
            <p>
             One thing I suspect is that this end of life philanthropy you see from (((businessmen))) is just them funneling money to the rest of the tribe for helping them build their wealth.

              With goggle, twatter, Facebook etc being Darpa/cia funded could MS also be funded by the same clowns? If the father of Bill was already balls deep in this big web of shut, then why not bring the rest of the family in.

              I’m gonna f#cking murder you, you stupid f#cking c#nt. I’m just letting you know, just to let you know that when it happens, you were f#cking warned bitch. You’re always puttin your location out there, so it’s real f#cking easy to get to you. I have a nice beautiful Desert Eagle that’s gonna be used on you. So keep thinkin all your health sh#t is gonna help you, cuz guess what, c#nt, it’s not gonna help you live another f#cking day. I’m gonna step right out from the pedestrians on the street and blast you right in the f#cking chest. Not the head, cuz I want you to squeal, bitch. I’m gonna make you f#cking squeal and shake on the ground, flailing, bleeding out. I’m gonna kill as many of you f#cks as I can before I go down. You’re done bitch, do you understand me? I’ve thought about how to do it for a while, and I have it pretty much down. I want to pull you off the road and torture you to death, but it’s just too f#cking hard to pull off. Another idea I had is when you’re doin one of your live things, I want to walk right to the door and shoot ya live on camera, so everyone sees you f#cking begging, c#nt, you’re gonna f#cking squeal so hard, cuz I’m gonna hit you in the chest, then the legs bitch, to make ya suffer before I finish you. I want everyone to see how you go. I f#cking promise you I’m comin bitch. I just gotta decide how I wanna do it. Maybe when you’re giving one of your dumb ass talks, I’ll go sit in the audience towards the back and do it. But it’s not easy to kill all your dumb c#nt friends that way. No, it’s pretty obvious to me that I gotta come to your f#cking autism sh#t center and shoot you right through the f#cking door when you’re on camera. That’s how I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna kill every single one of you f#ckers. Do you understand me? I’m f#cking comin for ya. So be ready for it. I don’t wanna see any shock on your f#cking face when I’m at the door bitch. I’m [gonna] f#cking shoot right through that door with a shotgun c#nt, I’ll kill every single person in that house and then I’m gonna torture you good bitch. I’m gonna make you bleed til there’s nothing left of you, then finish you. I just need to get a few things in order before I do it, but I’ve been wanting for a long time, and I’ve finally decided I have to do it, no more f#cking around. I want to make you scream so bad, to taste your blood and watch you scream bitch. I’m gonna kill you and I want you to know that when it happens, you could have done something. And you didn’t. That’s gonna be the best part you see, because I’m tellin you plain and simple. I’m comin now. Let’s see if you’re prepared when I get there for ya, or whether you look like a total deer in the f#cking headlights when I blow your f#cking head off. See you in hell. "

              This letter is based on false information regarding measles mortality rate and date of promised measles eradication.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The CDC’s official definition of an epidemic is: “The occurrence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time.” "

             <p>
              Schiff falsely characterizes the recent Washington State measles outbreak as an "epidemic."
According to "pennlive": ".....noting the current outbreak, which has sickened at least 56 people in Washington and Oregon, is more alarming than the state’s three previous ones." NOTE The 56 total is for BOTH Washington and Oregon. CDC's "Morbidity and mortality weekly report, Vol. 16, no. 15 Week ending April 15, 1967"
              <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/1472">

              is the measles benchmark MOTHERLOAD. It was published during the FIRST 12 weeks of the BRAND NEW NATIONAL MEASLES VACCINE PROGRAM BEGUN IN 1967. The NCDC is still trying to convince the public to get on board with the program. THEY NEVER USE MEASLES FEAR PORN. Instead, they persuade by COST EFFECTIVENESS AND SAVINGS!
             </p>
             <p>
              Why? Because parents would LAUGH at them if they tried to pull a Rep. Schiff. They list the BENCHMARK MEASLES STATISTICS.....PRE-VACCINE: Page 8
             </p>
             <p>
              Deaths per 1 million : 2
             </p>
             <p>
              Susceptibles (1-12 yrs) (The children not already immune) per 1 million: 50,000
             </p>
             <p>
              NOTE: Only natural immunity is life-long and can be passed on to nursing infants. Before vaccines, BABIES AND THE ELDERLY WERE PROTECTED. After vaccines, susceptibles are recurring because the vaccine does not give life-long immunity; hence, need for ever increasing boosters. Waning vaccines and boosters MAKE MORE MONEY FOR PHARMA. They leave INFANTS AND OLDER ADULTS MORE VULNERABLE.
             </p>
             <p>
              Total cases of measles per 1 million: 20,000
             </p>
             <p>
              Out of 20,000 cases, 19,800 were mild enough to be TREATED AT HOME.
             </p>
             <p>
              Treated at hospital: 120
             </p>
             <p>
              Complications : 80
             </p>
             <p>
              BASED ON THESE OFFICIAL CDC BENCHMARK MEASLES STATISTICS BEFORE MEASLES VACCINE we can conclude that one has MUCH GREATER RISK OF DYING in a CAR CRASH while driving to a DOCTOR'S OFFICE to get a measles vaccine, than DYING FROM MEASLES.
             </p>
             <p>
              Measles deaths per 1 million: 2
             </p>
             <p>
              U.S. car crash deaths per 1 million: 123
             </p>
             <p>
              "According to the National Safety Council, the estimated annual population death rate is 12.28 deaths per 100,000 population" (2017)
              <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/02/16/480956.htm">
               https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/02/16/480956.htm
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              In conclusion, 56 cases of measles is NOT an epidemic. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Statistically, NO DEATHS with that LOW number. Those 56 will now have LIFE-LONG immunity. No need for a measles vaccine. They can be around CANCER PATIENTS!
             </p>
             <p>
              END VIOLENCE STOP VACCINE FEAR PORN NOW!

              </p>
              <p>
               HL: I think the issue with Facebook is a difficult one because on the one hand they are asked not to dig into  people's personal areas and on the other hand being asked to go and take things down so I think from a Facebook perspective its difficult to do that. From a public health perspective as we saw in the letter from Andrew Schifft (sic) to Mark Zuckerberg that this is something in the league of like HATE CRIME...."

              Also pretty sure they introduced sterilization via vaccination in Africa:

              <em>
               Less than a year after the United Nations unveiled a sweeping population-control plot aimed at reducing the number of people in Kenya, a supposed UN “vaccine program” is under fire by doctors and Catholic bishops for deliberately sterilizing millions of women. The explosive revelations were released after medical researchers and the Catholic Church found a sterilization agent in tetanus inoculations being foisted on Kenyan women by two UN agencies in cooperation with the national government. Incredibly, it is not the first time that international vaccine campaigns by the UN targeting Third World populations have been exposed as covert sterilization and eugenics programs. Some critics have even referred to the latest plot as race-based genocide.

              He makes me sick. What makes me sick too is that Moyers who Ihad respected for years,is part of it too now. Not to mention Carter. Just found out about him last year. I remember Roslyn being on some board and it was telling. I wish I could remember it. 
Good God aren’t there any good people helping the indigent and poor anymore?  So horribly sad. So telling about the autism statistic. They want to achieve those results here too.

               Jimmy Carter goes to a fake church and he’s a fake Sunday School teacher. I’ve been saying this for years. I think something was fake about the envelopes at George Bush’s funeral because Jimmy Carter didn’t get one and he definitely deserves an envelope.But this is the little game they play, they don’t think anyone knows the truth.

                I know this is a bit off topic but it seems very odd that Carter has some kind of peanut farm before he became president and apparently had to sell it to become president (oh brother).  It was around that time that all of sudden everyone and their dog became allergic to peanuts.
               </p>
               <p>
                All presidents have been faking it for decades if not centuries.  They keep playing the game...if only just a few more million people woke up.

                  Every Child By Two (ECBT) is a non-profit organization, based in the United States which advocates for vaccinations. ECBT was founded in 1991, it's stated goals are to "raise awareness of the critical need for timely immunizations and to foster a systematic way to immunize all of America's children by age two."[1] ECBT was founded by former First Lady of the United States, Rosalynn Carter, and former First Lady of Arkansas, Betty Bumpers.[2][3]
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In 1991, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Bumpers founded Every Child By Two (ECBT) in response to a measles outbreak in which around 150 people, including young children, died as a result of contracting the disease.[4] At the time, Carter said, "It is imperative that we move quickly to increase our capacity to vaccinate children who are at risk for measles and other diseases, such as mumps, rubella and polio."[5] Carter and Bumpers started the national immunization awareness project by enlisting the help of governors' spouses to advocate for vaccinations[6] with the goal of immunizing 95% of U.S. children against diseases like diphtheria, measles, and rubella by the year 2000.[1] The group also expanded their educational outreach to include information about other vaccine preventable diseases, including chickenpox,[7] whooping cough,[6] and HPV. [8][1][6]
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  ECBT supports the use of immunization registries through which health care providers can track children's immunization histories for the purpose of reducing the number of missed immunizations.[13]

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In 2008, ECBT was criticized in a CBS News feature by reporter Sharyl Atkisson in a feature called "How Independent Are Vaccine Defenders?" that questioned the group's link with pharmaceutical companies and a possible risk for conflict of interest. The report stated that it was not illegal for the group to receive funds from the vaccine industry. A spokesperson for ECBT told CBS that "there are simply no conflicts to be unearthed."[14]

                   Well said. Good links. I had forgotten about ECBT. Rosalynn is quite the puppet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "In 1991, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Bumpers founded Every Child By Two (ECBT) in response to a measles outbreak in which around 150 people, including young children, died as a result of contracting the disease.[4]"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I am HIGHLY suspicious of this statistic. The footnote does not take you to the source. Instead it looks like Gannett was just quoting Rosalynn who NEVER GIVES HER SOURCE OR THE LOCATION OF THE ALLEGED OUTBREAK.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The main reason the number 150 deaths from a measles outbreak is fishy is because a 1967 CDC Morbidity and Mortality publication estimates that the yearly death rate from measles BEFORE VACCINES WERE INTRODUCED, is TWO deaths per 1 MILLION.  150 deaths would be per 75 MILLION people. The population of Thailand in 2019 is around 69 MILLION.  So Rosalynn just took some measles stats from a 3rd world country for the year and then just gave the number of deaths OUT OF CONTEXT to justify PUSHING VACCINES. Sick, sick, sick!  This is business as usual for the vaccine industry.

                    I have always said we have such smart as a tack people here.  WOW.  What a brilliant thought.  You are probably very right about her doing just that.  These people have no problem twisting things to fit them in to their narrative.  Oh she has fooled people for decades.  So has he.  I am so very disappointed, disgusted and sickened by them.

              Wow. How the hell, logically speaking, do vaccines REDUCE population? They prevent kids and old people from dying -- increasing lifespans and thus childbearing opportunity. This makes no fucking sense, unless they are putting something in vaccines that causes people to die sooner, or have fewer kids. Does he explain exactly HOW vaccines supposedly reduce population in any of his speeches?

               Nearly all vaccines given outside the US are manufactured by China through Bill Gates and the Clinton Foundation's support. Have you seen the recent news about chinese vaccines? How could you wonder how a vaccine could reduce a population. Clearly, they're not tested, and just as news is controlled here, it is more so in other countries.

                "This research doesn’t just show that vaccines are full of crud that top scientists can’t even define. It makes a mockery of health oversight agencies like the FDA and CDC and their lies that vaccines undergo adequate safety checks and risk assessment."

               </p>
               <p>
                In 2017, Health Impact News reported that the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN), supported by 55 organizations, representing over 5 million people, had taken the unprecedented step of serving a notice to Mr. Don Wright, M.D., M.P.H., who was the acting secretary of the Health and Human Services (HHS) department at the time, stating that HHS had failed in their duty to conduct the proper scientific research required to demonstrate vaccine safety as was required by law, and that they should take immediate action to remedy this negligence. Last week (July, 2018), Del Bigtree interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on his program HighWire, announcing that they had filed a lawsuit against HHS for violating U.S. law on vaccine safety, and won."

                  I've been fighting this battle for years. Be encouraged. Huge numbers are waking up. Years of vaccine safety research by parents and activists is paying off. Just remember, a vaccine is a DELIVERY SYSTEM. Without proper MORAL oversight, harmful substances can be put in the shot. Beware the up and coming DNA vaccines:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "Given such clinical results, understanding the underlying mechanism(s) of how DNA vaccines function is remains as a key step for its success. Recent studies investigating the immunological role of DNA-sensing machinery have brought new interest to the DNA vaccine field. It was demonstrated that the presence of double-stranded DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells can trigger host immune responses by a mechanism involving as yet unidentified cytosolic DNA sensor(s).7 This is expected to have an important impact on future researches on the cytosolic DNA-sensing machinery and on technological advance of delivery and processing of DNA plasmid.8 In this review, we discuss research developments in the understanding of cytosolic DNA sensing and its implications for development of DNA vaccines."

               Just an idea but often in some poorer countries people have more children because the child mortality rates are so high.  Maybe if with effective vaccines the child mortality rates would lower and then the need for having lots of children would be lessened?  I am just guessing, I am probably wrong but...

                Apply that logic to your own child. I would not. Plenty of guys in jail brag about how many kids they have by many women. Makes you more machismo in Mexican culture. Even in the early 70's there was found to be a link to severe health problems due to multiple vaccinations within a shortened time span. Most people were/are so uneducated that they thought/think more shots would somehow boost the immune system.

                Your thinking is a bit merky.
                <br/>
                That unproven excuse came out after Bill's TedTalk "OOPS!" was pointed out by vaccine researchers.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Maybe if with effective vaccines the child mortality rates would lower and then the need for having lots of children would be lessened?"
Think about it. If they have 5 children and only 2 make it to adulthood to reproduce, you have no net gain for population growth for that family.  DUH. Gates' Talk was only concerned with population net gain. If he put people over profit, he would have made sure they took the thimerosal (mercury) out of the vaccines they shipped to Africa when they had the means to do so. In 1999 California passed a law removing mercury from young children's vaccines.

                Access to clean water and sanitation infrastructure is the greatest cause for a drop in mortality rates in the third world.

               <p>
                The cholera outbreak in Haiti in 2010 is a good example. I personally visited there in the late '70's with medical missionaries and saw that a major health problem was lack of clean water (villages in the countryside had open ditches for sewage). The crowded city was worse. The average life span was about 30. The people were desperately poor and most had never seen a doctor. One with our group commented that they should have brought a vet because many of the problems they saw were mostly seen in animals in the U.S. Intestinal worms (found in polluted drinking water) was common. We gave them worm pills, but they would have the same dirty drinking water to take them with when they returned to their hut. Many had decayed teeth from chewing on sugar cane (yes, they were still involved in harvesting it for major U.S. cereal companies WHO PROVIDED NOTHING FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE.)  I digress. Back to the 2010 cholera outbreak:

                United Nations: Bill Clinton Responsible For Haiti Cholera Outbreak
               </p>
               <p>
                "The United Nations has implicated Bill Clinton for the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti that killed nearly 10,000 people and infected hundreds of thousands more. Bill Clinton was head of the United Nations mission to Haiti at the time UN troops dumped septic waste into the local water supply."
               </p>
               <p>
                "The Artibonite River, located in the town of Mirebalais, is the island of Hispaniola’s longest and most important river. Located in the heart of island, the contaminated water ran through other rivers, creating a stream of death through Haiti’s waterways.
               </p>
               <p>
                Cholera is a water-borne disease that thrives in wet atmospheres and HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY PRESENT in Haitian. It is a disease which causes vomiting and diarrhea until the infected person becomes dehydrated and dies. The virulence of this particular South Asian strain in Haiti gives an untreated infected person usually about 24 hours before death.
               </p>
               <p>
                The outbreak triggered massive protests across Haiti, accusing the UN of contaminating the water and bringing the never-before-seen epidemic to the country."

                Haiti had open water sources for drinking and UN forces dumped their excrement into the river. With a modern sanitation system, this scenario would have been very unlikely. Was the CF trying to create a new vaccine market?

                 I forgot about that particular outrage against Haiti. I
                 <em>
                  like
                 </em>
                 how these guys just grant themselves immunity.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The United Nations may have accepted responsibility for the cholera epidemic since the letter from Congress, but it has reiterated its privilege to not pay, be sued, or tried over its actions in Haiti. It is claiming protection by a Status of Forces Agreement SOFA) signed 12 years earlier after the coup against Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The SOFA makes UN soldiers immune to any prosecution or suit while in Haiti.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Nonetheless, the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti led by Brian Concannon and Mario Joseph have been accompanying thousands of cholera victims in filing claims against the United Nations. But in the same week that the UN accepted responsibility, an appeals court upheld a lower court’s ruling that it is immune.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Its kind of like how the vaccine manufacturers also get immunity for killing and causing harm.
