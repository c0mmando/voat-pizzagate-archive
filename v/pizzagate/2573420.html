<p>Who is Christine d\'Adesky?</p>

<p>d\'Adesky is a lesbian with a master\'s degree in journalism from Columbia in1982 and a bachelor\'s degree from Barnard in 1979.  She has been a foreign correspondent in Haiti; wrote about HIV/AIDS for various newspapers; launched magazines; was an editor-in-chief; co-produced a documentary about global AIDS treatment activism; was active in the peace and women\'s movements, to name a few.  In 2013, she began humanitarian work in Africa, focusing on the issue of gender-based violence linked to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>Christine dAdesky was connected to Laura Silsby in Haiti the day before her arrest.  More on this later.  
</p>
<p>Laura Silsby is now known as  Laura Gayler who works for the service that issues Amber Alerts.<br />

<p>Jumping to NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children).  In 1984, NCMEC was incorporated by private individuals as a non-profit corporation, meaning they do not have government oversight.  They, alone, act as gatekeeper for the government to deal with child porn, for example, without any oversight.  NCMEC hasn\'t exactly been responsible with this oversight-free role.</p>
<p>They are in the middle of a law suit over the handling of child porn constituting a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
(link) cybercrimereview.blogspot.com</p>
<p>Details of the lawsuit:
AOL maintains a database of hash values assigned to images classified as child abuse so that they are more easily identified/tracked.  AOL was simply sending NCMEC the images without bothering to open them to verify the contents.  So, NCMEC was violating the right to protection from undue searches and seizures by opening what AOL sent.  In this instance, only NCMEC was aware of what the photos actually were.</p>
<p>NCMEC has a large number of connections, many of them having strong ties to Hollywood - Bryan Cranston has been involved in the past.
(link) amazon.com KidSmartz-Abduction-Bryan Cranston</p>
<p>NCMEC also has connections with Laura Silsby.  NCMEC is in charge of the Amber Alert Program and Silsby works on their Executive Team.</p>
<p>Enter James Alefantis in this mix.  Remember how Alefantis posted an &quot;art&quot; piece by Jeff Koons showing him having sex with who was purportedly his porn-star wife?
link is not available.  
</p>
<p>Jeff Koons is very involved with the D.C./East Coast art scene.  Here, in Modern Luxury magazine, p.10, you see Alefantis and Koons mentioned as being involved in the art scene.

<p>Koons is a board member of the ICMEC (International Center for Missing and Exploited Children).  The ICMEC was founded in 1998 by none other than the NCMEC.

<p>Moving forward, another entity comes into play - Thorn - Digital Defenders of Children (previously known as DNA), founded by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.  Several other Hollywood stars support Thorn and Bryan Crabston recently sponsored an event for them.
(2 links) wearethorn; Wikipedia Thorn</p>
<p>One of the main services Thorn provides is the creation of a product (termed &quot;spotlight&quot; and &quot;solis,&quot; for use on the clear and dark net respectively) that help with API software which sifts through the material.  It does this sifting by scanning the hash symbols (which were previously mentioned landing the NCMEC in hot water).  Thorn was involved with the creation of this hash symbol identification system.
(link) wearethorn spotlight</p>
<p>Thorn doesn\'t just sell products to help combat child trafficking.  They also facilitate a meeting with various company tech advisors in what is known as The Thorn Task Force.  Members of this Task Force include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Dropbox, Yahoo, Instagram, Tumblr, Imgur, and Pinterest.  Officially, Thorn merely provides the guideline for the Task Force and doesn\'t take an official role.

<p>The Task Force collaborates closely with NCMEC, working with that very same hash tag that got the NCMEC in hot water.</p>
<p>Back to Silsby and d\'Adesky.  In a letter to the UN, d\'Adesky said she met Silsby on January 24, 2010 in a hotel in the Dominican Republic.  Silsby allegedly told d\'Adesky that her authorization to pick up Haitian orphans and bring them into the Dominican Republic came from an unnamed Dominican official.</p>
<p>d\'Adesky says. &quot;I informed her that this would be regarded as illegal, even with some \'Dominican\' minister authorizing since the children are Haitian,&quot; adding that she directed Silsby to UN agencies dealing with orphans and adoptions in the country.  d\'Adesky told the Wall Street Journal that Silsby responded, &quot;We  have been sent by the Lord to rescue these children, and if it\'s in the Lord\'s plan, we will be successful.
(link) socialistworker Christian right kidnappers</p>
<p>Yeah, right.  d\'Adesky the Savior.  Her family owns one of the biggest shipping companies in Haiti, DACO d\'Adesky Import Export S.A.  
</p>
<p>Did the earthquake interrupt an op?    The trafficking must have been underway when Silsby was caught in the quake.  She needed a Plan B and was put in touch with d\'Adesky.  Bingo! Ships!  And, cargo containers can be shipped through ports with &quot;diplomatic immunity.&quot;  They are not allowed to be opened, detained, or x-rayed.</p>
<p>ENMARCOLDA S.A. is also a family-owned organization, providing personalized, full-service shipping and logistics solutions for Haiti for over 50 years.  Jeffrey, Genevive, and Diggan d\'Adesky are all on the leading team.</p>
<p>ENMARCOLDA is also a founding partner of the fully-equipped Container Terminal; trucking and warehousing company, I.M.T., which also manages for the U.S. Government an 80,000 square foot warehouse storing food commodities.</p>
<p>ENMARCOLDA owns Wahoo Bar Beach Resort in Haiti.  The d\'Adesky family is also connected to the Haitian  Kiona Beach and Kaliko Beach Resorts.</p>
<p>In March 2017, a sting raid by Haitian police occurred at the Kaliko Beach Club near Port-au-Prince.  Several people were arrested in connection with sex trafficking, involving girls as young as 13.  At least 31 females were rescued.</p>
<p>The police seized Haitian and US cash, a computer containing pornographic images of children, and drugs.</p>
<p>The hotel owner said a group of Americans and Canadian tourists checked into the hotel, booked 22 rooms  and paid for day passes for the children to use.
(link) reuters human trafficking children Haiti hotel</p>
<p>Guess what?  Nothing happened.  All were set free.</p>
<p>In March 2017, the Director of CNLTP (National Committee Against Human Trafficking), Elz Thelot, stated &quot;the arrested were caught in the act and in view of the seriousness of their act, they should have been tried and sentenced so that the victims can be repaired.&quot;  
</p>
<p>Foreign participants in the trafficking were not even held or arrested according to numerous accounts.  Of the 9 Haitian nationals who were arrested, none were still in police custody.

<p>In November 2017, 4 prosecutors were fired fir the &quot;grave mishandling&quot; of the Kaliko Beach Resort incident.</p>
<p>Several foreign nationals involved in the trafficking arrangement were detained but released the following day.  It had been reported that only 8 Haitian nationals were actually arrested.</p>
<p>It is believed that the 4 prosecutors fired were paid to release the detained foreign nationals and were signatories for signed releases for the arrested non-foreign nationals.

<p>The d\'Adesky has their influence in the US as well.  Dale Sky Trading Company, established 1990, located in Miami, &quot;is becoming one of Latin America and the Caribbean\'s premier export distribution company.&quot;</p>
<p>There is a growing list of customers - Digicel Group, Dubai Ports World. Ecolog International, UNITED NATIONS, to name a few.</p>
<p>They provide products ranging from building materials, electrical supplies, generators, etc., and also have contracts with a vast number of military and government-related relations.</p>
<p>Founded in 1990 by Clive d\'Alesky.</p>
<p>Trafficking children in crates from Haiti through Miami appears to be what is happening.</p>',

           Did the earthquake interrupt an op?    The trafficking must have been underway when Silsby was caught in the quake.  She needed a Plan B and was put in touch with d'Adesky.  Bingo! Ships!  And, cargo containers can be shipped through ports with "diplomatic immunity."  They are not allowed to be opened, detained, or x-rayed.

          <p>
           In November 2017, 4 prosecutors were fired fir the "grave mishandling" of the Kaliko Beach Resort incident.
          </p>
          <p>
           Several foreign nationals involved in the trafficking arrangement were detained but released the following day.  It had been reported that only 8 Haitian nationals were actually arrested.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is believed that the 4 prosecutors fired were paid to release the detained foreign nationals and were signatories for signed releases for the arrested non-foreign nationals.

             In a letter to the UN, d'Adesky said she met Silsby in January 2010, a day or so before Silsby's arrest, in a hotel in the Dominican Republic.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            There's already a thread up on this story.  d'Adesky met Silsby on Jan 24th in the Dominican Republic.  Silsby was arrested on Jan 29th.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Yeah, right. d'Adesky the Savior. Her family owns one of the biggest shipping companies in Haiti, DACO d'Adesky Import Export S.A.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is completely illogical and evidence of nothing.  All you have indicating is you are suspicious.  You indicate no guilty whatsoever on d'Adesky's part.

             Did the earthquake interrupt an op? The trafficking must have been underway when Silsby was caught in the quake.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Absolutely not.   How you can write up a lenghty post like this be completely ignorant of the basic facts? The quake hit on January 12th, here are headlines from January 14th.  Silsby was in Idaho when the quake hit.

            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Nice imagination, but Silsby was caught with a bunch of kids on a bus.  Their plan didn't involve ships.  They were going to drive over the Haitian border in a bus.

            Lunacy.  We've reached lunacy.   Silsby was a screwup.  She couldn't even print up fake Haitian papers.  Now she's going to navigate diplomatic immunity?   Cargo containers do not get diplomatic immunity.

           <p>
            d'Adesky had not reason to come forward and connect herself to Silsby, but she did.  And when she did she undermined Silsby's story that she was not aware she would need sign off from Haitian authorities.  d'Adesky was clearing point out she knew the rules and was flauting them.  d'Adesky wrote quite critically of Silsby before any pizzagater ever did.
           </p>
           <blockquote>

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is a bit mixed up.  The NCMEC is not "in charge" of the Amber Alert System.  The Amber Alert system is coordinated by the Department of Justice.   The Amber Alerts is administered by local law enforcement.
            <br/>
            NCMEC cannot issue an alert.  It administer the tipline and resource clearinghouse for missing children, but it is not in charge of the Amber Alert System.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alert Sense sells the equipment, for this system.  It does not administer the Amber Alert System.   Alert Sense is a vendor, they have no authority to do anything about the Alert System themselves.   The IRS buys its calculators and spreadsheet software from vendors.   The vendors have no control over your taxes.
           </p>
           <p>
            And of course, there's no connection of the Clintons to Silsby.

             I appreciate your comments, but your dissection is rather harsh.  This is not Journalism 101 here.  Many of us try to do a good job on this sub, and I am one of them.  The Haiti connection, as well as many other pizzagate rabbit holes are deep and vast.  Hypotheticals are not forbidden here.  Additionally, you are putting words into my mouth with a few of your comments.  1+1 equalling 2 does not always happen here.  I believed the neonrevolt link contained good info, and info pushes many of us to dig deeper.
            </p>
            <p>
             I appreciate and welcome criticism when it's constructive.  I appreciate and welcome comments that expand on a post and/or correct contents of it.  As I mentioned in the first paragraphs, all of the info came from the neonrevolt link and their links (which were numerous) that were cited in their article.

              My dissection is harsh because you bought into many falsehoods and are intent on pushing new ones.   You're defaming a woman who publically came out against Silsby based on nothing but your own suspicion and the fact you have already swallowed several falsehoods.

Yes we know she changed her name and works for Mcme.
The child trafficking has been going on there for decades.  A org ( mafia) controls and runs Haiti business corrupt and legitimate.  The president ? Is also corrupt and is responsible for trafficking some kids.   The rumor was that harp/ Clinton created the earthquake to facilitate more trafficking.  😔
We all knew why gaylor was not prosecuted.

             Agree, it's old news, but I am not aware of linking the d'Adesky connection and shipping industry, Alefantis' acquaintance Koons and his ties to the International MCME, the Podesta "Wahoo" emails, and 2017's sting operation.  Guess it's just another summary with perhaps some additional info.  It's difficult to report on just one aspect of anything anymore.

            Like the older, Latin-letter fraternities, the Phi Beta Kappa was a secret society. To protect its members and to instill a sense of solidarity, each had the essential attributes of most modern fraternities: an oath of secrecy, a badge (or token) and a diploma (or certificate) of membership, mottoes (in the case of the Phi Beta Kappa, in Greek rather than in Latin), a ritual of initiation, a handclasp of recognition; to these, the Phi Beta Kappa would soon add another attribute, branches or "chapters" at other colleges. The new society was given the motto, Φιλοσοφία Βίου Κυβερνήτης or in Latin letters Philosophia Biou Kybernētēs, which means in English The Love for Knowledge be the Guide of Life. Greek was chosen, because Greek was in Roman times the language of science like Latin in medieval times. D'Adesky basically of or from Adesky. Adesky's hero is Aaron T. Beck

            Here we go.  Article is dated 02/06/17 which was a Monday.
"The Clinton Foundation announced Saturday that it was cutting its programs in Haiti, spinning them into separate entities.  Because the foundation announcement came just a day and a half, at most, of a Haitian police and anti-child-trafficking raid which led to the rescue of 31 girls, minors, on Sunday, it has spurred conversation among internet sleuths leery of the Clintons and the US political establishment.  It is from these sources the Haiti Sentinel was made aware of the foundation's development not previously reported by our news agency.  However, the sentinel has no reason to believe the 2 events were inherently linked."

            Put a space in the link after http and break the link. If you want to figure out which link it is do one link at a time and you can isolate it.
