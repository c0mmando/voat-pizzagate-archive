            Of course he is a freemason. Just like everyone else on that level. That does not discredit at all what he said, on the contrary.

            I don't think it's possible to reach the higher levels of any organization unless you are affiliated. There is a reason why all of these groups have initiations - these are the ties that bind them together - secrets and lies. Sodomy is a big part of initiations.

               Seriously? I care because I am sick and tired of being deceived and lied to. No, I am NOT saying that this is the case here but finding out about the Masonic lettering raised a red flag with me. I felt (and still do to some extent) genuinely sorry for Mr. Bernard but if it turns out that his testimony was just part of an elaborate scheme to get attention/support for his bank I am seriously pissed. And again : NOT saying that this is the case here - I'm just wondering what's really going on.

           <p>
            Yeah, exactly! I thought so too that these are the very kind of people he didn't want anything to do with anymore? So why still use their symbolism?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not that I dispute the legitimacy of his testimonial - after all, faking this kind of emotion would be difficult (if not impossible) for a top-notch actor to pull off - but on the other hand - who knows what kind of mental, psychological and whatnot training he went through to be able to fake that. Some training/conditioning a regular actor wouldn't go through. (I have seen the body language analyses video by the way.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe this testimonial is a very elaborate "commercial" to get people to support the "B of joy"...?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there any way to contact the interviewer? Would love to hear her input on this.

            he said in his own words he went along with most of the depravity during his tenure as a banker however once he got all the way to the top and he was told to sacrifice or defile a child, he could no longer partake in it any longer. It would not surprise me one bit if he had been a part of the Freemasonry, though he never says he was. But I would think that he had to at least know about most of the ceremonies to have seen what he said he has seen. He said most of it did not bother him, he was able to shut it off until they exposed him to the "kinder" and that was what sent him over the edge. I would assume he probably was being invited into that secret club.

            I connected with him on LinkedIn and several more from his organization...seems legit...and would make sense he is a free mason as he had to get intro'ed into the "club" and that might have been his entry...he probably would have had to have been a mason while a member of the club...everyone should read the protocol of the leaders of zion as he suggested..it talks alot about indoctrinating masons, etc..

            Maybe he is one? Would not be a surprise thinking of his CV. 
There are many freemasons on the planet. Even my brother's neighbour had been a freemason. 
Not ALL of them are evil satanists. A few years ago I went sightseeing to their club house in berlin...  many very normal people there. 
Guess the evil ones are hiding somewhere else. 
We know Mr. Bernard's  story, so I guess he must have been in one of the evil clubs. Guess they would not have him introduced to their satanist pleasures if he's not in the club...  But the question is, what he's  thinking NOW of that!

            I know opinions on Freemasonry are all over the map and it varies by rite and nation.  But in the US, we're loaded with Freemasons who mainly use it for networking.  Like any big organization, if there are deep secrets only a select few at the very top will know they exist.  He may have joined in order to move up in his previous life.  It doesn't mean they control him now.  It's smart to avoid dumping their secrets.  Bernard already may have more than enough people who are considering killing him.

            I guess the question is if he decided to go legit then why would he keep the masonic lettering in his linked in when he created "bank of joy"?...or is the "cooperatives" the criminal scam that he was running for other companies and banks?

             I don't see that in BoJ logo; I do see it somewhat in the United People Foundation (the parent company).

             However, I have seen that logo used by other companies as well.

            It would not surprise me if he is or was a Freemason.  My understanding is that Freemasonry is like a pig in a poke-you do not know what you are getting yourself into until it is too late.  The people 33rd degree or higher know more, and the ones below are not yet "in the light".
           </p>
           <p>
            I was also reading that Freemasonry has been infiltrated by ruffians...
