<p>August 27th - Clinton in Haiti - Vaccines pushed to post hurricane disaster

<p>The 2010 magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti killed 160,000 people and left 1.5 million people displaced from their homes. However, following the deadly quake, a Wikileaks email dump reveals that Hillary and Chelsea Clinton were more concerned about ensuring that all children under 15 were getting vaccinated at camp than the 1.5 million people displaced without proper food, water or housing.</p>
