OK so this is my take on Eames Armstrong\'s art which you can see on her Facebook as well as on her web page.  If you go to <a href="http://www.eamesarmstrong.com/writing.html">her website</a> you can get a starting point about what &quot;interests&quot; her.  She writes &quot;noise is a metaphor for the unwanted or undesirable, an open potential for transformation through abstraction, and a strategy of resistance against rigid or normalizing structures...&quot; and specifically she goes on to say, &quot; I’m interested in conflict and difficulty, complicated gestures, and the ritual celebration of confusion and illegibility.&quot; Right...so when you take this starting point and you inject it into the context of sexuality you can start to understand what some of her art may be celebrating or at the very least empathizing with..hint..the sexualization children maybe?  Take for example the home page image on her website of one of her more recent paintings called <a href="https://sli.mg/UGlW4g">&quot;Thong Dungeon&quot; </a> My first impression about this &quot;piece&quot; or P.O.S. is that it is an obvious attempt at blurring the line between sexuality, innocence, and the perverse or profane.  The sexual aspect is obvious: mostly naked people in thongs in what appears to an orgy of BDSM nature.  The innocence is conveyed through the overtly used primary colors (pinks and blues), in conjunction with the ambiguous &quot;smiley&quot; faces, and the seemingly adult scaled bodies with the lack of developed genitals.  The perverse or profane element of the painting is how the scene takes place in a dungeon in the middle of a traumatic moment that may convey violence (one smaller character appears to be on its knees with throat cut), fear, catharsis, and regret all at the same time (sounds like the perfect description of a ritual abuse scenario).   What is most curious about the style of painting is how the &quot;artist&quot; is able to confuse who is adult and who is child, and I believe this is fundamental to her work and very intentional in this painting.  For instance, some of the people in the painting are smaller in scale while others look more in control.  Some of her other paintings of children<a href="http://www.eamesarmstrong.com/2015-2016.html"> are more obvious </a>in that distinction but this one achieves a higher level of confusion. In my opinion this &quot;artist&quot; is obviously tipping her hat and winking an eye to this sycophantic pedo culture, or at the very least is empathizing with the players in it.  In fact, I think this dungeon looks very much like an abstraction of the infamous <a href="https://i.sli.mg/86mWlT.png">J.A. kill room </a> even including the detail of the mechanical vent that one of the characters is desperately reaching for to escape!  Of course the nature of her art or art in general is that the interpretation of it provides and endless flow of plausible deniability toward any attempt to implicate or allege.  So there is no solid evidence here really.  This is just something i noticed about the chilling nature of this &quot;art&quot; and the &quot;artist&quot; behind it, and further confirms why J.A. would have a friend in Armstrong.</p>

            Your sentiments might be noble and in some part we must not of course lose ourselves in hatred, but I'm sorry we should not forgive these acts. It's immaterial whether they choose it or not, the victims come first. At the very least they need to be put away for a very long time. Culpability should be determined on a fair trial basis but I don't believe in people getting off on some 'I was abused' charge. Many are abused and NEVER touch or hurt a child.

            This kindness and forgiveness very apparent in Europeans specifically...can also be a weakness and is ruthlessly exploited by criminal elements in our society. Anger is not always toxic but can be channelled as a driving force.

            She did a "performance" called "PISS TEST AND PRIVATE PIZZA"  Her description of the show was essentially: After missing her period for 2 months...She took a pregnancy test in front of the crowd, under a sheet of plastic in the corner...came back negative. Then took out a piece of pizza, went back to the same corner, back under plastic to eat the pizza (she made made a point to say the audience could hear her chewing loudly into the microphone) . She then came out and threw up into a bucket in front of the crowd. It seems clear to me that the pizza is representative of the baby that now doesn't exist for one reason or another. sick shit

            First of all, this woman is incredibly talented and is far beyond most of the 'artists' I have seen regarding PG.  That said, it's this talent which conveys a feeling of absolute HORROR and DREAD in her subjects and leaves on feeling deeply affected.

            These are the most heinous acts humans can commit. The perpetrators know right from wrong. They choose evil. Many victims of child abuse break the cycle in their adulthood.  These predators didn't.

            Kind of a "wall of text". Can we all learn to format text to make it more readable. Paragraphs, spacing, etc.

            This is very true since I am convinced many of the perpetrators were victims themselves and may have been mind controlled.
However, out first job is to "call the devil out".  We have to identify the problem before we can heal the problem.

            Yes, I agree and it struck the person in the forehead below (when looking at blue paint and the blue blood dripping onto legs.). Kind of like the Asian girl, Go Go, used in the movie Kill Bill 2.

            There's more vacant houses foreclosed and for sale in the area.... I always said dont shit on your own doorstep, Alefantis or anyone doing something other than rubbing shoulders in his own premises would have been total madness.

            Not a huge deal, but for the sake of clarity James alefantis and Julian Assange have the same initials. Wouldn't want to mislead anyone who is less read on this subject.

              The point is someone comes onto this site and sees someone talking about a JA relating to pedophilia, with all the mud slinging being aimed at assange it may be prudent to take the extra few seconds to type out alefantis' name.

             say you were a pedo and wanted to pay for a service. You find the source. You are told - buy X painting from Y person. This is then payment for the service, but you get 'art' for plausible deniability and a dead-end if you are audited. No need to withdraw large sums of cash.  The artist gets a cut, and maybe other payments in lieue (eg free promotion fro inked galleries and being pushed by the 'art community')

             I think art is used as a conduit to pay for pedo services. Alefantis owns / directs art galleries. He is connected to lots of artists who have very suspicious art like Durdjevic, Abramovic, etc.  Who would put some of this sick stuff in their hose? who would pay such big prices? i would say for example if you went through the list of everyone who bought art like Ria Pratt (Kim Noble alter) - you'd find pedos

             2k, 4k for satanic ritual abuse pictures. Why would you buy them. Where would you put them.

            Her performance art on her page looks bad too. Check out the "performance" she is doing in front of a pentagram, and the one called "piss test and private pizza."

            I'm thinking that tissues may actually be the MAPS, used to wipe up fluids and are kept as.mementos of the sordid event.

             Dont forget our pedo pal Epstein he also had similar box of tissues on display in house, just seems odd that. MAP though is a common pedo term Minor Attracted Person. Pizza related MAP I believe is a CP customer.

               handkerchief in this context imo was talking about the preference of the individual, black and white is S&amp;M &amp; Masturbation &lt;- so thats the sexual preference of the minor attracted person whos looking for porn perhaps as opposed to 'live action' seems to me they use the house viewings as a get together in houses that no one owns. Quite convenient actually.

                1967 in Portugal during the Salazar dictatorship, leaked by the Sunday Telegraph and Daily Telegraph on 11-12 December, after an Italian article:
               </p>
               <p>
                Under the title "Lolita Hunt in the Minister's Garden" (Caccia alla lolita nel giardine del ministro) is told the enthusiastic participation of an executive government member, very close to Salazar in games with girls younger than 14, along with other individuals.
In the gardens of the great estate this minister had in Estoril, they arranged what was frequently described as "hunts", during which a dozen girls completely naked, except for shoes and a colored hairband, were set loose as if it were an animal reservation. Once free, the hunters "diverse aristocrats, said minister and high state officials" followed behind them, equally bare and also with a colored band. The game consisted in capturing the girl whose band was the same color as the hunter's and consequent consummation of the sexual act. In other events, the minors would dance naked under pink-colored lights, practice which became known as "Ballet Rose" and came to name the case.

            You really should paste the url into archive.is as you're making the post, and include both the original link, and the archive link in your posts. By drawing attention to it before it was archived, you risk losing access to it.

            Also, you should provide a brief description of what concerns you about the images. There is one picture in a picture on the page below that looks like an adult coming through a sleeping child's bedroom window:

             These paintings kind of make me think this artist was a victim. Maybe now a perpetrator, but something about it, with the fake smiles, and the fists shoved in mouths as though bracing against pain or being prevented from speaking out.

            "Thong Dungeon" seems to show these people trying to escape through the little barred window. These are sexualised captured children.
