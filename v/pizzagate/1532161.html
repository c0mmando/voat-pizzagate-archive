            Well  its pretty clear  he is interested in young  blood,  and as a  billionaire he  is  going top  do whatever  it takes to obtain  his  "fountain of youth,"
when  you  look  at  who  really  controls  the world they  are the billionaires that  own  all the  corporations-these are the  people who"do what they wilt."

             "Peter Thiel "Killed" Gawker.com as Revenge
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Peter Thiel has never been explicit in why he funded Hulk Hogan's $10 Million lawsuit against Gawker Media.[1] Many presume it was because Gawker.com (now defunct) outed Peter Thiel as a homosexual in 2007.[2] As the official story goes, Thiel, supposedly angered by being outed, funded Hogan's lawsuit as revenge. As the Guardian stated:[3]
           </p>
           <p>
            [B]y publicly outing him as gay in 2007, Gawker founder Nick Denton shattered the privacy of Thiel’s fiercely guarded personal life and techno-libertarian vision. And Thiel, it turns out, can hold a grudge.
However, that begs the question as to whether Thiel actually worked to keep his sexual orientation a secret. Going by the unsourced quote in the Gawker article which said "Of course he's gay. Why would you mention that?," the answer is a firm no.[4] In fact, Forbes wasn't even sure if the article even outed Thiel:[5]
           </p>
           <p>
            ...[S]ome dispute whether the article actually outed the billionaire (Thiel said in past interviews that his friends had known since at least 2003)...
However, when Thiel intends to keep a part of his personal life a secret, he does so extremely carefully. As the Guardian stated, "When reporters contacted people in Thiel’s orbit, it’s not uncommon to have basic facts questioned."[6] For Thiel to be so careless with hiding the truth of his sexuality, even around his close friends, does not match his character, assuming it was something he truly intended to keep a secret.
           </p>
           <p>
            Based on search engine results limited to that time period (the months after January 2007), it doesn't even seem the news that Thiel was gay mattered enough to elicit another article on the subject from any other publication. Thiel went on to embrace his public homosexuality (as noted here), without any seeming public denial of the Gawker article. In fact, Peter Thiel has expressed the importance for individuals in the tech industry to ignore social conventions, which one would presume includes conventions regarding sexuality.[7]
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Peter Thiel "Killed" Gawker.com for a Litigation Profit
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Other outlets promote a competing theory that Thiel financed Hogan's litigation because he foresaw a profit opportunity.[8] However, at the outset of the case, many individuals felt Hogan would likely lose his case against Gawker Media, including a Federal Judge.[9] That does not even take into account whether there would be a profit over the cost of "reasonable" attorneys fees and how much the final judgement would be. Even if Hogan won and the judgement stood, Forbes admitted it was not clear if Thiel would receive any portion of the award from Hogan's trial.[10]
           </p>
           <p>
            For Thiel - someone known for fairly shrewd investments - this case would not be considered a good investment. If there was a profit motive, that motive lies elsewhere."

             A Competing Theory: Peter Thiel "Killed" Gawker.com to Benefit the Clinton Cabal
Background: Palantir Technologies
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Peter Thiel is a co-founder and the current chairman of Palantir Technologies, a private American software and services company, specializing in big data analysis.[11] Thiel is the company's largest shareholder and is estimated to own roughly 10% of the company valued at $20 Billion, making his ownership value likely $2 Billion.[12] Thiel's total net worth is only thought to be somewhere between $2 and $3 Billion, so it is safe to assume that his ownership in Palantir is a large portion of his net worth.[13]
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, provided much of the initial funding for Palantir Technologies[14], and for much of its life and at least until 2013, the heart of Palantir was in contracts that it possessed with agencies within the US government.[15]
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Karp is the current CEO of Palantir Technologies.[16]"

            It  IS indirectly  related  to  PIZZAGATE;
whether this  is  the right subverse(?) might  be  in  question,
but the energy associated  with children/young people's  blood is  fundamental to the  motive and
understanding of Luciferianism, he  may say 18  year olds,  but its obvious he wants the energy associated with young humans, and the  younger the  more energy, etc.

            So this URL doesn't do much good , considering the program we use to look into peoples profiles requires personal info. I tried searching for it by his first and last name, but as you can imagine, there are a lot of people under the name David Seaman. A direct email would be the best way to locate his PP acct.

            While interesting, to keep things separated we should focus on these as two unique items for discussion. I'm personally very pissed off with the David Seaman PayPal block. I am a contributor and just had an email exchange with him. Manually freezing someone's funds without any sort of justification is illegal.

            If someone attempts to enter their Paypal password too many times (and probably from an unusual IP address to boot) it locks the account until they speak with someone at PayPal. I'm pretty sure this is what happened with David's account. Someone trying to hack into his Paypal. I suggested he make a secret email address only he knows about, and use that for his Paypal and Youtube.. it's the only way to avoid this type of stuff. I really don't think PayPal played any nefarious role in his account being temporarily locked. They were protecting it, actually.

               Well, while that may be true it points to the reason it being locked not being because of someone trying to hack the account. That would lock the password not the withdrawal. That was my point.

              Well whatever you wanna call it, they froze the money (possibly) because someone was trying to get into his account. Makes sense.

              Probably doesn't have any more pull than any other billionaire including Musk. I doubt Thiel is involved in the illegal harvesting of youth blood for life extension despite being intetested in the topic of extending life. Anyone on the illegal side would have pushed for Hillary. Thiel took a lot of hate for backing Trump.

            I have access to PayPal records, unfortunately it would be illegal to share that information.. But if it would help clear up why exactly Seaman's PP is being limited, I might oblidge y'all.

            SACRED COWS: Peter Thiel, DynCorp, PayPal, James ACHILLES Alefantis / pizzagate ? there seems to be a THIN RED LINE of infant's blood leading to and through all of them, even though some of the mods here tend to disagree (vehemently) for reasons completely unknown (though not unexpected) by me.

            so yes, it was already established when you ditched my topic. bad form. you mights just gets yerself reported for that, for targeting and removal without justification or cause.
