Another possibility, and I hate to say it because I really admire this guy as a filmmaker, is Director/Producer Chris Columbus. I\'ve been thinking this for a while, but since Spielberg seems to have ties I figure this is a very good time to mention him. </p>
<p>Oddities
* Most of his movies center around children. 
* Many of these projects were the breakout movies for several child/young adult actors. 
* At least FOUR of his movies have child/young adult stars who have spoken out or have been rumored to be victims. This is already strange, but considering a director only makes a movie every few years, compared to a producer who makes several a year, this is even more of a crazy coincidence.</p>
<p>Spielberg Connection
* He was \'discovered\' by Spielberg after submitting his scripts for The Goonies and Gremlins. Both include children as lead characters.
* Spielberg continues to produce many of his movies, once Columbus began directing in 1987. </p>
<p>His movies which feature some of the out-spoken victims, and some rumored to be victims of pedophilia.
* One of his breakout scripts was The Goonies, which I believe he was un-credited as a Producer on as well. Corey Feldman is one of the main kids, and the rest of the cast is made up of mostly young boys too. 
* Sean Astin was also the star in The Goonies. This is a long shot but I know he\'s out of the system now, and am guessing he is close with Elijah Wood who has spoken out. He and Elijah Wood are both from Iowa, and are basically only making local/indie movies outside of the system now. Did he know what Elijah went through, or experience anything himself during his short time in the system? 
* He directed Home Alone + Home Alone 2, obvious connection to Maculay Culkin who is definitely rumored to be a victim. Let\'s also not forget his band &quot;Pizza Underground&quot;, and the now-iconic scenes involving Cheese Pizza in BOTH of these movies. <a href="http://blog.truffleshuffle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/home-alone-2-pizza.gif">Here\'s a Gif from Home Alone 2. Definitely Creepy based on what we know now.</a>
* He directed the first two Harry Potter movies. Hasn\'t Daniel Radcliffe spoken out, but was quickly censored? Mark Radcliffe is also the name of a producer on the Harry Potter movies, not sure his relation to Dan, but this was absolutely Dan\'s first project in which he was &quot;discovered&quot; from his audition. 
* An odd choice for Columbus if you compare with the rest of his filmography, but in 2009 he directed &quot;I Love you Beth Cooper&quot; starring Hayden Panettiere. We know she had a rough childhood and relation with her father, and the anonymous &quot;Hollywood Tattletale&quot; (rumored to be Robert Downey Jr.) spoke in detail of Hayden basically being a child prostitude. <a href="http://jezebel.com/5892565/is-robert-downey-jr-spreading-insider-celeb-gossip-on-blogs">Here\'s an article describing this anonymous tip.</a> Of course Hayden was a bit older in this movie and was already a star, but still I\'ve never figured out why he made this movie. The budget was much lower than the movies he usually works on, and I believe it\'s his only movie that wasn\'t a big box office success. Very possibly just a coincidence, but still throwing it out there. </p>
<p>Middle Career + Other Random Oddities 
* Somewhere in the middle there he made 3 hit Robin Williams movies too, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, and Bicentennial Man. Is it too far fetched to think Robin knew something and his death had any suspicion? Anonymous 5 hinted about this. (more below) Robin also has several Spielberg connections, including Spielberg-directed \'Hook\', a movie that\'s also filled with child actors. 
* Tom Arnold had a mid-size part in Nine Months. This is unusual because he rarely ever got a big part in a Hollywood movie. Arnold is infamous now for saying that he\'s seen Trump\'s unreleased racist Apprentice Tape. Tom went in to detail and said Trump used the n word and criticized his autistic son. The tape was never released, and multiple Apprentice producers all independently denied such a tape exists. Maybe I\'m wrong but I could\'ve swore Tom used to be a Republican. Is he someone another celebrity who is guilty and is smearing Trump out of fear of eventually being exposed?
* Mara Wilson (Matilda) was \'discovered\', and Mrs. Doubtfire was her first big movie. Her career didn\'t end long and she seemed to \'escape\' Hollywood. Did she experience or know anything? What happened?</p>
<p>Anonymous5 on 4chan
* Not sure if we trust Anon5 on 4chan, but I\'ve been following him since he\'s been posting. FBIAnon said he was legit, and he isn\'t as explicit in his info as FBIAnon, but gives several vague hints, and keeps insisting that we go after Hollywood first which will help bring down DC in return. 
* He did vaguely speak of Robin Williams, in relation to celebrity\'s &quot;Truman Show\'s&quot;, and confirm that was living in a Truman Show, and his show was \'cancelled\'. 
* He also gave a hint to be looking at the celebrities who reacting the most negatively to the recent election. This is far fetched, but just to note that Sally Field (Doubtfire), Susan Surandon (Stepmom), and JK Rowling (obv Harry Potter) are all more connections to him, and were all very strong-spoken about their opposition to Trump, possibly because his promise to drain the swamp and expose these awful elites. 
* Despite his usual vague hints, he explicitely stated that Patton Oswalt actually killed his wife. Have heard some people think that she was writing or researching something and was about to uncover something. He says this is why he has also been so outspoken against Trump, using Twitter as his medium to spew negativity. He is supposedly also scared Trump will expose him. 
* He often talks about young stars and tells us to look into &quot;how they were discovered&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001060/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">Here\'s Chris Columbus\' IMDB. </a> Let me know if you find any other connections. </p>
<p>Clearly there are already a very suspicious amount of connections here. I know some of these notes are far fetched, but look what has already come true? Can\'t be too sure either way.</p>',

             There's the link to his reply. I think he reconfirms this a bit further down too. Basically he does posts and then does extended Q&amp;A's throughout the post, and this was about celebrities and how they actually live in a 'Truman Show', or a legitimate bubble where they don't actually see the outside world. He gives further hints about Hollywood pedos, specifically Disney, but like I said, he's much more vague than FBIAnon, with a few exceptions.

              I watched E!news last night for the first time in forever. It was so scary to think people actually watch it all the time. The celebs were obviously acting as if they are their real self and it was all so scripted.

            Mara Wilson's mother died during the filming of Matilda. She was given the option to drop out. Instead, she used the experience as therapy.

             Here's the full archived thread. As usual, he creates his main post, states any other information he is trying to get out, then the rest of the thread is basically a Q&amp;A. He mentions Patton pretty close to the top, keep an eye out for the "Anonymous5" name to see his posts and responses. I'd recomment reading the whole thing if you're interested, fascinating stuff. Like I said not as explicit as FBIAnon at all, which is why explicitly namedropping Patton Oswalt was pretty shocking.

            I have no doubt Hollywood is a part of this but what you presented hasn't swayed me that Christopher Columbus is involved. Many of the things that you mention as odd aren't. His first two screenplays involved kids and were huge successes. Of course people would be eager to hire him on for similar movies (because Hollywood likes playing it safe and betting on winners).

             I agree, nothing provable, just strange that he connects to several of the victims somehow. Just thought I'd throw it out there especially after I read the Spielberg post.
