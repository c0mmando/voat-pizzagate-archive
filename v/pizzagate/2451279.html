            I have now found the full original programme with Brian Wedger The Child Abuse Cover Up - A Police Whistleblower Speaks

            . It has a page of description as well. If i remember he actually was anonymous when he first blew the whistle but is now open.
I beleive that the Professional Standards department of Operation Winter Key was looking into this - probably more from the angle that he whistleblew rather than investigating the non action by Police. No idea whether they have made a report yet.

            Unbelievable the corruption! 
No more proof than this: While those of us who voted BREXIT are ridiculed and labled as conspirity nuts, because we are sure there is a plan going on behind out backs and feel the governments in cahoots with the EU to keep us in the European Union - This is whats really going on: Here is the proof of our 'deep state' working against the people of the UK! -

            I don't know if we realise that Theresa May is the top of the pyramid in the UK. She was home secretary at the time of the cover up and is now PM, presiding over the biggest cover up and censorship in British history. She is likely as evil as Merkel

            This is Lord Pearson, pretty much the sole old school Conservative left in the House of Lords. Here he cites 3 sources arriving at a figure of over a Million Rapes (not to be confused with a million individual minors - most victims rapes multiple times), and only 222 grooming gang perps jailed in the last 13 years

           <p>
            Think about that;  1 million rapes divided by 222 = A muslim man has confidence that he can rape a schoolgirl in Britain and only face a ONE IN 4500 chance of going to prison

             iow he can rape 2250 times before reaching a 50:50 chance of prison time.  just trying to wrap my head around these odds.  its like never.  i see this as part of the depopulation agenda. it is demoralizing and demoralized people are easier to enslave.  and once you enslaved a population, you can do whatever. soft-kill, slow-kill or just traditional genocide like mao, stalin or pol pot.

              Exactly. Rape has always been used as a war tactique. Also, it effects future generations due to transgenerational PTSD.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Statistics show the number of child sexual exploitation cases in 2017 had risen by 30 per cent on the previous year
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Scotland Yard was worse at safeguarding children at risk of child sexual exploitation and rape than it was 12 months earlier, according to a report published in November.
            </p>
            <p>
             Described by sources at Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services as the “most damning review” in the watchdog’s history, it revealed
             <strong>
              that Britain’s biggest police force failed to properly handle 90 per cent of child protection cases.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Challenged over the concerning report, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick
             <strong>
              claimed the issue of grooming gangs was hundreds of years of years old, and suggested the apparent increase in offences could be a result of “raised awareness”.
             </strong>
             Indeed, Scotland Yard was worse at safeguarding children at risk of child sexual exploitation and rape than it was 12 months earlier, according to a report published in November.

             If this is the case, parents need to arm their children.  By that, I mean that they have to ask them if anyone is harming them or touching them inappropriately and educate them.  Then they need to tell them that if anyone tries anything, they are to immediately tell them.  IMMEDIATELY.  And they are to tell them not to ever be too scared to tell on a person in power.  EVER.  We are finding that there are many people in power abusing the children.  Teachers, doctors, nurses, priests, policemen, and their friends parents.  Men and women.  Parents must start arming their children not with guns but with information.

              Great advice! I also tell my kids that if anyone ever hurts them or does anything to them, and then threatens that they will kill them or kill me/dad, to not ever believe it. The kids know we have guns (since we teach them gun safety too) and we are able to protect ourselves and our family, so that is not something they have to be scared of or worry about. I let them know if someone makes that threat, they are lying.

              I have worked with too many adults who were sexually abused as children and were too scared to tell because of threats against their lives or their family. It also has caused me to be suspicious of just about everyone and watch my kids like a hawk because you're right, pedos masquerade as normal people in all walks of life!

               You are doing the right thing by your kids, that's for sure.  Yes, this is the trick many of them use, the killing trick.  Once we counteract that trick, we will really cut into their crimes.  Another warning, which I am sure you are onto is relatives.  I am sure you have come across those cases.  I think those are the worst people.  Taking liberties with their own family of children. How horrid.  And what a horrible thing to even have to discuss with your children, but we must.  If that's what it takes to get kids to rat on even their uncles, aunts or grandparents, even their own brother or sister, then it must be done.  Another horrid one.

            Britain has a verry , very corrupt government. With few exceptions if you scratch one you scratch a pedophile. That sickness is kept hidden and used against the government by (((those))) who know about the pedophiles secret perversion.
