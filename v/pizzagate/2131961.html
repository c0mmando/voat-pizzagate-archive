<p>His boss , Nuncio Christophe, was appointed in 2016 to replace the previous Nuncio who got into hot water covering for a squashed sex inquiry on the Minnesota archbishop John Nienstedt  (had legions of testimony detailing his long history of inappropriate behavior, even covering up for another priest that abused a member of Nienstedt\'s own family)</p>
<p>Nienstedt in turn was accused of covering up for a priest (Curtis Wehmeyer)  with similar problems who actually got prison time:http://minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2013/09/clergy-abuse/</p>

            Nienstedt's failure to address the sexual abuse allegations in his own family, and his cold and calculated response to the family decades later, would foreshadow his failure to adequately address the sexual abuse crisis in the church. Nienstedt resigned from the Archdiocese of St. Paul-Minneapolis in June 2015 while it was under criminal investigation and in bankruptcy.  COLD family response.  I have a feeling that maybe his cold response may have something to do with his not having any feeling for the abused.  What could possibly be the cause of that I ask you.  You make up your own mind.

            for another wonderful Post.  I read your write up and will read the links later.  These guys are just a horrible disgrace.  I too am a Catholic although no longer practicing.  I have tried to tell my parents and aunt but they agree and then continue to go.  They are 89, 90 and 94.  What to do?  At this point their lives would come crashing down if I told them everything I read on here everyday about priest abusers.  I have a feeling that is why  many Catholics are on here from day to day fighting against the  Dirty Disgraceful Dirt Bag Priests. Upvoat4U
