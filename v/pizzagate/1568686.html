            I am she is doing well now.  I didn't know you could arrange for "kidnapping".  Are you being sarcastic?  You really sent her off to a rehab or psychological facility, right?  Or did y'all really say she was kidnapped?

            I have told this to a couple of Veterans and they did not believe me.  I printed out the article in Rolling Stone and gave each one a copy.  They were angry at me at first for ruining their hero worship but now have started doing their own investigations and are glad I told them.

            I've just been reading about it in Wikileaks. Thousands of underage boys trafficked for camel races in the Mideast. of course, knowing that the Muslim male has a proclivity for raping boys, who knows what really happened to the children?

               I knew the media had a strong bias,  but it's usually against republicans in general. I saw them ignore Gary Johnson the libertarian party candidate this year,  which i figured was more because he was a third party candidate. But nope, they really hate libertarians even when they're running as Republicans.

            I don't really care for McCain but it seems like most of this stuff isn't pizza related. It would be good to know who took money from the UAE via Peter Madigan concerning the boys forced into camel racing.

             If anyone wants to know what McCain is really like, read an article in Rolling Stone (this is a few years old but that does not make it untrue).  I never liked McCain, but this really was shocking to me.  What he got away with because of his Father's Military Career, and what he did to the crewmen on board ship is unbelievable.  This really explains what he is capable if you have any doubt about him being involved in any of the pizzagate stuff.
