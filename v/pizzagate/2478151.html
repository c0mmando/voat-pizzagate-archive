<p>Backstory: I love Browning\'s poems, and years ago, I wanted to understand one called Porphyria\'s Lover. I looked into it, and found the disease in the poem, porphyria, or the Royal Disease, has a huge incidence among Ashkenazi Jews, as do a <em>huge</em> number of other <a href="https://i.imgur.com/x3JqCFB.png">genetic disorders</a>. The historic cure for porphyria was <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/born-to-the-purple-the-st/">drinking blood</a>. From there, I found this disease called Tay-Sachs which only affects them, and there is no cure, but thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>Years after finding that, I read a novel that had a character with Tay-Sachs, who was taken from her family to be with people who cured her with blood, and it was written in a way that I have come to associate with hidden meaning - not to mention the link between porphyria, blood drinking, and Tay-Sachs - so I looked in earnest in to Tay-Sachs, and it turns out that there <em>is</em> a cure, only to be found in Israel, and the kids who are diagnosed with the disease are taken from their families to Israel to get treatment. It\'s hard as hell to find what that treatment is, but.... <a href="https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/chasing-a-cure-for-tay-sachs/article_1c2aaaff-aa4d-55f8-8584-99e5111d5805.html">It\'s blood</a>, and marrow. It has been cured with a transfusion of pure umbilical blood, a full replacement of all blood within the child, though historically, it was done through, again, <em>bibens sanguinum</em> (which is the Hebrew translation of the word <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DkDFec14veQC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=bibens+sanguinum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XKt7cBYKUp&amp;sig=JeE-UgMfKO-vP_yBJEM5ZurW2Xo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN55vA5IjWAhXox4MKHQpLCPUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bibens%20sanguinum&amp;f=true">&quot;Damascus&quot;</a>, because it was where Cain slayed Abel), or literally, drinking blood, done every so often. This has been a <a href="https://archive.org/details/EustaceMullins-TheCurseOfCanaanADemonologyOfHistory1987">theme</a> since Canaanites came into existence.</p>
<p>Ok so, yeah, I\'m a crazy person, right? I have to be making this up, and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vp3crcQ.jpg">no one else in history</a> might have stumbled upon this imagined trail of bread crumbs. Turns out that the time in which Jews migrated to Europe, there also happened to arise the mythos of vampirism. You can escape a vampire if you drop a coin on the ground. Bram Stoker\'s Dracula was a Jew. Elizabeth Bathory was a Jew. Motzah balls, traditional ones served at passover, call for the blood of gentile children, and it is a well-kept secret that this practice continues in <a href="https://youtu.be/b98ch_Pyi-Y">some circles today</a>. Hemophilia (love of blood) is a typically Ashkenazi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030906102702/http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org:80/what/ashkenazi/factor.asp">disease</a> (Factor XI deficiency).</p>
<p>Also, look at Marina Abramovic, the Spirit Cooking lady. She\'s fucking <em>70</em>. She is quite obviously a Jew, but her wikipedia page has been scrubbed of any mention of her heritage, though it still lists it in <a href="https://voat.co/v/politics/1389732">search engines</a></p>
<p>We see this same well-documented pattern of blood ritual continue in modern times under the name &quot;piazzagate&quot;, but did you know about the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; of the late 80s which exposed crimes which are functionally identical to both Pizzagate and the history of Jewish blood ritual?  <a href="https://youtu.be/2p2Pp2ywHuU?t=837">https://youtu.be/2p2Pp2ywHuU?t=837</a>  The reason why they say nothing every came of the Satanic Panic was that there never any &quot;proven cases&quot;, but I have linked for you in the text above exhaustive and methodologically rigorous histories of proven cases throughout history. The only reason they aren\'t spoken of more readily, especially in places like this subreddit, is that every proven case has involved Jews. </p>

               One shill could totally take over the front page using about five alts. At two slides per alt name that is ten slides. I don't see any procedure for avoiding this in place.

I will keep this up and completely look into it all Especially now that I know Someone does not want it seen.  This should be posted again at least in whatever.  We can ping a whole slew of people.

               This is the most relevant post of the year. The whole blood drinking thing stems directly from this. I have done my research and obviously the person that posted this thread did theirs too. There is a damn good reason these people preyed on children for the last few thousand years and this is exactly the reason.
