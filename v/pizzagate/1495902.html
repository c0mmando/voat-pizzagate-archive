            Also, this is repetitive as well but it's important that everyone understand how the pedo trafficking is augmented by corruption in CPS:

             The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997
            </strong>
            has institutionalized financial incentives driving corruption within these services. This opens the door to the pedo cartel.
           </p>
           <p>
            74% of trafficking victims were in the care of social services or foster care:

            <strong>
             Horrifying numbers re: Foster Care:
            </strong>
            85% of children are removed from their primary homes for reasons that are not associated with physical, sexual or emotional abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, these foster children are 7-8 times more likely to suffer this kind of abuse in foster care. In other words, they are far more likely to be safer at home.
           </p>
           <p>
            50% of all foster kids end up homeless for at least 5 years after "aging out".
           </p>
           <p>
            The vast majority of homeless in America were foster kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are 3 times more likely to be put on psychotropic drugs than other kids, due to financial incentives to foster parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are more likely to get PTSD than war veterans and less likely to recover from it.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are 6 times more likely to die, than if they stay in their "problematic" or "abusive" home.

            "The number of children taken into state custody each year will be the number sufficient to generate the federal fund claims necessary to balance the agency payroll... The net result is a system in which everyone stays employed only if the number of funded child abuse cases and children taken into state custody always increases and never decreases."

            MAINE
EXCELLENT interview with Dr. Lori Handrahan - parent of a trafficked child who also happens to be a researcher... they've messed with the wrong mom.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her ex (an illegal alien) was aided by the pedo ring in basically abducting her daughter, who had successfully reported the abuse, complete with medical records proving the abuse. Even after the father was caught shoplifting (cough syrup, which pedos commonly use and is as strong as date-rape drug; they found 10x the legal limit of methamphetamines in the child's urine--a near fatal dose).  Instead, the corrupt ME judge gave the father full rights.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over three years, Dr. Lori Handrahan (the mother) studied the structure of the ring. Her research and communication and records reveal a battle with local police, CPS, head of DHS, head of Main Poison Control, the governor, Michael Waxman, a retired state trooper, Ass't Atty General, District Attorney's Office, U.S. Atty General. Rumors for over 20 years about this ring. In her case, Maine Children's Alliance (like Sandusky's Second Mile) President Dean Crocker who is also Ombudsman receiving Fed funds receiving oversight protections.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her research revealed 150+ lawyers cycling in/out of private practice in Portland, ME, the US A.G.'s office and the A.G.'s office, colluding with CPS and the state legislators to run this pedo ring. This jibes with a "john's list" of 170 people that has been cited but not published publicly. Initially, the governor was a strong advocate but then someone must have gotten ahold of him and he also went silent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are a few notes:
           </p>
           <p>
            First, she says the only entity that can really be trusted is the IRS - call them to look for the money connections. (Proving yet again that the .gov doesn't give a shit about our kids, but they do want their fucking money...) She wrote a great Forbes article I linked to on another post:
            <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2012/09/19/to-catch-government-workers-with-ties-to-child-porn-call-the-irs/#74a5df697b9d">
             http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2012/09/19/to-catch-government-workers-with-ties-to-child-porn-call-the-irs/#74a5df697b9d
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Every ring requires collusion with:
police
lawyers
judges
kids procured from someplace - state-run orphanage so this also involves social workers
media
false NGO
           </p>

            Yes - this has been discussed multiple times here, but always good for a review - you might want to do a search for prior conversations, good stuff. Here is more critical info on the late, great, heroic Senator Schaefer, RIP:
           </p>
           <p>
            Georgia Senator Nancy Shaefer and Husband were "murder-suicided" (allegedly over financial woes) weeks before she was to complete a documentary on her exposure of pedophilia in Child Protective Services and coverups at all levels of  state and local governments.

             The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Highlights from this report:
           </p>
           <p>
            **That poor parents often times are targeted to lose their children because they do not have the where-with-all to hire lawyers and fight the system. Being poor does not mean you are not a good parent or that you do not love your child, or that your child should be removed and placed with strangers.
           </p>
           <p>
            **That caseworkers and social workers are oftentimes guilty of fraud. They withhold evidence. They fabricate evidence and they seek to terminate parental rights. However, when charges are made against them, the charges are ignored.
           </p>
           <p>
            **The funding continues as long as the child is out of the home. When a child in foster care is placed with a new family then "adoption bonus funds" are available. When a child is placed in a mental health facility and is on 16 drugs per day, like two children of a constituent of mine, more funds are involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            **The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1998 reported that six times as many children died in foster care than in the general public and that once removed to official "safety", these children are far more likely to suffer abuse, including sexual molestation than in the general population.
           </p>
           <p>
            **That according to the California Little Hoover Commission Report in 2003, 30% to 70% of the children in California group homes do not belong there and should not have been removed from their homes.

             Senator Schaefer is Killed

            weeks before she was to complete her documentary on CPS links to child trafficking

            This article has a short list of just 291 children that have lost their lives while in CPS "hands":

            The person she was working on the documentary with is William Fain who supposedly is a child advocate who tours the country advocating for children and teamed up to do the documentary w/ Schaefer. Alex Jones interviewed him and it was one of those interviews where Jones just let the guy talk, asked very few questions... and I can't put my finger on it but most everything this guy said just didn't sound right. Immediately after the "murder suicides" he claimed with certainty that there's no reason to suspect foul play. Also, he vowed to publish the documentary and of course, never did. Here's the interview:

            Here's a strange article from InfoWars:

            Reality Calls did a really good job on a video meant to introduce people to the topic, if you want something succinct and vetted to red-pill people with:

           <p>
            I think it's also important for people to know about her story, because it helps people (who are able to think critically) understand that the people investigating and putting themselves out there for pizzagate/pedogate are not doing it to troll or push a partisan agenda. Making significant progress in uncovering this type of corruption gets people killed. Nobody "trolls" the internet when it could get them suicided, but saving children is worth the risk.

            Yup, she got whacked after spreading the word nationwide on Infowars. BTW this will help you organize all your info, geo tag locations, and search databases for names, usernames, and emails:

              I'm technically new to voat as well. I normally traverse the dark web to stay abreast on the latest hacks. I decided to lend a helping hand to the less computer savvy that are investigating.
