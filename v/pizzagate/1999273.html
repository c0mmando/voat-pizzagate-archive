            Recent documented case of SRA indicated that a tube was inserted into the child's rectum
           </p>
           <p>
            The child was put into a special pair of pants / trousers / jeans with a plug in the side - electric plug
           </p>
           <p>
            Was then "hooked up" to a car. The plug in the trousers fit into a plug in a small electric - kid sized? - car
           </p>
           <p>
            The child also talked about his/her "poop was stolen"
           </p>
           <p>
            Is anyone familiar with any mechanical device in existence that would fit this description?

            It would seem that there is some connection between nerves in the anus and the pineal gland and overall body function.  From what I understand, a large portion of fatal cardiac events occur in the morning during the constitutional.

            I don't suppose there are any surgeons or accupressure experts in here?

            I agree with this post, but it's funny how Mods will leave this post up but will delete a post about the gay rights founder being connected to Crowley and NAMBLA because it's "not related to pizzagate." Wtf...

             True. To really understand why Crowley is connected to NAMBLA the foundation has to be established. That takes going back in time to the core beliefs. Understanding who Crowley really was and how his writings were based on Egyptian Mythology of Osiris. Also understanding he was a top British Intelligence officer who worked helped develop US Intel &amp; trauma based mind control using the power of the state to practice their rituals on children.

            The 5th video down from the top, on the home page, is from Discovery Channel.  It is an excellent, if sanitized, overview of MK-Ultra.  Especially if one is new to the subject and needing some factual verification.  Don't let Hollywood brainwash you, it was and still is very real. Only the name has been changed.  This video doesn't cover the more disturbing aspects of the CIA techniques, the purposeful and clinical sodomizing of children.   Dr. Collin Ross is interviewed, he is highly regarded on this MK subject, and is a leading edge therapist to those afflicted by it.    Rape, that core aspect of the subject matter was still too hot for Discovery to touch.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 7th video covers how sodomy is central to the subject, does it very well and is shorter than most of the others.  I didn't watch all them, if the music is frightening I usually exit early PTSD. That's my litmus test for video.  Fear mongering isn't the way out, it just leads to more fear.
           </p>
           <p>
            The write up on the first page about  MK-ULTRA is excellent.  Here's a quote:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Organized through the Scientific Intelligence Division of the CIA, the project coordinated with the Special Operations Division of the U.S. Army's Chemical Corps. The program began in the early 1950s, was officially sanctioned in 1953, was reduced in scope in 1964, further curtailed in 1967 and officially halted in 1973. The program engaged in many illegal activities; in particular it used unwitting U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects, which led to controversy regarding its legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as various forms of torture.
           </p>
           <p>
            The scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at 80 institutions, including 44 colleges and universities, as well as hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated through these institutions using front organizations, although sometimes top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement."

            This is connected to pizzagate because it shows the beginning of Institutionalized Satanic Ritual Abuse by the State. The people involved are politicians and elite of past right until current day involved in child sex trafficking. This is very difficult to watch. It contains live interviews with the Hampstead Whistleblower children in the U.K. It also provides a detailed account of the use of Sodomy in children to stimulate the nerve endings at the base of the spine signaling the Pineal Gland in the brain. This has been discussed at length in archived threads. To grasp pizzagate and Satanic Ritual Child Abuse this is extremely important to understand.
The perfection of these techniques were used in Concentration Camps in Nazi Germany.
           </p>
           <p>
            This can help others see the Aleister Crowley connection to all of this. Remember he was not only a self-identified Satanist who gave himself the title "the beast &amp; 666" He was a British Intelligence Officer who also worked in the US. The Jesuits are these intel agencies elite. They formed the CIA after WW11.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aleister Crowley authored "The book of the Law" and the Thelmaic Religion which is mentioned repeatedly in John Podesta and others emails and followed by those such as Marina Abromavich. The spirit cooking recipe and rituals come from this.
           </p>
           <p>
            This understanding will allow you to see the meaning behind John Podesta's hands marked by the number 14 &amp; the fish symbol as told in the story of Osiris "the god of the underworld"

             I'm still puzzled by the hand marks.  What's it mean in Osiris?

              Research the Egyptian god of the dead. The story of Osiris and Isis &amp; Horos. You are starting to see many posts linking the Eye of Horos and the Pineal Gland (third eye believed accessed by sodomy)
             </p>

              It is about Ritual &amp; Death and worship of the god of the underworld. The number fourteen relates to dismemberment of the body and the fish symbol relates to the Nile River. The Egyptian story is not a myth but is believed. It involved incest and cannibalism. These are the symbols in that infamous picture of John Podesta with his palms raised.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is part of Thelmaic beliefs as written by Aleister Crowley. There have been well written explanations of Osiris and the occult. Understanding this core belief they share will help clear up the motivations.
