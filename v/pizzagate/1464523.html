            The most disturbing photo to me was the ( same?) little girl in the dress with a swirl motive holding something that looked like tape. There was a boy toddler in the background. That scene just didn't look right at all. I don't know at the moment if it was also taken from Alefantis' instagram, was it?

            Edit: This photo and apparantly it was from instagram

            Come on! Her mom comments on the posts and he said it was his niece or God daughter. I'm all for digging into this, but fk all the speculating. It's the same pictures of the same girl. I don't think Comet is the answer to everything. Just the door. This is becoming a dead end  with the same BS posts now for a month. Bring something new. not trying to discourage. I do believe we are on to something, but get up to speed.

             In one of the pictures of this baby who is supposedly his god daughter, Alefantis refers to the infant as a he, only to be corrected in a comment by Izette Folger, who wrote, "It's a SHE baby!!!" If this is really Alefantis's godchild, how could he have not know that it was female?

            I made a comment about that kids eyes the first time I saw them. Definitely seems sleep deprived if not distressed as well.
