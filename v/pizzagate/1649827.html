<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions oversees more arrests made in connection with Elite pedophile rings. </p>
<p>State police in Pennsylvania have just arrested a man for multiple accounts of sexually abusing minors, but now evidence has emerged that the man arrested was part of a family network that was responsible for supplying elite pedophile networks with children.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Sandusky, 41, who was arrested and charged with 14 counts, including statutory sexual assault, is the adopted son of Jerry Sandusky, the former longtime Penn State football assistant who was convicted in a school’s child sexual-abuse scandal.Jerry Sandusky is currently severing a life sentence in Pennsylvania\'s SCI Greene &quot;supermax&quot; prison after being found guilty of 45 counts of molestation in October 2012. </p>
<p>Now, more evidence has come to light to show the Sandusky family were investigated in 2011 for &quot;supplying&quot; Elite pedophile rings with children, or more specifically, &quot;young boys&quot; through the Second Mile Program.In 2011, radio host, Mark Madden, wrote an article attempting to expose the cover-up by Penn State officials into the investigation of the Sanduskys and The Second Mile organization. In an interview with John Dennis and Gerry Callahan, Madden said; “I can give you a rumor and I can give you something I think might happen.</p>
<p>I hear there’s a rumor that there will be a more shocking development from the Second Mile Foundation — and hold on to your stomachs, boys, this is gross, I will use the only language I can — that Jerry Sandusky and Second Mile were pimping out young boys to rich donors. That was being investigated by two prominent columnists even as I speak.”Speaking on Twitter regarding his reasons for going public about the cover-up, Madden said; “I normally abhor giving RUMORS credence, but whole Sandusky scandal started out as a RUMOR.</p>
<p>It gets deeper and more disgusting all the time.”Jeffrey Sandusky was arrested following reports that he had been sexually abusing the daughter of the women he was living with after the victim confessed to her elder sister, who raised the alarm that he\'d been molesting her. When Sandusky was taken into custody by State Troopers, his phone and computer were seized by officers which revealed a wealth of inappropriate text messages to minors as well as child pornography.</p>
<p>Sandusky is currently being held on a $200,000 bail on charges including solicitation of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, unlawful contact with a minor, solicitation to photograph or depict sexual acts, sexual abuse of children and corruption of minors.</p>',

            Sometimes the partner turn a blind eye. Sometimes they refuse to see it.  I don't know how that could be the case. There MUST be signs that a caring mother would see.

             I think that happens quite a bit but there is also "plausible deniability" which makes it very hard to indict unless there is firm evidence linking her directly to the crime. This makes it easy for her to be involved since she cannot be found "guilty by association" as many convicted are through timelines, etc.
