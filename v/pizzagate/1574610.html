<p>While looking into Victor Pinchuk and his ties to the Clinton Foundation I noticed he had a group called &quot;Cradles of Life&quot; dedicated to providing neonatal care to save the lives of premature babies.  Considering how he is a sick fucker I was clearly skeptical and wondering what the catch is and I think I found it.  It is in partnership with an organization called &quot;New Life&quot;.  When I looked up the organization I found only an adoption website and a surrogacy group with that name. The only mention of the group as a perinatal care group came from Pinchuk himself.  While I don\'t think the groups I found are directly related to Pinchuk\'s &quot;New Life&quot; one provided me extremely useful information on what is probably going on.  
</p>
<p>The issue of surrogacy being used to further child trafficking has been brought up on this board before.  In the Ukraine surrogacy is legal and the surrogate mother has no rights to the child so it is the go to place for getting surrogate children.  Frequently surrogate babies are born and then people fake contracts with the fake surrogate parents in order to act like they had commissioned the birth instead of just buying the child like it was from a meat-market.  One problem with surrogacy is it increases the risk of premature birth and perinatal death.  In Australia commercial surrogate babies had a 45% prematurity rate.  If Pinchuk really wanted to prevent premature births he would come out against the surrogacy business.  
</p>
<p>For those who look at it as a business you lose money from the IVF process and an opportunity cost from the gestation period of the surrogate mother so they have an interest in keeping the baby alive even if they are viewing it as just a sellable commodity.  However, they will sell the premature children to anyone who wants them which means many will be abused and molested (The New Life website flat out says they will sell to anyone).  Because of this Pinchuk can claim to be a savior of children while actually many would have been better off dead than go through the Hell that awaits them.  Sick stuff.</p>',

            I'm sure the kids that get preyed on are eugenically selected for various features in appearance as well as selecting the biological sex up front.

            Wouldn't surprise me the least that it occurs.  We are dealing with truly deranged people who I put nothing past.  But I don't think that is the case here though because IVF is the primary cause.  Pinchuk would probably much prefer to not have to pay to save their lives to still make money from trafficking them.

            Not sure I believe that.  I was born premature and low birth weight and I don't fall prey to a lot of the media propaganda that most of the people around me do.  I attribute it to birth cortisol levels making me less trusting and more cautious.
