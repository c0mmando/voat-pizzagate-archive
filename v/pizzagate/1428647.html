            Is Pizza Comet the same as Comet Ping Pong?  I feel like these are two separate places.  I thought it was a typo in the title but you called it Pizza Comet again in a comment.  Has a place named that been deemed suspicious and I just missed it in all the chaos?

            On Thursday November 3 around 5p.m, I saw 2 Cadillac Escalades in 1 minute. One was heading toward downtown, the other one was coming out of the streets next to the Brandy Wine building. I sensed something's not right since I've never seen Escalades in this areas at this hour, so I wrote down the plate number of the second car: 958885T.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both cars used PAPER instead of metal plates which even weirder to me. OR the papers were taped over the metal plates to conceal them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, this happened under 1 min.

            One story stands above all else is from my mom. She gossiped with our neighbors a lot about all kinds of thing, and this is the one thing that motivates me to post. Around August 2012, she told me about a story she heard that a kid who's lost for 12 years was found and returned home. My kid brother was almost 8 at that time so I couldn't tell whether she's making shit up or not.
           </p>

            I've rarely seen people with kids going into Pizza comet, but that's probably just me since I don't go out a lot. There's a CVS shop nearby that I used to  go to to buy some late night snacks, nothing particularly intrigued me about the area at night.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Murch Elementary school directly behind my apartment is full of kids from pre-K to 5th graders. A bit convenient to certain people in question, I might say.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS: I used to take 2 or 3 miles walks from May 2012 to August 2012 but I didn't notice any strange sounds. I do, however, notice the helicopter sound as they patrolled every now and then.
