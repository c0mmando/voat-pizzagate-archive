            Sorry for the shitty quality but a search for their logo shows their current logo which is still triangle shaped but nowhere near as obvious as this. This 'clue' hit me like a punch in the stomach to be honest, was standing out the front of my place having a smoke, when I walked back in there was literally a cloth bag (likes the re-usable ones for supermarkets) sitting on a desk in the study full of junk. I live with my family so its probably years old but was surreal to see it just sitting there. The logo is very obviously similar to those shown previously as listed by the FBI.

             Great find. This  company was first established as a division of Jardine Matheson in 1972.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jardine Matheson still owns a lot of valuable real estate in Boston through various holding companies. The Boston marathon attack was a PSYOP which used as a fraudulent eyewitness a manager of one of their five-star hotels (Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group), as well as others with connections to the IDF Leadership School, the Rotary Club, Strauss Israel (second largest food manufacturer in Israel), and the Beth Deaconess Medical Centre.

             All the relevant information is contained in this thread, if you didn't find it at the time. It's well worth going through the entire thing.

             This is the British-Israel, Royal Family-Mossad connection. This 'aristocratic' line is still around in the form of the Scottish Keswick family, and former PM David Cameron himself worked for the company after leaving Oxford University.

             It's well known that their fortune was built on the Chinese opium trade.
