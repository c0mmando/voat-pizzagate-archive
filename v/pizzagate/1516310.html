<h2>Now, here\'s the bigger tie-in into <strong>Tampa Bay Times</strong>:</h2>
<p><strong>Craig Newmark of Craigslist</strong> donated $1mil to Poynter Journalism School to fight &quot;fake news&quot; in their ethics department. News breaks <em>December 12th</em> same time as heavy  #pizzagate stuff. Remember the coinciding dates of the Tampa By Times article going missing - sometime <em>between 12-2 and 12-18</em>. Remember the three articles the author put out at Washington Post: <em>12-6, 12-7, 12-7</em>...</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/pCBeI6.png">https://i.sli.mg/pCBeI6.png</a></p>
<p>Poynter\'s chairman, <strong>Paul Tash</strong>, also runs <strong>Tampa Bay Times</strong>. So, Poynter gets the $, and the chairman runs both poynter and Tampa Bay Times, where the article went poof.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/KnySr0.png">https://i.sli.mg/KnySr0.png</a></p>
<p>Also: The TB Times subscriber-ship funds in part, <strong>Politifact</strong>, but is also funded by \'<strong>Democracy Fund</strong>\'</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/nXgYR4.png">https://i.sli.mg/nXgYR4.png</a></p>
<p><strong>Poynter</strong> has also &quot;partnered&quot; with <strong>Democracy Fund</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/kKACWh.png">https://i.sli.mg/kKACWh.png</a></p>
<p><strong>Democracy Fund</strong> came out of Omidyar (<em>Pierre Omidyar of Ebay, owner of The Intercept publisher First Look Media</em>)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/iCrJiR.png">https://i.sli.mg/iCrJiR.png</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Omidyar and Newmark are the founders of two of the largest exchangers of goods online, I don\'t think it\'s a stretch to say that these two are not further than a phone call away.</p>
<hr />
<h2>So to sum up:</h2>
<p>Scrubbed pedo article at a paper whose chair receives $1M \'gift\' to his university\'s ethics program to fight fake news; conflict of interests for Politifact with same parent funding org, Omidyar, as the Clinton Foundation. <strong>Seems legit, right</strong>?</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/LBu9kT.png">https://i.sli.mg/LBu9kT.png</a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Edit 1</em></strong>: </p>
<p>The new chair at Poynter is going to be <strong>Kelly McBride</strong>. The following needs more development, but she\'s a former/current staff member and a frequent contributor to NYT, Washington Post and a number of other outlets. She\'s extremely focused on ethics in journalism. Note the Washington Post tie-in to the current workplace of the above journalist posting several anti-Pizzagate articles whose Tampa Bay Times article was removed...more development to come.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Edit 2</em></strong>: </p>
<p>&quot;The International Fact Checking Network&quot; Initiated by <strong>Facebook</strong> and spear-headed by <strong>Poynter</strong>, IFCN, is funded by the above-mentioned, but is also funded by <strong>Open Society Foundations</strong>, a <strong>George Soros</strong>\' Funding operation. And, it\'s been well established that Soros is a <strong>Clinton Foundation</strong> funder.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><em>Edit 3</em></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Newmark</strong> and <strong>Omidyar</strong> have a very tumultuous past when <strong>Ebay</strong> tried to take over <strong>Craigslist</strong>, and seems that it was even stealing tech from CL for which they were under investigation. It stands to reason why Newmark would make himself part of <strong>Poynter</strong>, which very clearly is funded by Omidyar. The details of Ebay selling its stake of CL stock were kept private</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/RTjMgK.png">https://i.sli.mg/RTjMgK.png</a></p>
<p><strong>Omidyar</strong> looks very...very sketchy from all the stuff that I\'m reading. Lot\'s of money, lot\'s of funding organizations, lot\'s of ties all over the place, good philanthropic front with a very dark side. And, he\'s got roots in <strong>Hawaii</strong> that seem pretty suspect - having attended the same school as Obama and AOLs Steve Case (also a big funder). Coincidence that there\'s been a lot of posts here on Voat and on 8ch/Infinichan to suspect Hawaii activity? Hawaii\'s location and challenging terrain make it a good place to secret things/people away.</p>

           Omidyar and Newmark are the founders of two of the largest exchangers of goods online, I don't think it's a stretch to say that these two are not further than a phone call away.

           The new chair at Poynter is going to be
           <strong>
            Kelly McBride
           </strong>
           . The following needs more development, but she's a former/current staff member and a frequent contributor to NYT, Washington Post and a number of other outlets. She's extremely focused on ethics in journalism. Note the Washington Post tie-in to the current workplace of the above journalist posting several anti-Pizzagate articles whose Tampa Bay Times article was removed...more development to come.

            Ebay

           tried to take over

            Craigslist

           , and seems that it was even stealing tech from CL for which they were under investigation. It stands to reason why Newmark would make himself part of

            Poynter
           </strong>
           , which very clearly is funded by Omidyar. The details of Ebay selling its stake of CL stock were kept private

            Omidyar

           looks very...very sketchy from all the stuff that I'm reading. Lot's of money, lot's of funding organizations, lot's of ties all over the place, good philanthropic front with a very dark side. And, he's got roots in
           <strong>
            Hawaii
           </strong>
           that seem pretty suspect - having attended the same school as Obama and AOLs Steve Case (also a big funder). Coincidence that there's been a lot of posts here on Voat and on 8ch/Infinichan to suspect Hawaii activity? Hawaii's location and challenging terrain make it a good place to secret things/people away.

              I hear you! I have personal down voters who down vote every single comment I make. Check my post history. Most have a minimum of -1.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are trying to take away our ability to post (and freedom of speech) by taking away all comment contribution points. Once you go below 0 you can't post anymore. People have nothing better to do I guess.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: the problem is that if you would have 55 points and 60 active comments, one single troll with a few hundred points can down vote all your comments and you won't be able to post anymore. We need to start up voting each other a lot more so shills and trolls down voting has no impact at all.

               Ya, I'm in the same boat right now with not being able to down vote shills.

               The problem is that it's dangerous to just hand out upvotes for the sake of allowing folks to downvote. If anyone plans to do that, make sure to look into the account a bit and make sure you aren't inadvertently helping a shill

                It is because many are new and only have 10 upvotes per day. But if we don't do it then trolls/shills could shut people up like they did before when lots of people were voted in big numbers below 0. We should be able to take care of shills/trolls ourselves here. The only way to do that is start being more generous so everybody can gain points which in turn makes it much harder to attack us by taking away points so we can't post and are forced to beg for upvotes or create new accounts.
