            First, they say the Russians leaked the emails to Wikileaks. Now, they're investigating Russians (with no motive) for the murder of Seth Rich, for leaking the emails to Wikileaks. Which is it? To leak or not to leak.  They can't have it both ways.

            He had been speaking to his girlfriend on the phone just 2-minutes before he was shot, and told his girlfriend, “I’ve got heat” before hanging up.

            I thought he had also said he was just a couple of minutes from home and the girlfriend reported "noises" before he hung up.

            Rich was reportedly very talkative with police and paramedics, and many were surprised when he died about two hours later at the hospital from blood loss.  They also claim there was film from a grocery store that showed two people coming up behind him and shooting him.  And Ta-Da  they even mention the possibility of going to the Russian story. Oh Lord.

             Where is Seth Rich's laptop, where is the body camera footage from the three police officers on the scene, why wasn't all the camera footage from the bar Seth was at right before he was murdered ever requested and why did Donna Brazille request that the investigation be stopped?
            </p>
            <p>
             Very strange, all three bodycams from the responding officers have gone walkabout and are nowhere to be found? in a murder investigation? that alone seems a bit unusual.

            <p>
             American news media ignores many important stories, which is why the Daily Mail is one of my go to sources for news in the US and worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
             This whole thing stinks to high heaven
            </p>
            <p>
             And yet they print and air 24/7 hot and cold running BS Russia stories, with no problem
The Metro Police Chief was given the plumb job of director of security for the NFL a month following Seth's murder. The whole thing is about to unravel and I pray for the sake of this family and the rule of law in the country that heads role!
            </p>
            <p>
             I always thought it was suspicious and the investigation was non existent for such a high profile case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did I read this right? They're trying to say the Russians did it? I can't remember laughing so hard and normally I would find nothing funny about that poor man's death. Why would the Russians seek him out unless they were hired by the DNC? I mean, seriously he was no threat to anyone except Hillary and her people. Saying the Russians did this is preposterous.
            </p>
            <p>
             Several sources including a former British Ambassador have said he was the leak and was worried for his safety.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now the theory from the left is Russian agents killed him. What happened to the robbery theory? More evidence of collusion between the Dems and the Russians.

             Jack Burkman is not to be trusted as he was a NeverTrumper and raised a lot of money in the campaign to stop Trump.

              Yes, I have often wondered why Hannity never had former Ambassador Craig Murray on since he already  said that Seth gave him the emalis to give to Wikileaks. As soon as the police report was released I and others figured out there were 3 body cams and it was not rocket science.  They are keeping this from us. I also wonder why the bar owner was never grilled.  He now says that he was out of state?  We are being played.

              It might have been faked to verify a robbery like he was fighting back.  But I don't really know.  There is so much that seems answered one day and then gone the next day.Maybe it was not a big fist fight maybe he was pushed down on the ground or fell and scraped his knuckles and skin on the concrete.  We are left to do our own research because the DC LE and Elites are not giving us the honest answers that they should be.  That is THEIR job, not ours.

               Totally their job. So the injuries might have occurred from being tossed from a moving car ... which would support Webb's theory. Until the basics are released, we'll continue to speculate. And we are making such unbelievable headway ... like what someone online genius dug up about the doctor treating Seth Rich and the policeman who was on the scene.

                We have done all the research and they have released nothing.  We are left to play the waiting game, it seems.  Well, we are not about that are we?  We are not as stupid as they look.

                 Good way of putting it! Really, things are moving extremely quickly ... considering. Right now they have the wagons circled around the Russian narrative. It's all about getting through those wagons and KimDotCom might be a lead.

             EXCLUSIVE: Family of slain DNC staffer Seth Rich demands D.C. police reveal details of its murder investigation after reports claimed he may have been the source of Wikileaks emails
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Rich, a 27-year-old staffer for the DNC, was killed a few blocks from his home in Washington, D.C. last July.  No valuables were stolen
             </li>
             <li>
              Law enforcement officials have remained silent and theories spread about the mysterious circumstances of Rich’s shooting death
             </li>
             <li>
              On Tuesday, Fox News was forced to retract an explosive report that claimed Rich was behind the Wikileaks email leak
             </li>
             <li>
              The claim had caused speculation that he may have been assassinated for political reasons
             </li>
             <li>
              A team of private investigators led by GOP lobbyist Jack Burkman told DailyMail.com he found no emails to Wikileaks on Seth Rich's computer
             </li>
             <li>
              PI Rod Wheeler told DailyMail.com told he has never personally viewed the emails
             </li>
             <li>
              Police said Rich's unsolved killing was the result of a botched robbery but PIs working for the family said  the shooting was unrelated to a robbery
             </li>
            </ul>

             That definitely is noteworthy. I can't get access through usual means either. It's there to make citizen researchers think MSM is covering it to a degree. Same with the Fox thing from Hannity. They (Fox) are now stating there was zero evidence and they canned the story as 'fake'.

            <p>
             This means that psy-op minions are distributing this link in a controlled fashion.
