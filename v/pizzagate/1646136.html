<p>Here is a video link of SilverGunners explained video of Caillou Them Song which had the &quot;snuff pedo&quot; ring to it. So this video might clarify a bit of the process of creation of the Fatherhood video.

You have more connections to it being this then the connections to Podesta.

            I'm sorry people jumped down your throat instead of discussing rationally but as I'm sure you understand, the subject matter is very touchy. 
That being said, you definitely didn't provide ANY proof of it being fake. I don't need to provide proof it's real, the people who made the video need to provide proof it's fake. Until I've seen it, I will assume it's real enough that it requires investigation.

            It certainly does not speak for itself. Do they sell their music? Do shows? You honestly believe this is a serious musical group? I'm inclined to believe they're just trying to scare people, but I haven't seen any proof that their videos are fake, and they are definitely alarming enough to warrant the concern.

            I don't see how any of that proves that the video is fake. The silvergunner guy proved his video is fake, but not the original. Where in the discord group did they say it's fake? Can you provide a screenshot? Because I did in fact spend a long time going through the discord and all I saw were vague, shitty answers from kids trying to be edgy

            Jesus man, no one with a brain would make a video like this! Even if it is not Podesta, that shit is not art!
These sick fucks now need to prove that no kid/kids was tortured, that it was just "art".
Why would a non pedo make a kid's song about snuff? Even as a joke, who but a pedo would do that!

             Videos like this are supposedly made to enhance the effect of hallucinogens. I still think they should have to explain the video themselves and prove it was fake, but I have heard about this being a thing on the dark web.

            The thing about being able to "fake" virtually anything digitally with the right software and talented programmers, visual effects artists, etc is it's magic. One can't readily discern real from fake except via the context. Blair witch project played with context and that had people questioning what was real and what was fake. I am concerned that people are showing us real and calling it fake, ie Marina's art, etc... And/or people who fake also partake in real.

            This post might be legit, you guys need to calm down, if these videos are indeed fake then we need to move on. Did you guys even watch the video linked at the bottom? They clearly show that they made these videos themselves.

            Yeah, OK so these fucks get bored and decided for shits and giggles, we will put together a child being tortured video! 
Also, cuz they are super talented  they show the world that they can put together a fun kids themed song about "snuff"
           </p>
           <p>
            They should have to prove that this was all faked. Set up a live feed, and  show exactly how they made this Sick Evil Satanic shit!

            Thank you! I am very upset about what this group is doing right now, like notice when someone is trying to infiltrate with misinformation to distract. Deceitful information is always more interesting to lead on because you can come up with so many conclusions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope i can help clarify for those who seek the truth.

             They're all shills. It's their latest attempt to screw with us. You can tell the shills by their passive-aggressive attitudes and the way they use "key phrases" in just the right way.  Too perfect. Hard to describe. Like people learning a foreign language who use the proper way of saying things instead of the way normal people speak.  Anyway.... They're trying to divert attention.  And/or frustrate the investigation. Take it as a sign you're on the right track.  Ie don't let the bastards get you down.

            Shut up. It was not debunked and reddit is not to be trusted anymore anyway. How the fuck did these gamers get a child to act as if it's being tortured? Children are shitty actors.

             Are you serious, they are composers! That is their job, to manipulate sound. I can film my nephews running around screaming when they get in trouble. EZ 
I use reddit term loosely, THEIR FANS ON REDDIT, debunked it, contacted authorities, interviewed Silvergunner and they spoke on behalf of Worldcorp, who get paid by youtubers to provide music for their videos.

              I'm going to have to call bullshit on you here. Not that the videos are for sure real, but you saying "but theyre composers!" is like saying "but theyre priests!" When you write something off because of who someone is... nowadays, that just makes you look dumb and guilty yourself.
