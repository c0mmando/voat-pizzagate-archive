            So a Danish woman with ties to a Danish man who started a group involved in fraudulent third-world charities was at a meeting for third-world charities.  This is tenuous.  I don't see any connection to Pizzagate.  The "Teachers" group has been called a "political cult."  It hasn't been connected to ritual abuse.
