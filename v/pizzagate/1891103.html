            Well, if I was one of the Brainwashed Army I am sure I could still come up with an excuse to say:  It was the Russians!  Here is something Murray said: "I have no criminal record, no connection to drugs or terrorism, have a return ticket, hotel booking and sufficient funds. I have a passport from a visa waiver country and have visited the USA frequently before during 38 years and never overstayed. The only possible grounds for this refusal of entry clearance are things I have written against neo-liberalism, attacks on civil liberties and neo-conservative foreign policy. People at the conference in Washington will now not be able to hear me speak. Plainly ideas can be dangerous. So much for the land of the free!"  PS:  Do you think that just possibly some might be afraid of questions that may be posed to Murray while he is here, about Seth Rich?  Nah.

            I had lunch yesterday with a friend and she told me she had read somewhere that Seth wore a type of watch that could hold a flash drive.  Whoa. that hit me right in the forehead. I typed in Seth Rich and Flash Drive and came up with this article:
            <a href="http://www.1776again.com/2017/01/10/who-killed-seth-rich/">
             http://www.1776again.com/2017/01/10/who-killed-seth-rich/
            </a>
            ***Many things stuck out for me in here, but some more than others.  They mentioned the flash drive.  That made me think that is why they were trying to get his watch off - they were looking for that flash drive.  I think it was already gone because he had passed it to Craig Murray.  When they discovered it gone and the watch was torn that is where they came up with using that as their excuse that it was done in the "robbery".   They had already entertained the thought of killing him but they wanted to talk to him before doing so, to get info.  Maybe that is where they noticed his watch, knowing what kind it was.  I have always wondered what he did in all that lost time that we all wondered about.  Here is another interesting item: " Security footage from a nearby market showed two men following Rich through a crosswalk by his home moments before he was shot, FoxNews.com has learned. For some strange reason, the camera recording the event was not pointed where it normally points and the camera only captured the assailants’ legs and Rich after he was shot and fell onto the street. It’s almost as of it was set-up that way." Remember the shooter at CPP and how we wondered about the outside cameras and how we thought they were moved on purpose?  I think that is what happened the night on that corner on Flagler.  Also you see at the beginning of the article a picture of the scene on  that corner with people around Seth.  The guys in the navy shirts are DCFD from the Fire Dept.  There are two other people there that could be LE but I am not sure of the uniforms, besides there are only two and we know there were more.  Who are those two people?  Ok, another thing that came to me, the story about Seth being offered a job by the Hillary Campaign.  Why would they be offering him a job only 4 days before killing him.  I believe that is just a made up story to take the interest off of the campaign.  There had been way too many people already on their Kill List just in recent times.  Whew.  That is all for now.  I am sure I will think of more and if I do I will add it later.  Please Read the Article.  It is titled WHO KILLED SETH RICH. Thanks,

            This needs some immediate scrutiny. A US Attorney is murdered yesterday in business clothes in Florida with gunshot to the head and FBI is not crawling all over it?

             Great catch. This is very strange. A US Attorney is found murdered with a gunshot to the head and it makes no news headlines. Then the FBI refers questions to local police. That does not happen ever. All cases of Federal prosecutors are automatically investigated by FBI &amp; Dept. of Justice.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is enourmous. We need to get on this. Nice catch

              Found this in another article.   Whisenant had been working on visa and passport fraud cases, according to court documents. He also taught a paralegal program at the University of Miami.   Don't know if this helps.  Trying to find out if he was working on some really important case, that might have cause him being killed.  Great post btw.  Upvoats are in order.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The defendant was convicted, after trial, inter alia, of the crime of robbery in the first degree, as charged in the second count of the indictment, in that he forcibly stole property from the victim and during the course thereof “use[d] or threaten[ed] the immediate use of a dangerous instrument” (see, Penal Law § 160.15 [3]).
           </p>
           <p>
            The evidence adduced at the trial was sufficient to establish that the defendant placed a loaded .32 caliber revolver in the victim’s back during the robbery, and stated to the victim “keep your head down, don’t turn around, I got a gun * * * if you turn around you’ve had it”.

             The anons have to be extremely careful. If the info they provide can be linked to them it is 2 bullets in the back of the head. There are obvious shills spreading disinfo anonymously and insiders who are scared that release it in very secretive ways. You have to watch for the second type.

            maybe, anything is possible.  I'm still thinking assassins is officer robinson. He's got two connections to Podestas/Clintons, Metro police are complicit and the initial police report was changed regarding the shot spotter and we still don't have any info about the ambulance. Its the simplest theory and makes the most sense. Robinson probably ambushed Seth causing him to hang up the phone and then shot him twice in the dark. Robinson probably started to rough him up and tear the watchband when spotshooter caused other officers to arrive, followed by fire and news crews. The question is why did it take so long for the ambulance to get Seth to the hospital. And the wounds weren't so bad, so they got the hospital to finish the job.
           </p>
           <p>
            I dont think the FBI stolen guns or the Myrtle Beach guys are directly involved but certainly I could be wrong.

             I know I typed it wrong sorry. Realize that there has been mention it is not the gold van. That might actually be the disinfo versus the obituary. A researcher has found a direct connection by name.

              Since we  have pretty much bee running with what anon has told us (I was pretty excited too about the two guys)  I am thinking that maybe he is right and that maybe these two guys did something else nefarious that they were payed off for but were offed for damage control.  Remember they had quite a few people already on their kill list.  I too think these guys might be really important but for another reason than Seth Rich.  That is of course if anon is right.     I have found an article that is very telling and when I get my thoughts together I will put it in the comments.  It all started with something a friend told me yesterday at lunch. That Seth wore a watch that you could put a flash drive in.  A watch that holds a flash drive.  In this article it mentions him handing a flash drive over.

               That is interesting. Yes Seth was involved in handing off flashdrives to "sources" that delivered them to Wikileaks. I always wondered why it stated in the police report that nothing was stolen from him but "his watch was torn" Always found that strange. Most watches do not tear and it is an odd fact to list in the police report that was intentionally repeated by the Parents.
              </p>
              <p>
               This has always been strange to me it is not a fact most people remember about a murder. Almost like it was a message to someone like "his watch was torn (we got the flash drive)"
              </p>
              <p>
               There were other drops though maybe they thought they had intercepted the drop then killed him but it was sloppy.

                I think that he was gone far too long without us knowing where he was after he left Lou's.  I think somehow he was called and they questioned him, this verified that they were right.  They were going to kill him and they also knew somehow that he had a flash drive in his watch.  They tried to get it, but the cops were coming and had to leave.  I think he had already passed that flash drive on to Craig Murray.  That is why the watch band was twisted and torn.  I am going to put my thoughts into the comments about this other article soon.  My head is really screwed up after reading it.

                 Yes I also wrote about this earlier and believe you are right. Reading the statement of the "watch being torn" was odd from the beginning. Intentional and repeated as if they were trying to send a message that they had gotten the drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Honestly this feels like he was set up ahead of time. Joe Capone in the Whitehouse with felon SCEIU and Obama friend felon Bob Creamer 4 days before.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Capone admits to being present with Seth the night of his death at Lou's bar. He describes Seth as "being drunker than ever" and even offered him a ride home.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Seth leaves but goes missing for at least two hours. Gunshots are heard via shot-spotter and he is found shot in the back. Alive &amp; talking with watch torn. Bruising on hands etc. showing signs of struggle.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He goes to hospital, has surgery then dies after being stable.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Joe Capone lies last week and says he was out of town with his family that night. No investigation. FBI guns go missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I could go on. There is something called a "dying declaration" in law enforcement. When someone is a victim of a crime and their lives are in peril officers must stay with the victim to take all statements. This includes in the Ambulance. Hospital, etc. The officer is trained to get as much crucial information as possible. The identity of suspects, or descriptions, associations, conflicts, etc. In case the victim dies these statements can be used in court as evidence bypassing hearsay in testimony by the officer.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The D.C. Police would be mandated to be with him in the Ambulance, the EMT's would be interviewed as part of the homicide investigation. The autopsy would be included which could identify the caliper of bullet used and at what distance he was shot based on the wound.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Seth's hands would have been bagged immediately so scrapping of DNA from his finger nails could be made due to the physical struggle.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I could go on. I believe as you do. Something was slipped in his drink (truth serum" there was an attempted interrogation about who else he had spoken to. Shawn Lucas died next.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then some altercation happened or they just leaked the torn watch story as a warning to others that they got the flash drive. The weapon will come back to one of the FBI weapons reported stolen.

                  I totally agree.  About the flash drive, either it was already gone and he had given it to Murray, or yes you are right, they got it that night. And Yes, vomiting.  I thought I had cried the last time over Seth.  But now I am doing it again.  I wonder when it will stop?  My husband and two friends keep asking me how long will you go on with this?  Till we are done. Until we get justice for the patriotic kid that stole our hearts.

"A man at the scene who said he owned the gold van told The Sun News he knew the driver and let him borrow the van last night. The man said he’s known the guy for several years." (Read more here:
            <a href="http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/local/article88847962.html#storylink=cpy">
             http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/local/article88847962.html#storylink=cpy)
            </a>
            ) Both articles shows a clear unmasked picture of the tag on the ** Gold Chevy Astro Van**  "South Carolina LGL 344". Using free lookup tools on that tag returns "Plate Number:	LGL344,Make: 	Ford, Model:Explorer XLT, Body: 	SUV 4D,Engine: 	4.0L V6 EFI" 
So - Stolen tags? Can someone with access verify that tag data?

            Searching the names of these two deaths they turn up as SCIEU members with at least one that worked for Clinton Campaign. This has been mentioned in several forums including /pol/ Reddit &amp; here on Voat. Thought we might want to look into it. If there were additional murders of Clinton staffers on the same day as Seth would this not be an FBI investigation?

            There is also a link between one and some strange art as we saw in Alefantis work.

            It seems in archive.is one of these guys obituaries has a link Clinton Foundation Aide. Now scrubbed. Not sure of authenticity.

             I thought that  NotFBIAnon said these were not the guys or am I mistaken. I think it is quite a coincidence at least one was an SEIU member. Found dead next day.

             MS13? but of course they overlap with CIA also so yeah. there doesn't seem to be much online about these two and now that everything is so after the fact who can trust what is out there. obviously FBI is worse than useless, hopefully Trump will ditch McCabe soon and let honorable agents shift up.

              MS 13 is not just involved in CIA they work for Awan Brothers Pakistani Spy Ring involved in HRC/Podesta circle. This is why Debbie Wasserman Shultz was threatening the Chief yesterday to get the "equipment" back. Not sure if it is them but thought we should look.
             </p>
             <p>
              Below is the biggest redpill of all. Thought I would share it because it involves Seth Rich, HRC, Podesta, Debbie Wasserman Shultz, Awan brothers, Drug trafficking, CIA, etc. It is a very big redpill so don't watch if you get stressed at how corrupt &amp; evil this world is. Watch it if you want truth and can keep digging.

               MS-13, Latin Kings, and other gangs are used similarly through the mafia in Racine, Wisconsin. They do the dirty work for the elites running the trafficking and racketeering networks. This is why they need Racine, Milwaukee and Chicago to be sanctuary cities to hide the trail. There are Awans in Racine, associated pain clinics through Racine and Milwaukee, and others from Pakistan and India running side businesses in collusion with criminally corrupt officials and their associates. Local LEO are all corrupt along with the DA and Milwaukee FBI office which is a revolving door of corrupt and complicit leadership. The mafia and secret societies are very much in play in partnership with the corrupt elite using gangs, convicts and others down the line, covering it up, and tying off loose ends. The FBI cannot be trusted as they colluded with Loretta Lynch to stop investigations into Racine once they found out who it was connected to (including the Clintons and beyond to the real power players involved).

                You should post to George Webb YouTube or get hold of him or JASON Goodman. They have the Awan's Pakistan ISI involved in bringing in heroin with CIA to Chicago &amp; also setting up pain clinics all over the country where they sell opioids with Fetanal purposely addicting US citizens causing death then involved in organ harvesting,
