<p>This is a video of a pre school and a nursing home combined. </p>
<p>Its kind of sad watching this thinking of all the potential. We get all of these children in foster homes who might even be getting raped. These children grow up in foster homes, but they never have a parent. Every child would have a happier life if they had a parent. Parents keep the childs goodness intact. Without parents the child is slowly contaminated by the badness of society, and eventually becomes like the other bad people. This is also a fulffiling solution to an older persons life. I know that older people love children(not always in a sick way). Its good to see them having somebody to take care of, and being able to fullfil the final years of their life. Old people are usually very tired and jaded, but I know from experience that they become inspired around children. Its a great combination because children need guidence, and care while older people need energy and something to take care of. Its a beautiful thing because both the children and the adults can fullfill each other. Im sure that a child who grew up in something like this wouldnt feel like they lacked a close family growing up. I know this isnt pizzagate related directly, but I was thinking that if you watch this it could help inspire you to desire busting the pedos even more.</p>',

            Thank you.  It is a great idea if run by the right people.  That is the problem, we have entrusted our children unto the wrong people.  We know someone that just was taken to a nursing home and this would be a most definite pleasure.  She had no grand children and always wanted some.
