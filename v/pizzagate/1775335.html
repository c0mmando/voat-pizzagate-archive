            All those Hentai porn pics were put up by PGIZDUMB. He posted his usual drivel 2 minutes after the last Hentai porn picture was posted. That's no coinkydink.

            So he's a pedophile, there's no other explanation. He posted maybe 20 or 30 cartoon pics of little girls being raped. He's got a collection somewhere no doubt.

             It's either that, or this is a direct response to an influx of new users on the site and someone is purposefully trying to make this forum appear to be something it is not. We're going to need more mods...

            I'm still seeing a steady flow of these on the new thread with several usernames constantly posting. What would be the incentive? One multi-taskers lulz? I don't mean to jump to conclusions, but the consistency and on the evening of the tomahawk launches, I can't help but feel we're being herded into a picture frame of sorts...

             Not new either. The only change this time around was that it is cp. I put in some keyword blacklists to try and skip archiving those posts if they keep at it.

              You're right, PizzagateBot, I should have clarified that what is new is the content, not the action. Man, AI sure is getting better by the day ;)

              Edit: good call with the archive blacklisting- out of curiosity, though, would you mind sharing which key words?

              My thoughts exactly. The site isn't directly responsible for links shared by individuals, though, I imagine. It ought to be annoying work for our dear mods to clean it up, but other than that the only shitty factor I have just witnessed is first-time visitors will come here and go "WTF??"

                 Your favorite mod is the one that worked for 10 days to destroy the protests?  With lies that were proven to be wrong right after the first protest.   Stubbornly wouldn't admit any wrong and kept up the betraying, immoral and defaming posts through the second protests, proven wrong a second time and no apology, mistake admitted or anything to address the community her squat wrong sticky hanging over the entire place did - and you cheerlead?

                  Calm down please. I don't know what you want from me. What do you mean betraying, immoral and defaming posts? Can you explain? I agree that the sticky was somewhat of a bad idea, but the purpose was to spread awareness and warn people about the possible problems that could be encountered during the protests. Thank Goodness, nothing disastrous happened, but I don't think the sticky had any baring on the outcome to be honest. People showed up and it was more or less a success. Plus, my comment which advocated for the second date, on the 25th of March, instead of the 18th (which I personally thought was a bad idea since it was going to be held in front of Comet Ping Pong restaurant), made it to the top.

                  did NOT reply in any way; not negatively, nor immorally. I don't see where the problem is.

                   I was told specifically by one of the organizers that there were 600 rougly rsvp's to the first protest before that sticky when up.  Even if ony half would have shown that sticky depressed the whole effort and they DO blame some of the problem directly on that treachorous hit piece of slander contained in that sticky.  Not to mention the refusal to admit mistakes and take it down for the second weekend and beyond.   Disgusted.

                    You have inside info that I don't have. I might be wrong to think that it did not affect the outcome of the protest and for that I am sorry. As for an apology from Vindicator, that is not up to me.

                     No one said that is up to you, but what is up to you is to get real.  You want to sniff the butt of the foremost obvious traitor to this place, then go ahead, have yourself a "not negative experience."   But your judgement is seriously impaired, sad to say.   Look around, this place is weirder by a yard, and full of strangers.  you want to be part of a cult?  your blank happy cheerleading is putting you right in order.  Enjoy.

                       funny you mistake a real read for fake. You are so far away with your "I don't want to have a bad experience" narcissism from helping kids you are promoting the very ones hurting them.  Sorry you had to get obscene too, didn't used to be your style.

                        I've been busting my butt to gather material, spread awareness, consolidate threads, connect dots and help the investigation in any way I can. Do you know how much crap, evil, indecency I have to go through and read on a daily basis? This is not "I don't want to have a bad experience" narcissism. It's not my style to be obscene, but hey, there are limits to my patience. If you have a problem with Vindicator, it is not mine. The sticky was up for 2 or 3 weeks. Do you know how many upvoats it got? How many other voaters see him or her as a traitor? Less than 10? Why aren't all the others feeling as outraged and disgusted as you are over him /her? Why aren't they voicing their opinions, why aren't they bullying him/her like you do? I believe the only one here suffering from "narcissistic personality disorder" is you. Sorry to be this harsh, but I you were kind of looking for it.

                         Telling you I'm disappointed in you while I watch you fawn over a betrayer is not bullying btw, you are not above criticism because you have done what everyone else here has done.  1ew explained the upvotes very well, you are such a great researcher, find that explanation yourself.  and yes many are disgusted by Vindicator, but most activists have just left.   Exactly the desired effect.  Congrats on your super sleuthing except you can't discern disinfo propaganda even when it is waving like a red flag in front your your status seeking virtue signaling face.  An old phrase comes to mind.  I'll paraphrase - With help like yours, who needs shills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Anyway I'm not interested in exploring this further, I do wish you well and much sharper discernment in your ongoing journey.  I am not going to bring these opinions to any discussions on the board here, as a courtesy nod to the times when we were able to work together.  Good luck.

                          YOU GUYZ ARE BOTH AWESOME AND WE NEED UR POSITIVE ENERGY!!!! It's very easy to get into medium to low range periods of health after exerting so much mental energy into this stuff. I don't see anything 'wrong' from either of you here.. Your underlying intentions are pure... Only prob is the levels of negative/aggressive energy overloaded exchange and since it can't be attributed to underlying  intentions (as it normally can with shill for example) my professional opinion would be that it's due to medium ebb of health due to research loads. (Which means it''s really nada)
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I wasn't completely aware of substance behind ur mod accusations until now Bleu.... And I think both you and YYM have very positive aspects of your views towards Vindicator.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I'm going to use Alex Jones for analogy....
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Let's say both Alex Jones and Vindicator are at least partially compromised. (I'm not asserting this to be true, Devils advocate)
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We can say that their negative charge is decreasing marcher turnout .
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Even though Alex messed up with apology and I hated him for a few days... I'll never forget the amount of joy I had watching that Joe Rogan podcast and he continues to pour energy into the overall movement.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Let's say vindicator messed up by making sticky... But the actual process of moderating isn't easy and I've seen V defending the PizzaGate sub from the rest of VOAT who don't like us very much.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Now in these instances we have to analyze the underlying motives. For Alex Jones... He might be co-intel pro or might have had his family threatened... But I detected truth in his eyes and in his heart at many times during the Rogan podcast. Especially when talking about singularity. This means that his soul is not behind the cointilproing... His soul is behind uncovering of truth. It's not about the contract that is signed, it's about the man who signs it.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I remember reading the March posts but never detected illumination behind words. I never felt an internal pang. When V defended us against VOAT mods I felt that pang. You could detect truth. This means that although Vindicator might have some kind of "contract" that requires negative actions to be performed but because of their underlying intentions the overall net worth of their contributions will be positive and they deserve to be appreciated for that.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Humans are inherently paradoxical. Perhaps you aren't even allows to become a PizzaGate mod unless you submit to this control. We aren't privy to these matters
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I'm think I'm falling asleep so just gonna send. Point is Bleu and YYM u guys are both super awakens and we need you. Also Alex Jones, Vindicator or anybody else who MIGHT have some type of contractual obligation to negativity but they should be judged on their underlying motives and the net worth of their contributions rather than being trapped into their negatives.

                            Let's say vindicator messed up by making sticky... But the actual process of moderating isn't easy and I've seen V defending the PizzaGate sub from the rest of VOAT who don't like us very much.

                           This is where I was 3 days or so before the second protest.   We "bumpted" into each other and I very sympathetically (I even added a picture of an olive branch) said, look, you can see everything, literally, you said about the first protest was just wrong.   This is a moment of redemption.  Just say ok, this has been here long enough, take it down replace the regular sticky and tell everyone you are fine with moving forward.  No harm no foul.  Anyone can make a mistake.   Reasonable in the extreme.

                           What I recieved back was the most condescending, crappy, snotty response possible.  This is just the end of it.

                            I was deeply gratified to be able to send a message that smart people here are watching the watchers and watching out for each other and will not be intimidated by poorly orchestrated smear efforts. I am completely at peace, despite scores of nasty messages and comments.

                           That's when I started calling Vindicator after the smug, stupid and self satisfied Nellie Oleson.   I couldn't believe it.   She was bragging about being "infamous" and reveled in it even though she clearly knew she had stomped on a community effort.  I honestly was a bit shocked.  You can look at the parent to that permaiink and see my comment where I was trying to say anyone can make a mistake, let's just fix it now, etc..

                           Ever since then it has been to the mat with that one, as far as I'm concerned.  There is no redemption coming back from being excited to be infamous off the struggle of activist protestors and ultimately, abused children.  D-I-S-G-U-S-T-E-D  TO THE POINT OF TOXIC VOMITOUS is all I can say about someone like that.  When I think about the fear and anxiety people go through to put themselves out there for this cause, and some self satisfied prick like her sits on the top of this forum and gleefully squashes it all, not only because she can, but because she can't bring herself to simply be humble enough to admit she made a BIG mistake.  And then YYM celebrating that person like an airhead cheerleader as though none of this ever happened.  All I ever said was I was disappointed and she got super defensive - I didn't expect to get into it but I wasn't going to let HER snide bs stand either.  After being specifically asked by SOS and me, she slightly amended her top voted sticky on that thread, although a bit relunctantly, which was great.  But she knew what was in that thread and that it was all lies and disinfo ultimately - and that is a FAVORITE mod?. This is what they mean by useful tools, to put it nicely.

                           Anyway I just now saw this before my PMs to you, thanks for trying to see a bridge between us but unlike YYM I stand very firmly against sniffing the hindquarters of betrayers for status points and smiley faces.

                           BTW Vindicator told me that the mods post their own submissions under alternate names.

                            You don't think mods post their research under their mod names do you?

                           That would be pretty dickish. We have alts for posting research, so that it can be judged on its own merits.

                           Makes you wonder how come some not so great posts here get instantly upvoated, right?   Also, considering the mod climate, makes you wonder about all those submissions that come in waves like the ones pushing WorldCorp down our throats.  Anyway, food for thought.  Although she told me, because I figured out wecanhelp is the same as sensitive and other reasons, it is NOT generally widely known.   I doubt if anyone knows it really.   These people toy with the forum like it's a cute little game to talk about at cocktail hour.  Makes me nauseated.

                           I've come to understand that the people running these kinds of places have more than their share of priviledged twerps with ivory tower mentalities that model themselves after the fatuous bubble culture of silicon valley, whether they actuallly live there or not.

                           They pat themselves on the back telling themselves over and over a mantra of what good people they are and just like any church or cult, you find the greatest hypocrisy in those who chant it it the loudest.  If you want to understand what I mean, watch the show Silicon Valley - it is a comedy with insight into tech culture.  YYM even took her name from it, though she told me she came up with it herself - but used the exact same words as on the TV show.  ::rolls eyes::
