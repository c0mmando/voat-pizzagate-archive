             And how many times migratorypatterns will post it because its about politics and migratorypatterns said today that anything Trump related is pizzagate. That mentality is gonna destroy pizzagate if people don't get it into their head that the Democratic party alone is NOT pizzagate.

              agree.  i think too many of us consider PG a Dem issue.  I believe this degeneracy is not strictly limited to libtards. if we narrow the lens to exclude Reps, we're leaving out a chunk of the abusers.

             "Bucceroni explained that he was a ‘juvenile delinquent,’ and that he was one of many other ‘troubled’ young boys prostituted by Savitz to influential pedophiles like Sandusky and Dennis Hastert in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. Bucceroni’s statements to Disobedient Media indicated that influential pedophiles would typically target children who were financially and emotionally vulnerable to create a dependence on drugs or financial support, and that this often took place under the guise of philanthropy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bucceroni told Pundit Press that he was first introduced to Ed Savitz through social campaign events on behalf of prominent Democrat Ed Rendell during his bid for Philadelphia District Attorney.
            </p>
            <p>
             Although Savitz was eventually arrested for alleged sexual abuse of minors, The Daily News reported that Savitz died of AIDS just before the beginning of his trial in 1993. The New York Times wrote that authorities recovered 5,000 images of child pornography from Savitz’ residence. Additional reports stated that 200 bags of dirty underwear and socks were also recovered, along with 100 photographs taken at a “storage facility.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The New York Times added that Savitz had first been arrested on charges of sexual abuse of minors in 1978, but that Savitz’ record was expunged after completing a brief stint in rehab.  The Savitz case recalls the infamous Belgian Dutroux scandal. Like Marc Dutroux, Savitz appeared to be a middleman amongst an extensive ring of child abusers, rather than a lone predator. Bucceroni claims that as a result of being trafficked by Ed Savitz, he interacted with a number of prominent figures ranging from Dennis Hastert and Tom Foglietta to Lawrence King, all of whom engaged in pedophilia. Bucceroni told Disobedient Media that these interactions often took place at official political events. Bucceroni recounted that children were exploited for sexual acts in after-parties once the political event ended.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bucceroni told Disobedient Media that Lawrence King, central figure in the Nebraska Credit Union scandal, would host trips to “take kids from the South Philly Boys Club to Washington D.C.” Bucceroni explained that he was never tortured by Savitz or Lawrence King and was not personally aware of others being tortured but that Savitz used the “honey approach rather than vinegar.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Basciano had a well-documented friendship with Ed Rendell, a former District Attorney for Philadelphia, former Governor of Pennsylvania and former DNC Chair. Some press reports go so far as to suggest that Rendell shielded Basciano in the aftermath of a 2013 building collapse. An editorial by the Philadelphia Inquirer lamented that “It was disheartening to hear a former mayor, Ed Rendell, defend Richard Basciano,” during the ensuing scandal. The editorial appears to have since been removed from the Inquirer’s site.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a report by the Inquirer, Basciano said that he regarded Rendell as a “good friend.”  Another 2013 report by the Inquirer also referred to Rendell as a longtime friend of Basciano’s, who had accepted campaign donations from corporations and family members of the pornography magnate. The article has since been removed from the Inquirer’s website but was located using a newspaper archive service.
            </p>
            <p>
             This raises strong questions regarding Rendell’s longstanding friendship with Basciano in light of Bucceroni’s claim that prominent Democrat Ed Rendell engaged in pedophilia as well as his assertion that Basciano’s pornography outlets produced child abuse and snuff films. Michael Zaffarano was also mentioned in the Select Committee hearing, and acted as a mentor to Robert DiBernardo, adding further weight to the connection between Bucceroni’s claims and child exploitation as discussed on government record.
            </p>
            <p>
             Samuel Rappaport is also reported to have contributed financially to Rendell. The financial and personal connection between Richard Basciano, Samuel Rappaport and the former DNC Chair clearly ties the former Governor to a documented mafia associate involved with the production of child pornography.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Washington Post has described Rendell’s former Chief of Staff, David L Cohen, as ‘Comcast’s secret weapon.’ Bucceroni has also accused Cohen of wrongdoing. Cohen, now a Senior Executive Vice President of Comcast Corporation and the Company’s Chief Diversity Officer, served as Chief of Staff to Mayor Ed Rendell from 1991 to 1992.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Washington Post described Cohen as: “One of the highest-paid corporate figures operating in Washington.” Cohen also serves as Chairman of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and its Executive Committee, according to the Aspen Institute. Cohen is also Executive Vice President of NBCUniversal Media. NBC has been in the recent media spotlight after allegations emerged regarding sexual assault by host Matt Lauer against a number of female colleagues. The media company also came under fire for its unwillingness to publish an early story covering the Weinstein scandal, with the New York Times publishing an article titled ‘How Did NBC Miss Out on a Harvey Weinstein Exposé?’
            </p>
            <p>
             Bucceroni also told Disobedient Media that lobbyist Tony Podesta was known to be friends of figures such as Eddie Savitz and Richard Basciano, stating that he had seem them mixing at various philanthropic and social events in Philadelphia and New Jersey. He was careful to clarify that he had never personally witnessed Podesta interacting with minors in an untoward manner...."

               Ed Rendell, who is literally mentioned ^^^ as an alleged pedophile and is documented to factually be connected to (donations, friendships etc) child pornographers. Ed Rendell is a former DNC chair, former Gov of Pennsylvania, former Philadelphia District Attorney. He is factually friends with mafia members and slum lords. The article also mentions Lawrence King of the Franklin scandal.
              </p>
              <p>
               The article linked also discusses intelligence agencies using child prostitution for blackmail. This story is basically proof of pedogate but people here don't understand names that aren't screamed at them 24/7.
              </p>
              <p>
               The fact that this sub hasn't grasped the importance of this story is irritating.

                Sorry but I'm sick of people throwing youtube links without bothering to spell out the specifics.  I had already seen Bucceroni's interview yesterday.
               </p>
               <p>
                What really struck me about it is that it seems to happen in the same circle/timeframe as the GWBush "Jeff Gannon/James Guckert" White House rentboy scandal.  I'm very familiar with the whole Frankin Scandal/Lawrence King.   Yeah I agree this is big news - this thread was very poorly presented by the OP, that's all.

                 Your comments indicate you never read the article, which is necessary background for the interviews being posted. Idk how you can blame others for you not reading. Even when I posted the literal quote from the article naming the DNC chair you didn't know who I was talking about. That's not OP's fault.

                  An even better point. Its sliding into the swamp and just wait until they crank up the "sexual impropriety" windmill in the mainstream press. Its coming. And people in this sub will jump on it like a dog on a bone because they have associated the Democratic party AS pizzagate and its gonna destroy pizzagate if it don't stop.

                    It does seem in the course of making your point your making few friends.  So many seem problematic, I agree often but pointing it out rarely improves anyone..

                     Wow. Think about that sentence. "more than Trump." If people don't stop trying to turn pizzagate into Trumpgate pizzagate will become a Repub cheerleading squad. Its already happening and I'm trying to reason with people. Pizzagate will die on the vine if this don't stop.
