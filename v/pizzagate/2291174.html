<p>Here is proof that the elites have protected those who use human body parts for profit :</p>
<p>**<strong>Two Southern California organ procurement companies owned by the Ecuadorian Isaias crime family, have agreed to pay nearly $7.8 million in a settlement of a law suit brought by Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas last year that alleges the companies broke state laws regarding the trafficking of human aborted baby body parts.</strong></p>
<p>According to the Orange County complaint, the Isaias companies had no problem procuring on a regular basis tissue of aborted babies, including hearts, lungs, kidneys, brains, intestines, skeletal muscle and bones, from Planned Parenthood abortion facilities in Southern California, which were then sold worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/oaygV">http://archive.is/oaygV</a>.   The lawsuit accused the companies of illegally selling cells from fetal brain tissue for up to $1,100 per vial from 2009 to 2015, prosecutors said. Fetal tissue and cells were sold to pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions in Japan, China, Singapore, South Korea, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, the Netherlands, Canada and the United Kingdom, authorities said.</p>

The lawsuit followed a year of congressional investigation into allegations that Planned Parenthood sold aborted fetal tissue and organs to biomedical companies for profit.</p>
<p>****Hillary Clinton\'s good buddies, ****the wealthy Isaias family of Ecuador, sought asylum in America after stealing something like $660 million from the nation of Ecuador.

            In 2014:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez interceded on behalf of an Ecuadorian woman who was banned from traveling to the U.S. because of allegations she had engaged in visa fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             The woman, Estafania Isaias, is the daughter of a fugitive from Ecuador convicted in absentia for bank fraud and whose relatives in Florida made significant campaign donations to the New Jersey Democrat's 2012 campaign and the Democratic Party.

            Great job OP. Here is an interesting article I found confirming the connections between the Isaias family and the Clintons.

            Given the context of these reveals, its likely that Davinci Biosciences and DV Biologics were intended to be "fronts" for the true agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hidden in plain sight, since the things they look into imply stem cell based therapies. More specifically embryonic stem cells.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cruely ironic that in this investigation I keep coming back to the very field (biotech and microbiology) that I got screwed out of a career in because the economy imploded mere months before I graduated. As if I'm being actively taunted and mocked about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            That screw over is one of many things that cause me a whole lot of pent up rage.

             i know how you feel. i had a similar thing happen with my film/video post production education. &amp; on top of being screwed out of a career, i've been gang stalked/harassed/tortured by hollywood mafia (illuminati cunts) for over 10 yrs now.

            Has absolutely nothing to do with this lead. Its about a Ukrainian arms deal.

            This deal likely explains the phrases "traitor" and "Nat Sec".

            I’m sure many of us remember the

            <em>

            videos. I think this is a good place and time to revisit them, and give a hat tip to James O’Keefe and his staff. It’s infuriating to see — PP monsters still up and running; PP defenders vs. detractors looks about 10:1 in my internet search results; numerous articles that go through contortions to
            <em>
             debunk
            </em>
            these videos. I hope I live to see the day the public is thoroughly redpilled on this subject.

             During that time, the family made hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to Democratic and Republican political campaigns, in what became known as the Clinton “Pay for Play” scandal. Family members gave roughly $300,000 to Democrat politicians alone and reached out to Hillary Clinton thru her aide, Cheryl Mills, according to the New York Times. In return, the family received favorable treatment from the Obama Administration and State Department under Clinton, which expedited their immigration into the U.S.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2012, Roberto and William Isaias were sentenced in abstentia to eight years in prison for running their bank into the ground then presenting false balance sheets to profit from bailout funds. Estefano Sr. was also said to have been involved in the scheme, but was not on trial.
Ecuador says the Isaias family cost the impoverished country a total of $661.5 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clinton-led State Department resisted numerous requests by Ecuador to extradite the Isaias brothers back to their native country to face punishment.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Hillary Clinton allowed a known crime family into the U.S. so they could sell Planned Parenthood’s aborted baby body parts for profit. This connects Clinton to the illegal baby parts trade, in addition to improperly giving special favors to criminals in return for financial donations. The FBI should include her in their ongoing investigation,” Newman said.

            Would be so awesome if Ecuador charged HRC and demanded her extradited.

             He did - "Was the 7.8mm worth it?". Schiff is deeply connected to planned parenthood but I can't quite make the link to this yet. The amounts are too coincidental though

             Yes he did the other day but I thought Q said Shiff took a dirty 7.8 million related to Planned Parenthood?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Here is an article from July with Shiff's name in it regarding Planned Parenthood but it looks like Shiff is trying to out Planned Parenthood? He also mentions Benghazi.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “Who knows, maybe the select committee on Planned Parenthood can shed some light on Benghazi,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) quipped during a briefing Wednesday, which included both the Pro-Choice Caucus and Democratic members of the Benghazi panel.
