            I can understand.  Almost feels like (to me)  we are living in a world a'la The Truman Show (Movie).  Everything he thought was true,  was totally a "crisis actor event"  that went on his entire life.

            Ditto! These Sick  Evil Satanic Pedos walk among us! They make money, off of this shit!
Missing kids, death, all the people involved WTF! We was soo close to having that POS HillPedo sitting in the WH. HollyWeird the music industry, military, government, schools, medical, pharma, food, transportation, churches, retail, art, and God only knows what else is all involved! No more LibTards in any form of authority ever again! Let's face it, any Republican involved in this sickness is Republican in name only!  Praying 2017 brings down the Clinton Pedo Crime Cabal!

            Be happy that it's uncovered. Be joyous. We would never have known! Instead of getting depressed, be grateful and thank people like Assange and Seth Rich and the Ecuadorian embassy and all those DNC'ers who leaked and stood up to these PERVS!!! I mean, they made child prostitution legal in California! That would have been nationwide if HRC had gotten in! And nobody would have known WTH they were doing it? Okay, a handful of people would have known, so be happy!

            I know I'm the same I've been finding it hard to get on with normal life stuff, because it all seems to mean nothing anymore. I feel like going to work is supporting their system, buying stuff is supporting their system, just the whole of life seems fake.It can' t get covered up again. I think more people know now, and with the internet, information can spread much easier than it did when some of these other cases came to light. I know it's really depressing, but take heart from the huge number of people who are trying to investigate and do their best to expose what's going on, all these people who just genuinely care, whose hearts ache for the suffering of the children and the people they don't know and will never meet. The good people far outweigh the bad in this world, we've just got to get them to recognise that there are some people who are just beyond and below what we can comprehend in terms of depravity - I think many good people almost don't have the capacity to realise or accept that such evil stuff goes on.

            Do you have anyone in your life you can talk to about it? It's pretty lonely being the only one in your social circle who knows. I was thinking it would be great to do Pizzagate meetups, but then realised the meet up locations would probably get bombed or something. Anyway, just do what little you can to try and get the truth out there and have faith that the wonderful decent people of the world, when they're awake, will do anything to stomp out this kind of infection, and we'll succeed!

             Creating a meetup is like the dumbest idea I've heard.  I would have thought differently, but you have to check out what happened when gamergate tried to do a meetup (all they wanted was ethics in jurnalism).

             Admittedly, it would be a great alt media stunt to have a bomb threat called in.  Nothing glues a group together like a victim complex.

            1.) Wrong place for this comment, it'll probably be removed, or you'll be asked to move it to

            2.) How long have wars of religion been going on?  This is a battle of ideas.  It doesn't just stop.
