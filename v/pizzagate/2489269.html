<p>That video can\'t be re-uploaded to YouTube. It was only ever on YouTube once uploaded by a Greens gay rights activist. It has Senator Lee Rhiannon saying Scott Morrison (then immigration) minister is a &quot;homophobic bigot&quot; for not letting an FBI infant sex porn fugitive Dr Matthew Hynd aka <a href="https://voat.co/user/slurptea1">@slurptea1</a> - slurp marriage equality tea - all profits from infant sex lover raised gay marriage activist go to Queensland Aids council - trying to sponsor his illegal immigrant visa over-stayer Pakistani boyfriend. Under immigration law if you are an illegal immigrant over-stayer you can\'t marry to stay in the country - you must go home and be banned for 5 years before re-applying even on a marriage visa if you are straight. But that\'s not good enough for gays being treated equally so Pedophiles use the Greens to queue jump immigration and it\'s a LGBTI issue complete with a Greens press release. Very interesting case. </p>

<p>They are using technology designed to flag child porn to block videos of leaders of government praising pedophiles. Test for yourself!

<p>Technical information: The video I re-uploaded to 153news (you can download via the download button there) was downloaded using youtube-dl.org - a python scrypt that DOES NOT RE-ENCODE the video.

By QLD police actions they are saying pedophilia is inclusive of LGBTI by saying it\'s a crime to ask the gay lobby to give back infant sex lover ran campaign cash to a child protection charity (Queensland AIDS council). Also more to come on how OTOAustralia.org.au\'s Greg Tillet founded said gay police. Share this on facebook.com/policeglbti and you will be banned for life / arrested on arrival to Australia.

           - slurp marriage equality tea - all profits from infant sex lover raised gay marriage activist go to Queensland Aids council - trying to sponsor his illegal immigrant visa over-stayer Pakistani boyfriend. Under immigration law if you are an illegal immigrant over-stayer you can't marry to stay in the country - you must go home and be banned for 5 years before re-applying even on a marriage visa if you are straight. But that's not good enough for gays being treated equally so Pedophiles use the Greens to queue jump immigration and it's a LGBTI issue complete with a Greens press release. Very interesting case.

            Hello,
           </p>
           <p>
            My name is Luke McKee.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am a well known anti-gay-pedophilia activist and UNHCR confirmed political refugee and dissident from Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has come to my attention that a leader of the Australian Greens Party whilst supporting pedophiles on the run from the FBI for child porn gave a public speech at a protest outside Australian Government Immigration offices in Sydney claiming that Pakistan wholesale kills homosexuals.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Even Wikipedia says that is a lie.
Sodomy laws are normally only used against pedophiles - and not enforced. Your country even has transgender rights.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please read the top story about this saga on the world's #1 anti-pedophilia forum:

            Australian government has ruled you don't have bad a character if you download child porn - because the pedophile above whilst in jail in the USA is still sponsoring his boyfriends visa in Australia right now. Under Australian law you must be of good character to sponsor a migrant into Australia - and visa's are cancelled if immigration is informed otherwise. Immigration blocked my email because the manager was gay - and decided that child porn isn't bad character  - as exposed above.

            A public statement that you don't kill gays to restore the honor of your country on the international human rights stage contrary to the public statement's by Australian political leaders - and that this homosexual put in Australia near Australian children by the Greens party lobbying and a pedophile singing the sponsorship forms is removed as per the law. He never had a right to stay in Australia even before the visa was granted as he was an illegal immigrant over-stayer. Greens used gay rights as a platform to help him queue jump, avoid deportation and a 5 year ban that even non-homosexuals get for breaking the immigration laws before they can marry.

            What you choose to say about Lee Rhiannon of the Australian Greens party is not my decision but I know what I would do. She's already lost the ability to rejoin the next government, and has under investigation for parliamentary expenses fraud. There will be little detriment to international relations condemning her actions in league with pedophiles to attack Pakistan with baseless lies, and to be honest the majority of the Australian voting population will THANK YOU!

            what do we do when there are too many pedophiles here that downvote this story even after gay marriage protest organizers blogged the same thing (minus the new YouTube revaluations) if you see the links below so this intel doesn't get onto the front page of pizzagate.
            <a href="http://www.thestirrer.com.au/crowd-funded-hero-jailed-for-child-porn/">

            (that's a gay author only blog site)
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to block a news story that even some good gays call it out and then you downvote it - it must mean we have a problem with pro-pedophile downvoters on voat.
           </p>
           <h2>
            What do we do about people who downvote anti-gay-pedophile stories that even gay marriage activists write blogs about condemning? That proves this post isn't anti-gay it's anti-pedophile. So someone who is anti anti-gay-pedophile activism - logic dictates (double negative) he has to be pro-gay-pedophile - or if you believe the legal fiction some gays say that there is no such thing as gay pedophiles then just pro-pedophile. So therefore by this logic

            It's funny how the only story left in the Australian MSM about this (all others censored like courier mail one day after publication when they realized they already done 20 stories on the guy praising him as a gay marriage activist)... anyway... funny how all the MSM news from Australia never said he was one of the biggest gay marriage activists the country has ever seen.

              Thank you hojuruku. That was exactly what was needed.

              ProTip: When you have a complex submission with lots of claims and links supporting them, you can select the text that needs a supporting link, click the third formatting button (visible when you "view desktop site" if on mobile), and paste in the link url and it will turn the text into a hot link. Alternatively, you can manually insert the code by putting brackets around the text, followed immediately (no space) by the url address in parenthesis. This is great because it:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               Gets those ugly long url's out of the text
              </li>
              <li>
               Highlights the key points of your material in blue
              </li>
              <li>
               Clearly delineates which link supports which claim

               That's an alternative link to download the raw gay pride protest video of Senator Lee Rhiannon supporting those FBI child porn fugitives. It was downloaded with a youtube-dl.org in 2014. Can any of you guys upload it to you youtube or am I onto something here. My two YouTube accont's wont accept the video that YouTube encoded itself.

             Now that article is amazing, and based off my research because Bernard Gaynor has a close relationship with Miranda Devine at the Daily Terror newspaper. Maybe that article was only in print not put online so they weren't sued for hate speech and it would be harder for the gays to find. It's publication date is well after my breaking the whole WTF this guy is a gay marriage activist. The courier mail newspaper shared the story on twitter with the #childporn hashtag and deleted the story within a day of posting it once the commentators on there also worked out he was a gay marriage activist.
            </p>
            <p>
             This news story clearly shows Dr Matthew Hynd and Ali R Choundry were in a long distance relationship when the child porn was downloaded in 2010. I exposed this and gave the sources from gay news magazines praising them before their arrest. This saves you going to gay rights websites and seeing all the men wearing g-strings on the ads - instead you can just take it for gospel from Murdoch's newscorp. Under Australian immigration law "character concerns" are applied to both the visa sponsor and the visa recipient. So unless immigration thinks child porn is a sign of good character (well they employ leader of the OTO child rape cult
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b4d0d5c2ddd09ad6dbc0c0c6ddd8d8f4d6dbc6d0d1c69ad3dbc29ad5c1" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
              [email protected]

             ) Ali Choundrhy should be deported - but he's not. You can check the immigration law for yourself.

             You want to schedule a visit to talk about the baby sex porn he was caught with. I don't want to reveal my sources in US Law Enforcement that talked about that lying son of a bitch that only got free because he tried to blame another gay flatmate then bolted when the FBI does what the FBI does - investigate.

             If you demand i can do a find and replace on the world "baby" to "child" if it makes you feel better, but that will be detracting from the truth of the story. I did actually read that in some court documents I'm trying to dig up again too. Give me your answer within 12 hours, or after that extend the deletion counter by 24 hours.

             please remove the 24h warning. Anyone can see they are an item. The two youtube video links show videos taken down by Ali Choundry with them standing together saying WE ARE A GAY COUPLE - Give us money to sue the government for a partner visa whilst the visa sponsor (Matthew Hynd) is on the run for infant sex porn. He Fled The USA the day after the FBI took his laptops to become a top gay marriage activist in Australia.  I guess he thought he could get away with directing infant sex scenes if you read the prosecutors brief and nobody would want to deport him for the sake of gay pride - like how they let this other gay activist off connected to QLD AIDS Council as well:

             The judge ruled the child under 16 wanted the gay dads sex and had the gay dads sex crush so it's all was the child's fault. You can't make this s*@#$ up. Here is the gay lobby praising those boy rapists before they got arrested say yay they got their son - how dare you christians complain about them again - what could go wrong!

              wow proving a pattern of behavior and multiple gays linked to QLD's AIDS council peak gay charity arrested for raping kids is mass downvoted.... Exposing a pedophile ring - multiple pedophiles arrested by police with something in common - gets downvotes here. interesting intresting.

             Also more coming soon on how the Gay Police say it's a hate crime to investigate this pedophiles close links to raising funds for gay marriage. I thought the gay lobby would want to distance themselves from these infant sex lovers not prosecute people for asking them to apologize for gladly keeping hold of infant sex lover raised gay marriage equality cash.

            wow first vote is a downvote. Someone likes LGBTI activists raping kids - or at least the supression of the truth about them doing it and being praised by the highest LGBTI policitans in australia that refuse to say sorry for praising baby rapists and call the police on you when confronted with the facts.
           </p>
           <p>
            What Lee Rhiannon was thinking when she called the cops on me for asking her to apologize for giving a platform to baby rapists like ABC journalists had to apologize in the past:
I DID NOTHING WRONG PRAISING BABY RAPISTS. BABY RAPISTS ARE LGBTI. HOW DARE YOU COMPLAIN. THE COPS WILL GET YOU NOW FOR NOT ACCEPTING LGBTI IS PEDO AND PEDO IS LGBT AND THEY MUST BE RESPECTED AND THEIR MUTUAL CAUSE CHAMPIONED.

            Remember leftist ABC journalists say
Homosexuals can be pedophiles too and they are evil in the above article. Why don't you get that censored for hate speech too!

              Well I've only just read this topic, haven't downvoted anyone, but I can say that I'm tempted to, just based on your strawmanning and generalization. The sentiment here is great, the digging and articles are well worth praise and recognition, thank you! But you've made 8 out of 10 posts here yourself, and the biggest message I get is: "
              <em>
               any/all LGBT activists are raping babies, therefore anyone downvoting me is praising baby rapists.
              </em>
              "
             </p>
             <p>
              Like, Jesus man, wait more than 5 hours before accusing everyone of censoring you.
