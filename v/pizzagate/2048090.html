<p>A vulnerable drug-addicted teenage girl is kept for hours in a dingy hotel room being forced to have sex with a series of strangers who learned about her services by searching on the internet.</p>
<p>Her compensation at the end of the ordeal might be some heroin and a little bit of money.</p>
<p>It is a scene many local residents would associate with far-off foreign countries where corrupt law enforcement systems turn a blind eye toward women being kidnapped, smuggled across borders, and held hostage. But that type of exploitation is actually taking place in communities all throughout Pennsylvania, including the Johnstown region.</p>
<p>In an attempt to draw attention to the issue, the Cambria County Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) held the Modern Day Slavery: Human Trafficking in Our Neighborhoods conference for social workers, law enforcement officers and others on Monday at Saint Francis University.</p>
<p>“I think that\'s one of the hardest things that we face, the uphill battle of people thinking trafficking is international, and it\'s people being kidnapped, and put into servitude,” SART coordinator Erika Brosig said. “When, in reality, these are people that might be our next-door neighbors or kids down the street who are being exploited.”</p>
<p><strong>Brosig said the local sex trafficking business is linked to the ongoing opioid epidemic.</strong></p>
<p>“We know that we have a huge opioid epidemic here,” Brosig said. “That really comes essentially with an increase in human trafficking. Whenever you think about the drug trade, dealers can make so much money on heroin, but when they sell that heroin that heroin is gone. The difference with humans is that they don\'t go away. You can use that person over, and over, and over, and over again. And they\'re continuously making money. The amount of money that people can make is gigantic, and they realize that.”</p>
<p>The conference included keynote addresses and workshops.</p>
<p>Marlene Carson shared her own story of surviving domestic minor sex trafficking. She was taken at age 15 and forced into prostitution before eventually getting free. “It was because of people like this that are in your county that were compassionate enough, that cared enough, that were able to ask the right questions because of education awareness that I am here today and able to talk to other people about it,” said Carson, founder of The Switch, a national anti-trafficking network.</p>

            The hub and "Root" of the real Agenda, trafficking, corruption, enslavement, and the opioid epidemic is in Racine, Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            They created fake organizations called the Racine Coalition Against Human Trafficking and The Fight to End Exploitation. These groups are directly connected to those who are involved, and are connected to the Clintons, McCain, THORN and Ashton Kutcher, corrupt churches, and a long line of others in the chain. They use they mafia and gangs as part of the network, with added protection in Sanctuary Cities like Racine, Milwaukee and Chicago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is the model and "Root" of the real Agenda and the real Truth. This is why Paul Ryan, the Emanuels, Peter Thiel, and others involved are so powerful. It is connected to the global secret societies including Pilgrims Society, Committee of 300, and Council of 13 that are moving quickly to implement Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast through programs such as Sustainability and Community Policing.

             Lived there for a bit. Some really strange people and a few good ones. Met one who was in a union for my trade with brand new everything and had not worked for over a year. My contractor took a huge chunk of the Obama money passed out for free rent and rebuilding. He took right off to the Burbs or Chicago to his dealer and paid his employees in coke. What kind of plan gives free money to people already getting a check from the government to pay their rent more money for free rent? Slumlords were all for it, and voted blue down the line. Needless to say, the millions ran out quick. I always felt that the problem people were Chicago descendants, but then again I am not from there, so I will take your word for it.
