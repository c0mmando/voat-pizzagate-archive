            I wonder if this arrest has anything to do with Youtube's threat to ban Infowars. They claim it is because of calling the CNN town hall event as being staged because one student who was selected for the event came forward and said that CNN wanted him to follow the script they wrote for him. This was on other channels too so I suspect there are other reasons YT wants to ban Infowars.

             Yes most definitly part of it, but they want to ban them because they are not hiding the truth and too many people are watching them.  We 'knew/heard' it was going to happen but you really dont think they would be so brazen to do it!  But they are all in freak out panic mode and the power is scary.  They have already banned great peoples youtube.  WHAT CAN BE DONE??? This is now going into bazzaro land!

            Mainstream media? They are all part of it! Who will cover it? Megyn who pleased her donors by giving that creep of the century a free pass?! Jacke Tapper, whose wife has hailed CPP as her favorite night-out dining place? Anderson Cooper, who is a caricature of a MK Ultra victim. Wolf Blitzer? Conservatives are also controlled. Laura Ingraham shamelessly had that king of crisis actor Hogg guy! Are you kidding me?!

            If Alex truly put his money that confirms my theory that Alex was always on board but he received a huge threat from that Psycho JA and was forced to 'grovel' in Podesta's words.

            Because you don't live in Utah?  And these arrests took place in a small town in Utah.

            Sting operations happen all over the place.  Why would 7 arrests in a town of 3,000 in Utah be all over the MSM?
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy is just begging for publicity for his activities.   This story doesn't equalify for the pizzagate board according to rule number one.  Which of these guys was part of the elite?

            Something is fishy about Sawyer imo, he attacked me over PizzaGate on Twitter. After looking into his history he used to work for Hillary Clinton, John McCain &amp; Donald Rumsfeld?
           </p>
           <p>
            He reeks of Infowars controlled opposition.

            Former Navy SEAL Craig Sawyer says that over 3,000 pedophiles belonging to an elite satanic pedophile ring have been arrested, amid a total blackout by the mainstream media.

             I think it could be, because at the beginning of the video Owen says 6 pedophile arrests and Craig corrects him saying 7 arrests.  :)  Thanks for the extra links.

            I don't know. I have a very good friend whose young daughter is currently in the clutches of his sex kitten escort mother and her family that pimped her out when she was young.  The mother comes from a generational ritual abuse family. FACT. When he exposed her as a prostitute and let the children services know (this escort also has a very long rap sheet) my friend was consequently attacked and falsely imprisoned with NO BAIL SET! I made a big deal about it and Jim and Angie helped me expose his false imprisonment which led to him, after over 50 days, being released. My friend has tried repeatedly with Lawyer but is still ignored!!!! I mean come on Craig, he is an actual little girl currently being abused! This is happening in Atlanta and the escort is, of course, connected to the very powerful and richest men there. My buddy was threatened by one of them, a uber rich scumbag who is (surprise surprise) very connected to the Clintons
