            When I was a child I was taken from my parents by CPS and put in the system. I stayed in dozens of foster-homes. Those where cops were the family of the foster parents were the worse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Case in point at one home in Pasadena on day one at the new home the COP son of the foster-mother took me in a room put a gun in my mouth and said "If you ever touch my mother or tell anybody outside of this house what we do here we will kill you"
           </p>
           <p>
            Needless to say that night I saw the girls 12-14 being raped. Everyone slept in a shared bunk  room, girls and boys.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later I was sent to San Fernando same deal but different foster father was a cop, and he used to loan me out for 'stayover' at his COP buddy's houses, I was about 12 at that time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The COPS deep into this shit folks, I don't buy the theory of good cop.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ONLY thing all cops have in common is they keep their mouth shut and wait for the pension check.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            In summary cop's like little boy's, cop's like to sodomize and little boys can't get pregnant.

             This entire fuckin mess has me contemplating being a foster parent.  Seriously.  The government oversight and creeping is what has been stopping me. Thanks for sharing and I am sorry that you had to endure that.

              Do U have children? If you do I would not get involved. Once you take children in then the State has the power over your children as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Smart people keep all GOV at their door, once you become a foster-parent they can come at any time and inspect, not unlike how they can visit welfare mothers or people on probation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Oddly, the social workers work 8-5, and all molestation I saw occurred at night, ...
             </p>
             <p>
              I highly advise "GOOD PEOPLE" not work with the GOV; A common is most of the children in the system have been raped, and if you have children of your own, they will be raped by these foster-children because its how it all works, if your raped, you generally most of the time become a rapist.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stay away from all GOV with a ten foot pole, unless your a fucking idiot.

              In retrospect I considered it  a good education, I always ran away ended up finally after dozens' of foster homes living out with a good family until I was free at 18 to escape the matrix "Minor in Custody of the State"
             </p>
             <p>
              Make no mistake people CPS ( social services ) created in 1950's was all designed from day-one to steal children.
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              The kids I saw go through the system I would say 98% ended up dead by mid 20's. Drugs, Prostitution, Prison.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Buddhism we say that you know a nation by the way it cares for its 'stray animals', well in the USA/UK you can say we know the depth of depravity of a nation by the way it rapes, kills, prostitutes, bleeds, and eats its children.
             </p>
             <p>
              The USA/UK are just large satanic cults.

            I got fam in the cops, even high placed judges ...
           </p>

            Truth be told, unless somebody is prosecuting (highest level)...nothing will ever happen
           </p>
           <p>
            thousands of cases get thrown out because the rich/powerful will back each other up before letting one of them fall....

            That is why monsters like savile die before any dirt came to light and rarely will they go to jail
