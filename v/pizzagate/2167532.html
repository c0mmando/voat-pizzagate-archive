            NO, just no. Initial reports said 10 more guns were found in his hotel room and an incredible number of rounds of ammunition. Now they're saying 24 guns. His home contained an entire arsenal with a huge amount of weapons and firepower. Note his brother said, "He only had a few guns" as he had a hunting &amp; fishing license from AK.

            OK.  Their father was never around? Why? He was on the FBI's Most Wanted List as a bank robber, con man, thief. He escaped jail and ran a bingo parlor in OR. Why was he deleted from the FBI's List? He was eventually caught.

            Gunman months earlier on vid arguing with police at an Antifa protest in Reno, NV.

           <p>
            Ballistic experts have listened to the police scanner during the entire event, and watched several videos of those who were recording the country music concert. Conclusion is that 1 gunman could not have possibly fired so many bullets that quickly. Also they did not all come from the same location. If it were only 1 shooter, he'd have had to kill someone ever 1 1/2 seconds. So far there are 59 deaths and about 500 wounded.

            1  Exactly HOW did the shooter get 2 dozen guns and many rounds of ammunition through the metal detectors and "Eye in the Sky" casino security who sees the color of underwear of each woman in their hotel?

            I could go on and on about the countless discrepancies in the "official story."
