<p>Going back to the online business information for school trustee Paul John Evans, I\'ve made a few more connections. I\'ll give one example in this post:</p>
<p>So we have 6 pages of companies listed here; some defunct, others he has resigned from, still others where he is still a director.

<p>Grade was born into a Jewish show business family originally called Winogradsky; his father was the theatrical agent Leslie Grade and his uncles were the impresarios Lew Grade[4] and Bernard Delfont.  </p>
<p>...Grade left Channel 4 in 1997 to head First Leisure Corporation, He departed two years later, following a substantial internal re-structuring, to return to the media industry as chairman of the new Pinewood and Shepperton Film Studios Company. </p>
<p>Grade was on the board of the poorly received Millennium Dome project, and has served as chairman of Octopus Publishing, the Camelot Group, and Hemscott (a position that he intends to relinquish). </p>
<p>He had ambitions to become Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors in 2001, but was beaten to the post by Gavyn Davies. Following Davies\' resignation in the aftermath of the Hutton Inquiry report, it was announced on 2 April 2004 that Grade had been appointed BBC Chairman; <strong>his only demand [on returning to the BBC] was that he would not have to give up his job as a director of Charlton Athletic F.C.</strong> He took up his post on 17 May. </p>

<p>and of course he was questioned about Jimmy Savile : <a href="https://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=222773&amp;page=19">https://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=222773&amp;page=19</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was unsettling to watch former the BBC Director General, Michael Grade, and the music journalist, David Hepworth, discussing &quot;groupie culture&quot; on Channel 4 News last night. The pair seemed to conclude that the environment in which Jimmy Savile is alleged to have sexually abused a string of teenage girls was ultimately par for the course in the 1960s and 70s.
With the detachment of a historian pondering the mores of the ancient Greeks, Hepworth opined: &quot;It wasn\'t seen as being as sinister as it is seen as being nowadays. You\'d have huge rock names who had girlfriends who were 16, 17, or even younger and nobody would write about it. Nobody would particularly bother about it.&quot; Apparently abuse and exploitation were accepted side-effects of pop music in those halcyon days or, as Hepworth put it, &quot;just part of the showbiz mix&quot;.
Grade recounted the tale of his father, Leslie, booking a British tour for Jerry Lee Lewis in the late Fifties. The gigs were cancelled because the rocker had brought his 13-year-old bride along. As he shared the anecdote, Grade chuckled.</p>

<p>So, getting back to Sabine McNeill, this is how she is being portrayed in the British mainstream press: 
<em>\'UK\'s worst troll\' claimed London school was centre of baby-eating satanic cult</em> - <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/10/evil-troll-claimed-london-school-centre-satanic-cult-jailed/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/10/evil-troll-claimed-london-school-centre-satanic-cult-jailed/</a></p>
<p>No mention of her professional background as a mathematician at CERN or her appeal to the EU in 2014 to look into the rampant systemic paedophilia in the UK :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/_j7u0ktVib0">Sabine K McNeill fighting UK child kidnap in EU Parliament (Stop 007)</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the spokeswoman at the EU Parliament acknowledged that they are aware of the paedophilia problem in the UK. Maybe it was McNeill\'s threat to go to the United Nations which finally sealed her fate.  The Establishment has closed ranks and another whistleblower has been silenced.  Business goes on as usual.</p>',

           Note that the spokeswoman at the EU Parliament acknowledged that they are aware of the paedophilia problem in the UK. Maybe it was McNeill's threat to go to the United Nations which finally sealed her fate.  The Establishment has closed ranks and another whistleblower has been silenced.  Business goes on as usual.

              Yes. But it is muddying the waters to speak of Muslim perps as Satanists when they aren't.

               western girls and women deserve worse than contempt, they're taking more dick than ever while having fewer western babies than ever, which was the entire justification for mass immigration (officially; obviously the real reason was replacing whites as openly admitted by the Immigration Minister in charge, the Jew Barbara Roche)

              I think the guy who did the video is Muslim, and he is deflecting from Muslim crimes by saying all the child rape gang perps might be not Muslim at all.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think there might be an overlapping between the child rape gangs and UK establishment / the alleged Hampstead cult, but in the way that the Satanists use some Muslim perps for transporting children.
             </p>
             <p>
              And clearly the British government has endorsed Muslim immigration, and has been turning a blind eye on the activities of radical Muslims, thus facilitating Islamization.

             Hey MolochHunter, any updates on those "imminent pizzagate arrests"? :)) I can't wait to see "Podesta scurrying into those tunnels", for "famous suicides" and for "Clinton and cronies" to be arrested for being part of an elite satanic child raping/sacrificing ring operating in places like CPP. Any updates on that? :)))

                  I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to deflect from the ludicrous pizzagate conspiracy theory plot, all the ludicrous lies, half truths, speculation and things taken completely out of context that you call evidence for it, and claim that pizzagate is just about the idea of elites being involved in the abuse of children. That's fucking dishonest and disgusting.

                  Are you saying that pizzagaters are still using the same retarded straw man, moving the goal posts and other logical fallacies that they used back when I use to troll them? That's what it looks like.
