<p>LARRY CELONA?  Apparently Larry posted this article about a pop-up morgue being built in New York bcoz coronavirus : <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/makeshift-morgue-for-coronavirus-victims-set-up-outside-nyc-hospital/">https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/makeshift-morgue-for-coronavirus-victims-set-up-outside-nyc-hospital/</a></p>
<p>We know Celona well around here.  He\'s the guy that broke the Jeffrey Epstein \'committed suicide\' story.  He\'s the guy who posted about Ghislaine Maxwell sitting outside a burger joint, remember that?  He\'s the journalist\'s name in Kubrik\'s Eyes Wide Shut.  He\'s the guy who writes about the NY cops \'suicides\'.</p>
<p>Here are some voat posts:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3398243">Larry Celona, the NY Post reporter who broke the Epstein Suicide story is connected to the film Eyes Wide Shut. Deep state?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/theawakening/3398997">&quot;SPOOPY! Who is Larry Celona??? Larry Celona is the NY Post reporter who had the only post mortem photos of Epstein</a></p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/theawakening/3396542">#EpsteinMurder: By Larry Celona (The ROYAL LANCER) of Rupert Murdoch\'s New York Post</a></p>
<p>Royal Lancer?</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3713701">Tom Hanks was known as Lance CORONA in the 2011 film \'Larry CROWNE\' - a film full of symbolism</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Okay.   Larry Celona also did this article: <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/18/coronavirus-in-ny-film-unit-fills-in-at-nypd-precinct-after-31-cops-call-out-sick/">Coronavirus in NY: Film unit fills in at NYPD precinct after 31 cops call out sick</a></p>
<p>Did you know that the NYPD had a film unit?  And now they are being deployed to do the work of cops on the beat?</p>
<p>Here  are some of their cop cars <a href="http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/ny/nypd/nypd215.html">http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/ny/nypd/nypd215.html</a></p>
<p>The other article by the NY Post which stuck out to me was this article about a NY nurse committing suicide bcoz coronavirus: Italian nurse with coronavirus kills herself over fear of infecting others - <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/italian-nurse-with-coronavirus-kills-herself-amid-fears-of-infecting-others/">https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/italian-nurse-with-coronavirus-kills-herself-amid-fears-of-infecting-others/</a></p>
<p>We have the same story in the UK which came out on the same day, 25th March : <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8150349/Female-nurse-20s-kills-Kings-College-Hospital-London-amid-coronavirus-crisis.html">Intensive care nurse in her 20s \'kills herself\' at King\'s College Hospital in London where eight coronavirus patients have died</a></p>
<p>We also have a huge hospital with 2 morgues currently being built in London, called NHS Nightingale :<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8150745/MoD-NHS-start-work-transforming-Londons-ExCel-Centre-5-000-bed-hospital.html">Revealed: Floorplan for the Excel Centre 4,000 bed Nightingale hospital as London prepares for coronavirus \'tsunami\' and nearby City Airport closes to civilian flights to allow military planes in and out</a></p>

Willem is a member of the Kolff family, an old Dutch patrician family. ..During World War II, he was in Kampen, where he was active in the resistance against the German occupation. Simultaneously, Kolff developed the first functioning artificial kidney.[4] He treated his first patient in 1943, and in 1945 he was able to save a patient's life with hemodialysis treatment. In 1946 he obtained a PhD degree summa cum laude at University of Groningen on the subject. It marks the start of a treatment that has saved the lives of millions of acute or chronic renal failure patients ever since.

              In 1950, Kolff left the Netherlands to seek opportunities in the US. At the Cleveland Clinic, he was involved in the development of heart-lung machines to maintain heart and pulmonary function during cardiac surgery. He also improved on his dialysis machine.

Olson Co. in Boston Massachusetts, and later the Travenol Twin-Coil Artificial Kidney. He became head of the University of Utah's Division of Artificial Organs and Institute for Biomedical Engineering in 1967, where he was involved in the development of the artificial heart, the first of which was implanted in 1982 in patient Barney Clark, who survived for four months, with the heart still functioning at the time of Clark's death.

             Praising the work of Nightingale Hammerson at the welfare charity's biennial dinner on Tuesday, Labour business spokesman Lord Mendelsohn said being among the 500 guests at London's Guildhall meant more to him than his work in the House of Lords.

             Lord Mendelsohn, a former adviser to Tony Blair, said: "There may be wisdom in politics, but there's a lot more in this room. It's the wisdom of people who know what they've got to do to care for the next generation and meet their responsibilities.

              In the company of chief executive Leon Smith and chairman Harvey Rosenblatt, the prince toured the new unit's sensory gardens, admiring reminiscence items such as a red phone box and a Morris Minor car. He also saw the "memory box" outside each resident's room, containing family photographs and other personal items.
