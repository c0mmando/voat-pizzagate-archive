<p>I have created a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3ET4QbWByA">short video</a></strong> on my <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfFC_f69BnlrFSmOxLEPEA">channel</a></strong> summarizing this information and <strong>showing the screenshots I took from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr">archive.org</a></strong> that support my claim.</p>
<h1 id="md-claim">Claim</h1>
<p>Today, I can confirm that <strong>information about William Barr\'s employment with the CIA was mysteriously scrubbed</strong> from his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr">Wikipedia page</a> <strong>a day or two after Epstein\'s apparent suicide</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="md-proof">Proof</h1>
<p>Until as recently as <em>August 11th at 5:20 am</em>, the following information <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190811052007/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr">appeared on the Wikipedia page</a> of Attorney General William Barr:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 1973 to 1977, Barr was employed by the CIA, initially for a short period as a China analyst, then in the legislative affairs section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As recently as <em>August 13th at 2:14 am</em>, <strong>this information had been removed</strong> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813021456/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr">his Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<h1 id="md-barr-and-george-hw-bush">Barr and George HW Bush</h1>
<p>I was able to find <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-oral-histories/william-p-barr-oral-history-assistant-attorney-general">this fascinating interview from April 2001</a> with William Barr where he talks about how he first came to know Bush:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember the first time I actually dealt with him. It was legislation proposed by Michael Harrington, a very left-wing representative, and Bella Abzug, that would require notifying all the people whose mail had been reviewed by the CIA under a program called HT/Lingual. He had to go up and testify against the legislation. I had written testimony, and I went up and sat in the seat that’s behind the witness. Someone asked him a question, and he leaned back and said, &quot;How the hell do I answer this one?&quot;  I whispered the answer in his ear, and he gave it, and I thought, Who is this guy? He listens to legal advice when it’s given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of being a first hand source of the information that was scrubbed from Wikipedia, Barr shares a number of very interesting anecdotes about his service for the Bush Administration during this interview.</p>
<p>So, Barr served in the CIA under George HW Bush.  George HW Bush goes on to become the 41st President and selects 41 year-old William Barr to become the Attorney General.  And with a former CIA Director as president and a CIA lawyer as Attorney General, the CIA survives the epic fallout from a myriad of agency scandals that were coming to light in the early 90s, such as BCCI, Iran-Contra, and Franklin.  And then all of a sudden it\'s 1993 and the Clinton\'s take over.   
</p>
<p>I know this is stuff we already know, but I think its worth mentioning as we continue to try to assess how much hope we can rightfully place in Barr.</p>
<h1 id="md-questions">Questions</h1>
<p>Was this simply someone from Wikipedia?  Was this someone from Barr\'s team?  Was it someone else?  What was the CIA trying to accomplish with China from 1973-1977?  Was that all that Barr was doing for the CIA?  Is Barr to be trusted?Are Epstein and Maxwell former CIA?  
</p>
<p>If they are CIA, then were things orchestrated so that Barr would become the Attorney General now, thus making it easier for them to expose (sacrifice) two of their own, or, is this organic and just a bit of divine irony, thus placing Barr in a position where doing the right thing will require him to go against the agency?  What is our confidence level in Barr\'s ability to do the right thing and help expose the darker, more covert aspects of international intelligence?</p>',

            <p>
             While attending graduate school and law school, Barr worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1971 to 1977.[11] He was first hired as a summer intern for two years. During his law school years he was an analyst in the Intelligence Directorate division from 1973 to 1975, and then transitioning to an assistant in the Office of Legislative Counsel and "agency liaison" to Congress from 1975-1977.[11][12][13][14]

            So there you go, OP. Mention of Barr's work with the CIA is now well sourced and back on the record. Although there's no mention of anything regarding China, I'm sure this could be added at a later stage if a definitive source is found.

            Barr's father was OSS, the predecessor to CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Barr's father wrote:
           </p>
           <p>
            Space Relations
           </p>
           <p>
            A Slightly Gothic Interplanetary Tale
           </p>
           <p>
            by Donald Barr
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would a head master write a book about sex trafficking in outer space.
           </p>
           <p>
            I woke up about the Bush's after George W Bush sent Bill Clinton and his father on a goodwill tour after the Indonesia earthquake. The Bush's are the ones that rehabilitated the Clinton name. This was no accident. I believe the book "Compromise - Clinton, Bush, and CIA" by Terry Reed that told us Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton, at the time governor  of Arkansas, were sending drugs through Mena airport in Arkansas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bush Sr.'s dad was Prescott Bush, helped the Nazis in WWII and profited off the war. and helped start Planned Parenthood.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe Bush may have had a hand in JFK's murder. He was in the CIA at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe Barr is compromised. I hope not, but he is friends with Mueller for many years He may have played up to Trump to get the AG position.

            Michael Harrington...
           </p>
           <p>
            Was an American democratic socialist, writer, author of The Other America, political activist, political theorist, professor of political science, radio commentator and founding member of the Democratic Socialists of America.
           </p>
           <p>
            Harrington believed that if socialists were ever going to leave their mark on the country, it would have to be done through the Democratic Party.
           </p>
           <p>
            Harrington was the best-known socialist in the United States during his lifetime.

            It's standard procedure when an AG comes into a position that some information is removed.  It assists with him not being a target on national security levels. How effective it is, is questionable seeing how what goes on the web is always found somewhere. .After he leaves they'll put it up again.

            Actually, the information is technically not "scrubbed" -- at least not from the internet abroad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's go over this.

            As you can see, yes, the line referring to Barr's work at the CIA has been removed from the wiki entry's text. HOWEVER...
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look at this current snapshot of the entry, under the
            <strong>
             external links
            </strong>
            section, you will see a link to the justice.gov (DOJ) site's "Meet The Attorney General" page:

           <p>
            This page is updated with details on the incumbent Attorney General, here's a link to the current snapshot which
            <em>
             does
            </em>
            mention Barr's work with the CIA:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             William P. Barr was born on May 23, 1950 in New York City. Mr. Barr received his A.B. in government from Columbia University in 1971 and his M.A. in government and Chinese studies in 1973. From 1973 to 1977, he served in the Central Intelligence Agency before receiving his J.D. with highest honors from George Washington University Law School in 1977.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            While it is not as specific as the line removed from the wiki entry, the fact that he was with the CIA is not technically "scrubbed", it was just not sufficiently sourced. Previously, the only source for it was "Graham 1992, page 52" (still in use on that entry), with no indication/link as to what book/publication "Graham 1992" actually refers to.
           </p>

            After a bit of digging around, I was able to find
            <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/barr-william-pelham">
             Barr's personal bio on the DOJ site
            </a>
            , which also mentions his CIA work but has been edited on February 28th, 2019, to omit the specific mention of him working with them
            <em>
             as an analyst and assistant legislative counsel
            </em>
            . However, this mention is still accessible via web.archive.org in all snapshots preceding February 28th, 2019 (archived via archive.fo for posterity):

           <p>
            I'm sure if you can find a definitive, linked source for "China analyst" it could be added back to the wikipedia page without a problem. In any case, you can still edit the page to mention that he "worked for the CIA between 1973 and 1977 as an analyst and assistant legislative counsel", using the following web.archive.org link -- again though, a more specific, non-ambiguous source would be needed for the "China" part:

            The shit will really hit the fan once the public will find out that Epstein ran the child trafficking ring not only for the Mossad - but also for the CIA, and that the two agencies were cooperating.

             Is there any difference between CIA and the Mossad?
            </p>
            <p>
             Both being arms of MI5?
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clowns were running drugs, we know this is a fact
            </p>
            <p>
             With more money trafficking kids, wouldn't they up their game to that?
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been doing research on HW
            </p>
            <p>
             What him and his clowns have done since the Reagan days is absolutely horrible
            </p>
            <p>
             And it all started with his Fathers ties to the OSS
            </p>
            <p>
             Columbia, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras,Nicaragua, Venezuela, Brazil etc
            </p>
            <p>
             It's the Clowns that went in and destabled so it could be raped of anything worth money
            </p>
            <p>
             Then Georgie started the same in the Middle East
            </p>
            <p>
             Iraq, Libya
            </p>
            <p>
             They tried to get Iran a few times but failed
            </p>
            <p>
             And when they tried to go in Syria, Putin entered the fray
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe the CIA, and I hate to use the word, is the root of everything
            </p>

              They are different departments of the same corporation. They used Mossad to take down the building on 9/11 because they were foreigners and would have no problem mass murdering Americans. I think thy should have used the CIA because they have proven they have no problem doing anything. They traffic children, nuff said.

             You mean the guy whose friend and mentor Roy Cohn ran a child rape blackmail operation for the CIA, and who was friends with another child rapist and trafficker - well, I guess that's rather unlikely.

            "Operating under the direction of President Nixon, Dr. Henry Kissinger became the first high ranking American representative to visit the People’s Republic of China during his secret visit to Beijing in July 1971. It was during this visit and an additional trip in October 1971 that many meaningful breakthroughs occurred, allowing for a more normal Sino-U.S. relationship. Following Nixon’s February 1972 trip to China, decades of hostility between two historical rivals began to move towards cooperation and a more peaceful international order.""

            It's easy to answer how much we can trust Barr: not at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The federal prosecutors in Florida denied justice to the victims - only a couple of days before Barr recused himself from the old Florida case.
           </p>
           <p>
            A judge has ruled that the plea deal negotioated with Acosta at the time was illegal, the victims want to reopen the case -
            <strong>
             but the federal prosecutors refused.
            </strong>
            Go figure.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, like Dershowitz and Acosta, he worked for Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the law firm that represented Epstein during the Florida trial.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is as much swamp creature as it can get. Do you think Bush would have appointed an AG who is not compromised, and not getting blackmailed - nope.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             And then he wasn't able to protect the country's most high profile prisoner - he needs to resign. ASAP. #BarrCoverup
