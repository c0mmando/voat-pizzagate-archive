Leave one on the counter of a public bathroom in a bus station.
Find the most popular coffee shop in the largest city you live near, and leave one hiding under a newspaper.
Mail some to small town news papers and not big ones.
Mail a few to small town police stations. <br />
Throw a bunch of them in mail boxes, without postage and put return addresses of the mayor\'s office, or a law firm.
Leave a few of them in busy parking lots, big box stores, public transit, put a few in public lockers, leave one on a park bench, a Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>

If the data is out in the wild, being circulated and reported by random sources, it will become public.  It will become knowledge of those who find it.  They might be able to silence a newspaper, but if John Q. Public finds it, reports it to the police and tells all his friends and family about it, it will become public.

            I think it's a good idea, except that any  private citizen that finds something like this would have a world of trouble to deal with, and it would very likely ruin their lives. Even a peeon public official could endanger themselves for reporting it. So
            <em>
             my
            </em>
            humble suggestion is to not leave these lying around. Send them to police and small-time media, like you say. As many as you can, dozens, hundreds. If one Barney Fife finds a usb drive full of incriminating evidence, he'd pass it along and wind up suicided. But if there are tons of them out there, it'd become public eventually.
