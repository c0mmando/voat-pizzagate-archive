            I think it's a good idea, except that any  private citizen that finds something like this would have a world of trouble to deal with, and it would very likely ruin their lives. Even a peeon public official could endanger themselves for reporting it. So
            <em>
             my
            </em>
            humble suggestion is to not leave these lying around. Send them to police and small-time media, like you say. As many as you can, dozens, hundreds. If one Barney Fife finds a usb drive full of incriminating evidence, he'd pass it along and wind up suicided. But if there are tons of them out there, it'd become public eventually.
