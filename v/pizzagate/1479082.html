            The goat got my attention right away but I was like, screw it, we have no other choice. I think the majority of us came over after reddit shut down pizzagate so if they're compiling a list we're probably already on it. The NSA can spy on you through your smart phones and smart TVs already. We live in a police state whether we want to believe it or not.

              honestly i'm no css guy.  there's a css sub here that some subs were using so when i became mod of
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/til">
               v/til
              </a>
              well fuck you know, why fuck with a good thing... so i just updated it a little.
             </p>
             <p>
              clintongate's just that css pasta'd but with a couple color changes and i redid the little goat.  whatever 'i' you're seeing, i'm assuming it's wherever "clintongate" is written, whatever font it is set at is probably the issue.  i didn't choose the font, it was that way when i got til, and i've never changed it.
             </p>
             <p>
              i could change it if it really fucking bothers you, no worries....

              and what do you mean, eyeball...?... going to check sub with "all css off" turned off...

               Honestly man - I'm just picking up on shit. You haven't done anything wrong, and I'm just talking out loud.

              <p>
               It makes sense now that you mention it about the TIL. It looks like an eyeball that dots the letter 'i' - but it doesn't matter.
