            The possible steps to follow to gain surety rights and therefore the ability to instruct your debtor ie .the US corporation ( they will be bliged to )
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             as a group ( for this pizzagate investigation purposes ) or individuallly ( to discharge / setoff bills coming in ur name )
 instruct the US treasury to accept credit owed to ur NAME to reduce teh US debt ..in return to discharge /setoff  ur bills 
the NAME could be the court u will set up .
            </li>
            <li>
             also instruct protection for members of this court ..( they must oblige as they are now ur debtors ..)
            </li>
            <li>
             IF u set it up for your individual name first ..internal courts cannot hound you ..as ay charge will be setoff by the US treasury 
this might take time to understand as people are not taught how the credit system is set up ..but the steps are easy to follow as this is what we do anyway at our local bank ...we lend credit to teh internal banking system , away from the US treasury ...in effect we are increasing the debt inside the system to get benefits ( ie get teh bank to discharge our bills) instead of decreasing debt at the US treasury.
I have contacted the US treasury and they have confirmed to me by email that anyone on this planet can reduce the US debt
to understand this one has to realise that all countires are former colonies chartered by ROME ..

            That looks like a valid post.
I post things that are commentary (not research or new fact) to \v\pizzagate2
           </p>
           <p>
            Then in other comments you can include your url to pizzagate2

            I don't know why yr comment got deleted.

             .i just need someone to discuss the issue i raised ..it seems to me that all the research will end up as one of the many conspiract fact websites out there collecting dust. This method can be tried in a week ..if it doesnt work try another version of it ..we do have remedy and it is to do with reducing the debt and placing our names outside and above the US jurisdiction ..until then we are inside their jurisdiction voluntarily. thanks for the reply

            You comment was not removed. I see it. you may not be seeing all the comments on your device, due to the way VOAT does not always automatically load all the comments.  Sometime you have to click to load more comments.

             : We are getting off track. Read the FBI_anon threads, we are overlooking a lot
            </p>
            <p>
             i posted a comment in there and i cant find it. anyway this one was posted here ..and seems okay..i just need someone to discuss the issue i raised ..it seems to me that all the research will end up as one of the many conspiract fact websites out there collecting dust. This method can be tried in a week ..if it doesnt work try another version of it ..we do have remedy and it is to do with reducing the debt and placing our names outside and above the US jurisdiction ..until then we are inside their jurisdiction voluntarily.
thanks for the reply

            A lot of talk and no action ..makes pizzagate a merry go round ..
Please discuss..especially anyone with a law background ..
if people cant even address the legal issue .and investigate the set up courts of universal jurisdiction .then you'll just be fodder for the alphabet agencies who at the top are run by sociopaths , hiding behind immunity of office

              ur name being financial property can be traded like commodity on the stock market or used as security for loans ..ie US government bonds ...
like when u buy  a car (moveable property) on loan ..the finance company keeps the title of your car as security for the loan...in case you dont pay ..they having the title can grab it and sell it to recover the loan ...
...if u pay down the loan ..u will get the title of the car ..
this is what happens with ur name ...till u reduce the debt the US has title over it ..and if u dont follow certain rules ( statutues ) they can grab the asset via the court ...if u reduce the US debt they can have no claim ...if u choose not to reduce the debt and pay only the sservice charge ie your income tax ...then they can have u under their jurisdiction ..whilst making money off of you via the banking system which requires US bonds to play on the stock market ..
this is why IRS says tax is voluntary ??...
the steps i propose sets you outside and above the jurisdiction of the US ...
email the US treasury and confirm that u (or a group eg: pizzagate) now choose to reduce the debt in return for them honoring the bond they have to ur maintenence and care ( ie ur name ) ..

               <p>
                just like you have a multitude of ways we increase debt at the banks , paypal , cooperative societies ( all govt chartered credit factories ..that use the credit owed to the NAME that u as trustee lend to ( in effect you lend to the ROMAN pirate corporation called countries) to create more credit 
( google : or utube : Bank of england banks create credit
               </p>
               <p>
                there is a multitude of ways one can reduce debt
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  set up a local accoutn at your local district treasury with instructions from you to reduce the US debt
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  or
    State treasury canset one up for you
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  or 
    email the US treasury ..set one account up there online ..they have a debt reduction department
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 BUT
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                make sre you get confirmation from them that all charges in the NAME ..past , present and future will be setoff / discharged. 
its basically the opposite of how you use ur bank account..
the effect is that the entity that you set the bank account with will be forced to buy back US treasury bills with the credit u surrender to them ..
               </p>
               <p>
                the US debt subsidises all world debt and commodity trading ...which creates more debt ...
this is why the US has army bases all across the planet ...the US has worldwide jusrisdiction to police its debtors
               </p>
               <p>
                you must get confirmation from them that the surrender of credit is for the sole purpose of the US discharging /settign off all charges in your NAME ..from a trustee you become a beneficiary with surety rights over the US corporation.
you are then in a position to charge corrupt politicians., alphabet agenices ..if they do not respond you charge them a hefty amount ...towards the debt reduction at the US treasury .
               </p>
               <p>
                till then they do not have oversight outside their immunity status ...likeclinton , fbi directors etc ..
at the moment we've basically given a cheque book to them , voted them in to have the authorised signatory status every 4 years ..they create a debt , the interest of which we are askked to pay ...which is income tax ...we also collectively insure the debt via social security ...
               </p>
               <p>
                this is why they say income tax is voluntary ( it deos nt feel like it but that because they do not give us the other choice ..which is reducing the debt...we can volunteer to reduce debt or just pay the interest on the credit of the nation that is parted to the NAME as salary or income...
if you obtain a credit card bill every month 
u can volunteer to pay the minimum( keep the debt rolling over to the next month)  or volunteer to pay the full amount ( destroy the debt ) 
we have the same choice with the national credit card bill
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/R7mRSI8yWwg">
                 income tax is voluntary
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                when u decide not to pay taxes , you will be charged and thrown into prisons ..but what the judege will not tell you that judge agree that people go into prison as a voluntary choice to discharge the charge placed on the NAME ...it functions as a customs bonded warehouse ..( its a resting place ie A_RREST ..for the charged human battery cell ..when u leave a battery at rest for a long time it gets discharged ..does it not ..so prisons are warehouses offered to the client to discharge the charge over time ..)
               </p>
               <p>
                but basically u wont have to worry about going to prison , but only be judged by ur peers ...who will be the ones who will reduce the US debt ...
as surety rights will give you the right to charge anyone within the US corproation because everyone is an employee of the US corporation , including Obama and HIllary
               </p>
               <p>
                u will be able to set up courts with unversal jurisdiction and charge anyone across the planet for violating human rights ..this is why the UN has set up a guide called chartere of human rights ...but it can only be operated and activated by people with surety rights over the world payment system ( the US and its debt system) setting up courts with universal jurisdiction

              i'll try my best to make it simple ..it might take a few attempts...

             <ol>
              <li>
               your name on the birth certificate is a financial asset the minute ur parents apply for a live berth certifcate

             <p>
              links :
             </p>
             <p>
              google : what is namium
             </p>
             <p>
              even better it is a bond to the holder of the birth certificate and the name
             </p>
             <p>
              did you understand the concept that ur name is financial asset created by an application of live berth..?
             </p>
             <p>
              google :very soon every american will ..
             </p>
             <p>
              there is more on this topic to understand ..it goes into roman law and baptism ..have u attended a baptism ceremony ?
but at a basic level one must understand that the name is a piece of property ..like ur house , car , pencil etc
             </p>
             <p>
              Did u understand the concept of the name ?
