            The two girls (Holly and Jessica) bodies were found near  "RAF" Lakenheath yet the American AF personnel located there were not investigated. The day before the police arrested two people (prior to finding any bodies) and in "closed court" (remember Tommy Robinson?) decided to send the two away to a mental hospital and a woman's prison for holding till trial.

            There is a lot that goes on on military bases that doesn't receive full public attention. It's government land. That's why there's so many Superfunds located on military bases. The government doesn't have to obey it's own laws.

            For example, in 1982 the naval commander in charge of the Coos Bay, OR station was one of many outed by a Chicago informer who had been taken in on a national pedophile ring prosecution conducted by the FBI. The commander confessed.
"the FBI and NIS confided that the perpetrator had likely been “turned” by the Soviet KGB during a previous and unauthorized trip to the Soviet Union after knowledge of his pederasty became known to Soviet agents during a clandestine hotel check of his room and luggage."During the FBI/NIS sting operation, Frawley admitted that his network of pedophiles included senior naval officers, clerics, lawyers, politicians, and judges. Later, the two NIS agents revealed that the Coos Bay scandal “went to the very top” of the Reagan administration. A number of forced retirements of senior naval personnel, including one rear admiral, were announced after Frawley’s arrest. There was also a significant foreign intelligence aspect to the case that involved the Soviet Union."The naval employee used by the FBI to assist in the arrest was years later, Wayne Madsen of WMReports.

            Where is the accused now? Allegedly in North Carolina running a tutoring program, previously had run a day school. Is he on the sex offender list? No. Apparently after 10 years you can petition to get off it, or get pardoned or show that you're no longer a threat to the public.This for someone who was arrested for "accused of promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child and using a child in an obscene sexual performance. Both are felony charges." "All records bearing the NIS criminal investigation case number, 08–18–82N12PD 718XNA, were purged from Navy computer systems on the orders of the CNO and secretary of the Navy." FYI, this guy's father before him was a Marine general.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the government isn't going to protect the public by allowing loopholes that mask where the pedophile is years later, what can the public do?

             Incredible. thanks FF2! Hiding in plain sight, clues were there all along. All connected to Moors and satanic pedo activity. Yorkshire Ripper worked as a grave digger in the 1960s. Wonder if he helped bury Moors Murders victims?

            These connections are mind-boggling.  I'd read about Myra and Ian - sick stuff - but had no idea the time and place could be tied to Saville.  Bravo.  Still need to read your links.

             read some of the excellent comments here, EVB. Also linked to Yorkshire Ripper. We are now trying to find links to David Matthews, father in law of

           <p>
            David is originally from
            <strong>
             Rotherham, YORKSHIRE
            </strong>

            PLEASE help if you can find ties between David and Jimmy Saville/Moors Murderers, BBC Pedo elites. David's third son died mysterious on Mount Everest aged 22, in 1999.

           <p>
            If you read elsewhere in this submission,* David Matthews* we believe, may be heir apparent to Jimmy Saville and had an agenda/lifestyle trajectory similar to

             JEFFREY EPSTEIN
            </strong>

            If anyone can directly tie him to Saville and/or Moors Murderers, then bingo. We have opened the floodgates.

            my heart breaks for these children and those that truly cared for them
           </p>
           <p>
            If you think this has stopped because Saville is dead, try again
           </p>
           <p>
            who replaced him?  This is still going on , and not just in England
           </p>
           <p>
            This makes me so ill,  anyone who does this to a child deserves death, the cycle must be broken

              There is no way Matthews and Savile never met.  Birds of a Feather, Peas in a Pod, whatever.  Matthews was born in Rochdale in Yorkshire.  The cops covered for both of them I am sure.

              Your welcome, allways browsing - but attention on other things at the moment and have been for a while.
Like Qanon etc.

              It gets hard to voice your opinions on here sometimes.
The funny thing is......
In the uk news saddleworth was mentioned, but nothing else. It's (you) that raised my attention to this and oh yes, I've been spreading the word.
             </p>
             <p>
              Keep up the fight.....
Peace and respect to you.

              Thanks for doing that, MV. Appreciate it. Flair removed. Don't forget that we regularly get new folks in here who don't know how to access our hoard of evidence, so crosslinking threads is a real plus. Also, the shills will claim I am modding unfairly if I nail them for not linking support and then don't do the same to everyone.

            If this service wasn’t available, half the evidence that led to mass convictions would never have come to light. The girls didn’t trust police or social services to help them and I quickly found out why they felt this way, as no one wanted to listen to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            They did not want to listen because they were joining in or protecting the perverted rapists.  I hope this opens the way to more discussions within families and waking up to the fact that children are not little adults.  They need guidance and love from their parents.  I doubt anyone could finish this story with dry eyes.  It is a Heart Tugger.

            The covering up continues.  Pipa's father-in-law Dave Matthews was arrested for raping the same girl twice.  I said girl, yes a minor.  At his St.  Bart's Resort once and once in France.  When reading this story before, it mentioned she was his niece.  After reading 5 different articles, I no longer can find that information.  Another cover up?  Matthews age 74, awas born in Rotherham in Yorkshire County, the stomping grounds of Savile.  He was the son of a Yorkshire miner.

              According to Europe 1 radio, which first reported the charges, Matthews, now 74, was accused by a niece shortly before she legally became an adult.

              This was hard to find, though I found it when reported.  Thanks for the archive.

             SO TRUE. I don't believe he made his billions from a shitty hotel. Whats the bet he's another Epstein, with his Eden Roc Island? Let tug a bit more on the head of this snake and see what comes unraveling quick...I noticed not a peep about Matthews in recent weeks. Now he's connected to Royals so wonder if same viper attorneys are protecting both him and Prince Andy.....??

              Totally agree and yes how did he make all that money to buy Eden Roc?  He was the son of a miner and started out racing cars and BOOM  all of a sudden he is hobnobbing with the Royals.  Nope, he was and is caught up in some really nasty business.

               damn (lol, I know you hate cursing Carm) this is unbelievable what's unfolding. HELLO! talk about mirroring Epstein. Eps goes from a humble ass teacher making zip to owning a $$$$$ townhouse on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and hobnobbing with LW + co.... I'm researching the
               <em>
                Matthews
               </em>
               . They ALSO had a son die age 21 in suspicious circumstances....did you know that? Another son is on a upper class reality show, but is totally dumb yet manages a hedge fund? The brother married to Princess Pippa ALSO is loaded and manages several $$$$ portfolios. Something is sh*tty + stinky and going to get to bottom of it!

                Yes, I know about the son that died.  I have always felt he was sacrificed.  Wonder what he will have to give up to get off?  Perhaps what he provides for them is his payment.  Yes this REEKS.

                 Here's one of Lolfieldandlove's videos about the (alleged) Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe and a possible Savile connection.  While there was evidence linking Sutcliffe to some of the murders, he could not have committed all of them since he was pulled in for questioning no fewer than 11 times by police and each time they had to let him go because his blood type and teeth pattern did not match those of the Ripper.  That means either Sutcliffe had an accomplice or he was a copycat and the real Ripper was never caught.

                 And concerning blackmail, it seems that control of politicians through blackmail is so ubiquitous that it has become something of a joke.  Take a look at this clip from the early 80s BBC satirical comedy series
                 <em>
                  Yes Minister
                 </em>
                 .  Two senior civil servants are discussing over lunch who they think should become the next Prime Minister of the UK.  Pay attention specifically to 1.40 - 1.55:

                  Hiding in plain sight. Jokes crackd, champagnes glasses clinked, wink wink, nudge. I'm buggering a few kiddies tonight; only qualifications needed on MI5 file for candidacy of prime minister. Sheeple laugh away because, well, typical British humor.
Did you know Peter Sutcliff worked as a grave digger in early 60s? Think he helped Moors Murderers/Saville bury a few bodies?

                   I remember watching a video by an Irish guy called Thomas Sheridan talking about Savile probably being the real Yorkshire Ripper.  He recalled watching Louis Theroux's documentary where he hung out with Savile for a while.  Sheridan said that when he saw the part where Savile showed how he kept his mother's clothes and had them regularly cleaned, he remarked to a friend who was watching the show with him, half jokingly, "He's a sex killer."  Knowing what we know now about Savile, I think it's fair to say Sheridan was probably spot on!  I also recall reading that the warder who was present during Savile's first visit to Sutcliffe in Broadmoor said that from the way the spoke to each other, it was apparent that they already knew each other.

                       No problemo!  I couldn't find it on Youtube either and it has no doubt been scrubbed from the BBC's OD service!  Here's an interesting video showing how well known Savile's disgusting proclivities were in the ranks of the BBC:

            Interesting, that there now seems to be a connection between
            <strong>
             Savile
            </strong>
            and the Moors Muderers. 
I read a few years ago, that Savile was "fond" of them. And that they maybe knew each other.  And there was even the suspicion, that he might have tried to look like Myra with his blonde haircut. But mostly these stories just were rumours. 
I don't know if we can trust the Dailystar, but I think these connections have to be examined! Now even with satanic background!

           <p>
            Furthermore, there is an interesting connection of Myra Hindley to
            <strong>
             Lord Longford
            </strong>
            , who is also known as "Lord Porn" because of his "Longford porn commitee", which also needs to be examined (allegedly Jimmy Savile and Cliff Richard were part of it - but that's just a rumour- no proof till now). Longford also wrote a book "Pornography - the Longford Report"...

            When will the repercussions of Jimmy Saville stop?  Never?  It seems there is no end to his and his cohorts crimes.  They keep unearthing more heinous stories.  These you expect to be made up and written for gory mystery stories, but no, they are real.  Now as usual, they have burned all to the ground.  But their ghosts will reek havoc.  I believe in Victim Revenge.  Whether they are Dead or Alive.

             Carm, insane. All the famous patsies from over the years. Fred and Rosemary West too. I wonder if there is a Saville connection to Wests. Will research.

                I think there is a huge can of worms just waiting to be opened.  Written on the can is MATTHEWS.   It was his niece is what it originally said.  Now it is no where to be found.  Was she sold off to him by her parents and she hated it and reported it or did he just decide for himself.  He looks a lot like Epstein too.  I tried to connect him to Savile since they are both from Yorkshire.  No luck yet. He must have been terribly abused if he turned pedo.  Just like the rest.

             Guys, forget what was spun in the past. Read read read what you can and remember the key pizzagate phrase is always
             <em>
              "knowing what we NOW know"
             </em>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             None of us knew the truth about these scandals in the past. How could we? We just believed everything spoonfed to us.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aren't you now looking at every past scandal with renewed eyes? It becomes so obvious when you investigate: the photoshopped pics, the clear lies, cover ups...the 'suspiciously quick finding of patsies + closing of cases'....
            </p>
            <p>
             All missing kids from over the years are either victims of monster (regular or elite) pedo satanists or were snatched to order for their organs.  I think you'll all eventually arrive at that conclusion too

              As usual you make so much sense.  We are looking at everything with New Vision.  It seemed so clear before or it was befuddled but we never learned the truth really until now things are opening up.  We also can connect other crimes to new findings. Yes,  What a revelation.

             Wow, well this puts a whole new spin on the moors murders.  This whole time I just thought they were deranged, sick monsters and had no clue witchcraft was involved.  I’m betting most of the British public don’t know that either.

              Horrible shit happens all the time everywhere.  People only care if it's in their backyard.  The UK has to wake itself up UK style.

              So frustrating that we good woke folk here can see with clarity, yet the sheeple masses are zombies, still. As years go by, younger kids will have no clue who these notorious criminals were and soon, all these past heinous scandals will fade into nothing with no culpability or convictions. That's what the likes of the Moors arsonists are hoping, at least.

              I gotta see at least ONE huge name pedo elite sh*tstain get the nutz kicked out of him in prison before I die :( :( Obviously preferably more than one, but expectations are low :( :(

               It's coming MV.  Today was a turning point.  SCOTUS upheld travel ban (yesterday); the Justice who let Obamacare through is retiring with another one very close behind; and public unions just had their balls chopped off.  All in all a good day.

               Go check the latest Q.  That should give you hope.  America is waking up.  It's all about to come to light.  OG/PG was in the IG report.  Q confirmed the "club".

                  the daily mail comments section is always a great indicator. Just reading the comments on this Moors fire, 3/4s of folk asking if it was started deliberately to hide Keith Bennets grave!

                   They are finally feeling nervy enough to come out with what they know.  I think some have been holding it in, waiting for a really HOT article.  This is it.  It will set the pace I hope.

                    wonder if in early 60s in that part of UK whether medical experiments or such-like were going full throttle. Maybe testing new vaccines, experiments on kids or similar. Maybe that's why Saddleworth ablaze because didn't want Keith Bennet's grave found and subsequent autopsy performed.

                     LOOK at the picture of the crash.  Shocking and Amazing.    It's a miracle Matthews survived they all said.

                   One last thought and I've shot my wad...all of "this" (SCOTUS, unions, winning, etc.) HAS to happen before the gory stuff comes out.  The masses will realize as the darker and darker details emerge, that their worst fears are true.  Pizzagate is real.

                    yes agreed. Was said before on Voat that sheeple need to be drip fed slowly otherwise shock of pedo Satanists and such-like would cause mass hysteria and panic. Of course WE won't go into hysterics, having dealt with this now for years. :( :(

             Please research more and share/spread. You will see how obvious it all is. Looking at picture of Moor, it looks terrifying. So many ghosts must roam there. A thing of true nightmares.

             Much written about over the years. How could you NOT think they were connected? They all knew each other from England North in the early 60s. Saville also friends with Yorkshire Ripper. Saville connected to probably every infamous Brit pedo in last 50years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Been discussed on Voat in past, if you google South Yorkshire police cover ups +Voat.

             Now you have a chance to spread and share online. You really think its no coincidence the Moors went up in flames?

                I’m kind of shocked to be honest.  I knew my country was bad but I didn’t know it could possibly be this bad, that all the serial child rapists and killers are protected by the royal family, by Scotland Yard, the media.   I am disgusted and I don’t want to live in this world anymore!!!
               </p>
               <p>
                But THANK YOU for bringing this all to light.  I saw on the news about the moors and figured there would be something on pizzagate.  I just don’t know anymore.  I will try to do some research this weekend.

                 PB the cover ups are as bad as the crimes. Everyone is culpable. It is happening everywhere. Look at the politicians here. Epstein's crowd, so forth.

              No....I didn’t say there was nothing to it.  I just did not know that Savile was connected to the moors murderers.  I’m not surprised though with the connections Savile had.

             I'd not heard a savile connection to them either....though the Moors murders always seemed to have more to them than we were ever told
            </p>
            <p>
             Savile of course was friendly with Peter Sutcliffe after his conviction for the Yorkshire ripper murders...and it's been suggested he might have had a connection to the murders himself
            </p>
            <p>
             Kind of funny that morrissey ...who wrote a song about the Moors murders is now being pilloried as far right for asking questions about muslim child rape gzngs

               He's an interesting character....from Manchester to be exact....he always was popular with leftists (because of his hard core animal rights stance) but throughout his career he has also taken criticism for certain statements that were considered racist or bigoted...but with hindsight maybe were just honest and patriotic

                lol yes have heard of Smiths but I don't know much about him or them. He seems kinda depressed. Not surprising I guess  given his Manchester Yorkshire pedo knowledge :(

              Yeah there was that Lord Longford who got involved with Hindley during the later years of her prison sentence and tried to help her, just imagine, so I’m guessing Lord Longford is a pedo just like the rest of them.

              Yes the Yorkshire ripper.... didn’t Jimmy saville used to visit him at Broadmoor?  Probably the worst mental hospital to date.  Plus there was that red riding series about the West Yorkshire police covering up a pedo ring for decades....there is probably more than meets the eye for sure.
