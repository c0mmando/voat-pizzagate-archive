            One of the main reasons that I believe in this is that I was literally about ten feet from being kidnapped on a military base in the early 80s, during the same time as the "Presidio Affair" (which was rumored to involve other military bases).

            Yes, and it is inherently defiling and wicked. Thats why it needs to be brought out into the open and exposed. I hope that Pizzagate is the final nail in the coffin. If all of this stuff finally does come out it would lead to one of the greatest changes in political history.

             That has not been my experience. I have yet to meet a perp who was not abused. This is also pretty clear in the Hollywood scandals. Charlie Sheen was no doubt abused, and turned abuser. Not all abused turn into pedos, but I'd say that article is not factual. Silent Lambs are the victims of abuse in a religious cult.

            I work as a rehab counsellor helping all types of people recover from injury, abuse and getting them back into work. I think most of us are very resilient people, whatever may has happened to us it does not define our humanity. The best we can do is to help abused people, especially children as the earlier the better. What upsets me is how common sexual abuse is, especially in poor families (which i come from).

             I would tend to summarize it up as an attitude of entitlement that gets passed on.  Doesn't matter rich or poor.  If someone feels they are entitled to something they will go for it and feel no remorse. For example, domestic abusers all feel entitled and they never seem to believe they did anything wrong (at least for very long).

             We may be resilient, but it stays with us each and every day.  It never leaves.  42 years and a certain smell or sound - right back there.  It does not define my entire life, but it is always there lurking.  I don't do crowds or places where I cannot get out of very quickly. (think movie theater) I am self sufficient and watch my child like a hawk.  The only person I allowed to have him alone before he could talk was his godmother.

             The Joe Biden videos are disgusting.  Whoever does not think he is a molester is fooling themselves.  That is what they do.  They make you think you are crazy and could not possibly be what you KNOW it is.  If your child is pulling away from someone and they are pulling them back, even if it is a relative, intervene.  This is your child and you have the right and an obligation to protect them even if you think it is "nothing".

            I was molested for over a year by my special education teacher while in elementary school. It really messed with me.

            I remember after reading and seeing all the things revealed in Pizzagate for the first time, and burst into tears. First time i've cried in awhile. Keep fighting, guys.

            Sorry about your friend, that sounds horrible, and your situation too. I have/am fighting judicial abuse/corruption and even as an adult it is traumatizing.

            I was  stalked  by my friends older brother, but managed to kick him off  before it got nasty and thankfully he never returned.   I was in horror mode from then on.  I wasn't very big and he was.

            As a small kid in a prairie town, I narrowly escaped abduction into a car by an older man and woman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes I wonder what would have happened, and that's what makes it hard for me thinking about kids tonight who weren't as lucky as me.
