            All you new guys and gals, say hello to Amalek. He's our not so friendly and decidedly anti Jewish spammer from Canada. You'll learn to pick him out of the crowd pretty quickly.

            Hi, Amalek! Thought you were taking a vaca?

            So don't Atko and Putt instantly revert back to the last working version of code until they fix the current issue?  They could instantly and effortlessly fix this.
           </p>
           <p>
            They want to scatter all of us to the wind.  Voat is compromised. Atko and Putt don't even run the site anymore.
