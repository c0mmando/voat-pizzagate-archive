<p>With all this, I believe I can establish a timeline for the crimes in question for the sake of an updated working theory.</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series)</p>
<ul>
<li>Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice).</li>
<li>Witness: Clare Torao</li>
</ul>
<p>-2nd Incident:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine, Joseph Sargent, Judith\'s mother (accomplice).</li>
<li>Witness: Lorraine Gary</li>
</ul>
<p>-The Murder (my theory has changed here):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suspects: &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. The strongest lies are based off a truth. The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. Accomplices: LA PD, the media. The circumstances of this death (psychopath killers, murder suicide patsy, cooperative police/media/coroner match a &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; killing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timeline of the murder: The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match &quot;Grand Climax). The killer broke into the house and killed the parents first. The killer then shot Judith in the head. However, I believe this gun shot was NOT an instant kill. Not if the sacrifice was meant to be via fire. The killer needed that head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The killer doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the narrative. This level of sadism in handeling the bodies is the tip off that the killer is some form of psychopath/sociopath. I believe that this was the work of a single person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress  rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the police\'s claim of a possible murder of 7/25-7/26 is a lie, for the smell would have been obvious at this point.</p>

             Suspects: "Jack the Ripper". Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. The strongest lies are based off a truth. The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. Accomplices: LA PD, the media. The circumstances of this death (psychopath killers, murder suicide patsy, cooperative police/media/coroner match a "Jack the Ripper" killing.

             Timeline of the murder: The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match "Grand Climax). The killer broke into the house and killed the parents first. The killer then shot Judith in the head. However, I believe this gun shot was NOT an instant kill. Not if the sacrifice was meant to be via fire. The killer needed that head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The killer doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the narrative. This level of sadism in handeling the bodies is the tip off that the killer is some form of psychopath/sociopath. I believe that this was the work of a single person.

            De Longe is still alive, and so are the Podestas'. There were a lot of people saying that they were planning a fake space invasion to take over. China banned fireworks and are replacing them with lighted drones. Trump just quit part of the UN. Lot's of stuff happenening. Thank's for doing your part.

            FWIW, I strongly suspect the CDAN site has been semi taken over by the same group behind the Qanon people.
The breadth and detail of many of the most horrific events simply far exceeds the capabilities of a single individual, regardless of their connections.
This venue is proving effective in disseminating some of the darkest aspects of Hollywood and is doing so in an exceptionally effective way.
Thanks for your posting and ongoing digging.
