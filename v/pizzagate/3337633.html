<p>So Ehud Barak is seen entering Epstein\'s townhouse in January of 2016 while attempting to hide his identity with a very weird disguise. It would have made me stare harder. But he does enter as do four young women. There goes the claims that he never socialized with the convicted trafficker. </p>

<p>EXCLUSIVE: Married Israeli politician Ehud Barak is seen hiding his face entering Jeffrey Epstein\'s NYC townhouse as bevy of young beauties were also spotted going into mansion - despite his claim he NEVER socialized with the pedophile and his girls</p>
<ul>
<li>In photos obtained by DailyMail.com, Ehud Barak is seen hiding his face as he entered Jeffrey Epstein\'s Manhattan mansion in January 2016</li>
<li>&gt;    The 77-year-old, Israel\'s former prime minister, has long had business ties to Epstein, which current PM Benjamin Netanyahu\'s team is now trying to exploit </li>
<li>&gt;    Barak was wearing a camo-style neck gaiter which he pulled high over his face almost to his glasses and later, he was wearing it as a hat</li>
<li>&gt;    Barak admitted the photos are of him, blaming his bizarre attire on being cold, but claims he has \'never met Epstein in the company of women or young girls\'</li>
<li>&gt;    However, a bevy of young women were also seen going into the multi-millionaire\'s lavish home on the same day that married Barak was snapped </li>
<li>&gt;    Epstein, 66, was arrested last week and charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex</li>

<p>Now the weird thing about this is the timing, because Adam Schiff has tweeted out what would happen if a \'\'Fake\'\' video were to surface and be posted to one of the social media outlets. He\'s concerned it could swing an election. </p>

<p>I am gravely concerned about the threat of deepfakes.</p>

<p>So this is the hundredth time someone in the elite cabal has expressed concern over this \'\'DEEPFAKE\'\' video. And we see proof of how it might swing an election with what is happening with Netanyahu and Barak. </p>
<p>I really think the patriots have the blackmail videos and/or videos from Epstein\'s island. The timing and the mention of \'\'DEEPFAKES\'\' is too coincidental to not be hinting towards that. And, remember, the first mention of a faked video was of HRC. The Russians were supposed to have used a double.</p>',

            My theory is that Epsteins island was the blackmail operation for 9/11 and that Ehud Barak was an integral part of the team that did 9/11. Netanyahu is pissed off about a number of things including about Israel being used in 9/11 and getting nothing out of it - Afghanistan/ Iraq are nowhere near nor any threat to Israel -  and the terrible Iran deal put together by that Deep State faction. The more Netanyahu exposes on Ehud Barak the better!

             Interesting.

             You could well be right. I've always thought it was something that Israel knew about and not what they planned. Why else the "Jew calls" that Al Franken, among others has talked openly about. So to for calls to be made to Jewish people warning them not to go to that building, they had to have known. Now was someone in the US government complicit of ignoring the attack. That's something else we don't know. The theory is that the building did not collapse, but was detonated. In reading about that day, both Trump and Giuliani were furious at Skankles and the Skankles PR machine countered their criticism so do they know what happened and was Skankles a part of it? Could be. But this video ... the very first hint of it existing was an article about a Russian sex tape using a Skankles double. It's why I lean towards it being a sex tape. And there could be multiple incidents of blackmail video. That's something we're leaving out as a possibility, but I really think the one thing that would turn America's stomach is if HRC is in a lurid .... and I mean, LURID as in Epstein ... sex tape.

              It seems like everyone who was anyone knew about it - I don't blame Israel for getting their people out any more that I blame the French for doing the same. Israel and America were just used on 9/11, and the US especially in the ensuing wars.

            Has anyone seen any old photos of Epstein? I couldn't find any old pictures of him or his family? Maybe I don't know where to look? Has anyone else found any?. I was just searching the regular internet.

             Well, Naomi is a dirty girl and up to her eyeballs in pizzagate. There was a conversation on Voat and someone suggested it was Naomi Campbell that Sly Stallone was using a golf hole. Think the article only mentioned someone used to lay down in the nude and let him putt between her legs in some PedoWood producer's office. Can't remember the guy's name.

             You think the videos have to do with 9/11? Showing what? It can't be the planes. It would have to be individuals involved in something. If it were Skankles, for instance, what would it be?
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it would be more likely for a very sleazy video to be out there. I'm sure she was with her alleged rapist husband for a reason. I'm also sure she was working with Laura Silsby for a reason.

               It's what I've always thought.

               It's the only thing that's so repulsive as to turn everyone's stomach. Even if she were in an orgy w/multiple adults, it wouldn't have the same impact as being with a child.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the other thing is, now that we're discussing this, is that QAnon said this awhile back. So does Assange have this video? Was that one of the reasons they didn't just kill him? If that is part of the encryption key he tweeted? I think that even if HRC weren't ever running for political office again, that a video of this nature would ruin her legacy and tarnish the DNC forever.

                It's very possible Assange has the video; he was quite adamant about Hillary not being president, and they went to extreme lengths to silence him. I think it more likely, though, based on what Q has said about phones being taken into Epstein's sex dungeon and about Admiral Rogers approaching Trump, that the NSA got this video off of someone's phone.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pizzagate researchers uncovered the Chandler Instagram long before Q ever mentioned it (back when we were on Reddit). It's possible that Chandler took the video, and when researchers found her public pics, was interviewed by the FBI and forced to turn over the video. This could have been part of what forced Comey to go through the motions of reopening the Clinton email investigation in October 2016.
               </p>
               <p>
                I wish someone would create a master timeline document about what happened and what was discovered, when. It would be quite a bit more clear.
