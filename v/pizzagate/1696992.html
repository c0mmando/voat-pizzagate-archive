             It's 100% not his kids according to this article:
             <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2014/08/11/the-making-and-unmaking-of-a-power-marriage/">
              https://www.washingtonian.com/2014/08/11/the-making-and-unmaking-of-a-power-marriage/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "After 4½ years of litigation, Tony agreed to pay $265,000 to settle all financial obligations to his kids,
             <strong>
              who were adopted by his ex-wife’s new husband
             </strong>
             . (“He’s a great guy; I have nothing against him,” says one of those children, now 31.)"
            </p>
            <p>
             So in retrospect, for Tony to be casually mentioning "the kids" he's assuming JP knows exactly which kids he's talking about. Which kids?  According to the genealogy report Tony and John don't have any siblings, so which friend or family member is he with when referring to the kids?  Or, as we suspect, John knows what he means by "the kids" without having to give any further details.

            It sounds like Tony is somewhere else though. "Back on the 12th" and he's going to Somalia soon, according to his e-mails. It's possible he was in another country at this time, no?
           </p>
           <p>
            The series of e-mails is strange overall.  It sounds like they're trying to get together when Tony gets back from his trip. Initially Mary says she isn't available on the 12th (Sunday) and JP's hand surgery is on the 13th, so both dates aren't good.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony says he's back on the 12th but "going to Somalia", then suggest MLK day (Jan 20th).  JP doesn't seem to really read what he's saying and says "That might be work".
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony then reminds JP "Mary not free" that day. Then asks "Would love to get a pizza for an hour? Or come over"
           </p>
           <p>
            JP responds: "Are you free sunday mid-afternoon?"  Sunday is the 12th, when Mary said she isn't free.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony:  "Yes. Only wanna see you and Mike Berman"
           </p>
           <p>
            ** This is where the convo turned odd for me. Originally they're all trying to get together for dinner. Then it turns into Tony, John, and Mike Berman getting together on Sunday the 12th for "pizza for an hour". Obviously Mary can't make it on the 12th so why specify he only wants to see JP and Mike?  There's no concern of rescheduling to include Mary at some point either, why was she excluded in subsequent e-mails?
           </p>
           <p>
            JP next day: "How is the trip?"
           </p>
           <p>
            TP: "Very good. I'm seated with the kids so little wired"
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds like Tony was travelling. Any way to figure out where he was Jan 7th 2014?

              If Tony assumes John knows which kids Tony is travelling with, and knowing what we know about the brothers Grimm, is it fair to speculate that he's shepparding some poor orphans from some poverty stricken country to the land of milk and honey? No doubt it was a business trip - perhaps his tax records would show how many tickets were bought for that trip, or a passenger list would indicate who he was travelling with. It seems unlikely that he would be so brazen, but knowing how untouchable these goons think they are, and if they were A class cargo, I wouldn't put it past him.
