            David Seaman has said he wanted to back off from pgate and focus on other things since November I think.  He's a journalist who wants to do a wide variety of information,  but the nature of the pgate crap has caused him to go back to it, and he does have a sincere caring about the problem.
            <br/>
            I'm not sure why you think there must be some other reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ben Swan backing off of pg doesn't seem like reason for concern either.   He wasn't really involved too much, back came out with a goo review, now he's on to a media company isn't he?  He'll have to investigate other things.
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed  random posters also claim that  Alex Jones has backed off,  and although I don't really watch his stuff (not a fan)  I've caught a few of his vids the last few days and although Jones isn't using the word pizzagate, he's def talking about  pedophilia, as are other reporters on his show.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you doing okay  Guac?     I know this is more personal for you, as it is for me.
           </p>
           <p>
            A professional who continues to mention pgate is  Opperman Report.  I don't think he's a journalist, but he has  forensic computer experience  (if I remember correctly.)     I'm wondering if Opperman has done the forensics on that Koons Instagram  pic of what's allegedly  his naked wife.  From the beginning I wanted a computer forensic to compare if that was his wife or a kid, because I wasn't the only one who thought it was a kid.  It was on show at the Whitney museum.
           </p>
           <p>
            on a different topic:  has anyone dug on Koons.  (not sure if I'm spelling that properly and I'm too lazy to look it up.)

             Its not so much I think as I ponder. His financial livelyhood has very much depended upon pizzagate these last few months. I just am suspicious that there isnt a secret court  command we are unaware of. I owe my last few weeks of groceries to david seaman (cant explain but its true). I support the dude. Hope he comes out on the cool side of things in the end.
