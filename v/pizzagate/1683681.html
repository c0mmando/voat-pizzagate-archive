It is very long and vast in scope but worth a read if you can manage it. The anonymous author goes into detail about the CP industry including production, distribution, technical details, and pedophiles in general and draws many distinctions that I hadn\'t considered before. Some of the article relates directly to pizzagate by detailing how webs of CP operate. Also how child protection agencies have been less than helpful and even hurtful on a fundamental level.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This article contains views which push towards normalizing CP and pedophilia that I do not espouse, but after reading will allow that there is more of a grey area then I previously believed. </p>
<p>TLDR- Takeaways</p>
<p>1) Technically speaking (THORN I\'m looking at you) There is no way in hell you can stop, filter or catch people who want to get CP and are the least bit savvy. Any policy or organization that claims to do this is either naive or has ulterior motives for increased monitoring powers. This is under the &quot;<strong>The reality of filtering and censorship</strong>&quot; section. Again, this was written in 2009 and shows how the distribution infrastructure of CP (like hard drugs) vastly out-classes law enforcement. An example is given of &quot;renting&quot; a virtual machine on a server in Russia on which the virtual workstation contains CP, no files transferred no blacklist triggered, like a remote desktop through a VPN connection and a legit charge on your credit card (like Amazon Web Services).</p>
<p>2) The terms Pedophile and CP have been weaponized politically to the point where it cannot be discussed, or researched. This inhibits rational debate in the same way that calling someone a nazi sympathizer does. If you are found guilty of it, it destroys your whole life and can be a convenient way of getting rid of someone. There are in fact legitimate grey areas such as age of consent differing across countries (age of consent in Spain was 13 when this was written and is now 16), kids sexting being charged with CP. In the US an 18 year old boyfriend of a 16 year old girl can go to jail as a child abuser and rapist. This point is important because these <strong>are not</strong> the people/organizations we are targeting with pizzagate.</p>
<p>3) The author differentiates (I don\'t espouse this view) that there is acceptable CP (pictures the kids willingly make and are having a good time) and bad CP which is violent or abusive. According to the author, the &quot;good kind&quot; is like erotic child modelling where the kids do it willingly and get paid. The author claims that the wicked stuff most often gets produced by parents wanting to one up each other on sharing forums and are usually produced without intent for profit but rather status or recognition. These images are vacuumed up and distributed on commercial sites. I don\'t agree on the good/bad but I would submit that the kids in those two situations would have vastly different scale of psychological damage. I\'m glad that my mind was opened to an honest exploration of the idea.</p>
<p>4) According to an informal survey the author did, about 1% of the population is truly pedophile (attracted to young children, repulsed by adults). Another 29% or so of men are claimed to occasionally have fantasies about younger kids but never do anything about it and are &quot;normal&quot; by all social standards. This point (if true) helps me understand how so many of our politicians can be involved. I could believe now that through the intent to blackmail, many powerful men could be enticed to hook up with 16+ year old girls who are sexually advanced. That sucks, but it isn\'t what pizzagate is really all about either. Still these politicians would technically be pedophiles (end of discussion). Apparently that has a name ephebophile. But not a discussed topic.</p>
<p>The pedo-satanists are the ones we are/should be targeting, it\'s worthwhile to know how everything plays together, who is truly guilty and who have been swept up by association. As these arrests and raids which continue to happen (and should) pay attention to which groups are being brought down. The pedophiles are not power hungry, the Luciferians are, and they are using pedophilia to drive their agenda.</p>
<p>If this thread stays up, It would be best broken into separate discussions because the article is so wide reaching.</p>',

            The satanic/Luciferian component need not be present to inflict serious, lifelong damage on the victim.

            I agree. Before this whole pizzagate thing broke, all I knew was pedophiles bad. But that was before I learned about SRA NWO, organ harvesting, kidnapping and trafficking and all this other shit which is several orders of magnitude worse than American Beauty style statutory rape. Regardless of why/how so many politicians became involved be it belief in ritual magick on the bad end of the spectrum, or momentary lapse in judgement under the influence of alcohol with underage prostitutes on the... less guilty end. It is very clear that we do have a swamp. Mass take-down of the legitimate legislative branch would be a good start. Then term limits. Then mass take-down of the deep-state government. Then some sort of transparency or oversight for f*#(&amp; sake.

            One aspect in particular that has irked me for a long time is that drawn pictures of underage characters are considered "child porn". This includes depictions of known fictional characters like The Simpsons. That's scary for a number of reasons.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              In the case of known fictional characters, there is a public consensus that these characters are NOT REAL. THEY DO NOT EXIST. Therefore, how can depictions of them be depictions of actual children? By the same token, a scene of Homer Simpson choking Bart is a picture of actual child abuse, which is preposterous.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The suggestion that fictional characters hold the same rights to protection as actual human beings diminishes the impact of actual child pornography on actual victims. It makes a mockery of true abuse of children.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Making fiction illegal is ultimately an assault on freedom of speech and freedom of expression. This debate is centuries old, but those of us living in America are living in a time of fanatical liberalism with regards to speech. We should be unafraid to stand up for the speech of artists and writers, no matter how repugnant we might find their ideas. Those who fear the chilling power of hate speech laws, speech codes, religious objections to speech, and other assaults on free speech need to understand that this falls under the same purview.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Pedophilia is a fact and will always be a fact in human beings. That truth is unpleasant but must be addressed. Another fact is that there are pedophiles who live in our society who do not harm children, nor do they engage in activities that cause harm to children, such as consuming child pornography. These people should be seen as responsible citizens holding their urges in check in order to respect the rights of others. Fictional representations may aid them in maintaining this control, and if it involves no child abuse in production, it seems to me that this should be a public obligation to protect such material. I think everyone here would long for the day when fake child pornography is more available than the real thing.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            More than anything, the fact that government spends any time going after fictional erotica in a time when child pornography is available in enormous volume around the globe is an insult to everyone who pays into that government. Prosecute actual crimes that harm, not thoughtcrimes that offend.

            Did the rticle not mention predatory homosexuals or were you too cowardly to? Sexually mature and willing girls shouldn't even be on oUr radar. Look at hollywood, diddling boys is the greater crime because they grow up to offend as well

             It didn't. I take it the author of the article was involved with producing the "non-abusive" type of CP using child models in lingerie and provocative poses often with their parents permi$$ion. The angle from the author that was new to me was his familiarity of how the CP distribution networks operate. It didn't cover rape, molestation or any other form of abuse that happens privately. Only the stuff that is turned into CP for distribution. In the case of sexually mature and willing, I still view it as harmful because of my moral views and I also think that there are certain things you just shouldn't introduce to kids (like drugs). I don't think it's okay to give a kid drugs because they are willing. I don't think it's okay to shoot child porn because the kids are willing. I believe pornography in general distorts sexuality and causes interpersonal relationship problems at a minimum. If you're talking about a 17 year old girl who want's to pose naked for money, I still object because of moral reasons (unless she is a nude model for an art class... see grey area).

            Very interesting! I am currently trying to find definitions on pedophilia, pedophobia and adultism......the term Paraphilia seems to be an umbrella term for...engaging in sexual behaviour that is atypical and extreme.....is this how psychology is being weaponised? To break these "groups" into compartmentalised behaviour?

            "The pedophiles are not power hungry, the Luciferians are, and they are using pedophilia to drive their agenda."  I keep hearing estimates that 30% of the U.S. Government is involved in some form of human trafficking and pedophilia.  What that means is that the U.S. Government is 20% Luciferian with about 10% being Renfields to the Luciferian's Dracula.  Yet the 10% may be helpful in catching the 20%.  Yes, that does seem a little "normalizing" but sometimes one has to step away from God to fight evil.
