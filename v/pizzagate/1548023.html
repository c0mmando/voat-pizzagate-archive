            Robert David Steele has exposed some interesting things in the past

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Published on Sep 19, 2014
Robert David Steele - There was no bomb, there were no injuries; Boston bombing was a drill to lock down a major city. Sandy Hook school had been closed for four years, there were no students, no teachers

            He makes some excellent points:

           <blockquote>

             As a CIA spy, I have faked intelligence, lied to government leaders, and managed a modest false flag operation (no one died). This is what CIA does.

            <p>
             The exposure (I use the term advisedly) of John Podesta as a very unethical political operative with very strong possibilities of also being a pedophile, resulted from a single phishing expedition by a single hacker who social engineered Podesta into changing his Google email password through an intermediate site that then was able to steal all of Podesta’s email. This hacker is in jail in the US and it is almost certain that he is collaborating with a US intelligence service, not the Russians.

            I think this is a very very good detailed summary of the issue of Russian hacking our elections, voter suppression, and leaked information,  all of which are different specific  occurrences that need to be parsed. From everything I have read,  from multiple sources from all over the political spectrum, this summary accurately corroborates the facts being reported. FBIAnon  spoke of disgruntled NSA employees leaking information as well as statements coming from the FBI. Steve Pieczenik's claims. You have documentaries being made by those on the progressive left discussing the ways in which the right seeks to suppress African-American voters and eliminate them from the voter rolls. Look up Greg Palast and the film The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.   An attempt to audit Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by Jill Stein, who was not selling out to/paid by Hillary Clinton. That was a grassroots effort  aimed at more transparency, not to help Hillary Clinton, but to expose machine tampering,  registrations being flipped by way of vote by mail, the lack of paper trails etc.  Then you have the D&amp;C insider Seth Rich who most likely is the source for those emails pointing to the rigging of the Democratic primary and stealing it from Bernie Sanders.   Email leaks showing the collusion between Clinton campaign and the media which is no longer trust worthy  Then you have the known spying by every single government and meddling in elections, which is a separate thing. We have emails from Podesta saying he would make someone an example of leaks, even if they didn't have a real person.  Add to that the reporting by George Webb of the decades long plan for regime change and all of the business interests and the FBI headed by Comey, long time Clinton supporter and fixer who is now obfuscating and obstructing the investigation and the release of the emails in question off of Anthony Weiner's computer as well as the 1,100 CF donors-who are they?  Given what we know about CIA methods to control government officials, pedophilia and blackmailing of those involved, being more effective than prostitution and infidelity, so many implicated and the reason being, according to CIA whistleblowers and reporters, that nobody in those powerful positions will get there if they don't have skeletons which can be exposed,  I think we now easily see what has lead to a breakdown in our judicial system, electoral system, i.e. Democracy is a sham.
