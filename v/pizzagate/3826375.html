            I messaged the website creator on twitter and asked him where they get the cards because they didn’t seem to be affiliated with cards against humanity. So I wanted to know if use the cards against humanity cards verbatim or does someone write them or what?
           </p>
           <p>
            He said...
           </p>
           <p>
            “The included packs come from CAH, as well as third-party card makers. We are not affiliated.”
           </p>
           <p>
            So I said...
           </p>
           <p>
            “ Thank you for the response. Who are third party card makers? I’ve played CAH before and know that it is controversial but I’ve never seen anything as disturbing as a card I got the other night when playing with friends on your website. The card actually said “fingering a baby.” I was horrified by this and would like to know who is responsible? Can you please tell me where this card originated? People don’t realize that child sexual abuse is an epidemic. 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys suffer abuse and their trauma is not a laughing matter. Making light of such a horrific thing only serves to normalize it. Can you please tell me where this card came from?”
           </p>
           <p>
            And he said...
           </p>
           <p>
            “ That card comes from Guards Against Insanity. I will say, while I agree that that's obviously a horrific thing, that is kind of the point of the game - it is intentionally awful. If you're playing Cards Against Humanity or any of its offshoots, you should be prepared to see things that are going to disgust you, because that is the whole reason the game exists.”
           </p>
           <p>
            So the card comes from guards against insanity...

            . I noticed they are advertising this for Quarantine stay home activities, including a "family friendly" version, and that they just added a chat feature. If they are pushing pedo shit, we need to capture evidence of it -- ideally, an archive of the page in question showing the evil cards, or at least screencaps. Technically, that's required per Rule 2, but I imagine it could be time consuming to "get" those cards again, so I am going to give this our "Help!" flair. Perhaps some folks could help document the stuff in this game and post archives/screencaps in the Comments. My younger daughter's friends (16-18 year olds) love the original game. I never heard of CP being part of it though.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm curious if the "family friendly" version is really family friendly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once we have have documentation of the bad stuff, we can figure out who to complain to. Some of the parental guidance organizations would probably be a good idea.

            <p>
             I messaged the website creator on twitter and asked him where they get the cards because they didn’t seem to be affiliated with cards against humanity. So I wanted to know if use the cards against humanity cards verbatim or does someone write them or what?
            </p>
            <p>
             He said...
            </p>
            <p>
             “ Jake
            </p>
            <p>
             The included packs come from CAH, as well as third-party card makers. We are not affiliated.”
            </p>
            <p>
             So I said...
            </p>
            <p>
             “ Thank you for the response. Who are third party card makers? I’ve played CAH before and know that it is controversial but I’ve never seen anything as disturbing as a card I got the other night when playing with friends on your website. The card actually said “fingering a baby.” I was horrified by this and would like to know who is responsible? Can you please tell me where this card originated? People don’t realize that child sexual abuse is an epidemic. 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys suffer abuse and their trauma is not a laughing matter. Making light of such a horrific thing only serves to normalize it. Can you please tell me where this card came from?”
            </p>
            <p>
             And he said...
            </p>
            <p>
             “ That card comes from Guards Against Insanity. I will say, while I agree that that's obviously a horrific thing, that is kind of the point of the game - it is intentionally awful. If you're playing Cards Against Humanity or any of its offshoots, you should be prepared to see things that are going to disgust you, because that is the whole reason the game exists.”
            </p>
            <p>
             So the card comes from guards against insanity...

              We don't have screencaps of those pedo cards yet, though, right? Let me know when we do, and I will change this to the "Share!" flair and drop some Tweets about it.

            what did you expect ….   though this site warrants being investigated.....seems like a good way to probe for like minded pedo's along with finding preteens to victimize
