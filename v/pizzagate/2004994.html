            This is a great post. Out if everything FBI anon posted he stated the one person he was most worried about was Muhammad Yunus. In fact he was terrified just mentioning the name. Yunus is involved in many countries with the Clinton Foundation regarding oil plays, minerals plays, children sex trafficking, organ harvesting, etc,
           </p>
           <p>
            Micro finance is a CIA program and is used to entrap poor people into a life of literally slavery. They are offered loans or even cell phones linked to work camps with interest rates at over 1000%. Because they are desperate to feed their families they take it but of course that will never be able to pay back these loans at this interest.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bosses like Yunus or Clinton Foundation employees then demand everything from them and threaten them until they will enter prostitution to pay their debts. This still will not be enough and the bosses will demand they sell their children into sex slavery or be killed. The final step is to sell their organs.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is Mohammad Yunus game. It is also the CIA game. For those unaware Obama's mother was a "microfinance" specialist for the Ford Foundation "CIA Front" in Indonesia &amp; Pakistan as she worked for the CIA. This is deeper than you think.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since we were told Yunus was a key to unmovking all of this let's do it!

             Thank you, Jem777!  I think that must be the reason that people think a ton of stuff about Kaveladze was scrubbed from the web.  It is hard to find much about him prior to the report that he was the 8th person at the meeting.  I think it is because of the Yunus connection and that they don't want people figuring out that it isn't some humanitarian project.  Why they get away with acting like it is charity when you get paid back with interest is beyond me.  It is just normal lending but with people so poor they have no collateral and are easier to take advantage of.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will have to look into Obama's mother being involved in microcredit.  That was something I missed.
