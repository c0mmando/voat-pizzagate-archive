Mayer simultaneously tried to get her mother on the casting couch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
And then it occurred to me that Judy Garland also worked for MGM.  Apparently, Judy did at least 10 films with Arthur Freed as producer from ages 13 to 22.  According to<a href="https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/167269/Dark-side-of-Oz-The-exploitation-of-Judy-Garland"> this article</a> and also<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=90VnX45qv9sC&amp;pg=PT114&amp;lpg=PT114&amp;dq=judy+garland+author+freed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rDJsO1ej7j&amp;sig=eTVmHcS5oZra1AHrtU02zwERPfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZlNLLpfjXAhUk04MKHaBqAXQQ6AEIbDAP#v=onepage&amp;q=judy%20garland%20author%20freed&amp;f=false"> this book</a>, Judy was very troubled.  She was put on barbiturates and tried to commit suicide during this time.<br />
&nbsp;
Heres some notable quotes from the article:
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Paul Donnelly’s remarkable 2007 biography, Garland was a lost child from an early age. When her beloved father Frank Gumm, a flagrant homosexual, died in 1935, the 13-year-old Garland lost her best friend and was left to the mercy of her despicable mother. “My father’s death was the most terrible thing that happened to me in my life,” she repeated over the years. The traumatic period created an unhealthy desire in the girl to seek out older men for love and marriage, many of whom turned out to be homosexual. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She certainly didn’t feel safe in the MGM offices of Louis B Mayer. “In our house the word of Louis B Mayer became the law,” Garland said later. He took to groping her in his offi ce, telling her as he put a hand on her left breast that she “sang from the heart”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At 17, Garland was a mess; her life was totally controlled by Mayer and Ethel. Even her love life, such as it was, was carefully monitored. Having lost her virginity at 15, Garland was in constant need of male  companionship, especially after the death of her father. She had been linked with child stars Freddie Bartholomew, Jackie Cooper and Frankie Darro. Rooney was her best friend but when she began a putative romance with Tyrone Power, Mayer stepped in and scotched it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poor woman was plagued with suicide attempts and copious drugs and drinking until she died of an overdose at age 47.
Makes you wonder how many others they destroyed</p>',

            It has long been a tactic to reveal information about cases and criminals LONG AFTER they have died and the statute of limitations has expired.  It puts distance between current criminals and crimes and promotes a false narrative that MSM and law enforcement are doing something.

             This all didn't start 20 years ago out of no where.  It's been happening in Hollywood since it's inception probably also in Vaudeville long before that. If you don't understand the history then you can't understand the structure of the present.  To understand the structure you have to look at the evidence on who the molesters were and who they were in contact with.  Who they hung out with and who they called their friends becomes a road map to possible organizations.  Like following a lead from abuser to a group of abusers.  I just read that Arthur Freed had a musical production unit called "Freed's Fairies"  dubbed such because everyone in it was gay.  Ok so they were gay...but could they have also been pedophiles?
            </p>
            <p>
             Like Jane Manson and Sammy Davis Junior being drawn into Satanism with Anton LaVey who is a Satanist child molester. ----And then Anton LaVey is good friends with L. Ron Hubbard.  ------L. Ron Hubbard creates Scientology ----------- Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise are known Scientologists.------------Nicole Kidman's father was an accused Lucifarian MK Ultra child rapist.

              Exactly!   Just recently a friend of mine said, that "old Hollywood" was not as awful as "new Hollywood", although we both had read the book "Hollywood Babylon" (by satanist Kenneth Anger) already years ago! 
 It's good to expose also the "old heroes". So we can see, how that system works  -  and always had worked!
             </p>
             <p>
              I also recommend the history around  the book "Peter Pan"...   author James M.Barrie was the "foster father" (some say he was a pedo) to the family Llewelyn-Davies. Barrie was fascinated by Michael, one of the sons of the family, who inspired him to create "Peter Pan". 
Michael grew up... and committed (allegedly) suicide at the age of 21... together with a friend.  Some say, they were gay.
Another friend  was Robert Boothby, who grew up and became the infamous "Lord Boothby" , wo was  friends with Winston Churchill...  and the evil + pervert Kray Twins. It is said he had a relationship with Ronnie Kray.  Ronnie later was in the asylum "Broadmoor"  and became a friend of Jimmy Savile, who visited him regularly...
             </p>
             <p>
              But going back in the past of that family also is interesting. An uncle of the Llewellyn-Davis boys was Georges du Maurier, who was very much into Spiritism. He wrote a novel called "Trilby". It is about a young girl without any talent,  but when she's hypnotized, she suddenly can sing  -  and so she's becoming a star.  The guy, who's always hypnotizing her (and so earning a lot of money), is called "Svengali". It's just his name, but today we still call these people in the background of famous performers "Svengali".
              <br/>
              Well, I thought that is interesting (although a bit off topic here).

               The dividing line in Hollywood was the McCarthy Era/HUAC Hearings where liberals were purged from Hollywood
              </p>
              <p>
               As the right wing took over in Hollywood we have seen the deterioration and destruction and the movement to horror films and more and more steadily to introduce not only the most grotesque scenes of violent, but also what can only be said to be pornography in movies.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can also see this on TV -- and it's purposeful.  Watch Comcast and Verizon who make tens of billions from porn every as they continue to try to push porn into mainstream TV programming.
              </p>
              <p>
               As we see with the rise of the right wing everywhere ... drug trafficking and sex trafficking rise.
              </p>
              <p>
               There's no denying this -- See:  Movie "Everyday" with Live Schrieber and Helen Hunt where this very subject is discussed -- where writers are pushed constantly to write more insane and barbaric violence for films/TV.

                I agree, that contents of  movies and media in genereal changed in the sixties to more violence and porn. But  I do not think that it is a matter of "left or right wing".  We know that "they" are everywhere - the pervs and the pedos. Political parties are just created to confuse and divide us.
               </p>
               <p>
                I can remember, that in the 60s the "sub culture" got more attention and more publicity  - and this also meant:  more violence and porn in media!    I am not a friend of porn and violence - especially not in "normal" entertainment - but I also see, why it changed.  People were fed up with the kitschy and fake world that was shown on tv and in cinemas before, and the lies told by their governments!   The "sub culture" was much more exciting! 
When I was a kid I also loved to read my brother's "Underground-comix" and things like that!  I always was a friend of "sub culture". It was much more interesting than the boring fake ideal world shown in media! (and we know, these "fake worlds" just support the gouvernement by putting the audience to sleep).
               </p>
               <p>
                I read, that in the USA it had to do with the Vietnam war.  In Germany  we had a different history (the children of the nazi generation were protesting), but the result was the same:   Young moviemakers wanted to show more "reality". Yes, it was some "red pilling" involved!   They were more or less "left wingers", and, yes,  they brought   violence and porn in the cinemas.  But in th 80s it changed again, we got movies like "Rambo" , which were aimed more or less at a "right wing" audience.
               </p>
               <p>
                In general, I  do not care much about "Left" and "right" wing anymore.  The Clintons like to present themselves as "liberal" and "progressive" but they are not really "left" - if "left" means, to support the poor and working class. The Bush family is "right" wing, but they are just  globalists. It's all the same. And Jimmy Savile, who looked like a Hippie, was friends with Maggie Thatcher and a lot of pedo-"Lords".
               </p>
               <p>
                But I also think, that maybe the original  "purpose of red pilling"  by some of the sub cultural artists  soon  was turned into "just porn and violence" by the "industry" -  because criticism is dangerous for them, and "sex and violence" is good for controlling the masses.
Maybe the Rap- and Hip-Hop- movement is a good example. I can remember that in the early days of Rap and Hip Hop the lyrics were really political and criticising the status quo and the gouvernment!  But then the industry came and turned it all into dumbass "gangsta rap" with sexist lyrics and satanist symbolism!
                <br/>
                Guess they did the same with other art forms:   Removing   meaning and content and replacing it with sex&amp;crime.

                 Of course it is a matte of the rise of the right wing ...

                <p>
                 You have to familiarize yourself with Elite Patriarchy, which was actually created here Constitutionally by Our Founders in a betrayal of citizens and the revolution.  They were given land grants, and tremendous influence and control over our "people's" government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.  THAT was the first "redistribution" of wealth. Other than the stealing of this land from the native people and genocide against them -- 112 million of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our esteemed Founders also saved and protected the system of slavery for Elite, even down to the "Runaway Slave Act."  That guaranteed the Civil War which further benefitted Elites by splitting the nation into two camps of hatred which continue to echo today.Only males were given the vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                 After the coup on JFK which also took our "people's" government, drugs were used to create a more violent society.  The fake Drug War, finally, to control the public, especially "blacks."
                 <br/>
                 Also to make citizens frightened of other citizens -- especially of youth taking drugs.
Sexual perversion was used, as well -- this was the time of CIA's MKULTRA.
If you think that the CIA is liberal, I'd suggest you do more reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                 CIA was the successor to the OSS/pushed for by the Council on Foreign Relations in both cases.
You think they're liberals?
                </p>
                <p>
                 See the actual programs put in play BEFORE the end of WWII ... 
Operation Mockingbird, Paperclip, Gladio.
We defeated Germany but not fascism.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hitler was recruited by American Elites who along with International Elites funded Hitler and the Nazis
Later, when it became obvious that the war was lost, they brought out the Nazis and the Gold via the Vatican ratlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                 BOTH of our national political parties have long been owned by Elite/wealthy.  Koch Bros./John Birch Society -- do you really think they're liberals?  And other large corporations who controlled the Dem Party via the Democratic Leadership Council which was founded by Southern Dems in order to corrupt the party.
Bill Clinton was specifically recruited by these Elites.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Pornography is organized propaganda against females in order to demean and debase females.
There is nothing real about pornography.  The women who are forced to participate have generally been sexually abused previously and/or threatened.  Portrayals of "sex" now in porn is so violent that the bodies of these women are being destroyed and reports are that they have very brief careers now in porn -- a matter of a few months.  This porn is influence young males who can access it -- 8 to 11 years old - being taught to disrespect females.  Husbands are being found to be so addicted to this internet porn that they are unable to sustain family relationships, unable to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "Pornography consumption -- both violent and non-violent -- is associated with verbal 
and physical sexual aggression."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Elites/patriarchy always fear youth because they are the most likely for revolution.
The rebellion against corporate control and wealthy - against Capitalism and its evils --
and against the Vietnam War began to rise in the 60's.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The fake "Sharon Tate/Charlie Manson" scandal was a CIA/military operation to destroy the 
Youth Revolution/Hippies and it succeeded.  We've had many such "false flag" operations since then.
Mae Brussel is an excellent source of history.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you understand Elite Patriarchy/wealthy you understand that they requite war and chaos in order to
keep the nation divided.  Yes -- war is purposeful.  Capitalism is about moving the wealth and natural resources of nations from the many to the few.  And it has done that successfully all over the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I see you're saying you are Germany or grew up in Germany?  What were the young generation protesting there in the 1960's?  Here, JFK was making clear that the Cold War was fake and was merely a way to enrich Elites and to frighten the public.  "The world is intended to live in FEAR."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Again, AFTER the coup on JFK -- and after the McCarthy Era -- liberals were purged from government. 
That's what it was all about.  Liberals were purged from Hollywood.  And, later Koch Brothers' NRA used the gun issue to remove not only what remained of liberals in Congress, but also moderates from both parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There were occasional liberal films still being made:  "The Russians are Coming!" ... "Dr. Strangelove, or How I learned to Love the Bomb."  And, "On The Beach" about the end days after atomic warfare.
You can still find some liberal films today and they continued to be made.  But at the same time there was a tremendous rise in violence in movies and TV and the beginning of increasing the availability of porn.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Forget labels -- look at what people do.  The Clintons are NOT liberal.  Neither is the Dem Party.
The Bush Family is evil, with their history going back to creation of Hitler/Nazis.
Clinton's and Bush Family are very close -- think back to drug running in Mena, Ark.
Also puts both in close and long term relationships with CIA.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Basically, anything that actually gives any valid information to the public to judge what is actually happening in this nation has to be destroyed as it unveils the lies of the right wing.  Don't ever let anyone tell you that right wing propaganda doesn't work -- Hitler was our latest example of that.  The Vatican is an older example of it.  They pretty much invented vile propaganda.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Agree with all you  said in this last paragraph... and have also wondered myself about Rap music.
Remember that the CIA has now admitted to having created "Modern Art."

                 In showing the right wing influence on Hollywood which worsened everything ... that doesn't mean that some pretty sleazy and slimey things weren't happening in earlier times.  Just that they were amplified --
made more corrupt.

                 Pornography is an industry. 
Don't know how much of it is produced by individuals and then picked up --
or how much of it is made in an organized way.
If you have any info on it, post it.

                  You're getting closer but right wing is not the right term. Zionist is the correct term. Trump, Rahm, Hillary, and AIPAC are all Zionists.

                    Your jargon is useless in today's society because the fascist have buried themselves in the left sphere of our society with their fake charities, school programs, NGO's etc....all lining up to get the taxpayer money from the government and they are destroying our society. You know full well the most destructive people are pretend do gooders in the left. That makes left vs right useless and the only effective method of getting rid of these people is to call them by name instead of pinning the blame on an entire group of people called the "right" that have nothing to do with the problems of this world.

                     It is the Vatican which was given taxpayer dollars for their "religious based" organizations.
W and the Supremes did that for them though it's a violation of the Constitution.

                     Government pays NOTHING for Social Security --
in fact, SS pays the government 3% every year to administer the program.
Social Security has been put in the general budget so that the SURPLUS it 
was never intended to run can offset the MIC/Intelligence costs --
about 70 cents out of every tax dollar.
SS is intended to be a "pay as you go system" raising only sufficient
funds to cover benefits of those currently retired.
The Surplus was created as a way to steal tens of BILLIONS every year
from the fund.

                      You keep using that word and patriarchy and I will keep filling in behind you. You start naming the correct people and organizations and I will stop. Doesn't bother me because I have 87 gigabytes at my finger tips. You are letting me easily educate people. Your wording will cause people to attack what is left of our social safety nets and I won't watch you do it. Real simple.

                    Women are the dominant porn stars and they do it for money not because they are forced. So somebody needs to target this group of smut peddlers and bankrupt them.

                     A story little told is that of Jews in Hollywood’s seedier cousin, the adult film industry. Perhaps we’d prefer to pretend that the ‘triple-exthnics’ didn’t exist, but there’s no getting away from the fact that secular Jews have played (and still continue to play) a disproportionate role throughout the adult film industry in America. Jewish involvement in pornography has a long history in the United States, as Jews have helped to transform a fringe subculture into what has become a primary constituent of Americana. These are the ‘true blue Jews’.

                     Jewish activity in the porn industry divides into two (sometimes overlapping) groups: pornographers and performers. Though Jews make up only two per cent of the American population, they have been prominent in pornography. Many erotica dealers in the book trade between 1890 and 1940 were immigrant Jews of German origin. According to Jay A. Gertzman, author of Bookleggers and Smuthounds:The Trade in Erotica, 1920-1940 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), ‘Jews were prominent in the distribution of gallantiana [fiction on erotic themes and books of dirty jokes and ballads], avant-garde sexually explicit novels, sex pulps, sexology, and flagitious materials’.

                 dude calm down. I've been following this shit since 10-08-16 and haven't heard this story. Shirly Temple, Judy Garland, the "M" in MGM, all names that instantly ring a bell in my dutch ears, I'd think this would be excellent redpilling material and shall be sharing as such thank you.
