             No I refuse to bend to dogshit WW2 propaganda, NEVER CUCK, do I believe the Nazi's were controlled op sure do hence Alfred Rosenberg and Rabbi Goebbels and Mueller and Bormann those willing agents of ...btw everyone right of center and white is a nazi. There is a reason Israel is the per capital human trafficking center of the world and has organ harvesting links up the ass and child porn links.

              The Nazis were funded by the Warburgs, Openheimers, Bushes....Warburgs partners with Rothschild and own Central banks with them, including the private  Federal Reserve. IRS is collection agency for Federal Reserve, so that is theirs too. That is why Hitlers body was never found. They protected him for destroying Germany. This is why he allowed the British to escape at Dunkirk. The official explanation was nonsense. The war was to be prolonged, put governments in debt to the Central Banks they were borrowing from during the war, and to take down Germany who was printing her own money. Nazis were then sent to USA after war to teach CIA every thing they knew including MK Ultra. Yes, WW2 is all propaganda.

              We're the good guys. Remember that our movement is very much a "hearts and minds campaign". Therefore we need to be squeeky clean. Anything that paints us as the bad guys needs to be crushed.

            Hi,  This woman has nothing at all to do with pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the first time I heard of her a few months ago, the claim was she was given two years in a secret court hearing because she is a whistleblower.  Actually she is a mentally ill arsonist convicted in an open trial and she's lucky she didn't murder anyone where she burned a family's backyard shed.
           </p>

             A woman convicted of arson after a family of five had to flee their home when she allegedly set fire to their shed will serve her sentence in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
             Melanie Shaw, 44, of Bonnington Crescent, Sherwood, was found guilty of starting a shed fire and throwing paint on a Sherwood family's home last month.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite denying the charges, she was convicted by a jury's unanimous verdict of arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered on February 1, and damaging property at the same house on June 26.
            </p>
            <p>
             Returning to court on Thursday, December 11, she was given a community order for three years with supervision from the probation service.
            </p>
            <p>
             Judge Michael Pert QC was satisfied Shaw suffered from mental illness and told her: "Because you are ill, I'm not going to send you to prison."
            </p>
            <p>
             She was banned by a five-year restraining order from contacting the victims of the arson attack or going to their address.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shaw thanked the judge for his time as she life court as her many supporters, who attended her trial, clapped as she left court.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shaw was said to have had a grudge against a friend at a house where the sheds were set on fire in Bonnington Crescent after she had spoken to social services.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shaw, a churchgoer, lived nearby and had threatened her pal before starting a fire in the family's garden shed as they slept, the court heard.
            </p>
            <p>
             The friend's husband, who raised the alarm, told the court that they had all gone to bed when he awoke and heard a noise like the sound of running water.
            </p>
            <p>
             He thought one of the children had left a tap on but when he got up, he saw orange flames against the landing window. "I went to the window, thinking next door was on fire, and saw the shed was ablaze," he had told the court.
            </p>
            <p>
             His partner called the fire brigade, while he ran to neighbours' houses to alert them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Flammable acetylene gas bottles had been inside the shed but remained intact.
            </p>
            <p>
             The family could not return immediately to their home until it was considered safe because acetylene can continue to burn inside the cylinder.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fire happened in the darkness, so it was not until the following morning that the family saw abusive graffiti on a door and a wall about their daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Four months after starting the blaze, Shaw attacked the family's home again, throwing paint at the house.
            </p>

            So if you want to engage me on a factual level, I would welcome that. If you're going to be making up shit and name calling, well have a nice weekend.

                First of all I don't pretend to know much about this case.  I don't live in the UK and this case is not related to pizzagate.  You're the one who pinged me into this discussion.
               </p>
               <p>
                Secondly, I have not seen any supporting evidence of Melanie Shaw's claims that she was the whistleblower in the case.
               </p>
               <p>
                The investigations into these care homes goes way beyond her. Are the other people who came forward murdered, falsely imprisoned, and drugged as you claim?  If not, why not?  Why just Melanie.
               </p>
               <p>
                What I do see is years after the investigations started Melania Shaw claiming to be and people repeating her claims.  I also see that she is mentally ill.
               </p>
               <p>
                You seem to be confusing believing Melania Shaw with believing child abuse occurred in Nottinghamshire.   You can doubt one and believe the other.
               </p>
               <p>
                You can also be concerned with child sexual abuse and doubt some of illogical claims on this board.

               Dude you mouthing psychopath "further" evidence" lol read you -2 IQ spastoid 150 claims came forward even the "authorities" admitted this including CHILDREN WHAT WERE WITH HER IN THE HOME....stop sperging you imbecile. BTW her evidence isn't jsut the shtty refuted frame up attempts and false "convictions" based on a shitty ass fake story about a "fire" started by cops/their agents in a neighbor's backyard(what evidence is their she did it NONE thats admitted its a fake claim and FALSE FLAG to silence her just like happened in Franklin with brothers being murdered and FBI coming in threatening people to change their testimony)
              </p>
              <p>
               You go argue with the police case workers, family members, and 150 CHILDREN then turned adults that provided evidence testimony along with the insane amount of claims that were hushed up and covered up for decades because the COPS when receiving the report refused to act, the children WHO ESCAPED and then were returned to THE RAPE PIT...
              </p>
              <p>
               Melanie Shaw told the truth hundreds of witnesses back her the community backs her you are DISCREDITED, you clearly haven't even looked at the story you idiotic psychopath.

             "Melanie Shaw, a vulnerable abuse victim and vital abuse whistleblower, remains in high security prison HMP Peterborough, with no substantive evidence against her, no proper NHS medication that she has taken daily over many years, no treatment for her leg ulcer, no access her psychiatrist, no visits from her family, interference with her mail, bullying from prison warders, a national mainstream media black out and a stunning silence from her MP Chris Leslie and other MPs.
            </p>
            <p>
             On 11 July 2014 Melanie Shaw, a survivor of abuse at Beechwood Childrens Home, Nottingham, was arrested on charges of arson of a neighbour's shed, a charge that she denies. Nottingham police initially refused to say she had been arrested, and only admitted she was held in custody after numerous calls from the public who were concerned at her disappearance. Police police later seemed confused over the date of the alleged arson offence, publicly quoting both 1 February and 4 April 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
             At a hearing at Nottingham Crown Court on 25 July the prosecution failed to present evidence, despite the Judge prompting them with references to a finger or palm print.
            </p>
            <p>
             In what was described as a fumbling statement to the Judge, the prosecution excused the lack of evidence and promised it would be available ‘shortly.’ Despite the absence of evidence against her, her status as a vulnerable abuse victim and her importance as a key witness to widespread child abuse, the Judge was happy to place Melanie on remand, at a prison in which she has already suffered bullying, strip searches, denial of her NHS medication and disorientation through repeated relocation between cells.
            </p>
            <p>
             Her defence team failed to communicate with her and failed to challenge the lack of evidence. At no point was Melanie asked to speak in her own defence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Melanie had stated just prior to her arrest, that Nottingham police had failed to properly investigate both the widespread child abuse, and the deaths of numerous children within the ‘care’ of Nottingham City and County Council at Beechwood and other homes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note that Nottinghamshire police have used arson charges before to smear a witness' name.
            </p>
            <p>
             There were several flaws in the legal process, but she is remanded in a prison, Peterborough, where bullying is rife. She says she is not being given her Valium. If so, this is of grave concern, as it will at best cause discomfort, and at worst cause seizures which could be fatal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Melanie was told to expect a "direction hearing" on 12th Sepember. She prepared for it, but was then told that it was cancelled because the judge was on holiday. She has discharged her legal team for incompetence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Campaigners should get a legal opinion on whether a writ of Habeas Corpus should be issued for Melanie.
            </p>
            <p>
             22nd September 2014: Melanie was on hunger strike, though this is reported to have stopped shortly after.
            </p>
            <p>
             24th September Update more detail on the flawed legal process.]
            </p>
            <p>
             10th October: court hearing. Bail application made, possible that bail may be granted next week.
Radio interview about Melanie. It is rare for people accused of arson to be remanded in prison, unless there is past history of violence, which is not so in Melanie's case.
1 November found "guilty" by jury on instructions from judge. Found guilty in a flawed legal process. She is due to be sentenced in Mid December. Samantha Morton is now taking an interest in her case.

           <p>
            If you don't like zionists then Voat is not the right place for you. Try reddit, they love Palestine over there. You can try it yourself, go make a reddit account, criticize IDF and be pro-Palestine/Iran, they will love you."

            You people are fools and this is why the White ruling class elite has turned their backs on you and have joined with the Jews. People like me are ostracized for trying to help the commoners meanwhile we can join the other team and gain from your downfall instead.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why try to help the masses and have them resent you for it when you can profit by destroying them instead?
           </p>
           <p>
            Trying to help you people is self-destructive, however trying to fuck you over is profitable and secures our existence.

           <p>
            I'm trying to show you people with VIDEO PROOF that Tommy Robinson is a ZIONIST. He is working directly with the people who are behind the Islamification of the West. He has pledged his allegiance to our enemies on video, and yet this still isn't enough to clue the masses in to make them realize they're being played.
           </p>

            The average person is a sheep that subconsciously allows themself to be manipulated and influenced. This is their natural function. Sheep are gonna sheep. This is what they do. Trying to help the sheep is futile. You cannot turn the sheep into shephards. Trying to do so will turn them against you. This is why if you're a shepherd you work with the dominant group of shepherds ( Jews) and gain. Trying to help the sheep will only harm you. The sheep will subconsciously hate you for trying to turn them into shepherds because it is not in their nature. They want to be lead and instructed. They lack a piece of their brain that allows them to function indepently. They are like autonomous robots that need a signal telling them what to do in order to function. Without this signal telling them what to do they are lost.

            These are two pictures of many. He is a Zionist shill. Controlled opposition. His incarceration is a publicity stunt to gain him fame and influence in the movement. This is how (((they))) infiltrate and takeover.

            Tommy Robinson's real last name is LENNON and he calls himself a " ZIONIST" and has secret meetings with Jews. CONTROLLED OPPOSITION.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stephen Christopher Lennon (né Yaxley; 27 November 1982[3]), known by the pseudonym Tommy Robinson and previously Andrew McMaster and Paul Harris,[4] is a far right activist[5][6][7][8][9] who co-founded and served as spokesman and leader of the English Defence League (EDL),[10] from which he resigned in 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            Robinson has declared his support for the Jewish people and Israel, calling himself a Zionist.[19]

            I could keep digging, but I can already tell that he's working with Jews with makes him a shill, a traitor, or blind as a bat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jews import Muslims and create the problem and then pose as the solution and give us another " WE MUST LOVE ISRAEL" leader a-la Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look. Jews are not allies. They are behind the Islamification of the West.

             You are more than likely true its a psyop to make him appear a hero, using  the backdrop of shit events, but I still support the free inquiry of the public so I oppose the positioning but shit on the story. Good post upvote

            Some people are so brave.
           </p>
           <p>
            They go out on a limb and sacrifice themselves for the betterment of us all. They receive no reward on earth, and are mocked, slandered, and metaphorically nailed to that cross.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's at least make a promise to ourselves to at least give lip service to these individuals. I know we don't want to leave the comforts of our homes and couch, but we can do that at least.
