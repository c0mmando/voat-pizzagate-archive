<p>&quot;In 1972, at a nightclub in LA, rockstar Jimmy Page laid eyes on Lori Maddox, a<br />
14 year old girl.  Maddox’s personal accounts in the unauthorized biography of<br />
Led Zeppelin, Hammer of the Gods, claim that Page told his tour manager,<br />
Richard Cole, to ‘kidnap’ her and take her to the West Hollywood hotel the band<br />
was staying in.  Maddox admits to being kept under lock-and-key, presumably to<br />
keep 29-year-old Page from being imprisoned for child sexual abuse.  In Hammer<br />
of the Gods, Maddox describes having fallen in love with Page almost instantly.<br />
Page and Maddox “dated” for months afterwards, until Page left Maddox for Bebe<br />
Buell, who was of legal age at the time.&quot;
