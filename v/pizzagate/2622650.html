<p>Seasoned abortionist Dr. Deborah Nucatola, who serves as national senior director of “medical services” at Planned Parenthood.....</p>
<p>fulfilling the bloodthirsty demand for “intact hearts,” ‘‘lower extremities” and lungs.</p>
<p>“I would say it’s probably anywhere from $30 to $100” per specimen.</p>
<p>Nucatola exulted at how fetal livers have become tres chic: “A LOT of people” want them.</p>
<p>This master of murderous euphemism repeatedly referred to an unborn baby’s head as a “calvarium” and casually described the tricks and techniques she and her fellow abortionists use to “increase your chance of success.”</p>
<p>Rotating the babies so they are delivered breech before being mutilated </p>
<p>“good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that — so I’m not gonna crush that part. I’m going to basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”</p>
<p>use “ultrasound guidance” to target the coveted body parts — “so they’ll know where they’re putting their forceps.”</p>
<p>This method isn’t employed to reduce the pain and suffering of unborn baby and mother, mind you

<p>Harvesting Fetal Body Parts</p>
<p>Actual requests for body parts such as a &quot;whole intact leg, including the entire hip joint,&quot; come with special instructions that the body be dissected </p>
<p>Finally, the scientists specify whether &quot;abnormalities&quot; are permitted and under what conditions a body part will be shipped (such as in wet or dry ice) and by what mode of transportation (usually one of the well-known overnight-delivery services).</p>
<p>Because the sale of human tissue or body parts is prohibited by federal law, the traffickers have worked out an arrangement to expedite the process from which they all benefit and still remain within current interpretations of the law. For instance, the harvesters receive the fetal material as a &quot; donation&quot; from the abortion clinic. In return, the clinic is paid a &quot;site fee&quot; for rental of lab space where technicians, employed by the harvesters, perform as many dissections as necessary to fill researcher manifests. The harvesters then &quot;donate&quot; the body parts to the researchers and, rather than pay the harvesters for the actual body parts, &quot;donate&quot; the cost of the retrieval (a service) via a formal price list</p>
<p>1999 list and prices, makes you wonder the prices are now, or what an alive child price would be?....</p>

<p>The fiction is that under this mutually acceptable agreement, no laws are broken: No body parts from aborted fetuses are sold. In nearly all cases, the entire fetus is not needed.

Any remaining skin, tissue, bones, or organs are ground up in the sink disposal or incinerated</p>
<p>Rep. Henry Hyde....&quot;I deplore any medical procedure that treats human beings as chattel, as a subject fit for harvesting. The humanity of every fetus should be respected and treated with dignity and not like a laboratory animal.&quot; The fact remains, though, that it\'s legal, and 1.5 million abortions are performed every year in the United States.</p>
<p>It\'s legal, and tens of thousands of body parts from aborted babies are used in scientific research. It\'s true, too, that our laws provide no human-being status to an unborn baby. But despite this, unborn babies are considered human for the purpose of scientific experimentation.&quot; Suzanne Rini, author of Beyond Abortion, says this is an issue &quot;that never ceases to shock me. Fetal-tissue harvesting is a very lucrative industry, and just a small percentage of research could yield huge profits. Billions are involved in fetal-tissue research and harvesting, and the federal government participates in it in a big way. But it\'s also very shielded, and one has to try to understand the everydayness of it - - the foundational step in the process of abortion and fetal harvesting.&quot;</p>
<p>Two California fetal tissue companies have been named in a complaint for illegally profiting from the sale of human fetal tissue — the first such action since a series of sting videos targeting Planned Parenthood and tissue procurers more than a year ago.

<p>Two California fetal tissue companies have been named in a complaint for illegally profiting from the sale of human fetal tissue — the first such action since a series of sting videos targeting Planned Parenthood and tissue procurers more than a year ago.</p>
<p>The civil complaint by Orange County, Calif. District Attorney Tony Rackauckus could reignite the controversy over the anti-abortion group’s allegations that abortion providers and human tissue procurement companies are trafficking in the sale of fetal tissue.</p>
<p>DaVinci Biosciences and sister company, DV Biologics, made money off of the sale of &quot;hundreds of different fetal tissue and stem cell ‘products,\'&quot; &quot;from the hearts, lungs, kidneys, brains, intestines, skeletal muscle and bones of the aborted fetus donations,&quot; </p>
<p>The complaint alleges the companies “obtained aborted fetus donations from Planned Parenthood and turned those donations into a profit-driven business.” The companies “intentionally set the prices as high as possible in an effort to maximize their profits,” it says

            Black babies are being aborted at alarming rates and so are white children but there is a real effort to get the black women to abort. 
CPS loves to take the white babies. Did anyone see the post from Cecile Richards where she says the future is Latina? I think Latina women have fewer abortions since the community values family more highly and they help each other, but certainly it will be easier for Aztlan to happen along with the Muslim invasion since black and white people are all about aborting themselves out of existence while Latinas and Muslims want large families. The birth rates of white and black women are far far far lower. Sad to think of what we have unknowingly consumed in the way of flavor enhancers, etc. Here are some more articles:

             they don't need baby parts for stem cells
            </p>
            <p>
             all they need are eggs and sperm and a petri dish
            </p>
            <p>
             I see both sides, but think they should put solid no loopholes in regards to abortions

            <p>
             also think something needs to be done about trafficking, no doubt

             from what I been reading PP doesn't need tax dollars

             grant money is huge also maybe some of those celebrities can put their money where their mouth is

            Excuse me if my post isn’t completely revenant as I didn’t have the stomach to finish.   What a sad day for America that we are now sellers of unborn innocents.

            Oh my God.  I **shudder ** to think what part 3 will be like.  This is horrible.  It's so heartbreaking how they can just grind them up.  Down the drain.  I hope something comes of the Cali Complaint.  I can't even believe it.  Of all states. Let us pray this comes to pass.

            A few years ago I watched a lecture of a woman, now retired and completely reformed, explain her job in  an abortion clinic.  She said that birth control pills are rigged to produce pregnancy, which is why birth control has a very low efficacy. 
She described how employees were trained to conduct themselves with women during interviews, all to lean them toward an abortion.    I only wish I could remember her name or I'd link it here.

            The battle of funds for worldwide abortions..........
           </p>
           <p>
            President Obama repealed rules on Friday that restricted federal money for international organizations that promote or provide abortions overseas, sweeping aside a pillar of the social policy architecture of George W. Bush’s presidency
           </p>
           <p>
            The executive order that Mr. Obama signed reverses one of the first measures enacted by Mr. Bush when he took over the White House eight years ago and capped an opening-week flurry of action intended to signal a sharp break from the past in domestic and foreign arenas.
           </p>
           <p>
            “For the past eight years, they have undermined efforts to promote safe and effective voluntary family planning in developing countries,” Mr. Obama said of the restrictions. “For these reasons, it is right for us to rescind this policy and restore critical efforts to protect and empower women and promote global economic development.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The policy has become a symbolic and substantive football in Washington politics over the years. President Ronald Reagan first imposed the ban in 1984 when it was announced at a conference in Mexico City. President Bill Clinton lifted it a couple of days after taking office in 1993. Mr. Bush restored it a couple of days after he took office in 2001, and advocates on both sides expected Mr. Obama to lift it again.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only surprise was that Mr. Obama acted a day after the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion, rather than on the day itself as the last two presidents did. Mr. Obama did little to call attention to his move, issuing his comments only in writing and releasing the order after 7 p.m. Friday.
           </p>
           <p>
            “President Obama will be remembered forever not just as a smart, savvy, gifted and eloquent leader — but as the Abortion President,” Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey and co-chairman of the House Bipartisan Pro-Life Caucus, said in a written statement.
           </p>
           <p>
            “President Obama’s actions will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions and women dying from high-risk pregnancies because they don’t have access to family planning,” said Tod Preston, a vice president at Population Action International.
           </p>
           <p>
            Word of the order was received enthusiastically at a meeting on population trends at the University of California, Berkeley. Many of the gathered experts work for family planning organizations that face declining flows of government and private aid.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It is actually a great day for those who oppose abortion,” said Steven W. Sinding, a past director-general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and population adviser to the World Bank. “This will help many of the most effective providers of family planning services to enable women to avoid unwanted pregnancies.”
