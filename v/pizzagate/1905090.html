            Alex Jones has a video he supposedly shot incognito of the cremation of dull care ceremony where they burn a person who embodies dull care. They talk (yell) between eachother about tedium thruout the year, at their work and that now they get to burn dull care but dull care talks (yells) that he is a good or usefull guy and they need him that they dont really have to burn him. But after alot of argueing they burn him and he screams alot. that's pretty chilling too. Guys in dresses. Screaming. Oh and oh yeah, at Alcatraz and Martin Luther king in Berkeley there is a costume store right there, funky neighborhood, close to the ashby fleamarket,  they do the costumes. But then who knows what they do after the cremation of dull care ceremony. That's how they kick it off. So that after they let go of dull care in their ritual it allows them to be naughty as they want outside of good. That's what it seems to me. My sister's  mom lived next door to the costume shop and knew them, that's how I know they do or did the costumes. Also I think some gay guys may have written about being call boys there. (?)

            You can not take pictures pf people like that. Most car windows are dark. There's only one road up there and it's a tiny town.  Theres a long narraw road from town up to the grove, but there were national gaurd soldiers who were filming and blocking the entrance. The protestors called for cadaver dogs. It was scary. Up there by the gate it was scary. Mark dice had a book out and was explaining moloch, and stuff like that. Everything was surprisingly satanic already from the moment i got there. Noticing that the street signs said creepy biblical stuff, the store was called worldly goods. I shouldve taken pictures but didn't want to be noticed. 
 There were big white vans with black windows that carted children who worked there at bohemian grove at something like valet jobs who knows, bell boys? by the dozens. The children all had on red blazers and looked in their early teens. Boys and girls. The red blazer thing was very visually striking. The parking lot was  bustling with the vans. There was a bar across the street,  from that parking lot, coincidentally I knew the owner of the bar Inga, thru a vaulting teacher who kept Inga's horses, here in Marin. She wouldn't have been pleased if I said I came in with protestors...so I didnt. She was kinda mad about the protest. But we had drinks. It's a superb bar restaurant, like going back in time, situated on the river, gorgeous.  Like the twilight zone though- be warned. 
The people who said they were protestors later told me they were just hanging out with protestors, cause they liked them, and they live there in their cars and that they  don't get hassled by cops there at all, and also that plenty people live on the river too. They wanted me to stay! When I first got there to the town i drove around it a bit, then went parked at the edge of town, and came back with a locking bike with a basket. That was best for staying with the group as it made its way to the blocked gate dark windowed cars drove slowly by and people chanted at them about crimes against humanity. Once in a while someone acted like they knew who was in what car but...meh.
PS oh yeah. All the sudden the soldiers grabbed an old man and just took him away. That really deflated the crowd. A group went to try to coordinate his release from jail. I saw it happen he was pretty old looking guy. Freaky deaky

                    Thank you. It sure is hard to hang in there lately.  There are some funky things going on within this site and I believe it is because of the trolling, and shills, CTR, etc.  The guilty elites are shaking in their boots and fighting back harder.  They are fighting harder, because we are getting closer. We mus ALL stay strong right now put up an even harder front.  We must not weaken.  We must beat them down.

                     Hang in there, kid!  I've been here since the beginning.  I had to create a new profile after I forgot my damn password.   I didn't used to post much but I do more now.  So you just hang in and know that we all know you're one of the good ones.  It must suck for the criminals to know the  public is red-pilled.  I'm watching Depends stock, waiting for the big jump.  Those assholes.

                   Anyone who has read your posts would know you would never sacrifice a chicken to Moloch. In fact, I'd bet you buy your chicken already cut into wings and drumsticks, lol. I find that most of the people who call others on here "faggot shill" have drifted over from 4chan. I love those guys but they get a bit repetitive with that name calling stuff.

                    Yeah, there really is way too much of it on here. It is really  sad that people have stooped so low that it has become part of their vocabulary. They are really running themselves down. I volunteered  with kids many years ago and none of them ever used language like that.  It really shows where our country is headed.  I hope I am wrong.

                    Yes, it was about the coup in Honduras.  And I believe it was from Cheryl Mills to Hillary Clinton  I am guessing, only guessing, that she may be doing this at Bohemian Grove. I hope I am wrong but why would you send such a strange message.
