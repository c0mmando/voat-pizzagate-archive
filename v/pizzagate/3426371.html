            I followed Sheila Jackson Lee's office for three years to follow up on a district case of over 600 complaints of sexual abuse by the children in the Texas Youth Correctional Facility. They were rousted after 10 p.m. at night and forced to have sex with others and each other, and felt they were being filmed. Their Judiciary staffers come and go and use the position as a resume padder. After 3 years and checking in with someone different every few months they did absolutely nothing. When I gave them dates and times of my calls and reminded them there is a record, demanding to know what has been done, I was told they were handling complaints at the adult facility first. This all happened beginning in 2006.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then we saw Sheila wearing her pedo ring all these years later.  We also see the cultural shift in sexual behavior towards children being put out in her District.
           </p>
           <p>
            We really need someone in Texas to run against Sheila Jackson Lee and remove her from Congress. It's imperative. The way the district is drawn it would have to be a Democrat African-American to beat her. So be it. She must go!

             WHY CARLA ROSSI?

            <p>
             My performance work confronts white supremacy, complacency, and the confusion of "mixed" identities - of living in-between, particularly sexually and racially. I'm interested in the edge - that line between satire and sincerity, between critique and reification - as a site where transgression and transformation occur. That's why I'm drawn to drag as artwork. Drag often reinforces heterosexist projections of what makes a "woman," but - as theorist Judith Butler argues - it can also expose the cracks in binary sexism by blurring (or queering) gender. Queer drag exposes gender as a performed historical construction - a set of appropriated cues, images, or gestures that culturally signify masculine and feminine - rather than as a biological reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             The character I play, Carla Rossi, started as an art project in 2010 and has since turned into a full-fledged persona, body of work, and occupation. I prefer the term "drag clown" over "drag queen" because I'm not trying to emulate women. I'm more interested in Coyote-style trickery similar to the clown’s objective - a clown says one thing while doing the opposite. In that same way I use Carla as a tool for critique. When I perform as her I wear whiteface in direct allusion to whiteness, clowning,

             When Looking for Tiger Lily comes to the Talking Stick Festival, audiences will meet Carla Rossi, a drag clown in whiteface and a fright wig. But don’t be afraid: she’s a trickster, a storyteller, and the living, outsized embodiment of all the cultural collisions and identity crises two-spirit interdisciplinary artist Anthony Hudson has experienced. Carla is part coyote figure, part PowerPoint-wielding speaker, and much more.

            these faggots advertise who they are and what they like and parents

            ANYONE involved with children need to be vetted. What in the living hell. Why is this even a thing, let alone  a convicted sex worker being in contact with kids?
           </p>

            They are all out of their minds.

            In my child's school, they had some guy come in to teach kids chess, after school.
           </p>
           <p>
            One look at the guy and I and a grandmother of one of the other kids who signed up, went to the office and we asked he he had a background check done.
           </p>
           <p>
            The principal said he was giving a class at another school. I asked again, was there a background check done. He said he would look into it.
           </p>
           <p>
            That was the last day the guy was at the school.
           </p>
           <p>
            People have to stand up and stop this assault on the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am so sick of this.

             I'm glad you did that.   In the UK the indoctrination of kids has started: they teach little kids that there are up to 100 genders; they teach them about sexuality.  But many parents are complaining.  The Muslim mothers are fighting it tooth and nail--good on them.

              Don't fight it you'll never win. Pull the kids out and teach them yourself, public school fills their head with lies and you can do way better. Stop outsourcing everything! Be able to teach your own kids, defend your own home, grow your own food

            I fucking hate that skeezeball Mayor Adler. I'm sorry but Austin is a cesspool. Frost Bank is supposedly designed to look like Moloch and I've even started wondering about UT and the Hookem Horns hand sign (which I've done my entire life). I grew up there, my mom has lived there most of my life. She's a feminist dem, bitches about the lake encroaching on her property but then votes these pos in. Fyi Austin is in Travis County which was sanctuary until Gov Abbott sued. That was right around the time Adler thought trans should be able to use the women's restroom. I'm sure Miss Kitty Litter loves that. My husband worked for the city and said they had to install partitions in the ceiling of the restrooms at the park because these pos were climbing up there to watch little girls go to the bathroom and Adler wants to let them walk right in. Fucking liars. Fucking evil.

              When we were kids in summer camp the tallest little niggers white and black would climb up top the urinals and look over the divider since the wall diving the bathrooms had a foot and a half gap at the ceiling. Couldn’t really see shit assuming the designer wasn’t a complete fucking retard and it was funny to do, kind of like Porkys or whatever that movie was with the peephole.
