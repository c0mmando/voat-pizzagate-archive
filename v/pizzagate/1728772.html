<p>Untitled \'01
Maria Marshall
March 17th – April 14th 2001
83 Grand Street
Press
Time Out New York
Team will present an exhibition of new work by Maria Marshall from the 17th of March through the 14th of April 2001. Team is located at 527 West 26th Street, cross streets Tenth and Eleventh Avenues, on the ground floor.</p>
<p>During 2000, London-based artist Maria Marshall had seven solo shows and participated in several large-scale international museum exhibitions. Marshall has exhibited her work in Paris, Prague, Chicago, San Francisco, Istanbul, Brussels, Boston, Los Angeles and London, among others. Since her debut at Team in October of 1998 — a short two and one-half years ago — public institutions in Italy, Portugal, Scotland, Switzerland and Austria have included her digital projections in high-visibility theme shows. Her work continues to be in great demand.</p>
<p>Marshall’s new works again mine the dark psychological space accessible only through the manipulations of the medium of film. Here she presents three projections — two originally shot on super 16mm and one whose camera original is 35mm — one almost within a Classical Marshall mode; the other two radical departures in terms of technique and content.</p>
<p>The show’s centerpiece is entitled When are we there? For this film, the most disturbing work in the show — quite possibly the most disturbing work of her career — Maria places herself in front of the camera. Frozen in a Kubrick-like interior of wealth and power, the artist stands motionless as the camera pans over her body. As we watch the camera watch, her flesh is disturbed as though our gaze itself was bruising her body, rippling her veins and grabbing her throat. The six-minute loop repeats three passes of the same footage, during each pass, however, the special effects change in intensity, leading the viewer to question their own vision. Theresa’s Story is structurally quite simple. The artist’s son told his mother a story, which he claimed to have heard that day from a teacher. Marshall was intrigued by the element of performance in the boy’s retelling of this narrative and arranged to film him. As presented, Theresa’s Story shows us two views of the boy, facing forward and in profile, telling the same story on different days. His elaborations relate to each other creating an intertext with the density of a puzzle. As both tales are shown side by side, the additions and subtractions from the first telling to the second, make very clear the role of acting in the oral delivery of stories. The artist’s investigative process has yielded a glimpse of real life’s inherent fiction.</p>
<p>In President Bill Clinton, Memphis, November 13, 1993, Marshall presents her two sons, Jacob and Raphael in a sumptuous sun filled-interior. Diffused light streams trough a large window completing an image of material comfort and well being. In this room, in stop-motion, we see the boys endlessly unwrapping gifts. The narration, read haltingly by Marshall’s four-year old, is a fragment from a Clinton speech ostensibly about Martin Luther King\'s legacy. By wrenching the text from the adult professional and placing it in the mouth of a youngster, Marshall gets at the emotive center of Clinton’s speech with alarming force. The boys asks, “Who will be there to take care of these children?” as we witness an endless stream of consumption.</p>
<p>This is Marshall’s third exhibition at Team. For further information and/or photographs, please call 212.279.9219. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 11 am to 6pm.

            UPDATE: I just reported this to the police in England, will see what they're response will be.
1. In this video her son, who looks to be +- 4 years old to me, is literally smoking a cigarette?
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKfG9irehv0&amp;t=8s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKfG9irehv0&amp;t=8s
            </a>
            2. And in this one it looks like they actually SHOOT a man. I know acting is good but if you slow it down it looks real! The subject matter is quite disgusting too, it looks like shes 'hiring' her son out to a paedophile.

            This is a report here in UK, I don't think reporting it to them will be taken seriously, they already put out a report saying if they find people with pedophile images etc., they are hoping not to have to prosecute as it is a lesser offence, and that they should only concentrate on people who have actually commited an offended!!  Their reasoning? they are to overwhelmed with the amount of Reports!  I wish we were like in the USA when it comes to sentencing etc regarding pedophillia.  I guess it has been going on far too long over there that it is just not a surprise/shock any more.  SAD!

            I linked the vidme to #PIZZAGATE on youtube (who was the original one where I saw this 'Artist')  Who do I report it too?  RSPCC?  I reported the WorldCorp one, with Skippy shouting and tormenting the child in the shower cubicle. They, the RSPCC, passed it onto Manchester Police, then I heard no more about it.

I just love it when friends come in and say, ‘I hate that.’ It’s the biggest insult in the world not to have an opinion.”

             Then there's another category of people who don't appreciate it, don't begin to understand it, and even find it revolting, BUT, they pretend the opposite - to be accepted in certain social circles. Lots of these ones, wandering around galleries and clubs, looking and speaking like idiots, playing the role of fabulously hip.

            Australian artist Polixeni Papapetrou has also used photos of her young daughter in her art (which often has an M K ultra-ish vibe).  For example this:
            <a href="https://www.polixenipapapetrou.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Polixeni_Papapetrou_Olympia_as_Beatrice_Hatch_before_White_Cliffs_2003.jpg">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This stuff is so common I'm starting to wonder if that's (ie pics of young kids in inappropriate contexts) is where the money is in the contemporary art scene.  (And to most perhaps, if the mother is the artist, then it's a victimless crime.)

             Oh my goodness I was not expecting that. What an exploitation of your own child!  Wonder if it would be taken seriously if reported as inappropriate?  Came across this odd artist is too:  Ami Rawlinson:

            One of Maria Marshall's art videos is of her young son Jacob eating oysters. There's a quote on her site where she says some people associate oysters with sexuality. Err...so why have you got your kid son eating them then for adults to watch?
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember oysters feature on the birthday flyer for Buck's restaurant. So blatant its a code or metaphor for something.

            Tavistock mind control bullshit.  Clearly she had a disturbed upbringing.  The interview you showed with her indicates to me that she is no intellectual.  That's not what her work is about.  More experiential.  Interesting that the art world does not delve into that.  Usually any art critic worth their salt examines motivations behind an artist's work.  Take the Guggenheim for example:

             Often, their titles are derived from the utterances of her children. When I Grow Up I Want To Be a Cooker (1998) features footage of her son digitally altered so that it appears as though he is smoking. I should be older than all of you (2000) reveals a wide-eyed child lying in a box, surrounded by slithering snakes. When are we there? (2001) is a six-minute loop that winds through the corridors of a nondescript institutional building, ultimately ending up in a room in which Marshall herself stands; the camera approaches and focuses on her skin, which appears to move as though touched by phantom hands. For Puzzle Fit (2002–03), Marshall taped a group of preadolescent students, outfitted with microphones, in a disco; images of the students commingling and dancing appear with subtitles of their gossipy discussions on a four-part split screen, as 1970s dance music plays in the background. For 3 Minute Wonder, screened on London’s Channel 4 in 2006, Marshall created three films each consisting of three-minute deconstructed biographies of her son, her grandmother, and herself.

            It would be excellent if we could organize a protest at these sicko artists' exhibitions with appropriate flyers. Once we bring attention to those who the monsters support and bring them down, we will begin to chip our way to the top. If we can destroy these "artists" careers, and essentially find out what they're about and put them in jail essentially should they actually be involved in child abuse, which seems 99% sure they are, then the head creatures' funds and avenues are dried up. I think this is a better place to start with protests than a disorganized street display about Pizzagate. Where is Abramovic's next exhibit going to be? What other artists do they support, and where will they be promoting their sick shit? These are our targets. Someone should also be there with a tablet showing the videos such as the one above to those who are walking by without any intention of entering the exhibit, and another person there wearing a GoPro to capture the images of the ones who are entering the exhibit. Just my two cents, but I think it's a good place to start an organized front.

             Sounds excellent!  I live in the UK though :(  I am POSITIVE that if 'normal' people like us were to see the pictures etc of these sickos there would be more of an outcry...........how can we get these pics, ie ja covered in blood, girl taped to table, some of the dam pedo art of dead children in water, a row of little girls with hands tied behind their backs and bottoms red raw, disgusting pamphlets of the 'music bands' that play at these 'family friendly' places..........my blood is boiling, I want something done, but unless the public see these pics, we are seeming to be 'crazy' conspirators!

              Hmm... I'm sure a little bit of research would show that Abramovic has UK connections as well. Probably some "artist" friends or she may be having an exhibition somewhere nearby. Her followers for the stupid Abramovic Method seems to be a global phenomenon. Seeing as she's beloved by Lady Gag, has she ever come to the UK or has plans to? This would be a perfect time to red pill people in your area either through Twitter or at the concerns. Hell, both if possible. The Twitter campaign during her Superbowl performance about her activities with Abramovic was pretty successful.

             Protesting these artists is just going to give them free press and draw more people to their work. People love stuff that has shock value. Protesting them could have the opposite effect you're trying to achieve.  Think Ozzy Osborne,  Alice Cooper etc. One could argue they achieved a higher level of fame and fortune from being shocking and controversial.

            The occultists have basically taken over the arts and the public funding of art is basically a wealth transfer to the depraved.

            Thanks for yet ANOTHER example of fucked-up, psycho bullshit called ART. This shit is
            <strong>
             financed
            </strong>
            for a reason, and it aint because it's beautiful, OR mass market consumable. A WHOLE LOT is NOT RIGHT about the lucrative

              art
             </em>

            business in this world.

             The one titled "I saw you cry" makes me believe he was tricked into killing his pet. This is one way they traumatize deeply. Get the child to love and care for an animal, then make them kill it or kill it in front of them.
