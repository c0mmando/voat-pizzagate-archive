            On Nov 23, just as pizzagate was starting to heat up, I was posting on Voat when my modem stopped working for no apparent reason. It didn't work for eight hours, I tried everything I knew to do, and then I called my ISP to come out. Then it just randomly started working again, but it would no longer work with my old password, forcing me to change the password. So I am pretty sure "someone" has my network password now. The next morning I noticed immediately upon waking that my phone had paired sometime in the night with a new, unfamiliar bluetooth device, which I immediately deleted from the list. I started using my phone in data only mode to keep it completely separate from the wifi. That same day all my text messages began arriving 12 - 24+ hours late though I had never had a single glitch with my phone before. For some strange reason, suddenly I can't access my usage logs on my cellphone carrier web site or in the app on the phone. The next day, my debit card transactions started taking an inordinately long time to process.

            I am pretty certain they are watching me.
           </p>

            I actually texted myself asking them to not take so long to forward me my messages. lol  I have truly gone over to the paranoid side. But it's only paranoia if they're NOT out to get you. And I think we all realize that they ARE out to get us. Maybe not me, but certainly anyone among us who presents a threat to them.

            My family is on view for years, if you dont publish first hand evidence, youre life is safe. They will let you know that they know. If you publish fhe, be smart and use prepaid cards for Inet and be aware of the Orwell state, cameras, never use your name in the device and if your information is so relevant that you got to be killed, be careful and trust nobody, not even yourself.

            Not deep enough into investigation to draw any attention. As for you, next time don't go into the alley if three guys are there acting strangely. This time they were probably just trying to scare you. Next time could be worse...stay safe, my friend.
