            It's such a ridiculous &amp; simple tactic - accuse your enemy of something you are guilty of. (My ex was great at this!) If you shift the blame in advance, you bewilder the innocent party &amp; destroy their reputation, thus giving yourself the upper hand. The cabal are masters of this sort of evil.

            I do believe that there will be Republican congressmen/women who will lose their house race on purpose, after being nicely paid off, so that the democrats can get control of the house and impeach Trump.  That is their plan.  many republicans hate him too.

            That two-hour Trump/Putin meeting has really got to have them worried. It didn't take 2 hours to work out a cease fire.  And we all know  Putin has Hillary's emails for sure.  NOw Trump knows all their dirty secrets
Hey, did Podesta ever make it to Utah?

            My sister is a 28-year veteran of a large city police department. She always says, 'Think like a criminal to catch a criminal'. The Podesta emails and MSM have proven this is their tactic as well by placing blame on the opposition for exactly what they are guilty of themselves. Never get complacent and keep your eyes wide open.

            This is an excellent analysis and synopsis.  It certainly is a plausible theory.  I'm not going to address it point-by-point, but my posts repeatedly confirm that I believe we are fighting an attempt at the rise of the Fourth Reich.

            The war isn't one yet.  In fact, it is just getting started.  But at least we understand how they operate and have a leader who knows how to stay several steps in front of him.

              What you are hearing are the shills (propagandists) playing mini-Goebbels with their Nazi bullshit.  Most of them don't even know they are Nazis.  Yet.

            Great insight and great thread.  I appreciate you taking time to think outside the box and anticipate possibilities.   Kudos for being so focused on the bigger picture, because I'm sure many of us will think in this stuff over the weekend and, hey, who knows where it will lead us to dig?

            I have to give you props for this. In May CrowdStrike (ex-Russian Hackers with Comey plant and Soros funding) goes into DNC and puts Falcon on computers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The emails are transferred to flash drive in 2016 from inside DNC. This has been confirmed. On July 10, 2016 Seth is "murdered" They are already blaming Russians for the "hack" These leaks happened after and from inside. All of Wikileaks lawyers are murdered. Seth is murdered, Shawn Lucas dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            They knew it was an inside job. On July 7, 2016 Russian Ambassoder goes to the state department to warn of picked up communication of DNC staffer planned execution and names the assasination. The Obama admin has him thrown out of the US.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth is taken out. The night of the incident an FBI vehicle in the area gets vandalized and guns are stolen. Quietly reported. Two days later the assasin named a week earlier to the State Department by Russian Ambassedor gets in a shootout with local police and is arrested in DC. His companions found murdered hours away.
           </p>
           <p>
            No MSM story even mentions that a known felon was captured in a shootout with police two days after Seth is shot for an "alleged" burglary gone wrong that had been named by the Russian Ambassador a week prior.No mention of stolen FBI weapons.
           </p>
           <p>
            No MSM no statement from FBI....nothing

             Exactly. I also notice that Fox News just reported North Korea is trafficking slaves to Russia...
            </p>
            <p>
             I really believe they were planning to expose everything, except in reverse and pinned on Trump and Putin. They'd have the entire media and judicial system on their side.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the record, I think this plan would have worked had they won. However, the only way it has a chance of working now is if every single one of Trumps GOP and media allies are crypto-pedos and turn.
