<blockquote>
<p>A Manhattan federal judge on Wednesday evening agreed to postpone unsealing depositions related to the sex life of Ghislaine Maxwell until the alleged madam can file an appeal.</p>
<p>The order by Judge Loretta Preska will, for two business days, block the release of documents that relate to a deposition Maxwell gave as part of a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit filed against her in 2015 by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. </p>
<p>Preska ordered the documents unsealed in a court hearing last week, but gave Maxwell’s legal team a week to file an appeal with the Second Circuit Court. If the circuit court does not order them to remain sealed, the documents will be made public Monday, according to Preska’s order.</p>

              Sure looks that way.....judges are where the chosenites place a lot of their focus when it comes to subversive activity. That way, on the rare occasion they do get caught in other criminal activity, such as massive sexual black male operations, the people directing these activities never get caught.
