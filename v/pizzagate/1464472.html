            I'm the one who posted this, and I wish that I hadn't. After some more research, it appears that whatdoesitmean.com is a bullshit website. This article has no real sourcing that links the dead journalists and mayor to pizzagate. I tried to delete it, but I can't. It is peculiar that two journalists and a mayor were murdered by a sniper yesterday, but the connection to the CF and the PM of Finland does not have any justification that I can find.

            Here's a couple links reporting the murders. Shockingly, police seem to be baffled as to motive.

            For argument sake, if you are also possibly investigating human trafficiking ring, and it also involved Finland...How would you go about going off the grid so your actions can't be monitored (mostly supposed persons computer)
           </p>
           <p>
            And how would you notify people of your research, but are afraid you might be tracked, and also, you know..

             I don't know enough to give you a great answer, but I would pay cash for a cheap device, go to a place with public wifi access then go to 8ch.net and ask someone there. Or find someone in real life that you can trust.
