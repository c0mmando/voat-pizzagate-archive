<p>Lee Plourde told the Post that Epstein, 66, was not &quot;currently&quot; on suicide watch, but declined to give further details. </p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that <strong>Epstein had been taken off suicide watch at the end of July</strong>, adding that he had been placed on watch and given daily psychiatric evaluations following an incident in which he was found with bruising on his neck. It remains unclear whether those injuries were the result of an assault or a suicide attempt.</p>
<p>The wealthy financier was found unresponsive in his cell Saturday morning at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, officials said. Epstein was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Prisons confirmed that he had been housed in the jail’s Special Housing Unit, a heavily secured part of the facility that separates high-profile inmates from the general population. </p>
<p>Until recently, the same unit had been home to the Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, who is now serving a life sentence at the so-called Supermax prison in Colorado.</p>
<p>The disclosure that Epstein was not on suicide watch is likely to further infuriate his alleged victims as well as public officials who have demanded a full investigation into his death. </p>
<p><strong>It is also expected to increase questions about how how the Bureau of Prisons ensures the welfare of such high-profile inmates.</strong> In October, Boston gangster James “Whitey” Bulger was killed in a federal prison in West Virginia where had just been transferred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Unequivocally, he should have been on active suicide watch and therefore under direct and constant supervision,” former federal prison warden Cameron Lindsay told the AP, adding that if Epstein\'s suicide is confirmed, it would represent &quot;an unfortunate and shocking failure.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Attorney General William Barr in a letter Saturday to investigate the death.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every single person in the Justice Department — from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer — knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn’t be allowed to die with him,” Sasse wrote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Friday, more than 2,000 pages of documents were released related to a since-settled lawsuit against Epstein’s ex-girlfriend by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s accusers. The records contain graphic allegations against Epstein, as well as the transcript of a 2016 deposition of Epstein in which he repeatedly refused to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself.</p>
<p>Sigrid McCawley, Giuffre’s attorney, said Epstein’s suicide less than 24 hours after the documents were unsealed “is no coincidence.” </p>
<p>McCawley urged authorities to continue their investigation, focusing on Epstein associates who she said “participated and facilitated Epstein’s horrifying sex trafficking scheme.”</p>
<p>Other accusers and their lawyers reacted to the news with frustration that the financier won’t have to face them in court.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives, while he will never face the consequences of the crimes he committed the pain and trauma he caused so many people,” accuser Jennifer Araoz said in a statement.</p>

            "If the highly questionable suicide of Jeffrey Epstein had happened in another country, we would all be laughing at how corrupt that country is." The only encouraging thing to come out of this so far is that the leftist-fascist side has also put on their foil hats and declared a vast conspiracy. The only ones not doing so are the Deep State spokespeople all over the news commanding, "We must wait on the impartial investigations by the FBI and the Bureau of Prisons."  HAW, Haw and HAW! Mafiosa Hillary's FBI and who knows what branch of the Mafia is in charge of the Bureau of Prisons?

            Why would Epstein kill himself now? He and others knew what was in the depositions released a few days ago, and they would have known what the government seized a few weeks ago in the raid on his New York property.  There must have been other vile deeds — much younger children, cannibalism, Satanic sacrifices and as yet unnamed elites — to which Epstein could testify if he remained alive.

            Your head is down........don't take others with you.  False narrative and projection by MSM.  Don't you think Trumps lawyer, his AG and himself would have been the first to question it publicly?  They didn't.  You've learned nothing.

            AP got their talking points from NYPost which got their information from 'two sources'
            <strong>
             Use your head, have you learned nothing!
            </strong>
            Read the articles.  No where has Barr, Trump or Giuliani mentioned he'd been removed from suicide watch.
            <strong>
             DON'T YOU THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO ASK WHY!  AND INFORM THE PUBLIC!.
            </strong>
            Giuliani is Trumps lawyer for ---ts sake.  Use your head.

             Lee Plourde, whom I quoted in my OP,  is an official spokesman or for the Federal Buereau of Prisons, you can check that on their website. All other quotes in my post are also sourced with names.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only info that isn't, and this is only sourced with 'ap' is the time

              when

             he was taken off suicide watch.

             I don't like Liz Crokin, but in this case, she might be right. I looked at the pics that showed Epstein being taken to hospital, and the ear and the nose looked different.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein was not on suicide watch in the Manhattan jail where he hanged himself Saturday morning, officials said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Department of Justice spokesman Lee Plourde told The Post that Epstein, 66, was not “currently” on watch in his cell at the Manhattan Correctional Facility while he awaited trial on child sex-trafficking charges.
            </p>
            <p>
             Plourde refused to say whether that meant Epstein had been taken off additional monitoring or whether he had never been getting special attention to make sure he did not kill himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I’m not going to discuss his previous medical status,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein had reportedly been placed on suicide watch after he was found nearly unconscious in his cell on July 23. There was some question about whether the incident was a suicide attempt or an assault, and investigators noted that the marks on his neck were “more consistent with being choked than hanging yourself,” one source told the Post.
            </p>
            <p>
             An ex-cop housed in the same unit as Epstein who faces the death penalty for four drug-related killings upstate was questioned in the incident.
            </p>
            <p>
             Plourde refused to say whether that incident was ruled a suicide attempt or an assault.
            </p>
            <p>
             Plourde said Epstein was never treated outside MCC after that incident, disputing reports.
            </p>
            <p>
             “He was never taken to the hospital,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also unclear if Epstein was in a cell by himself or shared his cell.
            </p>
