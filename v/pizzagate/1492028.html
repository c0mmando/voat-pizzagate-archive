<p>I\'ve seen some discussion regarding this email: </p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/34/348460_re-gray-if-you-ever-so-much-as-criticize-me-again-i-will.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/34/348460_re-gray-if-you-ever-so-much-as-criticize-me-again-i-will.html</a></p>
<p>I thought the parts about the pineal gland and the references to 9/11 were intriguing, so I decided to do some investigation. I was intrigued by the possibility that this guy David F. McCullar, really could have participated in the inside job on 9/11 and was perhaps victim of some mind control so he didn\'t reveal it to anyone. And also that he might know something or be a participant in this pineal gland extraction thing, which I\'ve been reading about and I think it\'s part of the Satanic rituals. </p>
<p>So, I did a bit of Facebook snooping on this guy David, and I believe that for the most part he\'s just a mentally troubled guy. He\'s not a member of the elite - he goes to community college. However his grandmother has a lot of land or something in Central Texas, so he kind of fits the stereotype of trust fund hipster. I don\'t think this guy is part of the group of bad guys we\'re after. It doesn\'t look like he has a close relationship with Barbara Bush (Dubya\'s daughter), rather it looks like he had a chance encounter with her in high school and became a totally obsessed stalker of her. The love was unrequited. </p>
<p>He mentions the pineal gland stuff in his old FB updates, he\'s very obsessed with veganism and this is the one exception he makes, I think the pineal extract he takes is from animals though not humans. I don\'t have proof of that, but if he is a cannibal I didn\'t see any evidence of it. </p>
<p>It is interesting though that he is very into Satanism, the occult, and Kabbalah though. I think this stuff is just part of the general cultural atmosphere of hipsterdom. Also apparently he believes (or believed, during his mentally ill years) in aliens. Which is interesting to me because I\'m personally convinced there is some kind of connection between the Satanic pedo rings and extraterrestials (I have argued this in a previous post). But if that does exist, I don\'t think he is directly connected to it. It seems like he is a regular guy with issues. Perhaps he was a victim of MKUltra style mind control, but I didn\'t see any direct evidence of that in my investigation. We should probably let this guy be, and move on to other things. (you can view his public Facebook yourself if you\'re genuinely interested). </p>
<p>Here are a few interesting snapshots of the Satanic/occult stuff, might be relevant as the kinds of things these elites believe. </p>

<p>Again, I don\'t think there is any direct evidence that this guy is involved in the Satanic ritual abuse cults, it sounds rather that he has an infatuation with the ideas of Satanism, but he\'s harmless. He might have even been a victim of MKUltra or project Monarch mind control - that could have caused his mental issues.</p>',

            Some good points, I need to check out that book. But he and Barbara Bush went to Austin High, which I believe is just a public high school (elites want to maintain appearances of being like the commoners). So he could just be a nobody that happened to gain her attention. I would be willing to dig more into this guy's background to see if his Satanism extends to being affiliated with these pedo rings in any way - perhaps as a victim. He did mention that the guy at Stratfor was a pederast. We should investigate that guy.
