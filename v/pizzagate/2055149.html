             I replied to the mod who deleted it since Cooper seemed to have been heavily involved in knowledge regarding secret societies (which are at the pinnacle of pizzagate) but im not sure if threads can be undeleted on here

              No I don't think they can. But I could be wrong. If you repost include a paragraph at the beginning with some previous Voat posts involving Cooper if they exist?

            I hate to bring the UFO thing up as it seems to upset people on here "taking away from Pizzagate" but I feel it links to Pizzagate as child trafficking is one of the ways the deep state funds themselves to cover up the existence.

            Aliens exist. For them to get here involves science we know nothing about. From this science comes
            <strong>
             FREE ENERGY
            </strong>
            . When the elite make so much money from fossil fuels why would they want free clean energy for us?

            I don't care who calls out Steven Greer as a shill on here I believe him .. this documentary explained things so well to me. 3 hours long .. is worth every minute to understand how PG is funded and ran.

             How The Secret Government Works

            . In this video he mentions John Podesta twice. He also gives and example that

             pizza places are a front for deep state operations.

            Anyone looking into Bill's work needs to look at his MORE RECENT stuff, not the older stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason?  He did a 180 on several topics, including
           </p>
           <p>
            "some involving extraterrestrial aliens"
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill was privy to the "Majestic 12" documents, which he initially (of course) believed were real.  He later learned they were FAKE.  Then he took
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the unheard-of step amongst conspiracy theorists
             </strong>
            </strong>
            of retracting his former statements on the topic!
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill told me that he believed that the only reason he was hired on with the ONI was because he had been a DeMolay member as a boy (even though he was NOT a Freemason as an adult).

              "They had brick for stone and Slime for mortar" Ever wonder what the Tower of Babel looked like or why Slime (Bitumen in most Study Bibles) was used to hold Bricks together? Why not use Ashlar Stones like the Cathedrals or Great Pyramid? What "Wicked Abominations" in Solomon's Temple cause the Glory of God to depart (Eze 8:8-16)? Phoenician Priests "Kahn Baals" taught Cannibalism which is the origination of the Word "Cannibal"; Why? To go against God's Covenant with Noah "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat" Gen 9:4 Slime is Secret Society Initiation and Blackmail, primarily the type that would expose Sodom and Gomorrah; this is why Sodomy is called "Satan's Sex" and why Sodomy is often part of Secret Society Initiations such as Knights Templar or Shriner's. I won't link to anything related to this; suffice to say Kundalini "Serpent Force/Fire" begins at the Fundamental Shakra (Anus) aka 3rd Eye, Eye of Horus or Eye of Horus (Yup, the one on the $US) using what else? Key of David. Blasphemous by design; Satanists believe if one Sodomizes God, they assume His power (Google "Rite of Hyena King Shemeber" if needed); for this reason sinless, innocent children are used. In Spirit Cooking, the term "Earthquake Nights" refers to Sodomy as a way of ushering in the judgments God used on Sodom and Gomorrah, Pompeii &amp; Herculaneum, Crete, and Santorini (Thera). Greek gods thus became gods through Ritual Sodomy, Freemasonry's "Best Kept Secret".

              Pizza Gate is the tip of the massive worldwide Iceberg artificially created to sink the Titanic, the "Constitutional Republic of the United States of America" as the Scapegoat for worldwide Babylon (Rev 18).

              Time Magazine declared Donald Trump "President of the Divided States of America"; their most influential person on earth for 2016 and has paid no Federal Income Tax in 30 years in a deal made with Jimmy Carter. Donald says "I have never asked God for forgiveness, I do however take Communion"; the Donald may want to read 1 Cor 11:27-29.
             </p>
             <p>
              Donald is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord in doing so. He said "Jesus is somebody I think about for security and confidence...when I drink my little wine and eat my little cracker I feel cleansed".

              Mike Pence regards VP Dick Cheney the ideal role model; Why? Cheney Live Streamed Torture video from GITMO, Poland's Blue Site, Afghanistan's "Salt Pit" aka "Cobalt" and Iraq's Abu Ghraib torture centers. Cheney aka "Mr Big" was identified in Senate Hearings as having an insatiable lust for Corophilia (Feces) and "The Most Dangerous Game" (Hunting and raping victims).
             </p>
             <p>
              Cheney's Chief of Staff Scooter Libby wrote "The Apprentice". Hollywood Reality Star Donald Trump took the name for his TV Show "The Apprentice"; Star Wars (Reagan's Operation Blue Beam was also called Star Wars) Apprentice became Darth Vader. Scooter Libby wrote about Scatology (Excrement of all types), Samurai Sex, 10 Yr olds copulating with caged animals including bears. His wife Lynn with whom he raised 2 lesbian daughters wrote "Sisters" an old west tale of lesbian love much like Brokeback Mountain. Deborah Jeane Palfrey "DC Madam" was suicided on May Day 2008 to keep her "Black Book" secret; Water Sports, #2 Sports, Diaper Trysts and Corophilia among Washinton Elite just isn't ready for prime time.

              Comet Pizza: Merovingian Monarchs were "Long Haired Monarchs" derived from Long Haired Stars ie Comets.

              Besta (Portuguese for Beast) Pizza uses the FBI Logo for Child Pedophilia. Both are owned by James Alefantis Jaime le Enfants "James loves Children" aka "Jimmy Comet" is a homosexual, pedophile lover of Media (Medeans were purveyors of Black Magick) Matters owner David Brock.

              Rehoboth Beach comes straight from the Bible, the Philistines of Gerar. James Alefantis calls himself "Pan", the Greek god of lust; Alefantis also likes to be called "FAGAN" derived from "Faggoter" (Person who gathers wood) specifically used in the Fasces (Faggots bound by Red Cord around an excutioners axe), a symbol used by Mussolini's "Black Shirts", Abe Lincoln's Chair, Oval Office Doors, Supreme Court Doors and Speaker's Rostrum at the US Capitol.
             </p>
             <p>
              The origin of FAGAN comes from a 2nd Century Bishop "Fugatius" sent by Pope Clement I to Baptize King Lucius (Lucifer)

              Little Red Fox (FOX:F=6; O=15=6; X=24=6 or 666) Jesus called Edomite King Herod "That Fox"; Rothschild (Red Sheild) is a name change from Bauer (Farmer=Cain); the Red Six Pointed Star and 666 Am Mein Frankfurt address should be familiar; we are dealing with a Cainite-Canaanite-Edomite Cult.

              Pizza Gate is no worse than Nebraska "Boys Town", Franklin Savings and Loan; Pizza Gate is a cover for Worldwide Satanic Pedophilia and Ritual Sacrifice.

              Madeleine McCann was abducted and ritually murdered in Portugal just 3 blocks from the home of Sir Clement Freud with house guests John and Tony Podesta; the grandson of Sigmund Freud, grandnephew of Edward Bernays (father of modern Fake News) even befriended the grieving parents. Sick? The theme of the Broadway Show Dangerous Liasons is precisely this type of Sick promotion of perversion and Sin.

              PizzaGate, TwitterGate, Comet Ping Pong Pizza, Besta Pizza, Red Fox Pizza and Spirit Cooking is a CIA/Wikileaks Dump Why Pizza? Pizza means Cake; Margherita "Daisy", is the final scene in "Salo':120 Days of Sodom", the Magnum Opus of the Marquis De Sade whose philosophy "Freedom unreastrained by morality, religion or law" is also that of Aleister Crowley "Do what thou wilt shall be the sum of the Law". "Let them eat cake"? How about Pizza? The saying attributed to Marie Antoinette during the French Revolution; she was living in the Palace of Versaille, famous for the Hall of Mirrors, a hall much like "Mirrors of the Future" in New York City (A mirror reverses the image; Jesus is the "Light of the World" and Lucifer is the "Light Bearer" aka "Angel of Light". Hankerchief or Banana Code signals may even date from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in 1897 BC.

              So, why would Donald Trump sit on 2 mating parrots with 12 Yr old Ivanka on his lap wearing butterflies unless to flaunt Monarch Beta-Kitten programming? Iran-Contra illegal arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi (his brother owns Herrods in London named after Edomite King Herod, famous for killing infants 2 and under) the uncle of Princess Diana's lover Dodi Fayed dated Jackie Kennedy after the assassination (50cal derringer round came from her); he is a partner of Mitt Romney's (Trump's pick for Sec of State) and the Mormon Church (Clear Channel Comm and TRIAD Building). He sold his $200M Yacht Nabila (named after his daughter; means Arab "Noble") to Donald Trump who renamed the Mega-Yacht "Princess", married his 2nd 17yr old wife who changed her name to "Lamia", the Libyan (Phoenician) goddess famous for devouring her own children. Recall an RJ-85 ran out of fuel and crashed, killing a Brazilian championship soccer team owned by Columbian Company LAMIA. So, LAMIA allegedly attempts to file and fly a trip 200 miles in excess of the aircraft's fuel capacity? Bull Shit The RJ-85 has an electronic "Flight Mgt Syst" this is patently absurd. The same day the movie Jackie debuts starring the "Black Swan" herself. How much more in our face can this get?
