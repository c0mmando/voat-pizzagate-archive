<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Founded in 1910, the Boy Scouts have kept confidential files since the 1920s listing staff and volunteers implicated in sexual abuse, for the avowed purpose of keeping predators away from youth. According to a court deposition, the files as of January listed 7,819 suspected abusers and 12,254 victims.</p>
<p>Until last spring, the organization had insisted it never knowingly allowed a predator to work with youths. But in May, The Associated Press reported that attorneys for abuse victims had identified multiple cases in which known predators were allowed to return to leadership posts. The next day, Boy Scouts chief executive Mike Surbaugh wrote to a congressional committee, acknowledging the group’s previous claim was untrue.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Chapter 11 filing, lawyers said that because of the organization’s 50-state presence, as well as its ties to churches and civic groups that sponsor scout troops, a bankruptcy by the Boy Scouts would be unprecedented in its complexity. It would be national in scope, unlike the various Catholic Church bankruptcy cases, which have unfolded diocese by diocese.</p>
<p>“A Boy Scout bankruptcy would be bigger in scale than any other child abuse bankruptcy we’ve ever seen,” said Seattle-based attorney Mike Pfau, whose firm is representing scores of men nationwide alleging they were abused as Boy Scouts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Boy Scouts have already sought ways to navigate the organization’s dwindling influence among American children — the 2.4 million youth participants the group claims now are about half the number that were involved in the 1970s. In recent years, the group has changed membership requirements to allow openly gay scouts in 2013, then openly gay leaders in 2015, and then expanding to allow girls to participate starting in 2017. But legal pressures have only grown.</p>
<p>Other organizations, including Catholic dioceses and U.S.A. Gymnastics, have also sought bankruptcy protection in recent years as they have faced sexual-abuse lawsuits.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts’ troubles have lingered for decades. In a 1935 article in The New York Times, the organization described having files on hundreds of people who had been leaders in the scouts but had been labeled “degenerates.”</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts’ charter from Congress, signed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, lauded the organization’s role in teaching boys patriotism, courage and self-reliance. More than 110 million Americans have participated in Boy Scouts programs over the years.</p>
<p>Under bankruptcy proceedings, organizations are able to halt lawsuits and then get a deadline under which people must file claims. Mr. Kosnoff said those are often between 90 days and nine months, but he plans to advocate a yearlong window in this case.</p>

            As far back as memory goes there were lewd jokes about pedo Catholic priests and altar boys, and pedo scoutmasters and boy scouts. Also raunchy jokes about pedos and other perverts at the BBC. Like Weinstein these things were open secrets snickered about by everyone and otherwise ignored.
           </p>
           <p>
            Strangely, there were few rumors of pedos in Hollywood. That gossip was mostly about who was gay and who was not — the who-was-not pool was very small. The pedo stuff only became common knowledge in the last 10 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the Boy Scouts the propagandists are once again dragging out the tired old, "It was only a few bad apples. It would be a shame to destroy such a wonderful organization."

             I find myself wondering, sadly, whether the BSA was, like the Mickey Mouse Club and all the child actor shows since, created as basically a feeding ground for pedovores. The fact that the elite have always recognized Eagle Scouts as a special mark of leadership among those who arise from the struggling masses makes me go hmmmm.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, they may have deliberately infiltrated and corrupted the organization to take it down from the inside so it would be able to oppose them, as ample evidence suggests happened with the Catholic Church.

            It’s like what the Vatican is doing to the RC Church. Load it with pedos so they have to pay out. Voila. Bankruptcy. They want to kill all that is good in this world. Boys need a place to learn the things boys need to know and be with each other. Without girls. The same goes for the Girl Scouts.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s really sad what has happened to the BSA.

              Disgusting. They don’t want girls to be girls or boys to be boys. Then they rape them and add the Planned Parenthood info to poison their minds further. It’s time for parents to take over and make sure they learn the old time skills. This is so sad.
