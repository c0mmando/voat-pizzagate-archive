<p>Awareness of child sexual abuse has changed dramatically in the wake of the Penn State scandal that resulted in the conviction of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky on 45 counts involving 10 boys.

Within weeks, another case surfaced: Longtime child talent manager Martin Weiss was arrested Nov. 29 on suspicion of child molestation. He pleaded no contest in June to two counts of molestation.
An examination by The Times identified at least a dozen child molestation and child pornography prosecutions since 2000 involving actors, managers, production assistants and others in the industry, based on court documents and published accounts.
