            Age of consent in Oklahoma is 16.  The NATIONAL age of consent is 17.   The only thing in that article I think that says what the crime is is tha the PAID him for sex and there was weed there.

             The child porn charges were dropped in exchange for the lesser guilty plea of paying for sex and providing drugs. Some of the videos Shorty lured the boy with were of a pre-teen girl being raped. Others were of pre-teen, and teen boys masturbating. Videos of the boy Shortey later paid for sex were shared with a child porn network. It's likely that the child porn network is no longer being investigated... it's the cover-up machine in action. So when you get on about the age of consent stuff, just remember he had been sharing videos of little girls getting raped.

              You mean that the headline's main point is that a senator was caught with an underage minor when in fact, he wasn't underage isn't kind of a big point?

               minors are usually under 18

               if you take headline alone, I would agree with your point, but if you read whole post

              <p>
               the fact that it happened days after he pleaded guilty to child prostitution and pornography charges

                I read the article.  My point of my original post (it's still there) is all that I could see that they mentioned in the article was there was weed and the senator paid him for sex... both of which are illegal but they don't explain the underage part.  My point of him being underage (though 17) was simply because I honestly, sincerely don't understand why he's considered underage when age of consent is 16.  I do know that when you're under the age of consent in Oklahoma there's a 2 year variable for 14/16 year olds but I don't think that is the case for 17 since 17 (and sometimes 16 depending on the circumstances) is national age of consent.  Since the senator is not an authority figure over the kid I wouldn't think it was related to that, which comes in to play in some states.  I was legitimately just trying to figure it out, not saying the senator did nothing wrong.  I think he's a disgusting fuck and the fact that he's wearing that T-Shirt kinda drives that point home for even the casual reader.

                  I sometimes have to work with this shit for a living so when something like that stands out I try to figure out why.  I have no doubt that it's accurate and that was what he was charged with.  I just don't understand why yet.  I'm in meetings for about 5 or 6 more hours so when I get home I'll find out.

                  My big hangup is when they call someone a pedophile for having sex with a minor who is 13 or older.  I always correct that.  WAY too many people use that word incorrectly which reduces the impact of it.  It's like calling everything racist or everybody a nazi.

              Fuck off, you triggered cunt.  I pointed out a LOGICAL FUCKING POINT and provided details.  Explain to me what he did that was illegal because according to Oklahoma and federal law, 17 years old is not a minor.  I didn't state an opinion one way or another.
