<p>This is important because this politician and charity operator is a direct member of the Clinton Family.  She is the mother of Chelsea Clinton’s husband.  In the same time period, her husband defrauded 11,000,000 million dollars, she herself decided to begin an international charity.  She also helps out in Haiti, as it is an international charity.  Her son recently in 2016 lost a huge sum of his investors’ money. Women’s Campaign International should be seen as a hidden Clinton partner in Haiti.  The money is in the same family.</p>
<p>“In 2000, she decided to run, but ultimately withdrew from the Democratic Senate primary …after disappointing fundraising, mother\'s illness, and legal trouble of her husband…which ended in several convictions for fraud. Shortly thereafter, she filed for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy judge stated… &quot;I find that the Debtor has failed to satisfactorily explain the loss of approximately $775,000 worth of assets (the difference between the $810,000 represented in May 1996 and the $35,000 now claimed in her Amended Schedule B).&quot; Sonders v. Mezvinsky (in re Mezvinsky), 265 B.R. 681, 694 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2001).”</p>

<p>Lissa Muscatine is a best friend of Hillary. Her bookstore is two doors down from James Alefantis Comet Pizza. She links to many power players. The Washington Post, where she and her husband worked. Melanne Verveer, a writing partner, who founded Vital Voices, a charity that covers Haiti, with Hillary Clinton. And a recent partnership with Andy Shallal,  an Iraqi radical who ran for mayor. (We do not criticize him for opposing war. We wonder why he wants to be mayor of the city that wrecked his homeland, and what he knows about this power block of secrets that endanger all researchers.) The Iraqi loyalist Andy Shallal, with a huge financial fortune, connects with non-profits that are biased for the Democratic Party and the Clintons.  Busboys and Poets is a primary non-profit business of his.  He owns other restaurants.</p>
<p>Teachers for Change is another non-profit connected to Busboys and Poets. All the teachers featured loathe Donald Trump, and his ally Breitbart. This looks like political propaganda.  There are teachers of all views who want to help children learn better.  Their volunteer work is disdained.  The other non-profit has the name For the Love of Children, which seems to be a useful and sincere charity. They work with vulnerable low-income youth, in Washington DC, and this website quote is odd, “… From our founding call to close a city-run warehouse for young wards of the state…”</p>
<p>The Iraqi Shallal has every reason to loathe the USA for the damage done to Iraq during the recent war. Yet he wants to be mayor of the city, Washington DC that devastated his nation, and also he also seeks to influence the minds of American children.  (Yes, he was raised by a pizza-restaurant owning family, refugees from Iraq.)</p>

<p>Susie Buell Thompson: Best Friend Hillary, Billionaire Businesswoman</p>
<p>A billionaire friend of Hillary and Bill, and active in Haiti.  She was feted at Roberta’s Café by her best friend Hillary.  From her own website, “A native San Franciscan, lifelong feminist and environmental activist, Susie continues to support climate solutions programs and create opportunities for women and girls as leaders and problem-solvers locally, nationally and globally. “  Her non-profit named after her is a partner with the women’s non-profit began by Hillary Clinton and Melanne Verveer, Vital Voices. All connect to Haiti, with a sole emphasis on helping women and girls.  Susie and her first husband did not even want to pay minimum wages to their Esprit workers, mostly blacks and Latinas.  Yet she claims she gave a fortune to the Clintons with no strings attached, because the Clintons are selfless themselves at giving to the world.</p>
<p>All of her links remain up, except one that we found a few weeks ago which was deadly.  She linked to a huge charity in the UK of global orphans’ aid, which we believe connected to Haiti. We cannot find that link. It even stressed how huge it was.</p>
<p>Vital Voices Global Partnership
<a href="http://clintonfoundationinvestigation.com/2016/08/09/susie-tompkins-buell-2/">http://clintonfoundationinvestigation.com/2016/08/09/susie-tompkins-buell-2/</a>

<p><a href="http://susietompkinsbuell.org">http://susietompkinsbuell.org</a></p>
<p>Susie talks about violence to women, and tries to raise money for her own foundation.  Not once has she criticized Bill Clinton for his history of abuse.

<p>Susie appears in a minor fund raiser for Haiti.  Other publicity we cannot find suggested she went to Haiti herself to help with orphans.  We welcome helpers.  “Funds raised will help rebuild the school within the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral compound in the city\'s center, which was destroyed in 2010 by the earthquake that decimated much of that already-disadvantaged city.”</p>

<p>Vital Voices, founded by Hillary Clinton and Melanne Verveer, began with both French and English names in Haiti in 1998! Melanne Verveer is also a close friend of Hillary’s speech writer, Politics and Prose bookstore owner, Lissa Muscatine, right beside the James Alefantis pizza restaurant. The three women are friends</p>

<p>NOTE: Seneca Women’s global project site expired on November 27, 2016, and they did not renew it.  It looks like they needed the money from a Hillary win.</p>
<p>Obama appointed Melanne to serve as U.S. Representative to the UN Commission on the Status of Women. From 2000-2008, she was the Chair and Co-CEO of Vital Voices Global Partnership that she co-founded to invest in emerging women leaders. During the Bill Clinton administration, she was assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to the First Lady. She initiated the President’s Interagency Council on Women, and was instrumental in the adoption of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.</p>
<p>“Hillary Rodham Clinton is the Honorary Founding Chair of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security. From January 2009 to February 2013, she served as Secretary of State of the United States. During her tenure as Secretary of State, Clinton launched the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security at Georgetown University on December 19, 2011, at which time she also announced the creation of the Institute. A lifelong advocate of women and girls’ empowerment.”</p>

<p>Vital Voices states it works against child sex trafficking, and connects with the Clinton Foundation and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It is in Haiti too!</p>',

           NOTE: Seneca Women’s global project site expired on November 27, 2016, and they did not renew it.  It looks like they needed the money from a Hillary win.

From 2000-2008, she was the Chair and Co-CEO of Vital Voices Global Partnership that she co-founded to invest in emerging women leaders.

           Vital Voices states it works against child sex trafficking, and connects with the Clinton Foundation and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It is in Haiti too!

            Clinton's on the other hand found a family just as fucking dirty as themselves for their daughter.
