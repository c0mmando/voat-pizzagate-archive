            Not Obama Foundation related - but I have "out there" childhood/teenage memories of pedogate in Chicago.   I don't consider these true unless I get proof.  I remember delivering pills and empty, pre-labeled prescription bottles to a woman working in a pedophile spa underneath Water Tower Place, for my father.   The woman gave me a manila envelope with cash for my father, hypnotized me and instructed me to hand it to him saying, "You left this behind.'  I do not know how old I was, it could have happened in the 70's-80's.  I don't remember much else about it. None of my relatives were known to be involved in anything like this.  The other memory is of The Drake Hotel, involving cannibalism, and other relatives who were employees/suppliers.  I think that memory is from the 1960's.  It's dangerous legally to bring up "not pre-approved memories" to my relatives I've found, so I have no confirmation of any of this--

              Good question.  I do not know how I knew the pedophile spa was one, I should probably try to remember.  I don't want to say the name of the woman I gave the pills, etc. to, in case I'm mistaken, but she is a fairly famous TV/movie actress from decades ago, and I "knew' (again I don't remember how I knew) she was made to work down there, in-between normal filming for her career, doing underground pornography while wearing one of her iconic costumes from a 1960's television show.  Or maybe just that day she had to do that.  I don't know how I remember this part, either, but she would fill the pill bottles according to their labels, and they would be delivered to a pharmacy.  Sorry I don't remember any details about the pedophilia part.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the other memory, I remember always wondering why I was the only of my family to stay with these certain relatives when we visited Chicago from the suburbs, the rest of my family stayed elsewhere.  I seem to remember these relatives' porch was a dropping off point for cannibal-related flesh;  I have hazy, super traumatic memories of being at that hotel with them and there was some kind of industrial machine in a kitchen there, orange colored in my mind's eye, and the memory has something to do with babies; there was some kind of a room service delivery there I was present for (I don't know why I would be there at all, or involved in any of this.)
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the porch drop-off's were from victims that had been killed at cult snuff parties, which were connected to the CIA/blackmail, which I have mentioned before I believe my parents were involved with.   I wish I had evidence for you.  Hopefully someday.

               Man, that got worse with every sentence. God, I'm so sorry. Have you ever done psychotherapy to unlock some of those hazy memories? I hate to say it but you might be repressing even worse memories of your involvement. It might be better to keep them repressed though.

                Thank you.  I did try counseling briefly, it was a simple process of she told me to just close my eyes, go back to that (whichever) day, and remember.  And to "stay inside of myself' because she said some people drift away from their body, so to speak.   I remembered a very, very sad memory of one of the few good hearted and brave relatives I had, all of whom are gone now, who had fought for me.   But anyway this social worker turned out to be seemingly involved with the cabal in some way, so I stopped going to her.  It was shortly after Sandy Hook, and since she believed about CIA snuff movie parties, I casually mentioned I didn't 100% believe the Sandy Hook official story.  She became angry with me, and told me she was friends with one of the SH victim's families, counseled at least one EMT witness who was deeply traumatized, and told me furthermore that she could take my notes on crimes of my family, who she knew I was in danger of, notes that she kept at home, and instead place them in her office files so that if there ever was a court order for my files the notes would be in there.  I just decided to not try to find any counselor after that.  But at least she taught me how to do it myself.

                It is better to keep memories repressed in some cases, I concur.  Someone who is an actual pizzagate villain took pity on me as a child once after I witnessed something unbelievably awful at Offut Air Force Base, outside Omaha, Nebraska (my dad had a lot of  business -regular business- in that area.  Maybe he brought me along sometimes, I guess, maybe for pedo blackmail.)  I saw live children being put into cylinders with wet concrete, as for large pillars.  I was looking down on the pouring, so I guess it was part of the supports for an underground area?  It really devastated me, and in the last year I remember this man advised me back then that if I can't remember something without creating* an alter, then just forget it.  (*might be the wrong terminology)  He also taught me how not to be traumatized by my older sister having me do the daisy petal "He loves me, he loves me not" game, where I guess she was reinforcing some MK I had endured.  Most would never believe Satanist Michael Aquino was more gentle to me, even though I was a God loving child, than my own family of origin.

                  Since I remembered that I never thought about how many children there were.  I just pictured it flowing,  conceptually it felt like a great number of children and I didn't want to remember anything else.  But when I thought about your question, "how many kids in the cement?"  There were three.  Still a triple homicide which is deeply tragic, but I have to say the number of deaths felt larger until I thought about it, and it's a relief to remember sometimes.

                    I don't remember him consoling me.  He just took me on a walk and told me some things to make my predicament better.

                    I'm in contact with my family yes, unfortunately, but not with pedogate people from the half of my life I barely remember --
such as M.A.  "Officially" none of this ever happened.  I wouldn't just go and contact Michael Aquino for confirmation.  People knowingly involved with CIA black ops are not allowed to speak of them or I think they get killed, right?  Did I read that somewhere? 
Besides, I'm not sure it makes sense, I mean I'm a pedogate researcher.  But I'm lucky he respected me enough to help me.  Thanks for listening and showing compassion.

            Interesting post. Makes you wonder what these folks think they are going to get out of these donations. Maybe Michelle running in the future.
