According to their website &quot;THE SEDONA FORUM is The McCain Institute’s annual, high-level, private gathering of national and international leaders held each spring at The Enchantment Resort in the red rock country of Sedona, Arizona.&quot; <a href="http://www.thesedonaforum.org/">http://www.thesedonaforum.org/</a></p>
<p>They aren\'t kidding when they say high level. 2015 participant list <a href="http://archive.is/Wr9oQ">http://archive.is/Wr9oQ</a> - 2014 Participant List <a href="http://archive.is/yBpWw">http://archive.is/yBpWw</a> - 
Just to name some that are pretty striking:  Lynn Foreseter De Rothschild, Evelyn De Rothschild, Tony Blair, HRC, Saudi/qatar/indonesia ambassadors, Gen Petreus, Demi Moore, Pres of NCMEC, former prime minister of Russia and lots of CFR members and even came across a trilateral commision member with ties to Podesta. I basically just started doing some digging on a few of the attendees and this is what I found. I suggest you guys look into these folks as well.</p>
<p><strong>David Miliband</strong> - President/CEO of International Rescue Committee. <a href="https://www.rescue.org/board-and-overseers">https://www.rescue.org/board-and-overseers</a> - I\'m not sure if any research has been done in this organization, but looks like they work with refugees and victims of disaster. Look at the previous link I included of their board. The board and overseers include Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Allbright, Colin Powell, Tim Geithner, James Wolfensohn from World Bank. David Miliband is also Trilateral Commission. Also interesting is that he works for Center for American Progress, along with John Podesta. Here is an article from Breitbart on David Miliband and he\'s pictured with none other than George Soros. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/02/01/david-miliband-create-one-million-work-permits-for-migrants/">http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/02/01/david-miliband-create-one-million-work-permits-for-migrants/</a></p>
<p>Here are two emails referring to David Miliband from the Podesta wikileaks emails: </p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58539">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58539</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17215">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17215</a></p>
<p>The first link was a dinner reminder with host David Miliband. And the second link was regarding someone reminding podesta about a conversation with a couple people, including Milibrand. Here is another article from the Center for American Progress that puts Podesta and Miliband at the same place/time. <a href="http://archive.is/j46Ef">http://archive.is/j46Ef</a>  I came accross, this following post <a href="http://archive.is/wA2Mz">http://archive.is/wA2Mz</a> - The person who wrote the post was able to discover that David Miliband, friend of Podesta...was in Portugal on Sept.08, 2007, the very morning the McCanns were being made arguidos, and questions were raised as to why he was there at all.</p>
<p>Speaking of McCann...her father Gerry McCann is pictured here with <strong>Ernie Allen</strong> <a href="http://www.gerrymccannsblogs.co.uk/Nigel/sitebuilderpictures/GerryMcCannwithErnieAllen.jpg">http://www.gerrymccannsblogs.co.uk/Nigel/sitebuilderpictures/GerryMcCannwithErnieAllen.jpg</a> - Ernie Allen is one of the attendees at the Sedona Forum . The participant list shows he is part of the McCain Institute\'s Human Trafficking Advisory Council and also the president of NCMEC. I saw a few voat posts on Ernie Allen, so he could be another person looking into. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1688257">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1688257</a> - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458188">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458188</a> - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1665583">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1665583</a> - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458188">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458188</a></p>
<p>Another person I looked into was <strong>Mark P Lagon</strong>. He was appointed by GW Bush as the Ambassador At-Large to monitor Human Trafficking. <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/president/62/ThematicDebates/humantrafficking/lagon.pdf">http://www.un.org/ga/president/62/ThematicDebates/humantrafficking/lagon.pdf</a> -  If what we know about Bush is true, then Mark Lagon, must be involved some way, if Bush appointed him to overseer human trafficking for him. Mark Lagon is also listed on the CFR Roster, which can be no good either. <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=L">http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=L</a> - Interestingly enough, he is actually on the Board of Advisors for an organization called ECPAT, which has been &quot;at the forefront of the fight to end the commercial sexual exploitation of children.&quot; <a href="http://ecpatusa.org/team/">http://ecpatusa.org/team/</a></p>
<p>I came accross this article going through the Sedona Forum info. <a href="https://www.mccaininstitute.org/events/road-forward-fighting-human-trafficking-115th-congress-2/">https://www.mccaininstitute.org/events/road-forward-fighting-human-trafficking-115th-congress-2/</a>  the moderator of the human trafficking event was <strong>Martina Vandenberg</strong>. Martina Vandenberg may be important. While searching her name, I came accross an organization called Open Society in which she was part of a fellowship program in D.C. More interesting than the possibility that their logo could be mistaken for a pedo swirl <a href="http://www.osf.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Open-Society-Foundations.jpg">http://www.osf.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Open-Society-Foundations.jpg</a> - is the fact that its ran by George Soros. <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/</a> - Here is an article from Center from American Progress which links Podesta to Open Society Foundations and Soros. Since its a non profit organization, I thought I\'d look up some info on it. Not sure exactly what the income means on a non-profit, but looking at the numbers listed here...income is reaching almost 1 billion. <a href="https://www.melissadata.com/lookups/np.asp?zip=open+society">https://www.melissadata.com/lookups/np.asp?zip=open+society</a> Thats pretty massive for a non-profit.</p>
<p>I know McCain has been freaking out about possible Trump ties to the Russians...but I find it odd that McCain is inviting russians to his private meetings. One of the attendees was <strong>Mikhail Kasyanov</strong>. He is the former Russian Prime Minister who got busted in a sex sting with his assistant. <a href="http://observer.com/2016/04/former-russian-prime-minister-caught-on-camera-having-sex-with-opposition-leader/">http://observer.com/2016/04/former-russian-prime-minister-caught-on-camera-having-sex-with-opposition-leader/</a>    Another Russian invited was an opponent of Putin and is working for a movement called Open Russia, started by ex-oligarch Vladimir Kara Murzam. <a href="https://www.rt.com/politics/376834-opposition-figure-kara-murza-out/">https://www.rt.com/politics/376834-opposition-figure-kara-murza-out/</a>  Why is McCain meeting in private meetings discusing foreign policy with Putin Opponents? Why is he meeting with any Russian, when he is calling out Trump administration for just speaking with any Russian. Is McCain on their payroll? Is that why he is so eager to go to war with Putin? </p>
<p>Why is there hardly any info on Sedona Forum, aside from the stuff they put out? I mean don\'t you think having Ambassadors from Saudi Arabia/Qatar/Iraq/ukraine/indonesia/belarus and many others...on top of countless cfr members, people working with soros, CEO\'s of major companies, associates from the Rothschilds, Jp Morgan, Lehman, and Rockefeller...would be worthy of some media coverage? But I don\'t see much. </p>
<p>This could bring up some leads if we can keep looking up some of the rest of the attendees and what organizations/NGO they may be associated with. That miliband portugal podesta connection might be interesting to look into also. Please share your findings!</p>',

            Why was David Miliband in Portugal on the morning of 8 September 2007?
I remember wasn't it on some home video of the McCanns?
           </p>
           <p>
            As Ed Milliband was classed as Gordon Browns pet project and David was Bliars it could explain a lot, like the missing link between SOROS and the family.

            quick note regarding David Milibrand:  He was expected to be given an important envoy job for US under HRC had she won, and would have had to become a US citizen to do it.

            of note: "The wider cache of emails reveal an apparent fascination with Labour infighting as the 2010 general election loomed, with Blumenthal sending frequent updates to Clinton on Gordon Brown’s rumoured reshuffles, the resignation of minister James Purnell, and Labour’s poor showing in the 2009 European elections."

            I would be willing to bet McCain institute is one of many CF CGI type faciliators of pizzagate/pedogate institutions with fake do good error names. If they have been in high office to a ripe old age and are filthy rich it's probably their reward to help run "the business" and why they all stick up for each other even on so called opposite sides. Now we know it's not just bribes for pay to play....they sell more than "access" to a politician.

            Has this information been forwarded to anyone with a credible voice and following. I've been saying that McCain and Graham don't have the balls to be as defiant as they have been...that something was owed to someone.

             It only makes sense they would need to control some of the sea for incoming and outgoing shipments. I definitely gotta look into that. Thanks for the info!

           <p>
            On 3 October 2011, Jibril announced that he would resign from government once the country had been "liberated".[31] He later specified this meant the capture of Sirte from loyalist holdouts.[32] On 20 October 2011, Sirte was captured and Muammar Gaddafi was killed. Keeping his promise to leave at the war's end, Jibril resigned three days later. He was succeeded by Abdurrahim El-Keib on 31 October.

             I had come across an article the other day on Demi Moore where she was into some sorta freemasonry type thing where she was appointed as the number 1 female in a highly elite group of 25 exclusive members. For the life of me, I can't find that article. Crazy...to think how much people we liked growing up in Hollywood...could actually be involved in some sick ass stuff.

            Never used 4chan, redditor or any of the other sites I see discussion on. Anyone able to post this thread on those sites to get more eyes on this and more discussion? The Sedona Forum could be the new Bilderberg and whats interesting is how this went under the radar, when the event is made up of some crazy powerful and wealthy people with aspirations of world government and other sinister things we prolly can't even imagine.

            Just wanted to share this site, that has helped alot in looking into some of these people and organizations. You enter a name or organization and it gives you a chart with people, organizations, events that the person is connected to. Very helpful. Not sure if this has been shared or if a better version exists out there, but here it is. Enjoy.

            Can you give me the link of the video that shows this Miliband in Portugal when McCann disappeared? All I saw there was an anonymous assertion that he was there with a mention of a video showing him there and I couldn't find the video. Thanks.

             I don't have any video. I had just posted the link which talked about the video. Didn't try to find it though. Also, as a heads up...It turns out McCann went missing earlier in 2007, the day he was there on Sept 08 2007 was actually the day the McCann family were made suspects.

            SongBird McCain made tapes for the North Vietnamese. I understand he was under duress, but then he came back and made himself into a big war hero. A decision was made not to prosecute the men who made tapes for the North Vietnamese or McCain would have had to stand trial. His wife at the time had been in a bad accident while he was in the prison camp. On his release, he went carousing around Washington and divorced her.

            Kudos to the Op for some brilliant research.   On another note under Trump 1500 pedos caught so far in 2017.  Under O'bama 400 pedos for the entire year in 2016.  So it would be interesting to see if any of these orgs. that go to the Sedona fest have any reports regarding how many they aided in trafficking themselves and how many if any at all they saved.

            David Miliband is British - he was an MP in the Labour party and the brother of the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who stepped down after losing the 2015 general election to the Tories. Miliband was seen as the more right wing, neoliberal of the two brothers by members of the Labour party but the UK media basically constantly shovelled the story that David was the more credible politician and that Ed had stabbed him in the back to win the leadership election. David then left the UK to go to the US.
           </p>
           <p>
            So D Miliband being involved with all these awful people is potentially a link into the infamous UK government/establishment pedophile network. Him being in Portugal in Sept 2007 (Madeleine McCann went missing in May not September, but that article states it was odd that he was there that day as that was the day the McCanns were made official suspects by the Portugese police) also implies a link in to the British criminal pedo/trafficking/fraud etc network - it was always very weird how involved high level British officials/PR people etc were in the McCann case.

            Hi, All,
           </p>
           <p>
            There's been lots of discussions that involve these not-for-profit (NFP) organizations, but I've not found where anybody on the forum here has talked about the tax returns for these not-for-profits.  The IRS requires that NFPs file some form of a 990 form each year to maintain their tax-exempt status (there are 990-EZs for simple organizations and the bigger 990s for more complex organizations).  These tax returns ARE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC INSPECTION.  Therefore, lots of organizations post them on their websites and there are other charitable organization ratings/monitoring companies that also make these returns available (e.g. www.guidestar.org).
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, the McCain Institute Foundation 's 44-page 990 form for 2014 is here:
           </p>
           <p>
            2014 McCain Institute Foundation tax return:  (
            <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/306548232/McCain-Institute-2014-990">
             https://www.scribd.com/document/306548232/McCain-Institute-2014-990)
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            What's interesting about these returns is that besides the income and expenses of the organization, they list the directors and lots of other pertinent information, like the names of organizations to which they give grants or make donations as well as people/organizations from whom they receive contributions in excess of $5,000.  If you look at this McCain Institute 2014 return, you'll see that the Royal Embassy of Saudia Arabia contributed $1,000,000 to the McCain Institute in 2014. 
There are others listed as well:  The Eranda Foundation from the UK -- I don't know who they are but they donated $300,000 in 2014
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, this particular 990 has a 23-page Investments Schedule attached to it which details, for example, how many shares in the HSBC FDS Hedge fund they own.  (Didn't I see a post earlier today talking about HSBC's link to money laundering for some of these criminals?)  All of which is to say that there's a huge amount of information on these IRS public record tax returns.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been trying to do some research on a few of these NFPs, which I will post when it's in better order, but for now, I want people to know this resource is out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the IRS website to find an EIN (Employer Identification Number) for NFPs:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?searchChoice=pub78&amp;dispatchMethod=navigateSearch&amp;pathName=forwardToPub78Search&amp;submitName=Return+to+Search">
             https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?searchChoice=pub78&amp;dispatchMethod=navigateSearch&amp;pathName=forwardToPub78Search&amp;submitName=Return+to+Search
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The search criteria requires you to put the name in quotes to have a manageable list (e.g., "McCain Institute" pulls up just the one).
           </p>
           <p>
            The beauty of having an EIN is that it's very specific, so it's easily searched on google.  For example, I entered the EIN for "Innocents at Risk" and the top five items were ALL pertinent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also these are usually available as downloadable pdfs so that helps in countering the disappearing-evidence problem that we all keep seeing.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, if people can get started pulling the 990 forms for all of these various NFPs that are tied into all of this, they will give us lots of leads to work with.  Organizations that don't post their 990s are supposed to provide them upon request.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sorry I can't take more time right now, but I will happily answer questions if anybody has any related to this post.  (I'm no tax expert or anything, but I do have a bit of familiarity with 990-EZs.)

              Interesting.  Does it seem like Obama isn't or wasn't in as deep as McCain and Clinton in these NFPs and shady trafficking organizations.  Not saying Obama is good, just pointing out that Rothschild supported McCain over Obama -- crossing party lines.
as well as Hillary over Obama.

            Someone mentioned that this represents a lot of illuminati. Well this the goldmine of illuminati. They are the ultimate secret society. Protect their bloodlines. Allow others in only if they give an "oath" They have chosen presidents for us. Anyone who stands up to them is assasinated think JFK

              Not yet that I am aware. They posted a video where they go back in time showing the Rockefellers knowledge of events before they occurred like 9-11. Also statements attributed to the Rockeffellers discussing their plans for a New world Order. They mock him about getting his 7th heart transplant. They expose many secrets of the bildebergs. Finally they post a video showing a group of anonymous going to the Rockefeller grave with shovels stating David this is where you will be soon.

              They tell him the clock is now ticking and he must start using all his money and power to help humanity or their files will be released.

               Very powerful video. They also hacked the Bilderberg Group's Website and defaced them. Looks like Anonymous is serious Resistance.

             I noticed mad dog on the list too. I guess a part of me was hoping he's still a good guy. Of all these people attending...they can't all be corrupt right? Sadly, I'm not so sure. But I'll give mattis the benefit of the doubt for now.

            Absolutely excellent work. Loved the way you laid it all out too. Agree nothing good about any of this and John McCain and "the Russians" is spot on. We should bombard McCain on Twitter with these Russian association questions, however, it will likely all lead to us being banned!!!

             Wow, I didn't read that whole article but surely the website the OP posted (w/ McCain plastered prominently on it) was up when McCain said this (denial) ... he must be stupid, or just "talk with fork ed tongue."

             Anytime 2 Rothschilds show up for the same event other than a party, beware.  Klobuchar, Heitkamp and Whitehouse?  Well Heitkamp is a lukewarm Democrat, but Klobuchar and Whitehouse are seen by many Democrats as true blue.  Hah!  I would love to show this to some of my friends, but they will never believe me.  What will be said there is bad enough, but the parties and meetings behind closed doors is what is frightening.

            Nice work.  Every day it's becoming easier to spot who's part of a criminal cabal and who's not based solely on their associations, their behaviour, who they protect/attack etc.  God bless the information age.  We're starting to tighten the noose.

            Just seems not be enough time in a day to research all these people! Adding to my  list! I would just add that this place it so small and secluded to have such a meeting of this magnitude there is almost beyond belief! The biggest city close by (3 hours if memory iserves me correct) is Phoenix. By the secrecy of this meeting that is exactly why it was held in Sedona so it would be out of the way of prying eyes and media.

             Sedona is a well known area in Arizona. It's a popular vacation spot. I think there's a lot of wealthy people from all over that come visit. And there's also a lot of weird hippies that live there that are into crystals and auras and say the place has some "energy vortex". Wonder if that has any significance to the supernatural aspects of the pizzagate crowd, or if they just like it because it's a fancy place that's convenient to meet McCain at.

              Yes, a great vacation spot and beautiful homes for wealthy people galore.  A lot of artists, art galleries, hiking, rapelling, crystals and vortexes.  There is a town not very far from there that a bunch of old DeadHead hippies have made home.  It is called Jerome. There are head shops, tie-dyed t-shirts, candles, etc.  That is what makes having such a elitist meeting in Sedona so bizarre. Makes you wonder for sure.

            Paul Wolfowitz was one of the attendees. Didn't george webb have a video on him? I remember seeing a picture of Wolfowitz recently on one of Webbs video...but not sure exactly which one or how he was involved.

              You probably did ... I just went straight to the member site, I hadn't even heard of this (but I've only been around here 2 months) and as I say Sedona was spooky to me 15 - 20 years ago so I never went though I wanted to. Great post.
             </p>
             <p>
              And as I said in my other comment I've known for many years this is a celeb hangout and 'retreat' but I didn't know about all the other people/stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for the post, this really stinks, sounds like the Bilderberg of the (American) West meetup. Great to have that list. John McCain for crying out loud, can't wait till he's busted.

               I've been researched bilderberg/cfr/trilateral commission over the last few years...but never has Sedona Forum come accross my path either. Very odd right...especially when you start seeing who is attending this VIP invite only club.

                Yes, it's surprising. You've shined the light on the cockroaches. It's one big club and we're not in it. It's personal for me 'cause they always take over the best and most beautiful areas :)  You should check the property prices there. Lots of elite visit there or have property there, I remember when Sedona started becoming quite fashionable, reminded me of Aspen or some like place.

            Sedona Arizona is a beautiful place but even when I was 'asleep' I avoided visiting due to the very spooky vibe I got from it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lots of celebs and nutjobs love the place. I could never figure out Sedona, and I used to get big glossy book sized magazines from them that screamed big money (probably another reason I never visited).

            Great research!  Thank you. The SuperClass can't properly control humanity by publically displaying their collusion and the one voice embedded within the thousands of foundations, NGOs, ThinkTanks, SJW Universities etc.  This is why they own the media.

               Yes, 100 likes if I could. This is the major hole in criminal law that needs to be plugged. I have always found that legal reasoning to be absurd.

             Thanks. Please read it all and do some digging as well. Having the worlds wealthiest and most powerful people in the same room talking a good portion about human trafficking and foreign policy...with zero media coverage...something ain't right. Its up to us to figure it out though.

Clinton is among the national and international business leaders, philanthropists and public figures appearing at the gathering, held in Sedona, the tony red-rocks oasis in Arizona's Verde Valley." - from WaPo
