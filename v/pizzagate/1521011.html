I have just started watching a documentary on Madeleine McCann (haven\'t finished it yet) - one aspect of this documentary focuses on Clarence Mitchell Madeleine\'s parents\' Family Spokesman. The film states that at the time of Maddi\'s disappearance Mitchell was head of Tony Blairs Governments\' powerful media machine, the media monitoring unit - inside the COI - Central office of information - on a salary in today\'s terms of over 100,000 pounds. Headed up a 40 strong media manipulation department costing British taxpayers several millions of pounds a year - after working for the McCann\'s for a year he boasted to a Portuguese newspaper L\'esspresso that &quot;My job was to control what comes out in the media&quot; . Before becoming the McCann\'s spokesman he had worked for the BBC for many years (RED FLAG) on some of the top crime stories of the time (Murders by Fred and Rosemary West, Jessica and Holly murders, Jill Dandos murder (all cases to do with pedophilia Jill Dando was purportedly investigating pedophilia when assassinated) and many more ...The documentary asks why a civil servant of such prominence in the Government was put in charge (on the 6th May 2007- 3 days after disappearance ) of representing the McCann\'s case to the public ?
Mitchell was allowed to leave a highly paid post as civil servant to work full time on the case? Mitchell manufactured or fed stories to the media about people of interest, suspects ect. Later Mitchell carried on working part-time for the McCann\'s BUT THEN immediately retained a job as a Reputation Manager at FREUD INTERNATIONAL. A company owned and run by Matthew Freud. The son-in-law of Media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The documentary establishes Mitchell\'s close relationship with the Murdoch empire. They also state that in 2009 David Cameron famously met Rupert Murdoch on Murdoch\'s yacht in the Mediterranean. HE was flown there in Matthew Freud\'s private jet. Weeks after that historic meeting Murdoch\'s newspapers  (the SUN and the Times) were told to stop backing Labour and started backing Cameron\'s party the conservatives to win the 2010 general election.  Mitchell was then appointed to help win that general election. NOw this is all stated in the documentary which I would recommend watching in full for more details on that which I have referred to here (19 mins in) and more on the Madeleine McCann case. 
Documentary - starting from 19 mins

What caught my eye in particular in relation to Pizzagate and Elite Pedophilia was that Matthew Freud is not only the son-in-law of Rupert Murdoch but he is also the son of Sir Clement Freud, Grandson of Sigmund Freud (interesting due to Sigmund\'s ideas on sexuality and particularly childhood sexuality and latent childhood sexuality)  and brother of Lucian Freud. He has been a chef, food writer, television and radio personality and elected as a liberal member of parliament in 1973 till 1987 and also received a Knighthood. </p>
<p>After his death however, it has recently been discovered perhaps a few years ago,  that he was a pedophile and child predator, sexually abusing young girls for decades. I have read some stuff about him in these forums and in news articles which show he had been in touch with the McCann\'s after Madeleine\'s disappearance and they had become friends as he lived near from where she had gone missing in the resort of Praia da Luz resort in Portugal. He hosted the McCann\'s at his home.  It has also been suggested that while he may have been away during Madeleine\'s disappearance the Podesta\'s could have possibly stayed in his home during that time (i\'m not sure there is enough evidence at the moment to confirm or deny this) . </p>

<p>It is very strange that Mitchell, the McCann\'s spokesman now works for Clement Freud\'s son\'s company.
Also Strange is that Clement\'s wife Jill Freud is said to have had an affair with a 16 year old the Artist Will Self\'s brother although he said the experience was positive.  
</p>
<p>I also recently watched a documentary called &quot;the boy with the henna tattoo&quot; -- which shows a gay couple and their child - they traveled the world handing their son over to other pedophiles to be abused. He was also abused by those he called his parents one of which was abused himself and was groomed into the manboy love ideology shifting from his role as boy to man later in life. The documentary makes me seriously consider whether Madeleine\'s parents we\'re involved in this kind of thing? Loaning their daughter out to pedophiles such as Clement Freud? or his elite friends? the man was very connected! Perhaps him and his son then hired Mitchell to protect their interests or those of their friends and then offered a lucrative job at the end of it all.

<p>Would love it if anyone could find more out about Clement Freud, his son, Mitchell and their circle of friends ( they seem to be similar in their status in Europe as the Podesta Brothers in America? I also think that we could look more into Sigmund Freud\'s ideas on childhood sexuality as people have done on Kinsey? Could Freud have been a pedophile or subjected his children to psychological experiments to determine if his theories had merit?? 
Sorry for such a long post i just wanted to get everything on here before i forget</p>',

            Just read "The Assault on truth : Freud's suppression of seduction theory". This is a massive investigation that Jeffrey Masson did, while he was working at Freud archives in London. The oedipus complex theory is totally made to serve pedophiles. Alice Miller, great defendor of children, talked also about that.

             I was looking into MPD tonight and found this, went to post and found your comment:
            </p>
            <p>
             (quote)
 MPD is hardly a new diagnosis. What is new (1996) is the unprecedented rate at which this disorder is now being diagnosed. Studied by nineteenth century psychiatrists, MPD faded into professional obscurity from the 1920s until the early 1980s. This was the period when the theories of Sigmund Freud had a monopolistic hold on clinical thought. Freud believed that incest memories were Oedipal fantasies that the patient confused for reality. The Oedipal fantasy theory diverted clinical attention from trauma-induced dissociative disorders until the early 1980s when this theory crumbled under the weight of empirical evidence that child molestation and incest is more prevalent than previously believed. The collapse of the fantasy theory reawakened interest in MPD and since then the number of diagnoses has risen rapidly.

             Awesome ! Thanks for looking into this I studied a bit about Freud in anthropology and some of his theories do seem to serve pedophilia - I think one avenue of research within pedo gate / pizzagate that we could look into is the evolution of pedophilia as an ideology within academia and politics- there are some documents from PIE (pedophile information exchange) that shed some  light on the matter - will share when I have read more on them - mostly these ideas revolve around lowering/removing the age of consent and that children are sexual beings , that some animals Persue pedophillic relationships so it is natural and that the harm from pedophilia is not from the act itself but due to societies belief that pedophilia ought to be harmful - academics are often highly adept at obsfucating language which often hides intentions and agendas - I also think that pedophiles will soon start to reveal themselves publicly as a political social movement so this type of inquiry may become more important in the future (though I know this isn't of immediate concern in the investigation )

            One thing I'm surprised no one mentions in the McCann case is the known connection to pedophilia: a british doctor who was present during the holiday social events one night overheard one of the men and Madeleine's father make a joke about having sex with Madeleine (in an obvious, horrible pedo way). The doctor later reported it to the police.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is discussed in Richard D Hall's documentary.

            There is way too much circumstantial evidence for the Podestas and Clement (and, likely, the McCann parents) to be innocent.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are all waiting for that final piece of evidence that puts the Podestas in Portugal at Freud's house on May 4, 2007. After that, I predict that the story will spiral out of control in the media.

            Yes, please post as much as you can about all this. The Chipping Norton set have been hiding behind their nouveau riches and media power for far too long. Out them ALL. Ive posted plenty about the Matthew Freud, Clarence Mitchell, Clement Freud, Elizabeth Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch, Madeline McCann relationships. They're all connected. Read too about the very suspicious death of Christopher Shale. One should also look more closely at the famous newspaper phone hacking scandals that occurred several years ago and see what theyre REALLY about. And just how many dead bodies have turned up because of it.

              Welcome. I replied to your other post too. Phone hacking scandal: needs to a thread by itself. Journos hacked into a missing girls phone and deleted messages. Strange connection to drug dealers working at tabloids and "not random" pedos who carried out a series of attacks in the early 2000s (Milly Dowler, Sarah Payne, the Soham Girls, etc. Popular journalists died of "heart attacks" (what a surprise) for knowing too much ...all protected by Rebecca Brooks, Murdoch's, the most savage attorneys in the UK - Carter Ruck - and assholes like Clarence Mitchell (McCann spokesperson...also used to pr for Mohammad Al Fayed.) Mohammed Al Fayed's son dodi died with Princess Diana as everyone knows. Princess Diana's brother is now married to Matthew Freud's first wife.
Yes, its all unbelievable. Dig dig dig and POST!

            I remember reading on here that Gerry McCann had some interesting items on his computer. There has not been any news about what they found. Also supposedly the mother said, when she realized she was gone "They have taken her".  Yes it is possible they gave someone access to Maddy but did not think they would take off with her. This does not let them off the hook, for that means they were prostituting their own little girl.

            Hi, there are about a zillion threads already about m. mccann. This subject has been commented on extensively. Start with the search to your right. ----&gt; use variations of spelling because not everyone here (me included) always use correct spelling.  There is also a pizzagate.wiki so more stuff might be there. Please add anything new you find. 
PS do you have any sources for the Will Self/Jill Freud comment? That may be new here.

              Welcome - great to have you on board. Please do as much digging as you can and post/share on here anything you find. I can't wait for the cunty Freuds and their dirty associates to be exposed. Why Sig Freud is heralded as such a genius was always a mystery. Disgusting coke addled pervert freak, with insane, damaging theories and methodologies that do worse than good. Anyhow I digress. Yes, the as the other poster said, lots of good stuff on the Freud/McCann links already.

            Very very interesting. It's funny you mention Murdock, he was mentioned by an investigator named Tory Smith as one of the child rape perpetrators shortly before dying.

            I'll try to do some research into the others. It's not unheard of for elite to trade their children in for power, wealth, and clout. Allegedly musicians do it often for fame/wealth, sacrifices. I've heard rumors Kris Jenner has done it with her daughters, loaning them out for a night to elite as well as other celebs. Possibly why they're so famous, I know it's definitely not their talent.  Amanda Bynes alleged it, and was labeled bi polar, batshit crazy after accusing her father of pedophilia/pimping.

             Ah thanks for the link will check it out! and yeah it's pretty sick what people will do for fame and fortune...i wouldn't put it past Kris Jenner also heard that that's what Paris Hilton did to get famous ! it's a sad sad world if all this is true but thanks would be great to know more about Clement and Matthew - they are also related to Edward Bernays - Sigmund Freud's nephew and father of public relations - apparently Matthew Freud has followed in Bernays' footsteps

              FWIW, I've heard on Hollywood gossip sites that before Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton became famous in pornos they were 'studio whores', they would sleep with rich Hollywood types for thousands of dollars. Also that they would go to the rich countries in the Middle East for the same purpose.

              For sure it was in the press a few years ago that some young oil sheik offered a small fortune to fly in KK and 'party' with her all night. I think she was already married but yet amenable to this, not sure what happened in the end.

              Nothing to do with child abuse but goes to the decadence of our society.

              I really despise celebrities because they actually believe their false glory.
