<p>Of course this could be unrelated, but after it being revealed how widespread this epidemic actually is, I felt it necessary to give this incident some publicity. I believe that the process of getting children is going to vary all around the world. The low level players in the game are most likely not given any boundaries as to how they get the children. There would be enough plausible deniability in place for the top dogs to always steer attention away from them so that they don\'t really need to worry about what the low levels are doing and how they do it. Seeing two cases like this that were so similar tells me that these two men most likely had some other motive than just personal pleasure. Would they have likely sold these two young girls off to the system, where the girls would be forever forgotten about? Who knows. Again, I don\'t know that this is connected, but I think that this could very well be a widespread method of getting young children. Think of it as chopshop situation for cars. Usually the chopshop has a few people who are in the know, and those few people in the know go out and find vehicles for them to chop up, and they get a couple grand or whatever it is as a finders fee. How easy would it be for children too?! Anyway... food for thought I guess.</p>',

            David Shurter's family, the finders cult, dutroux himself and many other seem to be involved in this aspect of pizzagate

            Some of them take the kids to make child porn and snuff films.  Possible the Catholic Archdiocese in Texas is involved.  That is the case in St. Louis Mo.  Check out Wolftrail7272 Posts.  I am helping investigate.  Thanks for posting and spreading the news.
