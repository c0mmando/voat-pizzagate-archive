Of course if you manage to watch him for longer than five minutes, you must have it on mute or have lost your remote control. According to a very close family member, this host/celebrity has raped multiple young boys. He is paying people off and many of the boys he has raped have been family members so it is a very closely held secret. The reporter is afraid everyone will be bought off before he can be exposed. So, send me tips to send to the reporter.</h1>

OUT THAT MOTHERFUCKER NOW! 
Anyone who has ever known him.
Anyone who has ever been around him or his show.
Hell, anyone who lives in a city where he\'s visited check around, especially on rapes of kids.
LOOK IT UP AND PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER in any city you reside which he\'s been to. Ask the proprietors of the joints he\'s shot at. 
Anyone who has known him or his hometown.
Contact his network, his sponsors, his producers and ask them to look into whether he\'s made payments to anyone - especially parents of children - to settle abuse allegations. If not? Why would they resist at least checking his financials and legal history? Nothing to hide right?
Bullshit.
BURN.
THAT MOTHERFUCKER.
DOWN!</p>

            Hope this gains some traction, BOTH of those actors in  that dive pizza shop ARE NOT WHO THEY ARE TRYING TO PORTRAY, you're looking at two hardcore predators. Alefantis ain't no simple pizza shop owner and Fieri didn't get where he's at without having to get his knees dirty.

            I ate in a meatball shop he went to. They have signed photo of him on the wall and his favorite meatball is an up charge. Lol. Got to say the food is damn good. Anyway the owner was sitting at table next to us. His teen employee came over to eat on her break. He was talking to her like a boss and a mentor. She was seeking his advice. Wife comes over sits down. They talk with teen about her grades and college. Next they invite solo Lockheed engineer who is a regular to join them so he doesn't have to eat alone. Great people. Really nice to employees and customers. Nothing Pedo about this place at all. Nothing. So I gotta ask....IS THE ONLY PROOF GLUTTONOUS FAT ASS GUY FIERI IS SUSPECT PEDO BECAUSE HE WENT TO COMET PIZZA ONCE...???  Pretty thin if you ask me.

            Thought the universe was collapsing and Guy was a demon that I had to become, and that all the ingredients were poop and blood and jesus fucking christ it was scary.

            Holy crap. This gave me shudders. That dude is banned from our TV because every time I see him running his big mouth, horking down food and...ugh...liking his fat fingers it grosses me out so bad I lose my appetite. He is an f'g pig. Like Dante's Inferno level gluttony. I have a visceral reaction to him.

             I always was grossed out by him too. Never imagined him to be a pedo and I'll need some more proof, thanks much. But yeah. Hate watching him eat, with the grease shimmering on his lips and multiple chins.

            You know what?  Fuck you retards up your anus with a hot knife.  Way to slander someone with absolutely NO EVIDENCE.  Personally I think he's an arrogant douche-bag and I hated his show but that doesn't make him a pedo. Neither does anything you tards provided. You pizzagatefucktards are off your meds.

And for FUCK SAKE, most of us know that nothing is set in stone. That's why this actual fucking forum exists... so that we can toss around ideas, see what others know, and try to put a stop to all this Luciferian baby fucking bullshit! Ya got it, fucker?????

            i think he's local (sonoma county CA or napa) but i don't know anything about him other than his name and that he has some food show. i don't go out much here so i wouldn't be much help. i hope it does come out if it's him tho. i know my brother saw him driving his car around this town once. i'll ask my bro if he knows anything else about him.

            Never would have guessed Guy, but also not surprised (rumors about sexual harassment for years). My bet was Shep Smith. Here's an interesting

            on Smith's ties to Epstein. Maybe Enty/Himmm will out him next.

            I wouldn't be surprised.  During his Comet PP visit, Fieri watched Alefantis prepare a pork loin and commented "won't lose with that loin," then appeared to read a sexual connotation into that and grinned slyly at the camera.   Juvenile creep.

             He always says shit like that. He will talk about broccoli like that too. Clearly he has a food fettish and is a big fat, gluttonous pig but I'm not seeing anything overtly Pedo about this guy.

            Guy is notoriously straight. If anything he's mocked PG because it was explained to him by the left, and he needed cover for his past homophobic statements. This story is a red herring.

            When the Bryan Singer allegations first appeared in Crazy Days and Nights a few years ago, I and a few others who named him were shot down as gay bashers and almost everyone defended Singer's actions as just normal Hollywood behavior-- you have to pay to play, basically. Now you look at the comments and I don't see a single person defending him. People are waking up and that's exactly what we need.

            Does anyone know if he has had any episodes featuring voodoo donuts? Red flag for sure if so. Interesting enough there's been a commercial that my girlfriends dad hates featuring the fat fuck talking about "how it all started" and this comes to light shortly after. He says it plays every other 2 commercials on food network. (((They)))  are prepping for the shit storm...

               The odd thing is they said he was just in two movies and had not reason to commit suicide.  Easy to push someone out the window.  There were some of those Investment people that jumped out of bldgs. in NY.   Sad.

                 I am sure that is what got him where he is and I really don't know who he was, but with all this outing of abusers, I found it odd that he committed suicide with so much to look forward to.   So very odd.

                 There was a doctor that jumped into a river or lake and they said he had a note in his pocket.  I thought it odd they could read his note after being in the water.  There were other things wrong as well and some thought he may have been involved in the organ surgery somehow.  He had a wife that was in the news bus. field.  Strange.
