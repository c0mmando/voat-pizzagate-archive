            There is another aspect to this story. Musk has stated the water level was low enough that the boys could have been swum out, yet the public were put through an incredible TV drama with boys carried to Ambulances and held in isolation from their families. There is a previous example where such a drama was made up for the public over a mine rescue, and it turned out to be slick state PR. That's what I see going on here, and accidentally or otherwise, the story is being unravelled by Musk.
           </p>
           <p>
            A similar drama was attempted in a mine rescue in Australia, where two miners had been trapped underground for weeks. In that case the authorities wanted to paint the miners as hapless little victims at deaths door that they would carry out on stretchers, very similar to how the boys were treated. They wanted to drug the miners up before they took them out, and rushed them to isolation in hospital. In that case miners were perfectly fine to walk out on their own, and just wanted to see their families, and certainly did not want a stay in isolation or hospital.
           </p>
           <p>
            An Australia doctor told them (perhaps the same guy flown in to drug up the boys?) that they had to be carried out in front of cameras on stretchers. The two miners refused and said they were walking out, and the doctor told them that if they did not submit that he would forcibly drug them into submission. One of the miners made it clear he would give the doctor a hiding, and they walked out leaving the medical workers behind, no doubt to the surprise and disappointment of government PR guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see much of the Thai rescue as publicity making much of the helplessness of the boys, and the genius of the authorities. The parents were not allowed to see the boys, and the boys who were perfectly capable of walking and essentially in good shape were made out to be helpless victims who would need rescuing by the "experts". They were drugged up, and then carted out on stretchers in front of the cameras to waiting ambulances.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if Musk is right, that those boys didn't even have to dive to get out in the end, but could have been swum out? It paints the whole rescue operation as a PR stunt. That is news that authorities cannot possibly allow to come out. Musk has bitten off more than he can chew here, and will be reigned in. This illusion of helpless victims, useless families, and "experts" saving the day appears to me to be a repeating psy-op.

            Those jews love Thailand and other known pedo spots. There's a jewtuber who lives there by the name of 108morriss108. I asked him straight up if he was a pedo on Live Leak. If I remember correctly he deleted his account there.

            MSM is all over him about this. No one asks why he said it. Is he really that stupid? I think he got triggered by diver Unsworths statement that
            <em>
             he can stick his submarine where it hurts
            </em>
            and that its just a PR stunt.. which of course can be true.. but Musk was like: ok Team, make a background check on this guy and I'll come back at him* otherwise, who would be so stupid to call the "hero" of this story a pedo?

             Yes. LOL. I think this was the first insult that came to his mind when he read the diver's tweet, and so he just tweeted it as a reply.
            </p>
            <p>
             Imo it's been only a wild guess, but then of course he
             <em>
              might
             </em>
             be a pedo, considering how many British pedos are to be found in Thailand. It's worthwhile looking into this, but we'd better be careful not to jump to conclusions too early.

                America is the pedo capital of the world. Thailand is a place where children are traficked, the customers are from America more than anywhere in the world. Meghans law website Orange County california. Go give it a spit, it is outrageous. The entire county are pedos. Are_We_Sure and Donkey are less tedious than the idiots in here promoting Trump, Q, and not knowing what the fuck Elon Musk is. You guys are still sheeple and they are worse than the occultis. Sheeple need to go and i love agenda 21 for this reason. Make sure you have wireless, and make sure you have a smart meter. Your special cupcake, and you might be going away.  And I'm cool with that.

               Not saying it's impossible that he's right, just pointing out that this seems to have been a kind of spotaneous answer to the guys' tweet about Musk's offer to provide a submarine.

            anyone that spends time with kids/teens in this capacity- taking them to scenic plates, playing around in new places, etc, is a pedophile. if they don’t have a specific function with restrictions (tour guide, coach) chances are they’re making sexual passes at your children.

            Weird. I also found it weird that none of the kids were allowed to see family once rescued. They were 'being kept away from their parents for a while' something to do with having suspected infections. I find that 'sus'. Were people ensuring they were getting all their stories straight first? If infections are an issue then doctors and nurses will be wearing protective equipment/clothing. Why couldn't the parents just wear the same gear to see their sons they're obviously so desperate to see?

            <strong>
             Vernon Unsworth
            </strong>
            called his British caver friends to help with the rescue.  Now they are being rewarded with a one-week vacation and a "Thailand Elite" membership that includes a five-year travel visa:

Published on Jul 11, 2018
             </p>
             <p>
              Mae Sai, Thailand: Schooled as a monk and now hailed a hero, football coach Ekkapol Chantawong is one of several stateless members of the “Wild Boars”, a team whose survival after days trapped in a flooded Thai cave fixated a country that does not recognise them as citizens.
Coach Ek, the 25-year-old who was among the last to emerge from the cave on Tuesday, has been lauded for keeping the the young footballers – aged 11-16 – calm as starvation loomed in the dark.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was the only adult with the boys when they entered the cave on June 23 until they were found nine days later by British divers on a muddy bank deep inside the cave complex.
As he awaited his turn to undertake the dangerous exit from the Tham Luang complex, Thais on the outside celebrated him as a modest, devout and duty-bound member of the Mae Sai community."
             </p>
             <p>
              "The UNHCR says Thailand is home to around 480,000 stateless people.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many are from nomadic hill tribes and other ethnic groups who have for centuries lived around Mae Sai, the heart of ‘Golden Triangle’ – a lawless wedge of land bisecting Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and China.
             </p>
             <p>
              – ‘No nationality. No country’ –
             </p>
             <p>
              Among the stateless are Ek and three of the boys who were trapped in the cave alongside him – Dul, Mark and Tee – the founder of the Wild Boars club Nopparat Khanthavong told AFP.
             </p>
             <p>
              “To get nationality is the biggest hope for the boys… in the past these boys have problems travelling to play matches outside of Chiang Rai,” he added, because of travel restrictions that accompanies their lack of status.
             </p>
             <p>
              Without passports they are unlikely to be able to take up the invite from Manchester United FC to visit next season."

            I think the key to Musk's thinking is in this tweet:
            <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/def184ad8f/124257.png">
             https://imgoat.com/uploads/def184ad8f/124257.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He finds it suspicious that a male Brit decides to retire in Thailand (a known child sex tourism mecca) and labels it "
            <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sus">
             sus
            </a>
            ."
           </p>
           <p>
            That was my first thought too when I learned about this guy, but so far I haven't found anything to substantiate it.  Could just be that he was a spelunker drawn to the cave systems in Thailand.

             "Musk tweeted Wednesday that "his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone." "

             Musk never said his WORDS were not truthful.....
Now he has researchers alerted.

              Mr Unsworth, an experienced diver who now lives close to the caves, was crucial in persuading Thai authorities to bring in UK expertise."

             Smart people don't get emotional and lash out in the middle of an argument with someone?  Emotional people in the middle of an argument don't lash out with anything they can use?

             I have no doubt that Elon Musk is incredibly smart.  But this is not his discipline, not something he has studied.

              He is a CIA asset as is Jeff Bezos. Musk has no talent, no ability, and exposed himself yet again as the hack fraud that he is. CEO's don't carry on like that. He is a front, a phony. Yeah, we are going to colonize inhabitable Mars in 20 years. Elon can't get anything out of low orbit, knows nothing about science, never made a dime, company losses 100's of billions for a decade, bankers buy his stock to prop his cash bleeding company up. Elon Musk, laugh my ass off.

               You're exhibiting the conspiracist's tendency to overreact.   Perhaps Musk is overrated, and deserving of criticism.  But this is not valid criticism, you're going 100 miles in the opposite direction, where he not only has no talent, but somebody else is responsible for his success and it's all a show.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is the conspiracists view of the mainstream media as well.  It's not they deserve criticism for specific issues, it's every single thing they say should be rejected and they all work as one.   There are people on here who reject a news report about a press conference from yesterday.  It's really a ridiculous view.  It's certainly not a healthy skepticism.

                Stop with labeling people "Conspiracist" and "Birthers" and other CIA wordspeak triggering phrases. Musk is connected to CIA's IN-Q-TEL. He has no space program. You are being a noob on this one. MUSK is deep state bullshit. Again, loses billions every year and is funded indefinitely, like CNN and NYT. Bad ratings, no subscribers, never go out of business. They serve a propaganda purpose, like MUSK serves an agenda purpose of the CIA's venture capital arm.  Sop with Musk, it is like pushing Alex Jones, he is entry level awareness territory.

                 This board is filled with what psychologists call Conspiracy Ideation.  Conspiracist is a perfectly fine word.  It's a person who supports a conspiracy theory.

                <p>
                 I don't think I routinely call people Birthers.....I would more likely go with Birchers if I was speaking generally, but the Birther conspiracy theory is perfect example of conspiracist thinking because to actually embrace the Birther theory you have to convince yourself of a conspiracy spanning decades.  Conspiracists would rather keep expanding their conspiracy to absurd lengths than admit the initial conclusion was wrong.

            I have been wondering ever since the story broke if this was a play by Q team or similar interest.Thai kids trapped underground. Too closely tied to the themes of PG. Was this a push for public awareness? Will we find out something else about it? Its really been bothering me.

             The amount of coverage is totally inappropriate. I think there's a kompromat going on here and a lot of British pedos are watching the coverage praying they don't talk, while the deep state media possibly blackmails them.

             Yea I also felt something was off about it as well.. I first thought they were being taken there to be traded or sold to someone? Then maybe our beloved Mother Earth has stepped in and said "sorry, not happening today"

              That’s a genuinely interesting theory! I’ve been watching this show ‘Zoo’ on Netflix (stay with me here) about the animal kingdom turning on humanity because their DNA is mutating and now the animals are attacking our technology and can even cause natural disasters. The mutated animals all have something the show calls a “defiant pupil”.
             </p>
             <p>
              BUT you guys in this sub may know it as coloboma...
             </p>
             <p>
              It changed the way the animals perceived threats. Who is a friend and who is an enemy.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know it’s just a show but I haven’t stopped thinking about it and how they use symbolism in media. I genuinely think you’re on to something with that line of thinking.

             "The constant excursions, however, had become an issue for Thinnakorn Boonpiam, whose 13-year-old son, Mongkol, is among those missing. He said his son would regularly come home as late as 9 p.m., sometimes joining his coach and teammates on adventures that included swimming in waterfalls and riding their bicycles into Myanmar.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I have asked my son to leave the team several times, but he wouldn't," Thinnakorn said. "I suppose he enjoys these activities."
            </p>
            <p>
             While he said he was sure the coach was "a great person," he still felt his son was too young to be going on such trips with just one adult."

             Yup, I quietly contemplated this from the start. Underground Thai kids... Too close to home for PG smuggling. Was this a tactic to push for public awareness? Already a movie planned...

             After reading the article ( 5:44), it sounds like this may be how some pedos in the area operate. We know they like tunnels and caves. The 25 year old "soccer coach" grooms them and gets them into the cave at the agreed time. The Brit pedo cavers happen to show up (remember the caver had "reserved" that day).  He then called on all his "other" caver friends to help rescue. It is decided to turn it into a big rescue operation, and they show up with their ready "expertise" and become "heroes".  12 boys would be worth a bit. The kicker is the "one-week vacation and a "Thailand Elite" membership that includes a five-year travel visa." In my opinion, as a Pizzagate researcher, THIS SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE.

              As usual your assessment of the situation is First Rate.  What a perfect plan.  And now they have groomed the entire world.  This must be exposed, for many people were given that Aw Isn't that a nice feeling, by MSM and they played right along.  The Sick Freaks think they cooked up the best scenario ever.  I watched it like everyone else, but I had a funny feeling something was not right, and yes the fact that the boys were so different in age and also the father of one boy saying his son went on outings with this adult by himself, well that is Pretty Sketchy.

              This makes sense ^^^.  I would guess that guy was more like the main operations guy.  One of his coyotes got lost.  Dead Thai SEAL got in the way maybe?  This could be part of a massive trafficking network and Unsworth was sent in for clean-up.  Or it was part of a distraction operation.  It got a ton of airtime here in the US.

                Cave diving is extremely dangerous.  Rescue diving moreso.  Or the SEAL discovered more nefarious underpinnings and they short loaded an O2 tank and got rid of him.

                  Musk said the first P trap was passable without SCUBA. I believe him.  Possible other passages passable without air assist as well.

                    Cave diving is about the riskiest sport there is.  I've been diving and I've been caving and never shall the twain meet.

              This makes no sense. What is the end goal? The team received so much publicity that they are untouchable. I don't think your hypothesis holds water.

               "The team received so much publicity that they are untouchable"
That's the goal for the pedos. I think this is a result of a plan gone wrong, and an attempt (successful) to turn it around.
Unsworth already had approved access to the cave before the surprise flash flood. This would have messed up their theorized  pre-planned tryst in the cave. The 12 (valuable) boys were assumed to be trapped in there (perhaps the "coach" had radio contact with him?) With missing boys, parents and police now became involved. The perfect cover and remedy is to become the hero, along with your other cave buddies. Kids recovered, original pedo tryst covered, great PR and a free 5-year Travel Visa- WIN-WIN! Now, why would a high profile billionaire with a high tech sub be squeezed out of the rescue attempt and he then goes on twitter and very publicly refers to the "hero" as a PEDO?  DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
