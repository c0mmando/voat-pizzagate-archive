<p>I located the following document: </p>
<ul>
<li>| title       = U.S.C. Title 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE</li>
<li>| url         = <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2015-title42/html/USCODE-2015-title42-chap72-subchapIV.htm">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2015-title42/html/USCODE-2015-title42-chap72-subchapIV.htm</a></li>
<li>| archiveurl  = <a href="http://archive.fo/288lG">http://archive.fo/288lG</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It lists extensive information regarding rules and regulation correlating to the NCMEC, including polices regarding government funding of the agency via grants etc. Probably good to have some awareness of this so as to potentially detect loopholes within the regulations and oversight, whether intentional or unintentional. </p>
<p>I also ran into this document which I found interesting. It\'s called the KEVIN AND AVONTE’S LAW OF 2016: </p>
<ul>
<li>| title       = Senate Report 114-397 - KEVIN AND AVONTE\'S LAW OF 2016</li>
<li>| url         = <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114srpt397/html/CRPT-114srpt397.htm">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114srpt397/html/CRPT-114srpt397.htm</a></li>
<li>| archiveurl  = <a href="http://archive.fo/GSDyI">http://archive.fo/GSDyI</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To give a gist of as to what this Act is about and as you shall see just as to why it caught my attention: </p>
<p>The document states: </p>
<p><em>&quot;Kevin and Avonte\'s Law updates and expands this expired 
program, authorizing $2 million per year to cover not only 
those with dementia but also those with developmental 
disabilities. The legislation calls for the Attorney General to 
award grants to assist eligible applicants in developing and 
operating locative tracking technology programs. The locative 
tracking technology would be used solely to assist in the 
recovery of children with developmental disabilities in the 
event of separation from parents or caregivers. The bill also 
would change the name of the program to the ``Missing Americans 
Alert Program.\'\' Under this legislation, participation in such a locative 
tracking technology program would remain entirely voluntary. 
The Committee intends that a guardian or parent, in 
consultation with that child\'s health care provider, would make 
any decisions about whether or not to accept a tracking device 
for their child, and any such device should be the least 
restrictive option available to help locate the child in the 
event of a crisis. (Nothing in this Act would require use of 
tracking technology if a parent or guardian does not believe 
that use of such a device is not necessary or in the child\'s 
interest.) The Committee further intends that tracking devices 
assigned to children under this program should be limited to 
non-invasive, non-permanent devices that do not create an 
external or internal marker or involve the implantation of a 
device or other trackable items.&quot;</em></p>
<p>It\'s actually quite interesting to note, that during the re-authorization of this act, there was an amendment made, quoted as following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(1) in the section header, by striking “ALZHEIMER\'S DISEASE PATIENT” and inserting “AMERICANS”</em></p>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<p>I found that to be an interesting change. I wonder how broadly this can now be stretched out to where you could possibly do the implants legally given they are done low key and away from public scrutiny. </p>
<p>I just found it intriguing, since just recently there was a post made on voat about a human trafficking victim who was found have an RFID chip implanted in the victim\'s side. </p>
<p>I wonder who is doing the implanting under this act and what sort of technology or devices they are utilizing for tracking purposes. I wonder if they are perhaps using the very same make and model - RFID chip which was potentially found implanted in this victim. </p>
<p>I think those good questions to raise and they may very well lead to more interesting findings and help to further make sense out PedoGate and its operations. </p>
<p>Another interesting thing to note is what is stated under the limitations of this program: </p>
<p>*&gt;(d) Limitations On Program.—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) DATA STORAGE.—Any tracking data provided by tracking devices issued under this program may not be used by a Federal entity to create a database.
(2) VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION.—Nothing in this Act may be construed to require that a parent or guardian use a tracking device to monitor the location of a child or adult under that parent or guardian’s supervision if the parent or guardian does not believe that the use of such device is necessary or in the interest of the child or adult under supervision.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it interesting that under this section, there are listed absolutely no disease specific restrictions, which in my opinion would prevent from possibly parents, guardians, adoptive legal parents from potentially misusing or abusing this. I don\'t know. Maybe I\'m misinterpreting it. I just thought something of that sort would be listed under the limitations sections. </p>
<p>Also another thing which is interesting to note is the involvement of the NCMEC within this program as stated within the Act. </p>
<p>Also yet another interesting thing to note is, the person who sponsored the amendment of the Act:  
</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Charles E. Schumer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Co-Sponsors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Richard Burr</li>
<li>Christopher A. Coons  ----- <em>hmmm... Intersting last name</em></li>
<li>Richard J. Durbin</li>
<li>Chuck Grassley</li>
<li>Amy Klobuchar</li>
<li>Bill Nelson</li>
<li>Thom Tillis</li>
</ul>
<p>The details on the original proposal of the bill can be found here: </p>

<p>I\'m curious as to what his motivation was behind it. I highly doubt it was for noble reasons although no doubt it was pawned off under noble pretenses. I have a difficult time believing it because quite frankly I believe Chuck Schummer is an evil serpent. </p>
<p>This lead may possible illuminate greater details about the extent to which Chuck Schummer has ties to activities disclosed within the findings of PedoGate research. </p>
<p>I\'m going to continue digging into this further, but due to work, I do face challenging time constraints. Hence wanted to share this everyone so that those who possibly able to contribute can do so. </p>
<p>Also another interesting aspect which would be crucial to explore is:CPS and Foster Care System and the use of this program [of tracking implants] in correlation with children in the custody of the state.</p>
<p>I can see quite a massive potential for misuse and abuse of these provisions within these two particular areas.</p>',

           I'm going to continue digging into this further, but due to work, I do face challenging time constraints. Hence wanted to share this everyone so that those who possibly able to contribute can do so.
          </p>
          <p>
           Also another interesting aspect which would be crucial to explore is:CPS and Foster Care System and the use of this program [of tracking implants] in correlation with children in the custody of the state.
          </p>
          <p>
           I can see quite a massive potential for misuse and abuse of these provisions within these two particular areas.

            Tours and travel where children are in transportation is when they would be chipped. Chips have short range have to be read close by like a bus gate when you get on a bus. Or the longer range chip with a battery you can change out. They are working on making the rice sized chip more organic so to grow fiber and stay fixed, not to migrate around like nowadays.  There are cameras and microphones  on every bus. Seon is investing in rfid technology to guard kids sgainst bullies on the busses. Seon is the largest transportation surveilance company in the country. They use cameras and microphones and are working on chips. Seon, out of Virginia. Gee that's another strange thing. The state where the most state of the art child tracking and surveilance company is headquartered is also the state with the highest numbers per capita missing kids are in the whole country. Seon draws attention to itself because it uses a traffic danger sign, a black exclamation mark inside a yellow triangle, out of context.

            Just to add the company listed as involved Planitar is a government company specifically involved in intelligence agencies. Combined with Podesta group alone much less now that we were made aware that Brian Podesta is in leadership with a top secret clearance an obvious government employee this needs exposure now.

            Co Sponsor Richard J. Durbin, never a good sign! 
Also with the number of potential children this law is aimed at, $2 million dollars is not going to go that far. But it's a different story if the program is really meant to be used for nefarious purposes.

            Once a child is in cps custody, all you need is a diagnosis.  Then cps can chip without impunity. Scary thoughts.

            Does anyone know the percentage of children that go missing while in the legal custody of adoptive or foster parents compared to this of the biological parents?  I think this might be a very important clue.

              Oh and check these stories on CPS and their kidnappings of children (for various reasons, including medical research and experiments). That's probably why we don't hear more parents cry out that their children are missing! 
We do hear loads of stories about how CPS kidnapped children from their parents on baseless grounds however.

            Giving you a "Potential Lead" flair -- perhaps folks will be motivated to dig deeper into who makes sure NCMEC isn't involved in child trafficking, as well as how widespread the tracking device program is.

             I really think the NCMEC should be the subject of intense focus of the greater PG investigation.  It looks like the nerve center of the federal child trafficking network.

              I couldn't agree more. The way Twitter started permanently banning users left and right asking questions about why Brian Podesta needed a Top Secret Security Clearance for an IT job at NCMEC was a huge red flag. Sumpin ain't right, fer sure.

            If we could find out by whom and where RFID's are made we may be able to find out numbers (hopefully excluding for animals).  By knowing numbers and where they end up could help discover the scale.

             I remember watching the movie Zeitgeist back in 2007, where there was a short clip of Diane Sawyer (2005) talking about a couple who had their child chipped! It's been going on for a while.

            Last night someone posted victims' answers to a congressional hearing on ritual abuse.  One of the victims recalled hearing either Dr Green, Gottlieb or one of the other doctors saying that accounting for disabled children whom they had abused/killed was the least of their problems because those children don't talk.
