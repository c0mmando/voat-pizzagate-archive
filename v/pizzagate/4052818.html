<p>An international team of lawyers out of Germany specializing in corporate fraud are launching a class action suit in the US against a German Covid PCR test manufacturer, arguing the facts show they participated in Crimes against Humanity. The video discusses collusion between vaccine makers and government health agency decision-makers in Germany going back to the H1N1 Swine Flu, which led to a vaccine that caused over 700 German kids to become permanently disabled by narcolepsy. I consider this pizzagate-related due to Covid19 being used as a reason to remove children from their homes in multiple countries, as well as multiple Coronavirus vaccines in development based on cell lines <a href="https://www.pop.org/which-covid-19-vaccines-are-being-developed-with-fetal-cell-lines-derived-from-aborted-babies/">harvested from aborted babies</a>. It\'s a long video, but he lays out tons of data showing the scope of the deception perpetrated against the people of the world.</p>

<p>“Since July 10, 2020 this committee has been listening to a large number of international scientists and experts testimony to find answers to questions about the corona crisis — which more and more people worldwide are asking... </p>
<p>This corona crisis, according to all we know today, must be renamed a corona scandal. And those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. On a political level, everything must be done to ensure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas.</p>
<p>And for this reason, I will now explain to you how and where an international network of lawyers will argue this biggest tort case ever, the corona fraud scandal, which has meanwhile unfolded into probably the greatest crime against humanity ever.”</p>

<h2 id="md-dr.-reiner-fuellmich-attorney">Dr. Reiner Fuellmich, attorney</h2>
<p>Here\'s his web page: <a href="https://www.fuellmich.com/">https://www.fuellmich.com/</a> and <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=https://www.fuellmich.com/dr-reiner-fuellmich/&amp;prev=search&amp;pto=aue">his bio</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Reiner Fuellmich was born and raised in Bremen. He attended school in Bremen and Farmington Hills, Michigan. He completed his law studies at the Georg-August University in Göttingen and in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Among other things, he worked as a research assistant at the law faculty of the Georg-August University in Göttingen, where he did his doctorate. Before joining the law firm Dr. Fuellmich, he worked in the corporate banking business of Deutsche Bank in Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>Dr. Fuellmich has published various articles and books in the fields of banking law, medical law and international private law and has taught as a professor and lecturer at universities in Germany and Estonia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.faktor-magazin.de/kanzlei-dr-fuellmich-associates-gehoert-zu-den-top-20/">Here</a> is what appears to be a German regional trade magazine in 2009, lauding Fuellmich as a top consumer protection attorney.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="md-law-firm-dr.-fuellmich--associates-is-among-the-top-20">Law firm Dr. Fuellmich &amp; Associates is among the top 20</h2>
<p>Tested by Wirtschaftswoche, it was named one of the top 20 investor protection law firms in Germany. Test criteria were process success, the frequency of comparative discussions, experience, quality of the office team as well as the seriousness of the client acquisition and marketing.</p>
<p>Wirtschaftswoche writes: “The Göttinger is a specialist for those who have suffered damage from so-called“ scrap real estate ”. He asserts their claims against the buyer of the overpriced real estate as well as the subscriber of shares in various real estate funds.</p>
<p>In addition, Fuellmich also represents numerous investors who have become victims of the financial crisis, especially those who have unknowingly acquired highly speculative certificates.</p>
<p>Fuellmich has excellent international networks, speaks five foreign languages ​​and is first choice, especially when good US contacts are helpful in enforcing claims. &quot;</p>
<p>The law firm based in Nikolausberg, which specializes in consumer protection in the area of ​​capital investment law, has been representing the legal interests of cheated investors across Germany towards German banks for more than 15 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He apparently once worked for Deutsche Bank, but has since published papers on legal fraud there and appears to have led litigation against them in recent years. Couldn\'t really tell from his site. Google wouldn\'t translate the pdfs, but perhaps a German speaker could summarize them?</p>
