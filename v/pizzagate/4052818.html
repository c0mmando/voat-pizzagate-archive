<p>An international team of lawyers out of Germany specializing in corporate fraud are launching a class action suit in the US against a German Covid PCR test manufacturer, arguing the facts show they participated in Crimes against Humanity. The video discusses collusion between vaccine makers and government health agency decision-makers in Germany going back to the H1N1 Swine Flu, which led to a vaccine that caused over 700 German kids to become permanently disabled by narcolepsy. I consider this pizzagate-related due to Covid19 being used as a reason to remove children from their homes in multiple countries, as well as multiple Coronavirus vaccines in development based on cell lines <a href="https://www.pop.org/which-covid-19-vaccines-are-being-developed-with-fetal-cell-lines-derived-from-aborted-babies/">harvested from aborted babies</a>. It\'s a long video, but he lays out tons of data showing the scope of the deception perpetrated against the people of the world.</p>

<p>“Since July 10, 2020 this committee has been listening to a large number of international scientists and experts testimony to find answers to questions about the corona crisis — which more and more people worldwide are asking... </p>
<p>This corona crisis, according to all we know today, must be renamed a corona scandal. And those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. On a political level, everything must be done to ensure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas.</p>
<p>And for this reason, I will now explain to you how and where an international network of lawyers will argue this biggest tort case ever, the corona fraud scandal, which has meanwhile unfolded into probably the greatest crime against humanity ever.”</p>

<p>He apparently once worked for Deutsche Bank, but has since published papers on legal fraud there and appears to have led litigation against them in recent years. Couldn\'t really tell from his site. Google wouldn\'t translate the pdfs, but perhaps a German speaker could summarize them?</p>
