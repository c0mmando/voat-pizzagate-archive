            It can be proven easily with a gang of buddies that flat-earth is trash to keep us occupied. Don't further discuss it; but if you want to prove it for yourself, here's how- and what to do:

            While I personally do not believe the Earth to be flat I have walked away from the Flat Earth debate with some thought provoking ideas from the theory. Things that make me scratch my head would include; why does it seem like all independent or amateur space exploration is always obstructed by governments OR simply fails entirely (explosions, tech difficulties, etc -&gt; This video comes to mind
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAcp3BFBYw4.">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAcp3BFBYw4.)
            </a>
            ). It should also be very obvious to anyone in here that NASA is a massive FRAUD. Operation Fishbowl makes me wonder. International flight patterns can partially lend to the theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Things that make thing FE is absurd would include; I could have sworn I have seen slight curvature of the earth whilst flying in to Hawaii about a decade or so ago.  Sunsets and Sunrises!! Explain moonlight is FE is true..
           </p>
           <p>
            All things considered,  I personally think FE society folks are often time overly criticized for their beliefs. At this point I have met enough FE people who I believe to be very intelligent people and mean well.  Is it possible FE is a massive Psyop/distraction? Sure it is possible,  but I am not convinced on that either.  Just like i am not convinced on FE.

            This is a thread created to make flat earth look stupid. Ive seen this all over /x/ its not that clever if you seen it a hundred times.

           <p>
            Also this thread has been out 1.4 hours why is it still here? Is it because the mods support the disinfo?

             Yes, the complicit VOAT and its mods realize their obscure stifling of research is being noticed by good people here and as a last retort, they now begin pushing flat-earth crap.

             is an easy way to prove earth is not flat for anyone inclined to run an experiment to prove for themselves.

               You honor your accountname lol. The picture isn't "proof". The picture is an "instruction" to "obtain" "proof". Working with definitions and logic aren't the strongest traits of shills, proven time and time again.

            Dude you're shilling for child rapists and organ harvesters. That's fucked up. This isn't a joke. You're either a shill or a complete fucking idiot.
           </p>
           <p>
            In case you're an idiot the Flat Earth hoax is disinformation put out to marginalize conspiracy theorists which DING DING DING is a term the CIA invented in the first place to get people to ignore George H.W. Bush making black budget money by selling crack cocaine to black people.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you ARE a shill then just go and fucking die. This isn't a joke. Go find out what the Bush/Clinton Crime Family has been up to all these years:

             Why don't you have a look at the videos I posted and come back with a critical response? I've been here a while so...this is a lot of build up to start shilling. Not to say it's not possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can't prove who is a shill and who is not, but why don't you take a look at the info and form a valid critique of the info. I will rebuddle.

            The argument for it is pretty vast. Lot of research + sources. The main part seems getting past the bad science + vast amount of propaganda put out over the years.

            I'll rec two documentaries:
           </p>
           <p>
            [6 hour]
            <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GhRiLP32qfs">
             https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GhRiLP32qfs
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            [32min]
            <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=debcXgOi0T0">
             https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=debcXgOi0T0
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The 6 hours is the best, but the 32min is a great intro. Come back with any questions.

             okay so I watched the 30 minute one and will continue researching. My biggest reservation is: motive. What would motivate TPTB to attempt pull off this ASTRONOMICAL(no pun intended) deception?

            <p>
             EDIT: Also, couldn't FE easily be tested by 2 people video recording the constellations, one from the Southern Hemisphere and one in the north?
