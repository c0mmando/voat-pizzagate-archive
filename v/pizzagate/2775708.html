             Yup,  unfortunately I think you're right. Not to mention seems like Assange was possibly "neutralized" as we have not been given a solid proof of life since basically Nov 2016.... What are your thoughts on that?

           <p>
            This is utter nonsense and there's not a single use of code in the Podesta emails.  This suggestion of this code came from a single anonymous user.  It was a hoax pure and simple.   For example what do you think pasta with walnut sauce means?
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically the emails were so boring with some embarrassing political high jinks here and there, that people had to make up a scandal.  And they did and people bought it.

             Apparently resident shill AWS thinks that is not code word.  Showing once again, AWS is either retarded or full blown spirit-cooking shill!

              It's absolutely not code.  It's an odd phrasing but make clear sense in its context.

              is not evidence.  Your suspicion is not evidence,  In fact, you're engaging in a common logical fallacy called argument from incredulity.

               "odd phrasing but make clear sense in this context"
Ok?! What context. Please explain how the odd phrasing makes clear sense. 
I'll bet you can't. Because your full of shit. You just make statements like this all the time as the shill pedo apologist you clearly are. It's such an obvious tactic. You say their is no evidence of such and such, when there is.. and then you say there is evidence to support your stance, but you don't cite that evidence. Yawn.

                .  Wake up everyday and take instructions from your deep state handler on how to try and discourage people from researching this very real issue.  Even though I resent AWS's actions I still pray for their soul.  I imagine that Are_we_sure probably got sucked into this whirlwind via some other, possibly unrelated, circumstance and before they knew it they were trying to help cover up these unspeakable actions of our global "leaders".  What a shitty life to live!  I truly feel sorry for you AWS!

             I absolutely agree with your comment. I guess I am guilty of getting a little frustrated during this whole process and investigation (or lack thereof).

             In retrospect,  I should have titled this post "IMPORTANT REMINDER! Wikileaks is a VERY credible source of info!"  You are 100% right,  we should never put 100% faith into any system of information in this day and age. Everything and everyONE is always going to be subject to corruption at some form or another at some point in time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further more,  Assange's stance on the 9/11 "conspiracies" is concerning to say the least.   Thank you for the thought provoking and critical analysis of this post.  I really do agree with your comment.

              I'm glad I took a step back and approached it, both of us, in the right way. Makes me feel good about keeping up the fight on this forum and out in the street. Also, I'll take a good long look at your links in the post so I get even more info to arm myself. Guess the only thing that is one hundred is that we wants these filth eradicated...

              Nonbeliever in what? Read what I wrote it's quite simple. Nothing is one hundred percent reliable. That is a fact of life. I also said I'm not discounting the post. To say that an online source,  started by people we have never met is one hundred percent reliable is false. I didn't make the statement. The burden of proof to show one hundred percent reliability isn't on me. Of course WikiLeaks and many other sources of information have given us a lot. But they are not one hundred percent reliable.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, am I a nonbeliever of what?

               I'm glad to see reasonable debate still goes on.

               is right in that no "intelligence", evidence, or information is every 100%.  It may be 99.5%, but there is always the "freak factor".  The one random thing no one considered.
              </p>
              <p>
               Using your choice of analytic methods, they will all come back saying the likelihood of disinformation is high (90%), but it's penetration low, (&lt;10%).
              </p>
              <p>
               It's too easy to shoot holes in stuff.  We can disprove just about anything if it's a fraud, disinfo, misinfo, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               What's harder to weight is the reliability of the source.  While I could never say Wikileaks is 100% accurate, because we do not know what may be disproved at some point, I would state that in their history they've never been proven wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
               And when you have a 100% source, you "trust but verify" to quote Reagan.
              </p>
              <p>
               What I do see here are a lot of the trustworthy old timers (like me), which is great to see.  The Q noise has risen above PG topics, though there is no shortage of new information to sift through.  And it is all related.  Pizzagate is coming back up in discussion and "news".
              </p>
              <p>
               Like the Wired article I posted about.  They keep bringing it up.  Why?
