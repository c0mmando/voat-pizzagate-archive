            This post from 5 days ago gives a detailed discussion of the long-standing practice by the underworld to use Pizza places as fronts for drug trafficking.  It's not a stretch that this is a way to move the product and the money for various kinds of trafficking.  The Rock River Times newspaper article in here is very detailed showing the connection to NY organized crime and several small midwestern pizza parlors.

            I am going to assume you are retarded and explain the obvious to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are negative and positive aspects to everything. It is part of the dualistic world view which was common among Ancient Pagan Religions and was an essential part of the world view of ancient peoples. Ying and Yang, smooth and rough, hard and soft, positive and negative, good and evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Female sexual pleasure has positive constructive aspects (the Goddess/ beautiful maiden/ The lover/ the wife/the mother) and negative destructive aspects (The whore/ the murderess/the Parasite/the Betrayer). In Pagan cultures, the Negative Female Sexuality is actually much darker than the male. You can see this in Goddesses like Lilith who eats children or Kali the literal destroyer of worlds.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the same way, Male sexuality can be constructive as in being a husband or destructive like being a rapist (As a reminder, we used to kill rapists by hanging and rightly so).
           </p>
           <p>
            The Whore of Babylon is a reference to the Revelation. She represents a harbinger of doom and the destruction of humanity through the degeneration of her offspring.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you said " how can that be negative; the womb creates life"
           </p>
           <p>
            There could be a negative aspect to the womb too; in that the life that is created may be a degenerate being; "an abomination before god". What that means is if a woman lays with a degenerate man she will begat degenerate children. Look around you today. I see that happening everywhere I go. Woman who could be living in a positive creative constructive way are subject to and engaged in degeneration. They are the carrier of the next generation but they lay with ignorant abominations and so are not surprisingly giving birth to abominations. It isn't a hard concept to grasp.

            I saw some twitter action a few months ago. Someone had tweeted a pic of Obozos friendship bracket with the pizza slice on it. (Gift from Biden, here it is
            <a href="http://archive.is/iEWUp">
             http://archive.is/iEWUp
            </a>
            ). A user chipped I'm something like ~ "I'm a paedophile satanist and it's not a pizza slice". I don't know why but I got the feeling he was legit and that made me wonder what 'it' could be. My best guess was it's a reference to the Triangular Book of St Germain, which is worth a quick net search if you follow the occult links here, but just a guess

            Eve and Lilith aren't 'pagan' as so much as middle eastern mythos.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Hinduism, the Goddess Kali is a fierce protectress, brought forth to battle demons. She's like the Hindu Mama Bear.
In Celtic Mythos, there are the Morrigan; akin to the three Fates.

            All gods represent archetypes of human society; Game of Thrones covers this aspect with Faith of the Seven (where each of the seven represent stages in life)

            In Pagan traditions there are positive and negative aspects to everything. Like the positive aspect to masculinity is fatherhood and the negative aspect is war. It's the same with the feminine aspect - the positive is motherhood represented by Eve. The negative is Lilith or the whore of Babylon.

            I think Pizza is a reference to the ancient God Lilith who snatches children and eats them. Her other name is PIZNA. Note how the N can be turned to make a Z. The slavic root of  Pizda may in fact be a reference to Pizna since the pronunciation of NA and DA can sound similar depending on your ascent. Pizna represents the divine dark aspect of the feminine which is symbolized by the vagina and would likely be made into a slur like cunt to represent the word's more evil or more vulgar nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Cults of Lilith are related to the Cults of Baal since they are both Canaanite religions who used to make bread (Pan) out of the dried blood of children for consumption. They also used to roast children in a large oven like those used in Pizza restaurants. The flesh smells and tastes like pork and was often sold at market. Early Israeli authorities banned the consumption of pork in order to stop the practice and the Prophet Elijah killed the Priests of Baal by throwing them off a cliff. The word Cannibal literally means the Priest of Baal because they come from the Priesthood line of Cain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Samael and Lilith were the mother and father of Cain and together form the Satanic Trinity. In most horror movies the snatching of children is often shown using Owl symbolism for the Owl is the symbol of Lilith. That is why a child is sacrificed (supposedly in effigy) at the cremation of care cerimony in front of a giant owl statue in Bohemian Grove every year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cultists will often do mock rituals for show (and practice) and then do the real ritual behind closed doors. Maria Abramovic said that her art is for show but she does real magic in real rituals.

             Wait .... Lilith was the first wife of Adam.  And she knew that she had been created equally to Adam and was demanding equal rights.  Don't know when they invented divorce, but pretty much what happened.  Worse than that they buried Lilith, destroyed her reputation and you have to dig and dig and dig before you find anything positive about here.  Turns out, Lilith and Eve became friends.  Mostly there are lies about Lilith just as there have been lies about most women in the Bible including Mary Magdalene degraded as a "prostitute."  And about Mary.  This is what male-supremacists do.
Males are our sexual abusers of children; always have been. 
And they are heterosexual males: Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual.

              Okay, take your head out of your ass for a second. Stop listening to your Frankfurt School Marxist manipulators at whatever Academic Institution fed you that crap. They have scrambled your brains to your extreme detriment. They are your enemy. They don't care about you. They want to destroy you. You are the victim of mind control. Stop listening to them. Stop accepting their lies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Female Supremacist/ Feminist dogma was created to control you by Marxist conspirators who hate you and want to see you enslaved or destroyed. Stop and simply listen to what they are really saying or read what the text actually says. You as a woman, are half of a whole. When they degrade your men they are degrading you too. Your mind control programming will wear off eventually but until then you will have to be strong. The story of Adam and Eve isn't literally true. Nor is the story of Lilith. It's a story about something bigger. There is a message there but I can tell you are too dumb to understand it... for now. Perhaps one day when you are wiser you will understand. For now you have a lot of deprogramming to do.

               It's all myth, of course.  All of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                . According to medieval Jewish apocryphal tradition, which attempts to reconcile the two Creation stories presented in Genesis, Lilith was Adam’s first wife. In Genesis 1:27, God creates man and woman simultaneously from the earth. In Genesis 2:7, however, Adam is created by himself from the earth; Eve is produced later, from Adam’s rib (Genesis 2:21–22). In Jewish legend, the name Lilith was attached to the woman who was created at the same time as Adam. Image: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY.&gt;

              <p>
               The Garden of Eden was likely a lab, of course.  And it is also likely that's where the slaughter of animals began which is why today we continue to see Eve holding the apple as a message to us all.  It is where violence is introduced.
              </p>
              <p>
               All of these myths are written by males -- and whatever was actually written by females was mainly removed.
              </p>
              <p>
               All of the contradictions and violence are created by males.
              </p>
              <p>
               And, of course, feminism and matriarchal lineage has been around much longer than ..... Marxism????
              </p>
              <p>
               The history assigned to Joseph was actually Mary's lineage because at that time the family line came from the maternal side.

               <p>
                According to midrashic literature, Adam's first wife was not Eve but a woman named Lilith, who was created in the first Genesis account. Only when Lilith rebelled and abandoned Adam did God create Eve, in the second account, as a replacement. In an important 13th century Kabbalah text, the Sefer ha-Zohar ("The Book of Splendour") written by the Spaniard Moses de Leon (c. 1240-1305), it is explained that:
               </p>
               <p>
                At the same time Jehovah created Adam, he created a woman, Lilith, who like Adam was taken from the earth. She was given to Adam as his wife.

               A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.

               Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.

               Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.

               <p>
                A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
               </p>
               <p>
                Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.

                At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
               </p>
               <p>
                Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.

                Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.

                A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

                Hetero to homo-sexual orientation in the population is 44 to 1. This tiny percentage of men (2%) are responsible for 100% of the molestation crimes against boys. With 17% to 24 % of the boys being molested by the time they are 18 (it is 25% for girls), that makes homosexuals vastly more likely to be pedophiles than the general heterosexual population. The truth is a homosexual man has a vastly higher likelihood of being a pedophile. While pedophilia among heterosexual men is a tiny rarity, it is common among homosexual men.  I do not hate homosexuals, but I do hate pedophiles. It isn't a pleasant truth, but it is the truth none the less.

                It seems to me the "Patriarchy" isn't doing it's job of hanging until death these degenerate monsters like we used to in the past. Death should be the penalty but progressive Marxist/Socialist SJW Leftists like yourself fought hard for the past century to vilify those who would punish these crimes and argued on behalf of pedophiles that it is a mental disorder or a sexual preference. It is the taming of the "Patriarchy" which allowed Pizzagate to happen in the first place. Unleashed to dispose of these creatures the "Patriarchy" would have solved this problem in the same way Elijah solved it when he cast the Priests of Baal off of a cliff or how the KKK lynched pedophiles, rapists and murderers. AND it is those same "Priests of Ba'al" (because that is what they are) who are committing these Pizzagate atrocities today. We have to come together and cast these monsters off the cliff together for it has never been the Patriarchy who created the greatness of the Western World. It was men and women working together. Don't let your enemies (these Priests of Baal) convince you to turn against men. As I said, you are half of a whole. If you deny your other half they have already won.

                I don't expect you to understand, but I suspect that even you, a dyed in the wool SJW, do instinctively anyway. These crimes bring up primitive feeling in men AND women, and make us seethe with anger and hatred and we seek revenge and murder in their wake. Don't you want to see Podestas head caved in? Isn't that the most natural feeling in the world? And you know what? That is okay. That is natural. That is nature. That is what nature would have us do. Rather than a war on nature; War is Nature.

                When I was a young man I had the power to beat the living shit out of 5 rapists who I knew were guilty. I could have given them justice and their victim solace, but I chose to let the police and the courts take their course. The men all got off scot-free. I have regretted that day ever since. I wish I had done the right thing rather than the cowardly thing. I chose Peace rather than War. Why? Because I had been schooled from the day I was born to deny my nature. The Social Justice system had cowed me. I was forever apologizing for being a White Male (they were Pakistani Muslim). Forever brow beaten by the Holocaust and the Patriarchy even by women in my own family; my mother and sister. Forever told of my evil to which I was guilty. Even though I had never done anything harmful to anyone in my entire life. I had never even spoken poorly of another person without direct cause to.

                Do you see how this ideology of Feminism is creating an emptiness in both men and women. Resentment. A gap between us. The reason is because it is meant to. It is the ultimate divide and conquer technique. To divide women against their men. Now I don't know if you are White or not, but you certainly have swallowed the poison pill meant for White women. To turn you against men, they will say anything. They will do anything. They already have.

                The Old Testament wasn't written to 'cement Patriarchy'. People thousands of years ago simply lived and didn't have this idea of men against women. That didn't exist. It was tribe against tribe. It was men and women working together as a team and those who worked best survived while those who turned on each other died. That is the lesson. It is the simplest truth, yet you have been convinced by your enemies that it isn't so even though it is right in front of your face.

                 Obviously you haven't looked at the study which shows that males are our sexual abusers of children and that they are heterosexual males.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Right wing women's groups agree that our sexual abusers of children are MALE.

                 Evidently before the coming of the white man to Hawaii, homosexuals (Lesbians and Gay Males) were esteemed and honored there for their care for orphaned children.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Other evidence makes clear that heterosexual males are much more actively involved in homosexual activity than even medical doctors have realized.  Newspaper articles from two and three decades ago make clear that with the outbreak of AIDS, doctors in Brazil were at first surprised to find so many married women with AIDS, especially because they were not drug users and claimed not to have sexual partners beyond their husbands.  As it turned out finally doctors found that 30% of married men were involved in sexual relationships with other males.  30% --- 30%  !!  Much of this was of course hidden in this Catholic nation -- even from doctors.

                 Sadly, your second paragraph reflects only violent thinking.  "Beware of those with a strong urge to punish."
Keep in mind that violence only breeds more violence.  Also that as we've seen since the coup on JFK (our last liberal president) it is the rise of the right wing which brings torture and sexual abuse and human trafficking.   And many understand the involvement of Bill and Hillary Clinton in Cia's drug trafficking out of Mena, Ark and in trafficking of children.  That is not liberal behavior, that is right wing behavior.  The Bush's -- GHWB and "W" are of course right wing.  So is the CIA, MIC, our intelligence agencies.  And our corrupted government.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And, no, I feel no need to embrace violence.  I do want to know what causes people to behave this way.  What happened to them.  I do want to see them isolated from society so they can't harm anyone else.
That's because I see the harm that violence brings in return.  And, no, violence isn't natural despite how many times you may have been told that it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It also seems clear that you feel beaten down by feminism.  But how blinded you are to what patriarchy is actually about and its evils.  Male-supremacy is about the oppression and females and that has never happened without male violence.  Very brutal male violence.  This is the "bird with one wing" which has brought us destruction of nature even down to Global Warming which is making this planet unlivable for humans.  Rather than building a wall on Mexican border, Trump should be building walls around the North &amp; South Poles and Greenland because the melting of the glaciers is expected to bring a 9 foot rise in oceans.

                 Our species is the ONLY species on this planet where half of the species is at war with the other half.  Actually women are the larger population by at least 54% versus 46% -- possibly more, but it's difficult to tell because of the rate women are killed all over the world.  And this male violence against females because about 50,000 years ago when males rode out of an area behind Turkey to do violence to women.  Rather the bond between men and women and children has to be broken in order to send males to war -- otherwise they wouldn't go.  No women are "turned against men" as no male gets to live on this planet other than through the body of a female.  Women take care of males as babies, children and we mother them all through their lives.

             Friend that's some excellent knowledge. I see you haven't posted to this chan yet. I am hoping you will start as (IMO) there is not enough knowledge here about the overarching occult background that a lot of us see with PG (not all I might add)

              You have to be careful not to confuse the two. Lilith and The Whore of Babylon are not the same. Lilith is from the Talmud/Jewish lore and occurs at the 'beginning of man'. The Whore of Babylon is from Revelations and happens at the 'end of man'. They are both negative female archetypes however and they can be seen to be the same in many ways in a larger literary tradition.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Whore of Babylon rides a beast called Mystery Babylon. She is called that because Revelation is a criticism of the Cult of Babylon. Mystery Babylon is a Pagan religious system which has many of the occult mysteries and secrets but also engages in murder, sodomy, pedophilia, cannibalism, torture and all other forms of evil.
             </p>
             <p>
              Babylon is actually the cult of Ba'al as in BA - BA'AL - ON. Usually represented as a BULL. The Whore is the High Priestess of the Cult of Baal. She can be seen as Lilith because she is the consort of SAMAEL (the devil) and mother of Cain. Together they form the Satanic Trinity. So the Whore of Babylon and Lilith can both be seen as the Female Goddesses of Evil. While Ba'al and Samael are the Devil or Male Gods of Evil.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fun Fact: If you watch any movie that has to do with children being threatened there is usually an owl present in the background. That is a reference to Lilith. It is very common in horror movies. There will be an owl doll in the child's bedroom or something like that.

                That's for the best. Hollywood is now the source of immense degeneracy. I actually get angry watching movies now because of the filth we are forced to watch. Mostly because I refuse to have my children subjected to the immoral and disgusting lifestyles portrayed in every media now. I used to think that filmmakers were artists. Now I know they serve a darker purpose.

             That's grasping at straws imo, as Lilith is a Judeo creation, thus original works about her wouldn't use English alphabet, but in Hebrew. Does Pizna look like Pizna when written in Hebrew? Think in terms of original context.

             Lilith was Adam's first wife who refused to lay beneath him for nookie; she was demonized as women weren't supposed to be independent, and she was cast out of Eden and replaced by Eve; think about it, there's two creations stories regarding Adam's significant other; one where she was sculpted from the same mud as Adam (thus would be his equal) and one where she's created from his rib, which would be subservient Eve.

              Agreed. Everyone is so eager to be like yep it's the Jews. Lazy people scapegoat entire cultures. If it's the Rothchilds, do you really believe 99.9999% of Jews aren't as out of the loops as you or I? Must be some great compartmentalizing that enables millions not to spill the beans.

              Use your fucking heads, the Catholic Church is responsible for a tremendous amount of racism and persecution towards the Jews throughout the last couple millennia. The same Catholic Church that we know has spent billions covering up the rampant pederasty and child abuse which plagues its ranks.

             <p>
              How did pizzagate become the tin-foil hat magnet all-encompassing fruitcake conspiracy theory? Can I not subscribe to the belief that child trafficking and pedophilia are used by the deep state to blackmail and control people, as well as for profit, without also believing Jews are annunaki shape-shifting lizard people? Would it be too much to ask for you to all check your prjudice at the door when you purport to participating in a citizen journalist investigation of something highly important and objectively tangible (when we're not grasping at straws or pushing our own agendas)?

              THe modern use of Pizza parlors as pedophile sites was created by modern English speaking people who probably thought that the analogy would only be picked up by people in the know. That is why they use those pedo symbols. They are from ancient cults which they adapted to use as a secret so that pedos would know where to go. Like a form of secret advertising. The system is modern and was probably created around the time that the Hollywood movie Lolita was made because there is a lot of symbolism in that movie. Because pedo need to be careful that they aren't discovered since normal decent people would kill them, they had to form a code of secrecy. That code I think was formed using ancient Pagan cult symbolism in order so that there was some plausible deniability. You could just say that you really like Renaissance art, but the codes are in there. I don't think it is a coincidence that much of the art and film world is crawling with pedos. I think they congregate there because of the hidden symbolism. Just like Greek art and culture was used by the Gays in order to hide themselves and so they could have a secret way to meet one another.

              When Lilith was cast out El sent 2 angels to retrieve her. She refused to return and was cursed to have 100 of her demon children murdered every day. She gets revenge by killing the children of Adam and Eve (non-Jews). Jewish children even today wear protective talismans against the machinations of Lilith (so the Priests of Lilith will know not to take them and move on to goyim children.

            It should also be noted that English "minge" is derived from the Gypsy word equivalent. (Though it probably won't matter, since there are no people of Romany ancestry obviously connected to Pizzagate AFAIK) Correct me if I'm wrong.

            Perhaps it does mean a thing at all but a lack of the thing:
           </p>
           <p>
            For example 
when they say

            <p>
             dont forget to bring the pizza
