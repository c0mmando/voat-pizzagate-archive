             Sometimes I wonder if the way to get to the major news networks is to complain to our local ones. They are made of more "real" people who aren't as untouchable but no doubt have an ear further up the chain.

            The guy who was the illegitimate step-brother of JonBenet Ramsey who left the ransom note lived in New Jersey. That's strange. The guy wanted to be paid 118 000 bucks on X-date every year or there would be "consequences". That's spooky.

             You should listen to M'Linda Kula's 2 interviews on the Opperman Report, her research is so thorough. Bill Ramsey (who's changed his name twice now) lives in New Jersey, Ocean County, and he's the guy. Her research is impeccable and her network is actually making things move...slowly..but they are.

            He is a member of Satanic cult - all of them are. No exception. He could even be a member of The 9th Circle. There is a reason why Trump is acting so non chalant - he must have gotten hold of some pretty damning evidence on Comey - that could expose him part of the Pizza Party.

             The connections between the Clintons and Comey can be traced back to their childhood, I suspect.  They are products of the Satanic Farm System that cultivates mind controlled individuals for placement throughout government and society.

              This is what Newt meant by Trump not being a member. He does not resemble any of the symptoms of the pedo elite. The fact that his wife slaps his hand away is a sign that Trump's marriage is REAL not a sham as is Hillary's or Obama's. It's real but NWO wants simulacra!

            When reading up on comey at an earlier day I became totally puzzled at the story of comey and his brothee being abducted by a child molestor was soooo ODD. The details didnt make any sense.

             That whole story is ODD indeed. I read that the Comey brothers locked the "Ramsey rapist" inside their own house. How in the hell do you lock a burglar inside your house? Basement with no windows, that I can believe. This whole "Ramsey rapist" episode feels fabricated to me.

            I posted this comment 25 days ago,don't think it got noticed: I'll repost because it looks like interest is picking up on Mr. Comey: "Here's an anecdotal quote in which Comey is role playing prison with his children."Mr. Comey Goes To Washington | NEW YORK MAGAZINE (
            <a href="https://idraintheswamp.com/home/fbi-leadership-structure/james-comey/">
             https://idraintheswamp.com/home/fbi-leadership-structure/james-comey/))
            </a>
            )) Comey is talking about his upcoming “career day” chat to his daughter’s first-grade class. “My wife and I have five kids, so I’ve done this many times,” he says. “I like to bring stuff to show them: fingerprints, handcuffs, stuff like that.” Suddenly, Comey is shouting, acting out his lesson to the 6-year-olds: “Tell the truth! See what can happen to you?” he yells. “Okay, now we’re all gonna perp-walk to the playground! Tommy—you be Kozlowski!” Ironical, Comey barking out "tell the truth" to 6 year olds. Same article relates how Comey as a 15 y.o. with his brother Peter in 1977 in Ramsey,NJ were victims of a home invasion by the alleged Ramsey rapist who had previously raped 3 teenage babysitters . A suspect was arrested but not identified by any of the victims except for one of the Comey boys. Suspect had an alibi and was widely respected in the community. Suspect was later exonerated.

            </a>
            " In the decades since that episode, which Comey has said taught him important lessons about crime’s psychological toll on victims, the Northern Highlands Regional High School graduate has earned a reputation as a tough, but ethical, federal prosecutor and a Department of Justice attorney brave enough to stand up to political pressure from the White House." Have to wonder exactly what happened to the Comeys in 1977 that caused one of them to identify the wrong person and what kind of lesson/responsibility did he takeaway from the subsequent collateral damage to an innocent man and his family? Reports at the time stated Comey and his brother were not injured. I wonder why Comey would want to frighten 6 year olds with the perp-walk and handcuffs approach if he himself was a terrorized victim, why perpetuate it?

             I thought, now and when I read you comment the first time, I bet that rape incident was a psyop played on teenage Comey to ensure his mk was working. Or the story has been fabricated in more recent years to make Comey seem more believable, to make him look like he'd be more likely to prosecute sex crimes rather than aid and abet them.

              It would be interesting to know which Comey brother was the only witness to positively id the wrong guy and send the authorities barking up the wrong tree. They apparently never caught the perpetrator. Since the Clintons like to employ "dirty" people (a la Janet Reno :
              <a href="http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=177742.0">
               http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=177742.0)
              </a>
              ) maybe the dirt on Comey goes back a long time?
