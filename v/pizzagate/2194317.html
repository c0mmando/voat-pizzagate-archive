            I would like to upvoat this, but realistically, I cannot show an article like this to normie friends because it's full of fucking typos and that alone would likely cause them to discredit it.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "In the circle of pedophilia accusations that circulated around director Bryan Singer’s X-men movies, Marc Collins-Rector pleaded guilty to having sex with
             <strong>
              under young boy actors
             </strong>
             who were invited to parties and given drugs and alcohol as the opening act of a play that ended in older men sexually abusing them."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I'm assuming that's supposed to read "underage young boy actors". In the very next paragraph:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "USA Today reported on June 14, 2004, that Marc Collins-Rector who had been in custody since his capture in Spain two years previously, pleaded guilty to charges brought against him by federal prosecutors in California and New Jersey, accusing him of luring five minors
             <strong>
              across sex lines.
             </strong>
             "
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Guessing that's supposed to be "across state lines". See what I'm saying?

            I remember once I was online chatting with a person.  After a while, she talked about how she used to be a young teen actress in Hollywood, and there used to be regular orgies with teenage girls and some of Hollywood's agents, directors, producers, etc.  It occurred at a specific hotel, which she did not name. She mentioned a couple of agents from CAA, but declined to name anyone else specific. 
Don't know if it was someone pulling my leg, but it didn't seem that way. She rushed off, and I never spoke with her again.  I have alway wondered how real it was.

            Just when i read this article today
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://people.com/movies/goodbye-christopher-robin-director-simon-curtis-on-working-with-10-year-old-will-tilston-comparisons-between-will-daniel-radcliffe/">
             http://people.com/movies/goodbye-christopher-robin-director-simon-curtis-on-working-with-10-year-old-will-tilston-comparisons-between-will-daniel-radcliffe/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This old guy is an director, he's the one who "discovered" Daniel Radcliffe.
           </p>
           <p>
            He knows Harvey Weinstein very well, because Harvey "discovered" Emma Watson in one of his movies.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            What Harvey said about Emma in 2010:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Film chieftain Harvey Weinstein wants to take Emma Watson under his wing and mould a big post-Harry Potter screen career for her.
           </p>
           <p>
            The studio boss was getting all excited (professionally!) over Emma after seeing her on the set of My Week With Marilyn (where she gets seduced by leading man Eddie Redmayne), and then watching the footage of Simon Curtis's film.
           </p>
           <p>
            Emma, back in London for additional filming on the final part of Deathly Hallows, donned a wig over her gamine hairstyle to play the small but important role of Lucy, an assistant in the wardrobe department at Pinewood studios in 1956.
           </p>
           <p>
            The film's based on a memoir by Colin Clark, who was Laurence Olivier's assistant on the movie and who, during an intense period of filming, became Marilyn Monroe's confidant.
           </p>
           <p>
            But he flirted with Lucy as much as possible in between takes. Clark described Lucy as 'one of the prettiest little girls I have ever seen in my life... slim as a wand, curly brown hair, huge brown eyes and a wide cheeky grin.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Harvey told me: 'For ten years she has been this schoolgirl in the Harry Potter films and now you see her as a woman for the first time.
           </p>
           <p>
            'She has an elegance about her - she looks like Jean Shrimpton! - plus she has a gift for comedy and drama, and we're just starting to see her range.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I feel we're going to work together a lot in the future.'
           </p>
           <p>
            He was speaking before a screening in New York for the film Blue Valentine, which features powerful performances from Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, who portrays Monroe on My Week With Marilyn.
           </p>
           <p>
            The latter's director Simon Curtis called Emma a 'proper actress'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Curtis cast Daniel Radcliffe in his first role when he played David Copperfield in 1999. 'It's great to have given Emma her first job after Harry Potter,' he added"
           </p>

Background[edit]
           </p>
           <p>
            Born to a Jewish family[2] in Chicago, Emanuel was raised in suburban Wilmette, Illinois. Emanuel is the brother of former White House Chief of Staff and current Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel, National Institutes of Health bioethicist Ezekiel J. Emanuel, and adopted sister Shoshana Emanuel. His father, Jerusalem-born Dr. Benjamin M. Emanuel, is a pediatrician who was active in the Irgun, a hardline Zionist militant group whose activities in Mandatory Palestine during the 1930s and 1940s led to its listing as a terrorist organization by the British authorities, the Jewish Agency and the 1946 Zionist Congress.[3][4][5] His mother, Marsha Emanuel (née Smulevitz), was a civil rights activist, and the one-time owner of a Chicago-area rock and roll club.[6] As a child, Ari was diagnosed as both hyperactive and dyslexic, and his mother spent many hours helping him to learn to read.[6] He is a graduate of New Trier High School and of Macalester College in St Paul, Minnesota, where he was roommates with director Peter Berg.

            Career[edit]
Prior to founding Endeavor, Emanuel was a partner at InterTalent and senior agent at ICM Partners (ICM).[6] He began his entertainment industry career as an agent trainee at Creative Artists Agency (CAA).
           </p>
           <p>
            Emanuel has been described as a "21st century Hollywood mogul" and “the pre-eminent power player” in Hollywood.[8][9] Emanuel and WME co-CEO Patrick Whitesell have been characterized as "rewriting the Hollywood script", and they have both been named to Fortune's Businessperson of the Year list.[10][11] In a May 2013 article on Emanuel, Fortune called him "one of the biggest guns in the consolidating entertainment business".[12]
           </p>
           <p>
            Emanuel's relationships with his clients, coupled with his stature in the industry, has led to various homages and parodies over the years, including Bob Odenkirk’s character Stevie Grant on The Larry Sanders Show, and Ari Gold, played by Jeremy Piven on the HBO television show Entourage.[13] In 2011, Emanuel cofounded TheAudience with Sean Parker and Oliver Luckett.[14]

            Ariel Emanuel has served as a member of Live Nation Entertainment board of directors since September 2007.[15]

           <p>
            Public advocacy[edit]
Emanuel gained widespread media attention in July 2006 when he called on Hollywood to blacklist Mel Gibson because of Gibson's "anti-Semitic remarks" during his DUI arrest. Emanuel wrote, "People in the entertainment community, whether Jew or Gentile, need to demonstrate that they understand how much is at stake in this by professionally shunning Mel Gibson and refusing to work with him, even if it means a sacrifice to their bottom line."[16]
           </p>
           <p>
            Emanuel's name was in an August 17, 2006, advertisement in the Los Angeles Times that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict.[17]
           </p>
           <p>
            Emanuel has hosted fundraisers for the Democratic Party.[18]
           </p>
           <p>
            Controversy[edit]
An April 2002 lawsuit by agent Sandra Epstein against Endeavor Agency brought forth accusations by Epstein and other Endeavor employees against Emanuel.[19] In the court filings, Emanuel is alleged to have allowed a friend to operate a pornographic website out of Endeavor's offices.[19]
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Epstein, Emanuel made racist and anti-gay remarks and prevented her from sending a script about Navy SEALs to actor Wesley Snipes, saying: "That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Everyone knows that blacks don't swim."[19] Emanuel disputed these accusations at the time. Epstein's claims were settled for $2.25 million.[19]
           </p>
           <p>
            In March 2013, it was revealed that Emanuel was unhappy with an interview of him and his two brothers conducted by NBC anchor Brian Williams. According to the New York Post, Emanuel was not pleased with the "aggressive" tone of the interview and believed that "something was just off", according to a source.[20] Emanuel's lawyer sent a letter to NBC over the perceived issue.[21]
           </p>
           <p>
            Art philanthropy[edit]
Emanuel has in the past been active on the board of trustees of P.S. Arts, a Los Angeles, California-based nonprofit organization that works to bring art education programs to Southern California schools. He has also helped the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, establish MOCAtv, a dedicated YouTube art channel. In 2012, he joined the museum's board.[22]

             Yes, actually all 3 are quite a prize.  The father is still a practicing pediatrician in Chicago.  I looked into them couple weeks ago and it said to contact him at Lurie Children's Hosp.  That is scary.  Think about it.  Also Zeke was very instrumental in writing the ACA aka Obamacare.  Well we know what a wonderful job Rahm is doing protecting the People of Chicago.  I am wondering if Ari is too big of a fish with him raking in all those huge donations for BO and others. But then who know.  If the heat gets too hot in the kitchen, they may just end up having him as a guest at the next Spirit Cooking.  No one can be spared to protect the reputation of the Abusers.
