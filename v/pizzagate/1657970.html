            I'm pretty positive these are not the same people in the father video.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              The guy in the father video has a much deeper voice than the older brother.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The kid in this video's too tall. The kid in the shower, his head was about level with bar on the shower door. This kids taller than that.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The younger brothers voice in the video is deeper, than the one in the shower.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Only one time in this video, did  I hear a high pitched scream like the kid in the shower. but the high pitched scream in this video sounds like it was added to the video. When you hear the high pitched scream the older brother  (who sucks at making videos) is in front of the camera, but moves after a few seconds.  You then see the younger brother laying on the couch looking at an IPad. The younger brother isn't playing around with the older brother at that moment, so the high pitched scream is in a strange place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, later in the video, you actually hear the younger brother scream and it sounds deeper than the kid in the shower, or even the high pitched scream earlier in the video.
           </p>
           <p>
            My guess is world Corp. Put this video together quickly to try and stop people from talking about the father video, or.  doing any more digging.

            My bad I get what happened now, this dude is running this stuff off of his home pic, and has opened ports to of course allow the traffic. Sorry without knowing that piece it looked like a huge trap. But this is the guys home comeputer exposed as fuck. That's the only thing that makes sense.

            someone pointed out on reddit that in that video that older kid has his pants pulled down at one point. I don't think that video is as innocent as we all thought at first glance. watch at around 11:36. I think this kid was either exposing himself off camera to that little boy or it's just another weird troll to make it look that way without actually showing anything. again just sick either way.

            GUYS THE OLDER BROTHER IS EXPOSING HIMSELF TO THE YOUNGER BROTHER IN THE VIDEO THATS WHY ITS ON THERE. 
Ok in the video with the kids this is really fucked up. For one the older brother asks him 10:12 "Do you understand now why its fun to scare you?" the older brother also says 11:19 "ahhh ahh smell the gas..." which then makes that kill room drawing with the gas vents make sense and not seem as silly. Then I dunno maybe no one noticed this but the brother starts to wrestle with him, at 11:24 he appears to be touching the younger brother in his privates,  then the little brother starts yelling stop, stop stop no seriously stop, the older brother then goes back to his chair and pulls his pants down to his ankles, when he sits back on the couch 11:39 you hear the younger brother laugh when he sees the older brother exposing himself with his back facing the camera on the couch. They both laugh very weirdly about it, its very obvious once you see. Right after that little brother says dads going to come home soon, 11:52 and you can see the older brother pulling his pants up, they are still unbuttoned and hes putting his belt back on. So... yea the video is of the older brother molesting the younger brother... thats why its on there. It may also be the same children from the other videos, the abused often become the abusers.

            Explain how anything you posted or put in that video confirms the identity of the child in the abuse video. We don't see any features of the child. We don't have a clear recording of the child's voice. We see a distorted shadow showing the child's size. While I am still not convinced that it is Podesta in the video, I am even less convinced that the video you showed is of the same child in that apparent shower.

            Fairly certain? That's not proof of any sort.

            How do you know it was a teenager? My first instinct was 8-12 years old.

            Great investigative work but I don't think this is the same kid. Kid in video is way younger, neither of these kids screaming would sound like the one in fatherhood. The older brother sounds too young to be the one screaming at them too. I just don't see it or hear it. I think this older brother has something to do with worldcorpo the website but I don't think he's got anything to do with those videos.

            I think it is Podesta but it doesn't matter it was put online to send a message to Podesta and the message is we are on to you Mr. Asshole and with any luck Attorney General Sessions will order the G-Men to arrest you very soon. Podesta is scared to death by all these videos and voice print comparisons. The monster heard in the video is obviously Not the kid's father he is on a power trip yelling at the kid "What's my name! My other name! I'm your daddy now!" and that is meant to scare the kid and force the kid in to a different split personality it's all part of MK-Ultra disassociative disorder training. The goal is to literally create an alter persona in the child being terrified. Podesta could be the voice in the video they sound very similar but bottom line it doesn't matter. John is terrified now and there is nothing he can do to shut this down. I wish Drudge would post the video on Drudge Report but then it would be a huge libel lawsuit that Drudge doesn't want. Podesta won't sue us because that would just call more attention to the video and legitimize it. Podesta has to ignore all this investigating but his days are  numbered. I think he will be killed by higher-ups and it will be made to look like a tragic accident.

Alright it showed up , but was delayed.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what I tried to post:
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if it presents the same child in the abuse video [and I missed the information which would establish that]
           </p>
           <p>
            how does anyone know that the happy video wasn't taken before the child was killed, raped, roasted, whatever?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to learn to copy all my comments before they are posted.. Is there really someone in real time watching this shit?!

             That's a good point, one there is no solid lead saying this kid is the kid from the fatherhood video.  Second, even if it was, as you said there is no guarantee he is safe at all.  This whole post reeks of "Okay guys, it's over I debunked it you can go home now!"  When it's literally just a random video of a kid, even if it is from a backend directory on the same site.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyways, if you could check out this voice analysis of the fatherhood video with an election night speech, let me know what you think and if it could be the same voice

              Alright, I see what someone mentioned about the final "R'S"
In the speech in front of a large audience in an ostensibly important formal occasion - should've been thanking the followers for all the work and money - which I don't think he did - but in any case its a formal speech and it's more leisurely, He would enunciate the final "R"'s He's on stage.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the torture MKULTRA moment he's striking the child with his words and it has a staccatto rhythm . He's probably "hopped up" on some drugs; poppers? So the "R's" are dropped; perfectly explainable.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've noticed people who put on voices, act voices, when they get angry or scared they revert to older more habitual cadences.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know there are people who can take a voice print and really know from a forensic POV , not just speculation.

              Sounds just like "Father"  But there should be a rock solid way to prove that.

              Here Podesta is again:
John Podesta Refutes 'Clinton Cash' Charges (Apr. 20, 2015) | Charlie Rose

              Liar, "Clinton Foundation , put everything out there. Complete disclosure" )
             </p>
             <p>
              **John D. Podesta has a very distinctive voice. **  He breaks in and over-rides the interviewers question.
His voice cracks up high to a higher range at about 1:27 + as the voice in the MKULTRA-type vid does?
             </p>
             <p>
              **Can you find any other voice that sounds like him? **
             </p>
             <p>
              In the Horror vid , when the "father" says "finding my way" the manner in which he lingers on the word "way" sounds exactly like John D. Podesta. 1:08

             <p>
              Also, for the Horror vid it sounds like he's adopting an "alt" voice , as people do sometimes, when speaking to animals or to children.. Like telling a horror story. But it still sounds like him.

              Fatherhood' John Podesta Voice Comparison.
Same hesitations you see in other voice samples.:
             </p>
             <p>
              "What will you call me? You will call me ..........[hesitation]..................................your Father. "
             </p>
             <p>
              "Say it again"   "Say it again"   -- sounds exactly like him. 45 - 50 seconds
             </p>
             <p>
              At the campaign closing "Listen to me.. " "[]go home"
             </p>
             <p>
              [what a douche. Can't believe anyone ever took this fool seriously. Doesn't even thank anyone.. Alright , so that counts for psychopathology that is shown in the horror clip ]  1:37
             </p>
             <p>
              "We are so proud of you. and we are so proud of HER" Alright he did thank at the very end. But didn't focus on any individuals.
             </p>
             <p>
              [in terms of "Russians trying to influence election" They never explain how the leaked emails do that.. He just skirts it" ]
             </p>
             <p>
              3:58 "You oughta get a real job" Angry. sounds like battering "Father."
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDWSSfsbMdE">

              He is so fucked. [When I first saw the "Pizza" material , I wrote that.. It's over. He's toast. He's done.] Sounds precisely the same.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do not feel sorry for him at all. I can't believe he was let get as far as he has.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now there's more. He could've been hung out to dry just with his pedo artwork, the teddie and klennex next to his bed, and the Pizza map reference. But now,, hmpth. There must be more, too. ]

            I'm not necessarily convinced that everything is all unicorns and rainbows now, especially that this theory is simply riding on a
            <em>
             hunch
            </em>
            that they are the same children. Regardless, I appreciate the effort and perspective.

            I too wasn't convinced that was Podesta either (and I never heard the name 'skippy' being yelled out either) but let's not question fate.
Perhaps even though unrelated---- the strange and disturbing contents of World Corp needed this pizzagate investigation to get serendipitously called out.  So it's a win-win any way you slice it!

            Why these 2 comments though?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I do not think it was John Podesta's voice in the abuse videos. 
We need to close this chapter if it is ultimately unrelated to Pizzagate. I'm sure Robert Robinson knows all the answers.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            At first it seems as a "Hey all. The kids are safe. Don't worry anymore." Then it goes over to the subtle. "It's definitely not Podesta in the video." What evidence is there for this? Despite the voice in the original video.
If it IS him, we'd get so much further. I'm pretty skeptic here.

            OK, so here are the possibilities I can think of if these two brothers are the children in the abuse videos.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Stepfather abusing stepson(s).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Older brother abusing younger brother.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Brothers creating fake abuse videos.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            If 1 or 2, then this needs to be dealt with by srs bzns popo.  Until that happens, we need to keep pushing to discover the facts and end the abuse.  If it's 2, then it's likely that the boys have been abused (and may still be being abused) by another person; that kind of torment isn't normal teasing and horseplay.
           </p>
           <p>
            If 3, then one of these boys -- or someone who knows them -- needs to clear this up.  This has way too many people truly upset.  Trolling is great, but there are real consequences to taking pretense too far.  (If you're tempted to be snide and denigrate the people who are upset, don't.  That discussion will be for after we resolve this.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Another possibility under #3 is that the audio has been manipulated, maybe to add in things, and/or maybe to alter the voice(s); who knows?  One thing which I find strange is that the boy in the shower doesn't ever knock over the disco light.  If it's there at his feet, why didn't he?  Why would someone put the light in there with him?  Or, is the shower stall something other than a normal shower stall?  Maybe the light is coming through from somewhere beyond it.  (The CPP hypothesis is one possibility in that direction.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The abusive and adult tone of the "I'm your fuckin' daddy" guy leads me to think it can't be the older brother.
           </p>
           <p>
            As additional food for consideration here, watch the "I'm not sure who recorded this" video again and imagine that it's being made by a boy, maybe an adolescent or a junior high boy, who's out to create freaky weird shit videos.  It seems like that might be what happened there.  (It is definitely one of the creepier videos I've ever seen, and that was obviously the intention of the creator, whoever that was.)  If the sound is unaltered from what the mic captured, then that is hideous and any child subjected to hearing that would be traumatized.  OTOH, it could be that the freakiness of the sound was achieved in post-processing and the ambient sound of the room was nothing like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            My thoughts are a swirl right now, so I hope this makes enough sense to be useful.

            There is nothing suggesting that the child is alive and well after the abuse video was captured. This could very well be leaked by the same people who leaked the abuse video... It absolutely is John Podesta. This video could be leaked to help identify the child.

             I agree with this. I've seen too many things suddenly popping up 'out of the blue' to dismiss this. I did at first. I listened to 30 seconds of the screaming video and there is nothing that tells me a kid screaming like that is goofing off.

              I meant leaked onto the internet in the first place. You don't know it wasn't waiting to be discovered. You've done some great work, but I'm puzzled why you are making so many assumptions that aren't reflected in the findings...

               Exactly.  It's just a random video of a kid from the backend directory of the site.  No guarantee at all that the kid is safe, or that this is even the same kid.  But people are accepting this as "awesome work" and "yeah it's totally debunked!  We can go look at something else now."  No, for all we know it could be Skippy, John Podesta's alter ego and this was leaked to us in a directory full of other random videos and now people want to use the other random videos to detract from the main source, Fatherwood.webm.
              </p>
              <p>
               And just because people say it's a Boston accent doesn't make it impossible for it to be Podesta.  Alter egos, drugs and alcohol, stress and anger can make a difference in someone's voice.  Especially if they are in a disassociated state of mind.

            Is anyone looking into Gary lee munroe? The guy who is holysagemunroe on tumblr. Brings up worldcorp as being owned by him, pictures from worldcorp Facebook page include Gary lee munroe, video from shady worldcorp website features piss toilet guy that looks similar to Gary lee munroe.
           </p>
           <p>
            That connection isn't solid necessarily; worldcorp is a generic enough sounding name. But I've spent a lot of time looking into this guy and there is some very weird shit regarding him, his claims, affiliation with ULC, and mention of child trafficking via adoption agencies. I even tied an adoption agency in Ohio (50 miles or so east of the one that was just raided by FBI) apparently involved in this based off of a name he mentioned in his ramblings. It may have been Jamie Waller, but I can't confirm because I'm on a tablet currently my away from my desk.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's going on with him is a rabbit hole in and of itself and I have no idea what to make of it yet, but I can't get the mentions of adoption agencies and child trafficking he's made out of my head.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: another weird piece I wanted to mention is his claims of kids being microchipped. I found an article about exactly that, how a sex trafficking victim upon rescue was found to be implanted with the same exact type of chip he mentioned in his ramblings. Huh.

            Also I am confused. You showed a video of two children, yet what makes you think either one was the one in the torment video? You could not see the child in that video. At least in Podesta's case, he has an east coast accent, the child calls him John and the lighting is just like CPP. As far  as th child goes, you simply present a video with children and say it is  probably them. Not compelling. Probably one of the children is the one for the torment video for what reason exactly? Any reason?

             GUYS THE OLDER BROTHER IS EXPOSING HIMSELF TO THE YOUNGER BROTHER IN THE VIDEO THATS WHY ITS ON THERE. Ok in the video with the kids this is really fucked up. For one the older brother asks him 10:12 "Do you understand now why its fun to scare you?" the older brother also says 11:19 "ahhh ahh smell the gas..." which then makes that kill room drawing with the gas vents make sense and not seem as silly. Then I dunno maybe no one noticed this but the brother starts to wrestle with him, at 11:24 he appears to be touching the younger brother in his privates, then the little brother starts yelling stop, stop stop no seriously stop, the older brother then goes back to his chair and pulls his pants down to his ankles, when he sits back on the couch 11:39 you hear the younger brother laugh when he sees the older brother exposing himself with his back facing the camera on the couch. They both laugh very weirdly about it, its very obvious once you see. Right after that little brother says dads going to come home soon, 11:52 and you can see the older brother pulling his pants up, they are still unbuttoned and hes putting his belt back on. So... yea the video is of the older brother molesting the younger brother... thats why its on there. It may also be the same children from the other videos, the abused often become the abusers.

              At 11:19, he says "smells like ass" actually, but you're right about the older kid flashing his dick. I guess that's just the world he lives in. Poor kid.

              ya, I didn't realize this when I first watched it, but once someone pointed it out on reddit, it's hard to unsee. it seems like there is a trend on here where everyone is so quick to debunk this site that they aren't even filtering through the evidence properly. why are people so adamant that this site is some prank/BS? Let the truth come out instead of making up your mind prematurely and trying to come off as some hoitey-toitey, holier-than-thou spotter of disinformation.

              We don't know for sure that's the kid.  But if it is, then the torturers use Robert Robinson as a babysitter of sorts.  I don't think Robinson even knows what goes on.  He doesn't have a very high IQ.

             Also, there is no time stamp? So even if the new video show the same children [and why should it exactly? I missed that part] the happy video could've been before the child was killed, roasted and eaten, for all we know.

              The way hes trying to get us to brush this under the rug with little to no evidence on his part is suspect as all fuck. The child was behind a frosted shower door the entire time. You cant make out anything out about him other then a blurry silhouette. Saying its the kid in the video he posted is completely non-sequitorial.

               It's an angry, raging, disassociated, possibly fueled up on drugs and alcohol, playing dominos in a strobe light room Podesta.  It's basically the election night voice but amped up a little bit.

                 Right?  I'm pretty sure that's what dominos is.  Some type of game that they play with trafficked children that is actually more like an intense hazing ritual where they can be the one in control.  And they probably get intoxicated while they're doing it and have a laugh about their stories. Who knows what happens to the kid once they're done with them, I bet they either use them for something or kill them off.

            Fartyshorts explained the original screaming video was on youtube for years and hashed over a lot. The fact that that video was one of two actually hotlinked from the fake site was a major clue. Nothing on there was illegal in any sense of the word. Just some really bad rap, crappy "mystery" videos, and the two videos that COULD be viewed as disturbing but contained no illegal content were the only two videos hotlinked. Only the creator of that site could have made them hot links. So people listening to the one would be too scared to DL and look at the others. Also probably collecting IPs.
           </p>
           <p>
            People don't seem to be able to grasp the asshattery in the hotlinking. Create toll site, hotlink two iffy videos, make people DL the rest to view...hardly anyone does out of fear...BOOM explosion of ZOMG. Those videos were taken off youtube where they've been the subject of speculation for years.

            We know that the lighting and chamber looks the same as in the CPP basement. We know the voice sound similar to Skippy, I mean John. We know the child called him John. Yet you think this is unrelated.  For now, I say this material belongs here. The child was not acting. This I am sure of. That site used a tormented child for what reason? This material belongs here, Podesta or not.

             I agree the child deserves to be helped regardless of who his abuser is/was. That's why I reported this, hope others will too because more reports might make them actually take a look at it.

             we have zero facts on this stuff. that's all we know. everything is pure speculation. I agree with you that the material needs to be fully investigated/debunked before anyone says it doesn't belong here though.

            Good work. Nice laying out all the steps involved so you don't get a bunch of deniers. I've been pretty vocal about saying I didn't think it was Pedosta, simply because of the way the video guy uses soft R's and Pedosta uses hard R's. If that's a Boston v Jersey thing, I guess that's what I was getting at.

              I just get the same mental objection between the "Yurr" and "Yaw". Pedostain has a very hard R at the close of words like Your, Here, There, etc. The video guy has a very soft R, almost to the point of not even hearing an R sound.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll add that it DOES sound like him, but that one thing has held me back from being convinced.

               People suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder can very well have a way of speaking that is unique to each alt. Alts have been known to speak with accents common to specific locations, although the main does not. It can be subtle, or it can be very strong. Even such things as an alt saying 'yins' which is a Pittsburgh thing, while the main would say 'you guys' or 'y'all' . 
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of the man in the video being John Podesta, especially knowing that he has openly admitted to having at least one alt. I think it would be necessary to find audio of SKIPPY and compare that to the voice in the video.

                Seriously, don't know why people are turning away from looking at the similarities between the voices just because "it's a Boston accent" therefore it CANNOT be John Podesta.  That's just shoddy logic.  Under that logic, I could rob a bank using a Cockney accent and therefore it's not me on the videotape because it's a cockney accent, right?
               </p>
               <p>
                I definitely think it's an alter ego, Skippy, combined with possible drugs and alcohol and incoherent rage that could produce any voice really.  If you look at the voice in the fatherhood video compared to Podesta's voice you will hear it is very alike

             No. He was like 8 years old. But you could HEAR his TEEN BROTHER (I'm assuming his brother) in the background yelling for the dad to stop abusing the little one. The kid in the alive &amp; well video appears to be the same kid being abused, maybe a tad bit older. Listen to the squeals, they sound the same.

              Looked more like a 3-4 yr old to me, from the profile of the child"s body. I have 6 kids. Kids internal organs are adult size by the time they are 3-4, thats why their abdomen is rounded out because their body has not caught up with their organs. I dont think he was anywhere close to 8.

              Could you time-stamp exactly when you hear the older brother yelling to stop and in which video?  I don't remember hearing that but I wasn't listening for it...it would be great to have an exact point and some words to listen for just to confirm thanks!

            kek.jpg in that given directory. I sense a 4chan meme data dump? Files are from mid 2015 though.

            The DHS Insider recently said there will be more data dumps to investigate for us. Probably its all out there, but the IPs/websites are going to be accessable once in a while. IDK

             It wasn't meant to be accessed - I found it by getting the IP address of whoever runs WorldCorpo.net ... so no I dont think this is part of any intentional data dump.

              I clicked through some of the images and files and it's a lot of crap... With that lack of server security it should have been indexed within minutes from some crawler and available through search engines. Maybe it's a cable modem and some dude's home-PC? I mean a reverse lookup of the IP give's me this:

             So here it is, all this going on and instead of tweeting about the video being fake - Podesta tweets something about UFO's being real!!!! Add 1 + 1 together. I asked so many mothers - trust me they know - they all said that child was terrorised, no way it was acting. Children cannot act terror - it will be fake, gigglish, there is a reason why children are given light roles. Child in the video cannot be more than 9, 10, no acting possible. There is something in the bathtub. Voice actually says 'I am your fuc$&amp;n father' - did that sound fake to you. I had no idea Soros has so many on his pay roll.

              Kid was around 3-4 by the body profile and the way his abdomen was rounded. I have 6 kids. Kids organs grow faster than their body so the have an outward rounding of the abdomen between 2-4. I'd say about 4, maybe 5.

              So we have to remember the full narrative from way back on the UFO subject. Specifically, THE LAST CARD narrative of J Allen Hynek to Carol Rosin. . (the false threat of UFO Alien attack/presence) It is relevant and I am seeing it surface now. I have personally  spoken with Carol Rosin and know that she is laying low in Oregon. She knows whats up.  This should be kept in mind at each mention of UFO presence by these guys (NOT to say that this kind of activity is not real, it is a complex subject that I am very familiar with. its personal. --THIS post is a word to the wise on the fear mongering that will be the 'last card' option of the elite. I think we have reached that apex in time so it follows they will pull this card at this moment. Watch it progress and remember this disclosure given by Rosin. Her life was ruined for speaking of it... This stuff goes deep but here is the gist.

               Devil's advocate time here: why would WVB tell such an important message to someone upon first meeting her?  Also, she has a pretty well-developed dramatic mode for a rando.  (Perhaps being a teacher helped her develop that, so it might be legit.)

                      He says "Fadda." What does that tell us?? (I'm southern and wouldn't know. Could be the Bronx for all I know.)

                       I heard "fatha". But it could be "fadda" which would for sure would make it a Bronx accent. Who knows. I highly doubt it's Podesta's. He's from Chicago and I heard exactly 0 Chicago accent. So this thing is just a distraction at this point. It's not Podesta so we should move on.

                             Oh don't worry Arthur they know where all of us live. I'm pretty sure Steve Feinberg and Cherberos Capital even own Voat. Everything anyone ever send across the wire is recorded.

            That's great they're alive, if it's them, but what loving parent subjects their kids to that?!?! Just because you don't see abuse happening all the time, doesn't mean it's not happening.

             Why doesn't Podesta tell us that. I want the voice analyzer to tell us that. Screams were too real, children cannot act!!!!!! Can't fool me. Show us the voice analyzer graphs. Voices sound too similar.

              The thing is, it's not some parent that's lost their temper, this is being done on a 'manageable' level for lack of a better word. Of course a parent can be this deranged, but the point is that when they lose their temper at their kid they themselves are usually unhinged and un-composed at the time, this doesn't look like that, this looks 'by design.'

             Even abused children will default back to being happy children when they can. Obviously they aren't being abused in this video but in the other one they were being abused for sure.

              Right, it's not like abused kids never have happy moments.  They recorded their playing around while Dad was away from the house.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for recording this video so we didn't have to click suspicious links...this whole thing is the perfect setup to get people to accidentally download CP or collect IPs etc
             </p>
             <p>
              (my time code references are based on your video (Sheilaaliens) btw not the raw video of the brothers)
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's a dump of autism:
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't think we can say it's the kids for sure.  Robert has tons (fucking endless) vids of himself and his voice (including his voice when he's upset) and it doesn't sound like Fatherhood or Each.  Personally I think the voice is WAY closer to Podestas (I think it's 100% him and that's CPP with the matching lights etc, but that's just my opinion).  But that guy with all his teeth is the scatfreak's profile pic and everything...where did you see weird strobing colored lights in this brothers video?
             </p>
             <p>
              There's just no reason to assume these are the same kids.  Why would this even be uploaded by someone?
             </p>
             <p>
              Is there anything anyone's noticed about the house?  Can we find anything in there to place it's general location?  What device is the younger brother playing with (could maybe nail down a year this was filmed)?  Can anyone tell what the thing o the fireplace is?  It's triangular with a flag folded on it...could we figure out what that is if it's some kind of award or something that could tell us who the Dad is?  Can anyone make out what the kid is saying at 9:10 if it would help us place the time?  At 9:57 does the older brother scold the couch kid by saying "SHANE!!!"?  If you pause at 10:13 on the one frame of the end-table with the TV remote that's only sort of blurry, there's a jug of juice similar to the jug of chocolate milk the pedo guy is drinking in the tub...often people will buy the same type of products so could they be his kids?  Do we know if he has/had kids?  At 11:47 the kid stumbles his words, it sounds like he maybe says "Chase" or "Jase(on)" (like maybe the older brothers name?) and then it sounds like he says "Mom" but then switches to "Dad's coming home soon"?  Can anyone make out what's being said?
             </p>
             <h1>
              <strong>
               <strong>
                And there are 3 brothers, not 2.  Listen to the audio and watch the couch kid's face...
               </strong>
              </strong>
             </h1>
             <p>
              At first I thought it was just the audio being off maybe even by a few seconds, but the rustling sounds of the older brother adjusting the camera at 10:33 end right when he's done adjusting it so there doesn't appear to be any audio mis-timing...
             </p>
             <p>
              Watch the couch kid through the whole clip, he's not talking when a bunch of the young voiced giggling and talking is going on, and at 10:33 when the older brother sets the camera down he says "quiet down over there" and the kid on the couch looks to the side.
             </p>
             <p>
              At 10:43 the couch kid is doing a goofy open mouth facial expression while you hear giggling, that doesn't make sense.  And then he lays on his stomach and you hear the voice of a kid laughing their ass off, which doesn't make sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              My guess is at that moment the older brother is off-camera to the right tickling or playfighting with another young brother...the way he's giggling and not running around the room I'd guess he's younger than the couch kid, maybe sitting on the floor.
             </p>
             <p>
              At 11:45 the older brother does a bunny stomp across the room toward where I'd guess the 3rd kid is and you hear him giggling away while the couch kid has a closed mouth and somber expression when he realizes Dad is coming home soon.
             </p>
             <p>
              But then at 10:15-10:20 you can pause and catch glimpses toward the fireplace and TV area and I don't see a kid there.
             </p>
             <p>
              But at 10:21 you hear the kid giggling away and saying "I wanna SEE!!" but the couch kid is just sitting there with a default facial expression, he's not the one doing that.  And at 10:31 that same 3rd kid says "OH MY GOD!!!" and that's when the brother says quiet down and you can see the couch kid turn to look.
             </p>
             <p>
              So my guess is there's a 3rd little kid and he's goofing around near the older brother's legs as he's fiddling with the camera THEN goes to sit in front of the TV to get play-wrestled with the older brother.
             </p>
             <p>
              It doesn't change anything really, I just wanted to draw attention to it incase it triggers anything for anyone else.
             </p>
             <p>
              So far we can conclude that this family has 3 boys and a Dad who leaves the older one to look after them while he's out (looks like daytime so maybe he's at work?  That would make it a weekday but then why aren't any of the kids at school?  That would make it more likely to be on a weekend...but the little one knowing when Dad is coming home makes sense during the week where Dad would be on say a 9-5 schedule, how would the kid know when Dad is coming home if Dad left on a weekend?  Could just be guessing at when Dad is coming back from picking up groceries or something, can't say for sure, just stuff to think about.
             </p>
             <p>
              Does Robert Robinson have kids?  Was he the guy with the YouTube channel that was complaining about being divorced and missing his kids?  I only glanced at that stuff so don't draw conclusions on that unless you know for sure, but if it WAS him maybe these are his last vids with his kids that he saved before a divorce or prison or something?  I don't know the whole Robert/scatfreak/etc story so someone else with a better understanding of him chime in here.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's good shots of the house they're in through the video and here's a bunch of personal pics of Robert (go through the whole thread), maybe that bathtub one is in here?  Everyone on this forum seems to fucking HATE him:

              Doesn't look like he's even CAPABLE of having a house let alone a clean one let alone taking care of 3 boys.  Skimming through the album he's been living in this shithole too long to have had a house with kids...maybe he had a girlfriend and the couch kid stumbling on his words when he says "Mom--Dad is coming home soon" was going to say "Mom's boyfriend"?  Like maybe those are his girlfriend's kids?  Is that reaching?  I have no fucking clue.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the very last page of that flickr gallery he has teeth and the 2nd last page (2910) at the bottom he shows close-ups of the holes in his gums where his teeth were and a bunch of bloody paper towels...he must've just got them pulled?  That would've been 2011.  No idea if that helps with anything.

              What the fuck even is this:

              I don't even know what I'm looking for anymore there's too much fuck this guy and fuck all of this I need a drink keep digging everyone...that kid's screams on Fatherhood and Each don't sound like acting and at some point an adult was participating in whatever the fuck that whole thing was.  Whether these are the boys are not doesn't mean it's not worth looking at and Robert's voice just doesn't sound like the one in Fatherhood.  That Podesta comparison is damn close and the strobe lights match CPP and we know they know how to do construction etc (wouldn't be hard to build a shower somewhere in CPP and you hear music in the background either a band playing or booming music).
             </p>
             <p>
              I just don't see this being something that should keep us from continuing to dig into whatever the fuck we've run into.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also I'm skeptical about this whole "the original audio's been edited and stuff added to it" etc thing some people are trying to push now...some of us were here grabbing the videos when they were first sitting in that directory, it's not like we can't compare audio if someone thinks there's specifically some part that wasn't in the original audio.  None of the people who say the audio has been edited seems to actually say exactly what was added/removed at what time-stamps etc for us to compare...and even then we can refer to the SilvaGunner analysis video on YouTube which has Each in it to confirm that Each hasn't been altered.
             </p>
             <p>
              So if you think the audio's been altered, tell us where and what so we can compare against the originals.  Otherwise that's coming off a little suspicious...

              <p>
               I still don't think this guy is the voice in the Fatherhood and Each videos, it sounds like Podesta to me, but why is this guy's photo in the OP's newly discovered directory?
              </p>
              <p>
               Not sure if there's other evidence Robert is connected to worldcorpo but a lot of the filenames on OP's URL are stuff like "get off my forum" and there's a bunch of meme pics etc, is it possible that whoever worldcorpo is just has Robert's picture from that hate thread at somethingsensitive forum and posts it as a meme pic around the forum?
              </p>
              <p>
               I definitely don't think we can say that it's impossible for someone to have that "private pic" of Rob...the guy has literal thousands of private almost naked pics of himself up so there's no guarantee that worldcorpo or the brothers are connected to him (that I'm aware of, there may be other evidence that I don't know about, a lot has happened the last few days) and again no evidence that the brothers are the ones from the Fatherhood, Each and Dad videos.

                That's a skinny fucking arm (just like Podesta), that's definitely not the arm of Robert Robinson who's been fat for pretty much forever.  There's no way that's Robert banging the broom in Fatherhood.

                Same fucking gross tub and facial hair and haircut as the pic in OP's video from this new worldcorpo site...time-stamped 5/15/2015.  You can see out the doorway that this is definitely not the house from the video of the brothers from OP's video.
               </p>
               <p>
                He's definitely not the guy from the Fatherhood video (Fatherhood video has skinny arms and sounds like Podesta not Robert) and unless he has a girlfriend with 3 boys, which is basically impossible because look at this freakshow, I can't see Robert having any connection to that video of the brothers.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think whoever worldcorpo is they probably hang on a forum that Robert was on (maybe even that somethingsensitive forum who knows) and that pic of him in OPs video is just something someone found of his that they saved to post as a meme...or maybe they're the person running that twitter account with the profile pic of the guy with all their teeth etc
               </p>
               <p>
                But I'd say it's safe to conclude that that pic doesn't prove that worldcorpo is Robert and I can't see how the video of the brothers could be related to him.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also he has a twitter account
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/augusta_maine">
                 @augusta_maine
                </a>
                and runs hangin-out.net a forum with a bunch of private areas that are probably full of pedos doing pedo shit.  Fuck this guy.

              This is just copypasta from the YT vid but PG has taken enough time away from all of us I'll wager so forgive me while I just ctrl-v..
Interesting and it's possible but I wouldn't assume that's the kid. Not sure if you have kids but when they are young and screaming at the top of their lungs they all sound the same for the most part. I'll give you the hair looks similar, it is a common haircut though. But the kid in the shower was significantly younger than the kid in this video. Could have been from before but I'm feeling this isn't related. Interesting but 'found kid alive and well' is quite an overstatement. Either way, if there is nothing to that abuse video why didn't the guy just respond to your email and come to voat and explain himself?

            everyone is talking about the fatherhood video because of the possibility of podesta's voice, but what about the dad.mp4( that was deleted, too) that depicts a child smearing what appears to be feces on himself while shivering in the bathtub/shower? that kid looked chubbier than this kid does. Maybe I'm misremembering the kid because I have no intention of ever watching what appears to be literal shit again.

             that dad video didn't run from day one. The minute that site was posted here I was on there reviewing the videos. It never loaded. However if there was a kid playing in shit, that explains the shit on the bathtub and the dirty underwear on another video. Someone probably took a video of their kid who shit their pants and cobbled it up into something else. But I never saw dad. It didn't run at all the day that site was posted here.

I honestly did not see any poop video
So again, the day the site went up, within minutes I was documenting each video. DAD didn't run.

              VLC Player ran it.  Why are you spreading disinformation like this?
             </p>
             <p>
              There wasn't any nudity in Dad.mp4 so I don't think it would qualify as CP, the kid had boxer brief type shorts on.  He looked to be in his late teens and had a skinny-ish build, and I remember him having floppy hair (there were lots of down angles where it covered his face).  He was shivering and looked forced to rub feces all over himself (seemed to be legitimately scared like the shaking seemed involuntary, but who knows).  He was sitting on the ground in a brightly lit shower (tiled floor square type shape, not a bathtub) and then it cut to him standing in the shower and you hear the shower running.  It was maybe 30 seconds long.
             </p>
             <p>
              He could be the older teen in the video of the brothers or whoever that Eli kid is, he had that sort of look.  But I didn't save the video so I can't rewatch it to confirm, and half the teenage kids out there look similar to that so I don't want to make any huge leaps of assumption.  If anyone could put it on YouTube it might be useful to analyze it now that we can pretty much confirm the fatherhood one is in a shower etc

               What I'm telling you is that on day one the Dad video did not DL, it did nothing. It was a dead link that was apparently repaired.  That's disinformation? There was nothing illegal on that website. Nothing. It was designed to be mysterious and compiled into something meant to distract. Gosh, it seemed to have worked. For all we know some tard parent was filming/shaming their kid with a poop issue. Jaysus parents film their kids in what others could perceive as horrific all the time. Example that horrid black mother who filmed herself kicking her wee kid out of the house and terrorizing him for voting for Trump at school.

                 Again, the very first day that site was on here that DAD video did not DL and did NOT open into VCL. I have not seen it, and only going off someone else's description. The entire site is either a troll or a diversion. You're completely welcome to keep wasting your time with it.

              that dad.mp4 video ran fine for me and was the grossest thing on that site and was just gone after a day. I don't know what to think, but my gut says it was legit CP that could get people in trouble. it wasn't a video where you only see a shadow and hear screaming. this was a close up of a kid in a dark bathroom/shower with only skimpy underwear on rubbing brown stuff on himself while shivering under running water. if it wasn't for the yelling sounding like john podesta, this would be the most notable video depicting something illegal/nefarious on there. it's too strange of a coincidence that it's gone. it's almost like they fucked up by uploading something that could actually get them in trouble so they deleted it. that's just my two cents on the matter. maybe it's all one big troll, but it's worth finding out either way. to add to my comment, that was the only video on there that made me go "did i just watch CP?" "Am I fucked?"

               If I'm thinking of the same video you are describing, and I'm pretty sure I am, I have it as insubordination.mp4 at 41 seconds in length.  I thought I was looking at an adult male, not a child.  It looked to me like some footage created for a C-grade horror film.  Looking at it again now, it does look more like a slightly overweight boy, perhaps.  It's hard for me to say because the video is so weirdly processed.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do also have a dad.mp4 with nothing in it (which, obviously, doesn't run).

               I've downloaded videos from the worldcorpo web site more than once; I don't know when I got this one.  I'd never heard of that site or any of this content before this week, though.  It was during this week sometime.

                ya, I remember you replied to me a few days ago saying you had the video of dad.mp4 saved. that didn't look like an adult at all. that looked like a husky, prepubescent 10-13 year old boy to me. that person was 90% body fat and looked like a child who has never exercised properly. there was not a spec of muscle definition or pubic hair indicating it being an adult for that matter on them IIRC. the only thing making me think it's some sort of spoof is how strangely it was shot, but these are sick fucks we're dealing with so who knows?

               There is actually a disorder children can develop regarding poop. hell adults can have poop disorders too. I once knew a hand pooper. Person would wind TP around their hand and poop in their hand. I'm not kidding.
              </p>
              <p>
               The whole website is designed to be provacative without breaking the law.  I honestly did not see any poop video except the one with poop on the tub and dirty underwear. It could be a mean punishment to a kid who has a poop issue. I don't know. Given the context it doesn't seem worth injecting into PG here. It also hardly seems worth the work of altering the videos except for the intent to misinform.
              </p>
              <p>
               So again, the day the site went up, within minutes I was documenting each video. DAD didn't run. and the only poop I saw was smeared on the side of a bathtub. Anything after that post was added. I summarized each video because people were terrorized (as was the intent) by the only two hotlinked (shareable v. dl) videos and they were "too scared" to listen to the rest of the hotlinked and "too scared" to DL the rest.
              </p>
              <p>
               After that the shit flew (pun intended) and the hotlinked video re fatherhood has become so altered it's barely recognizable from the original.

I agree with this which is why that video disappearing tells me it was possibly illegal. you seem pretty authoritative on this matter yet haven't even seen what in my opinion is the most disgusting video in question.

                 Whatever. please keep focusing on this. The video didn't disappear it appeared. It literally wasn't there the first day. The DAD link did nothing. I reported on that the very day the site was posted on here. It was added later or repaired along with a bunch of other stupid stuff meant to titillate the uninitiated. It's worked. Congratulations.

                 Ya'll still haven't figured out the hotlinking issue and why it's a giveaway. Trust me there is a b/tard somewhere laughing it's ass off at you all.

                  Listen man, the Dad video always worked.  When you clicked it in your browser it didn't work, it didn't work in mine either.  But if you loaded the video in VLC Player it worked fine (VLC can play slightly corrupted files that other players give up on) and a bunch of us watched it.

                   Again, the very first day that site was on here that DAD video did not DL and did NOT open into VCL like all the other videos did. I have not seen it, and only going off someone else's description. The entire site is either a troll or a diversion. You're completely welcome to keep wasting your time with it. Please feel free to explain the "coincidence" of the hotlinks. LOL

                  again, you are ignorant of the content yet play like you are some authority on it??? I even agreed it's probably just a distraction and some weird site that pushes the limits, but that video definitely worked for a bunch of people on the first day and your anecdotal evidence isn't doing anyone any good here. Based on what I saw, there is good fucking reason they deleted that hopefully not literal shit video.

                   The first day that video was posted on VOAT literally no one else DL the other videos. So for all I know the troll that made the site was LOLOLOL at how people were reacting, saw my run down on each video and my comment that DAD did not open at all in VCL and then they went in a fixed it. So whatever. NOthing on that site is illegal content. Trolls aren't going to UL KP and go down for that. SRSLY do you even Internet or are you pushing an agenda?

                    Ya'll is incorrect; it's a mistake a lot of people make due to 'll being otherwise universal (it's used to replace "will", with the apostrophe replacing the "wi").  The mistake certainly could be more common in some places than others, but the "aw" sound only occurs in "all", not in "ya", which -- when used as slang for "you", anyway -- is pronounced "yuh", not "yaw".  So "y'all" is a contraction of "you all" or "ya all", but in both cases, it's only the "a" in "all" which the apostrophe can replace.  If the apostrophe replaced the "a" in "ya", "ya'll" would then be pronounced "yull".  Nobody says it that way; it's "yawl".

               ya, the way it was filmed tried to make it look edgy and they went out of their way to not show the kid's face so who knows? it could be an elaborate prank, but how sick in the head do you have to be to even set that "prank" up?

             Well there's two kids, the younger one and the older one. Maybe it was the older one in the dad video? Maybe it was neither? But yeah that vid is extremely messed up too. I hope these kids are ok, regardless of if Podesta was involved or not.
