            The combative, demeaning, quick to libel others that research and post such is odd, and divides as not encourage people to want to join in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every past casecwas of a failure of not enough public, victims and researchers harmed, only a few fall guys busted with short elite jail charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if one does adhere to the fbianon writings, fbi anon repeatedly said sub sahara, conventions, etc that expand this much more than she is limiting the narrative. Sure Dupont research, and local bust; but as if that will stop this, nope. And all of this connects to mass corp and give systems in USA and abroad; USAID, cps, public healthcare, refugees, immigrants.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Dc area, clearly is into caucasion kids more than Haiti or Africa. The Ireland numln cases, clearly state that orphans sent to USA and is a huge area to research. The FBI operation has staff saying girls rescued are sent to CPS or Vista Maria; which is Good Shepherd, which is the same Ireland nun npos of the prfo, mass graves, both kids and impoverished females abused/slave work, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Haiti Survivor book, Let Haiti Live, mentions Boystown over 1000 times, starting with the South Fl location near the ports. Boystownn 11locations are more south, sent, Ne coastal and Vista Maria is more upper USA, Ne locations. Vista Maria/Good Shepard is clearly more DC, Comet types of Caucasion children they fancy. Alefontus and pals are posting white children, many with a European look. All cases relate, its all about destabile than SYSTEMICALLY route Dif types of children. That is, I agree with you; controlling narrative, combative to others helping with such consistent demeanings is not helpful. Nor, does it consider the dire affects and outcomes of every case. And a survivor has been posting on his blog that he and others fear the narrative, nonstrategy and dividing will only lead to more dire outcomes, and let the crimes, continue.

            For our benefit we better hope and pray there are elements of good which I believe there are in the FBI... not everyone is a pedo lover... it's just those at the top are able to overrule the lesser agents b/c they have power and use persuasive tactics and what not... of course many of them are likely implicated but the fact that they were able to expose the CGI and Clinton before the elections says there are elements of good.

            Yup, I totally already understand that dimension... It also freed up the Sarin gas so that it could go to the rebel groups that the US and CIA are supporting in Syria where they did the false flag chemical attack in order to induce Nato and the US to take action. Many goals were accomplished with Gaddafi's ousting, but I had never heard of the child trafficking dimension until now.... Very eye opening.

            It is about the big picture and the scope of it. When you want a case and get down to hard evidence, Benghazi might be a good place to start, bit that´s the job of prosecutors of the new administration.

             <p>
              Attitudes such as yours piss me off. Write one OK blog post and think they can direct the investigation.

               So who is paying you to troll? I have NOT written "one OK blog post". I have been doing this for YEARS, so why do you not find someone else to troll? YOU are the one insinuating it is a waste of time. I was being sarcastic, you uneducated fool. Now run along. This is a serious thread, not one for idiots getting paid $8 an hour to bug investigators.

                 Says someone who cannot spell. We know all about you trolls who are paid to try and discredit us. I do not give a FLYING FUCK what anyone says about me. This is not about me. You have no idea who I am, what I am doing, nor how I intend to do it. So run along and play somewhere else.

           <p>
            I think this means that the FBI physically retrieved a server and its hard drives from the burnt-out "consulate" building in Benghazi, as part of their investigation. Note, that according to the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigation_into_the_2012_Benghazi_attack">
             Wikipedia article
            </a>
            the FBI was the lead investigator in the Benghazi attack.

            FBIanon's goal was for Trump to be elected. That happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI (and other government agencies) have 100x more than we ever will. That have every email on her private server. We can continue to investigate for fun. But mostly we are waiting for AG Sessions to announce arrests and search warrants.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure if this will involve Comey being fired/arrested.

              FBIanon isn't posting any more. There are seven transcripts. The last was on Oct. 17. It predicted code words in the Podesta emails.
             </p>
             <p>
              On Oct. 30, the FBI Twitter account went crazy and it was announced on CNN and the Wall St. Journal that there was a massive FBI investigation into the CF.

               Yes, and a few days later that was dropped. I do keep up with the news, you know. (Did you think I did not know about Comey's letter, him saying they went through 650,000 emails in a week and dropped it again?

                No, Comey said that the email investigation was dropped. His letter was also worded very carefully to say that they only reviewed the emails during her tenure as SOS. The letter did not say anything about the Clinton Foundation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Let me quote FBIanon again: "The real point of interest is the Clinton Foundation, not the e-mail server. We received the server from Benghazi, then from the server we found data on the CF. Then we realized the situation is much worse than previously thought."
               </p>
               <p>
                "Killing HRC would not cause this problem to go away. The problem is with the Clinton
Foundation as I mentioned, which you should just imagine as a massive spider web of
connections and money laundering implicating hundreds of high-level people. Though I do
not have a high opinion of Hillary, she is just a piece (albeit a big piece) of this massive
shitstorm."
               </p>
               <p>
                "Mainstream media is shit. Who cares what they say. They are attempting to distract by
putting the focus on HRC’s emails and not the Foundation."

                 I believe I said that. Are we not communicating? And WHY would he mention the Clinton Foundation? That would have been STUPID! And I do not need you to quote FBIAnon since I already did that. AND, if you REALLY want to know who to blame, it is George Soros. Now why do you insist on telling me things I already know? I am looking for NEW information, not a lecture on things I know. I have a trip to prepare for.

                  Here's a timeline, since you seem to be dense and combative:
                 </p>
                 <ol>
                  <li>
                   In my comment above, I wrote "On Oct. 30, the FBI Twitter account went crazy and it was announced on CNN and the Wall St. Journal that there was a massive FBI investigation into the CF." I am talking about the Clinton Foundation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   You wrote in reply "Yes, and a few days alter that was dropped."
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   I wrote in reply, "No, Comey said that the EMAIL INVESTIGATION was dropped [and] [t]he letter did not say anything about the CLINTON FOUNDATION."
                  </li>
                 </ol>
                 <p>
                  Now you are saying "I believe I said that." No you didn't. You didn't understand that there are two different investigations, and Comey only dropped one (email server and classified information), and not the other (Clinton Foundation, corruption, bribery, pay for play, child trafficking, treason). Even still now, you don't seem to fully understand this. And that makes me doubt that you really read FBIanon, fully and carefully, or if you did, that you actually understand what he was saying.

            Gee, I never heard of any of that stuff. WTF is your problem? It is clear you are 100% anti-government, which would explain why you cited Occupy Wall Street, which makes me think more-and-more that you are a Soros shill. Everyone in the IC is not corrupt. PERIOD. FULL STOP. Now, if you want to start your own thread explaining to the world how we need to burn down Washington D.C. and put a despot in charge, go right ahead. But not here.

            It's also interesting that
            <strong>
             Beyonce
            </strong>
            emails John Podesta the DAY AFTER BENGHAZI.... asking if he will come join her to meet with Obama in NYC. The email is obviously written in a way to look like it's automated and innocuous, but the timing is WAY too coincidental. Perhaps they met and then John recommended to Obama to speak with James Alefantis on September 26th and 27th.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beyonce email to John Podesta:

             Thank you. Great point! We know she is involved in some capacity, we just do not know what. I will file that away in my mind as I continue digging.

            I mostly agree with what you're saying, but I wanted to clarify FBIAnon's role in this, because it's important that his leads stay in our focus as a community. It doesn't matter who he (or she) was, or whether or not he's really FBI or CIA or anything like that. What matters is that his leads, step by tiny step, seem to check out, and without them, this investigation wouldn't even be a thing. We got crucial information from a person (or even multiple people) whose identity does not matter in the least anymore. Someone said this before and I like it: if a homeless person whom you talk to every week keeps giving you the winning lottery numbers for four weeks in a row, do you, on the fifth week, reason about how he's just a homeless person and he's just larping, or do you go and buy a goddamn lottery ticket?

             I LOVE THE METAPHOR! ROFL! True, and while I have not been active on this point (as in writing posts), I have wondered myself why people are saying this, that, and the other person is FBIAnon! Who DOES care?! Does it matter? Maybe AFTER this is over. But not now. And you are right about his leads, which is what I just posted a few minutes ago to the person who mocked FBIAnon.

              I'll try to find an example... most of it is just confirming evidence and stuff we already know but you can see that since they have uncovered their President's Satanic cult which is forcing her impeachment process that they are just AWARE now and are truly interested in stopping this.

            FIRST! You cannot lump ALL FBI and ALL CIA into one category! That is like saying ALL blacks are this, and ALL Asians are that! I have posted umpteen times there is a war going on within the IC between the "good" guys and the "bad" guys.
Sure, someone can look into South Korea. But FBIAnon was quite clear that we need to focus on the Clinton Foundation, and he is right. I am looking at Libya/Turkey/Syria, and by extension Belgium and Haiti. Maybe a few others just to tie up loose ends. 
And you are an idiot if you question FBIAnon at this point. His July post turned out to be almost perfectly accurate. Why do you not do some research before discrediting things you have not even studied?

            There is a good cop vs bad cop war happening inside these institutions. I'm not sure if FBIAnon is a good cop or not, but there is potential that the argument he/she makes could lead into toppling everything as well if it is the pareto optimal choice.

            My fear is that what happened to Epstein happens again.... dozens of high level people are implicated such as Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz, and Bill Clinton.... and none of them go to jail for their heinous crimes against humanity.

            It's almost high noon to start taking street justice to the elites if this gets covered up and whitewashed under the rug.

            Based on the yelling in this thread... I'd call shill, or noob. I have no problem with either case, and tend to believe the latter, as it's quite obv.

            Another thing about #pizzagate, it makes you hungry for pizza (not THAT kind of pizza).

                 I am busting my ass. I will NOT be ready by the time I leave, but I have three days in transit. And I have always been good at learning on-the-fly. LOL! And, I am trying my best to be open-minded, but I must remain focused. When people try to distract me with side arguments having nothing to do with the Clinton Foundation I get extremely perturbed.  AND, thank you.

            So in other words Gaddafi had to go b/c he ended the human trafficking ring between Libya and Europe b/c this ended the $1 billion annual empire that the mafia (hence high level Freemasons and connected political elites) had connections to?

            Also, I'm just curious, what's your take on why James Alefantis would visit the White House on September 27, just 16 days after Benghazi? It's not like he has intel or anything.

             He is in on the pedo ring. And it was the 26th AND the 27th, as I said in my article. Obviously they were CYA meetings. It would be nice to subpoena the White House records and see to whom he spoke and get their recordings. Which we can do once we get the investigation re-opened.

              Thanks for responding. Do they record everything in the white house for private meetings? I'm honestly asking b/c I don't know, sorry if I come off as uninformed. And wouldn't these recordings be deleted by now?

               They are supposed to be recorded and saved. Eventually stored at the National Archives. They are subject to subpoena (with cause, of course). And, of course, we know they can be destroyed illegally. But, we have to try. And I thought I made the point about Gaddafi in the article, but maybe I was not clear. Hillary needed him out of the way, not only for oil and arms, but so the trafficking corridor through Libya could reopen.

                Thanks LaDonna, very very interesting.... I'll have a post to make later that will have some potentially interesting tie-ins from the infamous P2 Freemason-Vatican connected lodge in the 1970s and 1980s. These aren't ordinary masons they were all 33rd degree masons and one of the members admitted that in order to gain entry to the 33rd degree they had to commit infanticide.... a la Jimmy Comet's video about infanticide and the post about Moloch. Just all way too coincidental sort of stuff. This might potentially have an interesting tie-in. I'll link you when I make the post.

            This is not the right tactic. You cannot force the meme.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason is that Bhenghazi unfortunately is a politically divisive issue. The "left" will not join a "witch hunt" over Benghazi.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason #pizzagate has taken off is because it taps into a completely universal, morally unassailable, and therefore righteous position to oppose violent abuse of children. No one can realistically argue against this position.
           </p>
           <p>
            The way to get the broadest support for any cultural "meme" is if the issue is as simple and universal as possible, all principles of marketing and propaganda apply here. This isn't an intellectual exercise. Take the example of "Occupy Wall St." Regardless of your opinion of the actual movement, it was the largest political protest in history because it's "meme" was simply aimed at one thing 99% of people can identify with as being negative or evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            The efforts of the citizen intelligencia elite to direct the memes will fail, as the always do, especially by trying to redirect attention towards a highly intellectual "gun running" or "pay to play" scandal in which the audience or participants have to weave a mind-numbing tail of linked bank accounts and favor trading. Nobody will care as much about a topic as dry as this, as compared to the topic on which #pizzagate is focusing. Benghazi has no where near the emotional registry, or universal "appeal" as #pizzagate does.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no way to control a meme, other than creating a better one.

              's sentiments about anything with a potential to divide people being a bad idea. I also agree that we need to narrow FBIAnon's guidance down to a few key points, but I disagree that what you're suggesting should be the narrative to get widespread attention. We'd possibly be shooting ourselves in the foot.

               I encourage people who wish to investigate other things to do so. But we have time against us. Each day the people in Washington are victimizing more and more children. Hillary, Soros, et. al. need to be shut down NOW. Not twenty years from now when Soros is dead and God-only-knows how many children have been destroyed. Not only that, but more than a half million people are dead in Syria...and that blood is on Hillary's hands. Hers alone. Not Russia. Not Assad. Hillary Rodham Clinton. We need her locked away.

                We all want them to be locked away. But, from a purely economic point-of-view, even in the best-case scenario, we have a curve leading us up to the point of the first significant victory. If you want to help the children and everyone who's a victim of this horror, it is in
                <em>
                 their
                </em>
                best interest that you first accept the fact that for us to even have the chance to get there, time needs to pass and that means suffering and deaths that are inevitable. If, under time pressure, we make the mistake of going down the wrong road (that, say, alienates many people and divides the community), we may never have that chance at all. As brutal as it sounds, we're trading in a smaller number of current lives for saving an enormous number later. Our PR strategies are absolutely crucial in getting there, and a lot of thought needs to be put into them. I know the emotional pressure of this, especially for you as an investigator, is crazy huge. But let's not slip up and gamble away our chances. Just keep doing your best, and if we all do that, it will play out the best it can.

               Yes, but do you SERIOUSLY THINK WE CAN BUST EVERYONE IN THE DAMNED WORLD? In order to break a chain you only need to break one link. In this case, there will be about a half-dozen. Then people can follow-up. We have to FOCUS, or this is going to be a Ph.D. research project instead of an investigation leading to arrests and convictions!

                Many of these have already been busted. If we can connect the Norwegian pedophile scandal to people in the USA that are implicated in #PizzaGate, that would actually go a long ways to convincing the public that something nefarious is going on.

                  It is US authorities that tipped off the Norwegians.

                 <p>
                  EDIT: If you guys are connecting Benghazi to this that's up to you, but that's going to be seen by the public as political. Connecting a Norwegian pedophile ring to those within #PizzaGate would not be seen as political, and it would honestly be a dagger if we found those people being connected to Comet Ping Pong or something like that. I do agree we need to focus, that's why I argue against getting Sandy Hook conspiracies involved, but at the same time we shouldn't be so narrow that we don't follow good leads of convicted pedophiles at the highest levels in other Western countries.

                   I am not discrediting, denying, nor discouraging the Norwegian connection. But we need to focus on OUR end. And people have still not even caught on to the fact that CPP is not the center of this in D.C. From all appearances it centers around Dupont Circle, and hardly anyone is talking about that. One of many reasons I am on my way to D.C. People are ignoring leads because they are obsessed with that one corner on Connecticut Avenue.

                    I get that argument. And it's true to a large extent. I think the main reason is because it's easier since there are so many connections with Comet Ping Pong right now, but to some extent, that's why we also need to look at other leads and develop other connections.

                     Those ARE the connections. I have a list of properties in the Dupont Circle area owned by Alefantis/Driscoll and John Podesta. Have you ever been to Dupont Circle? On face value it is a paradox, and I wondered about it the first time I saw it. By day, it is just a section of D.C. where, on the weekends, the homeless are fed by different groups. By night, it is a homeless haven with people some of whom are enthralled with the occult. There is also a major tunnel entrance in the park. As the name implies, Dupont is a circle from which streets extend like wheel spokes. And everything surrounding that park is upscale. Multi-gazzillion dollar businesses. Someone needs to check it out.

                      The most interesting connection on DuPont so far imo is the Podesta/Alefantis/Arab Besta Pizza owner who also has ownership stakes in global shipping interests as well as connections to the Onassis Greek shipping family.

                      There are many links in this chain to attack but we have to remember a lot of them are mirages and that's where they want us to be distracted towards. It's hard piecing all of this together but thank you for your hard work and keep it up.... My other fear is that this is so systemically connected that it could be TOO BIG TO FAIL type of mindset (although I pray not)... the UK Royal family was implicated in a major child hunting club called the 9th circle satanic child sacrifice cult:

                      This stuff is so globally interconnected and yet it keeps getting buried by the MSM every time we come close to nailing them. There have been many child mass graves uncovered in the last couple years and no one cares... It's truly sickening of the horror that goes on behind the scenes. This isn't a made up story either or some alt net type of conspiracy theory, there are many mainstream publications that wrote articles on it. Godspeed my friend.

                       I am not talking about the company, though. I am talking about the area in D.C. But I realize the company was implicated a while back.

                      I was talking about developing the connections further. Yes, the Dupont Circle actually has been investigated to some extent, and there is some information within #PizzaGate about it. I encourage you to look up that information. But sure, it can be investigated further, as you are doing. Different people will investigate different leads, though, and that's a good thing. We shouldn't all focus on just the Dupont Circle.

                       Of course not. LOL But if kids are being trafficked, they are not disappearing into a hole underneath CPP or Besta Pizza. They are going somewhere, and they are getting there somehow. And, like I said, that is only one of the things I am going to be looking into. Yes, I have seen some. What I said is "hardly anyone is talking about it" not that no one is talking about it.
