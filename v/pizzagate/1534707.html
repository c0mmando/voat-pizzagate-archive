</p>
<p>Here are some definitions for generic terms: </p>
<p>**Occult **-- (<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/occult">http://www.dictionary.com/browse/occult)</a>) --  adjective  1.of or relating to magic, astrology, or any system claiming use or knowledge of secret or supernatural powers or agencies.  2.beyond the range of ordinary knowledge or understanding; mysterious.  3.secret; disclosed or communicated only to the initiated.   4.hidden from view.</p>
<p><strong>Ritual</strong> -- (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ritual">https://www.britannica.com/topic/ritual)</a>) -- The performance of ceremonial acts prescribed by tradition or by sacerdotal decree. Ritual is a specific, observable mode of behavior exhibited by all known societies. It is thus possible to view ritual as a way of defining or describing humans.</p>
<p><strong>Ritual sacrifice</strong> --  (<a href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Ritual+sacrifice">http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Ritual+sacrifice)</a>) -- a type of religious offering, or gift to a superior or supreme being, in which the offering is consecrated through its destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Freemasonry</strong> -- (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/order-of-Freemasons">https://www.britannica.com/topic/order-of-Freemasons)</a>) -- the teachings and practices of the secret fraternal order of Free and Accepted Masons, the largest worldwide secret society</p>
<p>Here are some more in depth reads if you\'d like more understanding of different religions, symbols, and practices:</p>
<p><strong>Kabbalah</strong> -- (<a href="https://kabbalah.com/">https://kabbalah.com/)</a>) -- is an ancient wisdom that provides practical tools for creating joy and lasting fulfillment. It’s an incredible system of technology that will completely change the way you look at your world.</p>
<p><strong>Thelemistas</strong> -- (<a href="http://thelemistas.org/en/Documents">http://thelemistas.org/en/Documents)</a>) -- Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O) -- (<a href="http://oto-usa.org/">http://oto-usa.org/)</a>) ---  is a religion based on a philosophical law of the same name, adopted as a central tenet by some religious organizations. The law of Thelema is &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.&quot; The law of Thelema was developed in the early 1900s by Aleister Crowley</p>
<p><strong>Satanists</strong> -- (<a href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/">http://www.churchofsatan.com/)</a>) -- Founded on April 30, 1966 c.e. by Anton Szandor LaVey, we are the first above-ground organization in history openly dedicated to the acceptance of Man’s true nature—that of a carnal beast, living in a cosmos that is indifferent to our existence.</p>
<p><strong>Luciferians</strong> -- (<a href="http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm">http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm)</a>) -- Luciferians view Lucifer as a spiritual and enlightened being. And while Luciferians do embrace the enjoyment of one\'s life, they accept that there are greater and more spiritual goals to be had.</p>
<p><strong>Demonology</strong> -- (<a href="http://www.deliriumsrealm.com/demons/">http://www.deliriumsrealm.com/demons/)</a>) -- Virtually all religions &amp; cultures have various supernatural entities that are considered malevolent or even evil. In some cultures, these may be simply forces of nature like hurricanes. Sometimes they are entities with capabilities for destruction such as fertility gods/goddesses. And in some belief systems, they are evil spirits hellbent on making one\'s life miserable. </p>
<p><strong>Witchcraft</strong> -- (<a href="http://witchcraft.com.au/origin-of-witchcraft.html">http://witchcraft.com.au/origin-of-witchcraft.html)</a>) -- originated with the human civilization itself. The fear of the unknown and its imagined role in making our day to day life easy or difficult, created witches and their craft. Even though witchcraft as such was practiced mainly by experienced and old women, men also practiced it. Witches were the mediators between the human beings and the mysterious super powers such as spirits and angels. When a witch succeeded in resolving the apparently mysterious problem of someone, the performance was termed as magic, a process that could not be easily explained away through any logical analysis. The witches prayed to the higher powers or the spirits for help and guidance in resolving the problem by performing certain rituals and the whole process was called witchcraft.</p>
<p><strong>Paganism</strong> -- (<a href="http://www.paganfederation.org/what-is-paganism/">http://www.paganfederation.org/what-is-paganism/)</a>)  --Pagans may be trained in particular traditions or they may follow their own inspiration. Paganism is not dogmatic. Pagans pursue their own vision of the Divine as a direct and personal experience. </p>
<p><strong>Illuminati</strong> -- (<a href="https://www.illuminatiofficial.org/">https://www.illuminatiofficial.org/)</a>) -- The Illuminati operates in defense of you and all humans, in all places, and of all generations. Our duty to this planet has spanned across centuries and survived even the most established government entities. But the cultivation of trillions of human lives is a daunting responsibility, and while the human would not exist today without our protection, many uninformed masses mistake our guidance for a restriction of liberty.</p>
<p><strong>Temple of Set</strong> -- (<a href="https://xeper.org/pub/pub_about.html">https://xeper.org/pub/pub_about.html)</a>) -- The Temple of Set is an organization with one task: to provide an environment in which individuals discover, pursue, and realize their unique purpose and destiny. Our philosophy holds that excellence and creative purpose are rooted in self-awareness, self-knowledge and self-creation. We name the experience of the willed unfolding of this individual potential Xeper.</p>
<p><strong>Santería</strong> -- (<a href="http://santeriachurch.org/about-santeria/">http://santeriachurch.org/about-santeria/)</a>) -- a religion that is capturing the interest of many people around the globe due to its deep mystical roots and powerfully visceral religious experiences. Santería, or La Regla Lucumí (or Lukumí) as it is more properly known, is one of the African Diaspora; religions spread around the world with the scattering of the enslaved African people brought to the new world. Santería originated with the traditional religious and spiritual practices of the Yoruba people of West Africa (centered around the modern day nations of Nigeria and Benin).</p>
<p><strong>Voodoo</strong> -- (<a href="http://www.livescience.com/40803-voodoo-facts.html">http://www.livescience.com/40803-voodoo-facts.html)</a>) -- Vodouists believe in a distant and unknowable Supreme Creator, Bondye (derived from the French term Bon Dieu, meaning &quot;good God&quot;). According to Vodouists, Bondye does not intercede in human affairs, and thus they direct their worship toward spirits subservient to Bondye, called loa.[11] Every loa is responsible for a particular aspect of life, with the dynamic and changing personalities of each loa reflecting the many possibilities inherent to the aspects of life over which they preside</p>
<p><strong>SCIENTOLOGY</strong> -- (<a href="http://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology.html">http://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology.html)</a>) -- Developed by L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology is a religion that offers a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of one’s true spiritual nature and one’s relationship to self, family, groups, Mankind, all life forms, the material universe, the spiritual universe and the Supreme Being.</p>
