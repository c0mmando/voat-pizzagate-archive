<p>Want to know how the Alabama election is going? The state attorney just filed an emergency motion to make sure they could continue to destroy electronic ballot records. You can’t make this stuff up.</p>

<p>No, you sure can\'t. And here I thought Jones winning had to do with the smug ignoramus Charles Barkley\'s endorsement, but that\'s me. </p>
<p>I really ddn\'t believe there were irregularities in the election. I figured the smear tactics won out, but then I saw a tweet giving the outrageous number of dem voters this time around ... and now this. Why would a court think it in the best interest of Alabama to destroy records? Why? </p>

<p>In final-hour order, court rules that Alabama can destroy digital voting records after all</p>
<p>Alabama is allowed to destroy digital voting records created at the polls during today\'s U.S. Senate election after all.</p>
<p>At 1:36 p.m. Monday, a Montgomery County Circuit Court judge issued an order directing Alabama election officials to preserve all digital ballot images created at polling places across the state today.</p>
<p>But at 4:32 p.m. Monday, attorneys for Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and Ed Packard, the state administrator of elections, filed an &quot;emergency motion to stay&quot; that order, which the state Supreme Court granted minutes after Merrill and Packard\'s motion was filed.</p>
<p>By granting the stay, the court effectively told the state that it does not in fact have to preserve the digital ballot images - essentially digitized versions of the paper ballots voters fill out at the voting booth - created today.</p>
<p>The court will hold a hearing on Dec. 21 about whether to dismiss the case outright. By that point the state will have had ample time to destroy the digital ballot images legally under the stay.</p>

               No, the amount is three times that so it doesn't qualify for an automatic recount.

               I just wish the battle was over and the pedos/Cannbal Elite were all in jail and the government drained of the swamp, but this is an ordeal. Moore was a shoe-n and KAPOW!!! Out of nowhere, skanks that are willing to lie for their Cannibal Queen. But now? Now? I really do believe it didn't work and so they relied on what they always rely on: election fraud.

                 And what makes Trump so great is that he knew what he was getting into and did it anyway! Don't know if I would have made the same decision. But I'm so thankful for the indie journalists. They've born the brunt of heavy censure/criticism and are real media warriors. While I'm at it, thanks to all of them for digging deep.
