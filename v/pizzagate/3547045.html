<p>Talks about one Deenis J. O\'Brien who donated 10-25 million and served as chairmon of the Clinton Global Initiave\'s Haiti Action Network.</p>
<p>O\'Brien\'s company, Digicell, received MILLIONS of US TAXPAYER DOLLARS from USAID (soros org) ostensibly to establish a way for idiots and &quot;immigrants&quot; to send donations directly to friends and relatives in Haiti.</p>
<p>O\'Brien is quoted as saying, &quot;“I know lots of people were asking: What on earth is a telecom company doing getting into the hotel business?” &quot;  Indeed.</p>

            Good post, thank you for bringing attention to this stuff, a lot of which I had forgotten about. I'd like to point out that in the digicell thread it says
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One of the first things that comes up when you google this guy is an article which details how the Clintons encouraged him to get into the Hotel Business in Haiti and also personally profited from the venture.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Well, this is most certainly NOT the case any longer. A simple google search for "Dennis J O'brien" now might lead you to believe the man never even existed...
