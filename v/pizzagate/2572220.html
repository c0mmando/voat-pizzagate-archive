            You people are amazing. Here we have actual evidence that the government has accidentally handed over at least 12 children to human traffickers for use as child labor.
           </p>
           <p>
            And you're attacking the people who come out AGAINST that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you FOR the government handing children to child traffickers? I have to assume you are for it, because I don't see any outrage about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you actually care so much about children being abused and used as a commodity, why do you do absolutely nothing about confirmed cases of it? Why do you instead "investigate" for years totally unconfirmed and implausible cases of child abuse?

              So now HRC runs ICE and HHS too? Under Trump? When ICE is enacting Trump policies? Do you have any specifics as to how the liberal deep state shadow government has implemented any liberal policies at ICE in the past year?

             <p>
              I love how if anyone says something you disagree with, you automatically disregard them as being a paid political operative. The people who are political operatives are the right wing conspiracy theorists here and on 4Chan. People who make up crazy stuff with no evidence, ignoring  any evidence of people who are actual pedophiles and child abusers.
             </p>
             <p>
              You don't give a crap about pedophiles. You just hate liberals and want to smear them. You've never gotten someone put in jail and you never will. But do you know who does jail pedophiles? The FBI. The law enforcement officers you smear and delegitimize and obstruct and want to dismantle.
             </p>
             <p>
              In early 2017 you right wingers were celebrating FBI arrests of pedophiles, crediting Trump for year-long law enforcement operations that were competed under Obama. But yeah, liberal politicians and LEO are protecting pedophiles. Sure.

                 Or maybe you haven't heard the fate of Robert L. Robinson. Convicted pedophile who raped a 13 year old girl while he was in the Philipines. One of my finest moments. He was a shill on this board...just like you. I found out who he was and starting investigating him. Tracked his social media for several days. Discovered on one of his own youtube videos that he was taking creep shots of underage girls and LAUGHING about how he got away with it AFTER being caught red handed. Tipped off the cops to get a warrent for the root files in his phone. They claimed they didn't find anything illegal, but it was too late. Made sure the public knew what he was doing. Street justice.

                  So, your "finest moment" was "catching" a sex offender who had already previously been prosecuted several times... you found him because he CAME HERE to you... you claim you sent the police to look at his phone and they found nothing, no child porn... but after having the police investigate and clear the man of the illegal activity you apparently wrongly allege he did, you mounted a vigilante campaign of harassment for someone without proof of guilt or an actual crime... despite multiple other people on this site calling it a witch hunt. The pedophilia allegation was never confirmed, and the pedophile was harassed but is still out there on the streets. If that's a finest moment, I'd hate to see your least finest moment.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What is it about you people being unable to describe your references? As usual, I tried googling for dog show incident and found nothing. My hunch however is that there were other people besides you independently complaining about other problems unrelated to alleged pedophilia, and you're taking credit for that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Either way, I still see no pedophilia allegations being confirmed, no children saved, no pedophiles taken off the streets.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I still have to shake my head at you all calling everyone a shill, cuck, etc. SIMPLY FOR SAYING SOMETHING YOU DONT AGREE WITH. I'm against pedophiles and hope they get caught. But you all are ignoring actual pedophiles and child trafficking. You're aattacking the FBI who are the ones who prosecute pedophilia, sex trafficking rings and child porn. You make their lives harder through that and by adding to the noise of tips about wild goose chases. Their forensics and other resources are limited, and paid for by our tax dollars.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Even if you had 2 success stories, you're still doing way more harm than good overall.

                   Wrong. The bastard was actually BRAGGING about how he was getting away with taking creep shots of underaged girls, even when he was caught red handed doing it. He routed his images to a root file in his phone, then uploaded those pictures onto the internet for other pedos to get off on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Robert now can't leave his house without getting attacked on sight. The public was just that pissed off after they found out what he was doing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, the "Dog Show Incident" is in reference to how Hollywood had to pull the movie "Dog Show" off of theaters and edit because of certain scenes containing pedophile grooming behaviours.

                   Obviously you were too stupid (most lefties are) to figure it out for yourself.

                   Don't worry. When pizzagate breaks, you will be revealed to the public as one of those who tried to cover for the pedo trash.

                    Oh, you mean "Dog Show" incident. "Dog Show Incident" doesn't mean the same thing.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The movie Dog Show got horrible ratings and was probably pulled more for money reasons.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Even if you did start a giant wave that spread to the general public and got the movie pulled, that didn't save a single child or catch a single pedophile. The segment from that movie was in poor taste, but it wasn't an intentional plot to groom kids worldwide to submit to sex, and wouldn't cause any kid to become groomed.

                    Talk about shilling -- you all have been pushing the fake Pizzagate story for 18 months based on non-evidence and hallucinations, and nothing has happened. And when someone actually goes there with a gun to investigate, when people find out there's no basement there, you always come up with improbable explanations that keep your hallucination going. "The CIA is helping to cover it up." Yeah, right. The Pizzagate story is never going to break.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Even if it was some big FBI/CIA plot, a bunch of Scooby Doo kids "sleuthing" on the Internet isn't going to beat the CIA. If the Presidend of the US can't do it, you certainly can't.

                    You should be able to tell from my writing that I'm not stupid. If you can't, that doesn't speak well for your intelligence. I don't watch TV and had never heard of some bad movie that was only out there briefly.

                    </em>
                    go Google "dog show incident" or "dog show" and see what comes up for you. Really, the problem as usual is the lack of clear citations posted here. "Google it yourself," yeah, no thanks.

                 Yup, i bash liberals a lot because they give me pleanty of reasons to. I also bash republicans when given the opportunity, i am an equal opportunity asshole. I do not believe that only liberals are capable of abusing children, i believe monsters are and you can be from any political bias and still be a monster.
