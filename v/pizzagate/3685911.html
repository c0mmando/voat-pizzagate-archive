            Hi! I'm new to voat but not at all new to this subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            It ties up so many loose ends, and connects nearly every topic I've independently researched.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just wanted to point out as of today, 1 month after this post, the WHO is claiming they may need to remove family members from their homes during quarantine.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also already stories being shared over social media of healthcare workers having their children taken by cps because of the contamination risk. It's happening, y'all.

            Is it possible that the extreme reaction to this new coronavirus (compared to the reaction to epidemics we've known about for years but which are not causing the shutting down of entire cities) ... is it possible that what is wanted from the extreme reaction that's being elicited is for zillions of people to be quarantined in millions of towns and cities? Maybe an effort is under way to change the way people have lived for thousands and thousands of years, so we no longer feel at home anywhere on our earth, and mostly stay in our separate shelters. Maybe this is another kind of operation like what the Y2K scare was, one result of which (possibly intentional) seems to have been to motivate people around the world to get their computers backed up for when 9/11 happened. Maybe now the effort is to have people mostly in quarantine for when some major upcoming surprise-disaster happens in the coming year or so.  Here's a well-supported report on plans to sabotage the 2020 election: https  ://  mintpressnews.com/   media-israel-intelligence-2020-elections-cyber-security/264361/   It's a joint Israeli/USA project, not just Israeli. Evil people of all kinds.

            Meanwhile little Susie or Bobby has recovered and has been sold off instead. No one is looking for them, and the urn on the shelf has ashes from the local vet or some nameless homeless guy that od'ed a few weeks ago.

             There was a video of 2 teenage girls being taken away. The officers wore facemasks amd had red armbands reminding me of Nazi Germany, but no hazmat suits or gloves, parents whom werent wearing masks at all were pushed back. The 2 girls were in pink PJs put up a fight.

            I heard from a mom in one of my mom groups that she has a friend who just started nannying for a couple who has two young children. The doctors were exposed to coronavirus and now need to be quarantined for 2 weeks and the nanny is freaking out because she just started the other day.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm thinking, wtf- no way in hell am I being quarantined away from my kids for two weeks. Definitely sketched me out.

             Exactly. If people are quarantined who's going to watch the children? The government? We know they are part of pizzagate according to many SRA survivors.

            According to CDC as of today, there are 6 deaths associated with COVID-19 in Washington state. One was 50 years old and had recently returned from China. Another death is of a patient from an assisted living facility. The total number of verified cases of COVID-19 infection in the US as of today stands at 100 TOTAL. Most who get sick recover. Deaths are usually associated with the elderly who have comorbidity states.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's put this all in perspective. The US estimates for Influenza are 310,000 - 560,000 hospitalizations and over 18,000 deaths during this Flu season of 2019 and 2020. More than 480,000 deaths annually in the US from tobacco related Illnesses. Hepatitis C kills over 10,000 with 1,000 needing liver transplants every year. Hepatitis B infects over 3,000 Americans every year with more than 2 million being chronically infected. 5,000 people a year in the US die from chronic hep B disease. The worldwide numbers are 257 million people have chronic hepB infection leading to over 850,000 deaths a year.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, taking in the whole picture, this COVID-19 outbreak is nothing as compared to other infectious diseases that kill millions every year. But, you won't hear anything, if rarely, on the news about those real epidemics. We need to step back and not be so quick to jump on the panic bandwagon. We have good policies in place to control the spread of infectious disease here in the US. POTUS is not worried and neither am I.

             Has anyone seen a "This is Mabel Johnson of Walla Walla who passed away from COVID-19" videos?  Usually, the MSM tries to personalize such crises in order to stoke fear in the masses.  To date, I've seen nothing to identify any casualties of COVID.

              I understand your concerns Patriot. I work in health care and we are not overly concerned as compared to all the news hype. And that includes alternative platforms. In fact, no protocols have been instituted other than normal infectious disease controls already in place for Influenza, TB, and the like. There are much scarier bugs we worry about.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have good controls here in the US. I am afraid that the crisis is being manufaoctured to create panic. Many, like myself, are coming out and saying just that. There are other agendas going on behind the scenes. We do not live in those countries taking advantage of their situations to remove those they have labeled as trouble makers.
             </p>
             <p>
              This crisis is DS ammunition and they are running low. They used a big gun with this crisis and it is running out of steam. Chinese companies are going back to work. Worry about the vaccines being made for this more than getting infected. That is where the real concern lies.

               It should also be noted that Hong Kong was not quarantined like Wuhan was, and protesting occurred in both regions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wuhan &amp; the Diamond Princess were quarantined and 5g was just installed city-wide and the ship probably had 5g too. I wonder if the 5g caused radiation poisoning instead as it shares the same symptoms as the common flu.

                I heard that the ship also had 5G. The symptoms are very easily confused with the flu. Except for the bleeding. I saw several videos out of China where people were laying in blood. Hmmm...

                  Hard to say what was really happening in China. I am not sure we will ever know for sure. There are a lot of moving pieces to all of this and we are not in the loop. And that is probably a good thing.

            The big flaw said plan has is the truth about corona virus.
           </p>
           <p>
            As someone who studied these sort of things, I can say that this virus in comparison to major diseases caused by viruses is a “weak little whelp”.
           </p>
           <p>
            The very definition of a “paper tiger”. Only 2% mortality rate with the bulk of the casualties being in areas with heavy smoking or pollution.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cabal is trying to SCARE people into panicking over a viral weakling.
           </p>
           <p>
            Knowing the actual threat level of coronavirus and spreading that truth is the best counter measure.

             I have asked you for medical advice a few times. I have trust in your comment. They are creating hysteria for a reason. I hear of lines in Costco for food and supplies. Now I hear on the news they are rushing this experimental vaccine. Huge profits is what this is about for Big Pharma. Some people may be so frightened they will accept a shot untested. Very scary. We can try to calm friends and relatives and help keep the frenzy down.

             Thats the thing though...don't think the cabal won't declare Martial Law/Quarantines over this. Im not scared of the virus. I know we can't underestimate the cabal and how far they would go.
