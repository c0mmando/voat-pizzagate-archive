            Here's another reveal in the form of a comment after the same Blind. Stephanie Seymour has been repeatedly papped with her 2 gorgeous sons when they were children and young teens as if she were their lover rather than a bio parent. It's beyond creepy. I
           </p>
           <p>
            Is Stephanie repeating the pattern of her young teenage years in which the owner and head of her modelling agency, close to her father's age, repeatedly raped her with full knowledge of all the other agency models?

            This is one of the Comments it really touched me:This is too fucked up! Children need to be protected. I have a friend who works against child trafficing in DC. I showed her the blind about Heather O'Rourke and she said she is sad to say but it was probably 100% true. She sees this shit everyday and then goes home to her family. I ask her how can she sleep and her response was " I get to see this scum of the earth put away. " Himmmm hope you are safe somewhere far far away. If you get time please let us know if it is HL and CS? If not, I want to know, they need to be exposed. Thanks Himmm thanks Enty. It's hard to read but if shit like this is happening it has to stop!   OH GOD I just know it has to be Sheen.  I hate him so.

             To whom would they report the info? Do you realize Good Samaritans must have substantial proof for LE to respond?

            <p>
             For numerous generations women have scolded others for speaking up, saying they should just suck it up and get on with their lives. As a society we blamed drug abuse and alcoholism on addicts' weaknesses. Never has there been an expose that it could be the result of intense childhood abuse with the parents often participating and/or refusing to stop it.
            </p>
            <p>
             In reality society needs a hotline where anonymous calls can be made and real assistance provided. This CDAN Blind, and IMHO Hmmm and his close buds should be credited with the very long series of reveals &amp; exposes, shares that the married spouses/partners of the perps did not want their children to go on trial and to be known as "the one" who had a really mentally sick parent. More victim blaming.

            One of the saddest Blinds I've read when you start reading the comments and realize posters in the know are outing many top level stars as potential serial child rapists. The victims at the time were a 5-year-old little girl/relative, and later a young boy/relative. Both kids have been in therapy for years and have had numerous suicide attempts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both the actor and actress were  married to others at the time of their shared addiction to watching child porn. Soon they started acting out their fantasies choosing those they knew. Spouses found out, filed for divorce including full custody of any shared kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is beyond depraved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess one of them finally has found her conscience and wants to reveal all. Her previous partner is threatening her financial and physical health &amp; well-being.
