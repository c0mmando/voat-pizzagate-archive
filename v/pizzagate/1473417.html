            They will sell it to the wider audience as a mere sexual preference. To oppose, you are a bigot. Exactly the same way how they mainstreamed the gay agenda. Rumors are floating that new legislation is coming in the USA with pedo as part of the new norm.

             IF you look at all the public names of Facebook posting on Comet Ping Pong with their support, this would not surprise me. But you know it seems even the Trump win did not stifle their dementia about who controls America, aka the people control it, and they going to end up losing whichever way they want it. A RECOUNT is sounding more and more every day like, "Ok, lets have a civil war, then I can legally shoot to kill you librtards"

            It would be pretty terrible for the LGBT community if TPTB tried to lump pedophiles in with them. Beyond religious dogma, it's not that hard to accept or at least tolerate LGBT people since they are not hurting anybody if they have relationships. If a pedophile gets the 'relationship' they want, it will involve hurting children, psychologically at a minimum and then physically/sexually at worst. It is that factor of harm that sets pedophilia apart. I can't imagine any remotely sane LGBT person wanting to be lumped in with pedophiles, but I can see them being baited into by TPTB, in essence, "We fought hard to make sure* you *were accepted, now you owe us." So it will be important for the LGBT community not to fall for that shit.

            They have literally been pushing to legalize pedophilia. They argue that children can make those decisions of 'who they want to love' but hey, if you can have a 5 year old say that they feel more like a girl than a boy, they can literally get a doctor to perform the gender surgery. It's happening. That slippery slope that everyone argued would never happen is happening

             No,  you can't. You can't get gender reassignment surgery until your late teens. The most you can get before then is hormone blockers. For what it's worth, most of my earliest memories (which date back to that age) are of gender dysphoria.

             Transitioning made me a way happier person and didn't harm anyone around me. Don't lump us in with these freaks.

               I'm not disputing that, just please don't think that there's some kind of connection there. Feel free to do the research yourself if you don't believe me either. The overwhelming medical, psychiatric, etc. opinion is not to do anything irreversible to trans kids until they're old enough to appreciate the gravity of what they're doing.

               I also should say that I have no doubt that many pedos look at the LGBT community and think we are somehow like them because of society's revulsion, but the vast majority of the LGBT community hates pedos just as much as everyone else.

             Now I can see an argument against permitting this until adulthood, but I am not a parent of a trans child, so I can't begin to understand why.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pedophilia, on the other hand, is literally rape. In better scenarios, the child "permits" it because they were coerced by a perceived authority (an adult). In worse scenarios, the parents allow their unwilling child to be exploited. Either way, it's sickening.

            I invented the acronym LGBTQP two weeks ago, got two twitter accounts banned for it and one facebook account. 
So if you looked it up and that is what they saying, can you prove coincidentally they been saying that for more than two weeks or you just made it up now? Got screen shots recorded or wayback to prove its older than two weeks? 
If not, then they invented it to stop my meme flying.

            Please do implicate the whole gay community in paedophilia.
That falls for the divide and conquer strategy of the powers that be. And hillary will get the whole media to say pizzagate is a conspiracy of homophobes so deranged they cant distinguish pedophilia from gay. Dont give her that ammo because you know the media will run with it
we need to assist the healthy (consensual adult only) gays to distance themselves from the Clinton administration.
Political correctness will be a deserving casualty of pizzagate, but we must be careful not to throw the Humanist baby out with the PC bathwater.
What I see in the future is a return to a conservatism so strict that harmless liberties you and i currently enjoy will be crushed as 'gateways to depravity'

             I don't know, where do you draw the line? What do gays have to offer to the community other than self-genocide of their gene pool? They don't pro-create.

             Women have done the same thing to themselves with feminism. There was a point where they really had gained some balance, just as homosexuals did around the same time. And then everythnig was about right, but then oh no, the feminists and the homosexuals wanted EVEN MORE, until its where does it end? PIZZAGATE?

             I know why the jews hate white men. Because we are the superior race .We make success while never lying. The jew makes success by always lying.

             Now blacks, blacks have not even had a chance in this century to see who they are in the modern age. And yet look they rule music. But they have not even had a chance compared to the rest of us.

            <p>
             So that is why I am talking just about this problem I accuse the jews of having with the white man.
            </p>

             Do you have a problem with the White man Mr Jew ? Do you want to take it outside? You know what happened last time we took it outside don't you.

This is a direct attack on Christianity.

                I dunno, you just seem to have a very reductionist view of race relations, and I'm unclear how that serves the purpose of child protection. I'm also unclear how an identification with Christianity is going to assist here given how thoroughly riddled with paedophiles the christian organisations are.
Just put the bloody children first. Not your racial ideologies or your christian sense of identity. If there is a God he will forgive you for putting the children first and staying discreet about your divisive certitudes

                 In the past two thousand years all the accusations of child pedophilia and murder have been leveled against the jews. There are countless books about it from over the centuries, because the appearance of mutilated children being found and the sudden disappearing of children happening was directly correlated to the movements of the jews. 
Its no coincidence John Podesta is a jew. Alefantis is a jew. Weiner is a jew .Epstein is a jew. They are all jews. You people are so brainwashed hardcore by jewsh Hollywood.

                 the line between pedophile and LGBT becomes blurred the more this LGBT community are pushing their boundaries. 
You go to the Comet Ping Pong facebook page and see hundreds of people supporting them - They seem unmoved when you show them videos of this Heavy Breathing performance there, and you have to try understand how can they be unmoved and still call or think this is a family restaurant for children?
You have to ask how did this happen, where these people keep pretending they are blind to the art that was on the walls, and to the comments that James Alefantis was making to these images on his Instagram account. You have to start trying to understand what is it that enables these people to think they have cover from it? that they can pretend its 'nothing'.

                 Its important to never overlook the fact that the United States of America became the most powerful country in the world as a Christian nation.

                 Imagine I showed you or published a video of a muslim cleric biting the clitoris off of a little baby girl, then sucking her severed clitoris and chewing on its remains. Would there be outrage? But when people see photos and stories of Rabbis biting the foreskin of a little baby boy and sucking his severed penis there is no outrage. 
You tell me? Is it true what Prime Minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon said?, "We the jewish people control America and the Americans know it."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Do you know what the jewish elite think of Donald Trump? They think now that he had married his children into prominant American jewish families just like they the jews marry their children into prominent families around the world, with the hidden plan to overthrow those elite families and the power of their nation. Why do they think that? Because that is exactly the MO of the jewish bankers for the last five hundred years. But they really think he did that on purpose. Then he wins over those jewish familes by being part of them, and then agrees with them about overthrowing the psychopathic likud terrorist regime of Israel. He is truly America First. But so now are the jewish families he has married into. He has shown them the way. 
Trump is not being bossed around by the jews -

                 They hate him. They are scared of him because he is America First. I tell you next year there will not be Israel's annual token donation of forty billion dollars from the US. How is it that germany pays to Israel every year 8 billion dollars for reparations for the 'Holocaust" but us Americans who saved their asses from the Nazis - according to the hollywood narrative - pay them on average 35 billion per year OFFICIALLY. But in fact we pay them EVEN MORE, all our conquests in the middle-east have been for Israel. Not for us, had nothing to gain from it for us - So we have paid Israel to exist long-term, over the last fifteen years, 6 TRILLION DOLLARS and HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES OF OUR AMERICANS.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think I need to reiterate here - Yesterday I finished dumping 1.8 terabytes on TOR of the international child pedophile blackmail archive off of John Podesta's servers. they going on and on about his emails. I have dumped videos of all the most powerful pedophiles in the world caught on camera cooking chldren, raping children, cutting their heads off. This people are going down. Its done. I prayed to Christ last night to let the enemies know they have no value in killing me now because I don't have the evidence anymore, the whole world has it. This was Hillary's Nuke Bomb codes for absolute power.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As they move towards total censorship of the internet through threats of imprisonment and economic sanction, then we must all move over to bitcoins and TOR. And we must teach everyone how to use TOR.

                 Donald Trump said he will be the greatest President of the United States since Abe Lincoln. I can tell you, he ALREADY is.
