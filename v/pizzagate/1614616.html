  'formattedContent' => '<p>I realize my account is brand new - I made the account LockeNKeynes about a month or so ago but can\'t remember the password for the life of me and didn\'t tie it to any email address.  I was going to just let this float by, but only found two other references and they didn\'t really take off.  Maybe it\'s nothing, but here goes.</p>
<p>So while at work today I was doing some work on a content manager that manages a digital messaging board.  On the desktop is a program called FreeMake Video Converter.  This is their <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIovKqrPPRAhXC3YMKHX-uApAQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ffreemake-video-converter.en.uptodown.com%2F&amp;psig=AFQjCNHykJk9JDHILluwVDVgBrRkE5FOBA&amp;ust=1486191341719188">Logo</a>.  This alone would be a little suspect but maybe just coincidence?  There\'s an interesting tidbit in their privacy policy though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170203061416/http://www.freemake.com/privacy_policy/">It has a section specifically about Children\'s Privacy</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Children\'s Privacy - Freemake website is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.&quot;</p>
<p>I\'m not sure i\'ve ever seen a website specifically state that it is not structured to attract children?</p>
<p>It should be noted that browsing multiple tech forums in reference to this program suite, many people have some interesting claims about adware type installs in addition to the Freemake program.  There\'s also a couple different tiers to the program it seems.  The Adware theme is constant though.</p>
<p>On their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FreemakeTube/videos">YouTube Page</a> they\'ve got several videos that have some interesting graphics.  Nothing too funky save a few things.  At the end of the video, &quot;How to Convert Video Free,&quot; at the 52 second mark there\'s a picture of the typical pyramid / all seeing eye with the text, &quot;In FreeMake We Trust.&quot;  Their Freemake Music Box video also has some interesting artwork going on, though nothing specifically stood out to me on that one except for the unique fonts and animations with quite a few swirl designs.  
</p>
<p>In multiple videos the phrase &quot;I Love PSD&quot; &quot;Life with PSD&quot; pops up.  This phrase seems to reference advanced photoshop skills, but when searching the term I noticed a couple of the initial search results referenced the group that seemed to appear in the freemake YT videos as well.  <a href="https://vimeo.com/16080050">Vimeo link - &quot;I have PSD&quot;</a>.  Mostly a completely innocuous and tame video save for an odd picture that doesn\'t really fit the scheme at 27 seconds.  He has a folder highlighted here.  When searching that folder\'s name there\'s quite a few pictures of children that initially pop-up.  Almost all of them come from a single photobucket account.  <a href="http://s296.photobucket.com/user/crankycrankerson/library/Gee%20-%20Constant%20Murders%20%20-IL-?sort=6&amp;page=1">This Photobucket account</a> contains many pages of what seems to be missing person\'s cases.  Most seem to be fairly young, 18 and under.</p>
<p>The account also relates back to several other social media accounts.  On these accounts are some interesting messages such as: My mom taught me how to cook a roast</p>
<p>My dad taught me how to change a tire.</p>
<p>Together, they taught me how to harvest a drifter\'s kidney&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you get abducted, they\'ll use those duckface selfies to find you.</p>
<p>moral: never stop doing duckface, even chained in a basement&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You\'re SO funny
do we bang now or later?
what\'s accounting like?
this basement is dark
stop stabbing me&quot;</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is pretty weak by itself.  The logo, child privacy policy, all seeing eye reference, and photobucket account were the things that stuck out the most to me.  The photobucket account is INCREDIBLY loosely connected.  I just got click happy in the search results, but the path that led me to it still originated from the Freemake videos.</p>
<p>This is the parent company of Freemake <a href="https://herdprotect.com/signer-ellora-assets-corp-112147eafc4a57ee6f337ba0e16bcccd40d0.aspx">Ellora Asset\'s Corporation</a> as it\'s pointed out <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1512656">In this thread from a month ago</a>.  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/13101+W+Washington+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90066/@33.9941399,-118.4406652,190m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2ba8a156cf4ef:0x62cf925090291d99!8m2!3d33.9942339!4d-118.4410402">This is the GoogleMaps location of FreeMake\'s headquarters apparently</a>.</p>
<p>It\'s entirely possible i\'m just suffering from confirmation bias, but seeing that logo on a work computer piqued my curiosity so I thought i\'d do some basic searching just to see what turned up.  I\'m more of a lurker than anything else, just waiting and hoping on that Session\'s confirmation.</p>',
