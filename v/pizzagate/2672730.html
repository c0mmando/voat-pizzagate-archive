            Just made a video about her death. I am just beyond sad when I watch her videos and hear her voice. She walked through the fear but it wasn't like she know what she was up against. I think I had a few exchanges with her on here and others that I trust here really liked and admired her. Now I know why, or I better understand who she was. I had no idea she had been a police officer.

             Capital Heights has always been known as a sort of no-go zone. No use heading over there unless your stopping in a Home Depot or something in the middle of the day. In fact, most of PG County is undesirable. Bowie is not so bad, but lots of opportunity crime at the malls; you got to go to Harm City (Bal) for some real gang-banding. In PG every six months or so, a major story breaks on .Gov corruption.
            </p>

             That's a crummy place (CH Raddison) to stage yourself. Cost? In my other posts I speculated that if she settled a PI case (personal injury workman's comp) for a high figure b\c of the major back surgery like that is going to cost close to six (6) fig. Take that x pain x lost wages and your looking at a substantial WC case. So...she leaves CA b\c (as friend and former Fed) her life was in danger and is able to ...what...perform her own private investigations (leveraging her background) on her dime. Shit, cash doesn't last long. 100K doesn't last long...
            </p>
            <p>
             I was re-reading the Dutroux Affair (see here:
             <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/belgian-x-dossiers-of-the-dutroux-affair">
              https://isgp-studies.com/belgian-x-dossiers-of-the-dutroux-affair
             </a>
             ) and the patterns seem to all replicate the same structure EVERY SINGLE TIME. Generational abuse (targeted for f-Up'd baseline psychology)...kids from broken homes (BoysTown, CPS ect) , recruitment into the network, blackmail, torture and folded into the the superclass elite networks, mind-control (spycraft) then plied to create MPD\DID, elaborate structure such as complicit banking and shadow systems (see Dope, Inc.), compromised and participatory institutions (judges, police, high-ranking officials). At EVERY turn the victim is throttled &amp; discredited (more pain on top of an already unbelievable tragedy to most folks ), combine those head-winds with a complicit MSM and massive dis-info systems set up like the False Memory Foundation (a sham that has enlisted top Uni Psychiatrists...the same jackasses running MK that received funding\grants from who? The Company? ....(imagine if that story ever hit MSM. The same highly-regarded academic PsyDoc that ran the entire dept, well-published for sure and well-known internationally, wholly complicit human trafficking and experiments to be discarded like trash. .Gov dis-info structure and the Uni gladly took the money...#WEKNEW) Reading the Dutroux Affair this template is spelled out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, I believe until there's a bunch of good guys with enough resources and know-how, the tactical and operational means to provide a real underground railroad system and safe houses, redundant asymmetrical cells and finally a death by a thousand cuts, will be the only way to bring down the %1 percent that participate that are assuredly pathological is going to be difficult. But, the Dutroux Affair is a good learning template.  The %1 isn't so special. The good will eventually crush them into the ground. The elites conducting any business whatsoever with what this group and many others are discussing, don't belong on Earth...as Trump said: Fast Trials...Death Penalty.
            </p>
            <p>
             All this bla bla...but I hope JM had amassed enough damning evidence that a viral fire will start and what few good guys within an agency that have the Presidents back will begin the clean-up. It's no wonder Trump has the Deep State, MSM and the establishment against him...he's just like the victim fighting head-winds. What Trump doesn't have against him are a shit-ton of American people and patriot military.

              Excellent post, chalk full of info. Love that you drew comparisons to the Dutroux Affair. No time to celebrate however as I feel time is running out, especially considering 5 G and what that may do to harness free thinking

               T Paine had (if its not already brought into the threads) post today on his Twitter account and up on TruePundit. A captured audio via free-conference call with Farmer J? and JM. Conversation leads off with the same "playbook" (lets just refer to it now as the PEDO PLAYBOOK so that a redundant theme\meme is reinforced to all of the ANONs) about intergenerational "targets" as being the PRIMARY supplier and pipeline of victims, outside the otherwise ratlines into third world shitholes such as Haiti et al exploited by NGOs, Human Trafficking "SAVIOURS" that have flipped the script and so on. JM speaks of the same incompetence &amp; failures of .Gov agencies that since 9/11 WOKE time we've all known about. Incompetence comms, corrupt "blackmailed" high-ranking officials providing cover and misdirection. She doesn't get into (during this 35 min convo) anymore detail about this latest and most damning of all time CLINTON victim is protected (for good reason) but more importantly...how a kill switch will activate redundant systems to get this info out. THAT is going to be the biggest of all challenges b\c every damn system in place is against it. The whole house of cards FALL.

             Great you are making a video. I tried to get her reinstated. She was allowed back one time. Then I was banned and allowed to come back and then she was banned again! They would not answer inquiry why she was banned. Jem was so disappointed. I told her they are compromised in that mod pod. Too many great researchers were having their work deleted. She was my hero. So brave, such a bad ass. I will miss her.

             How old was she? Her latest vids don’t demonstrate ailments but a scared as hell person... unless you can FOIA examiners report your just grabbing at straws ... why don’t u ANONs fire up Judicial Watch to run this to ground... get some horsepower behind it. If she was in PG (I can ask my Captain budy in PG and former Bal swat) where she got steered to. The women deserves it.

             Just like Las Vegas right; the most sophisticated commercial entity to have their own SOC center. Where are the vids? How many people died? Is it in the news? Was it a mirage? Why has MSM forgotten? The whole event as told is irrational.

            jem777, her last Task Force video was made outside the courthouse where the Manafort trial was taking place. She claimed that Manafort's  illgotten gains from. Ukraine activities were related to child trafficking.  This  video might have been second to last,  with the airport video #5 re: her research, PTSD being the very last.
           </p>

            Until there is an autopsy, there is only speculation as to the cause of her death. Rumors re suicided,  massive seizure, etc. should all be taken with a grain of salt. And how can we count on a reliable autopsy out of DC?
           </p>
           <p>
            If AreWeSure  really threatened her, then I apologize for defending him at times. Why would Vindicator ban her?

            This is not a game. This is an awful development.  During my activist days in the 70s, two of my colleagues in two different states were murdered. Some folks at my employment began wearing bulletproof vests. I had small children and thats when I got out and left the state.  I will pray for her.

            This is terrible. In germany a guy got killed a month ago. He was researching pizzagate too. He told his mother he found some terrible proofs pizzagate related and that he thinks he's in trouble. A few hours laters he was found dead. The police told his mother it was suicide. He jumped from the last floor in his hotel. His laptop was taken from the police. Now his mother is investigating.

            Another thing is, he got immediately observed by the hotel security even he entered the hotel and wanted to check in. So they knew he will check in there. You can see the video here:

              You guys don't get it..  You think were all here to put together some rock solid, evidentiary based court case.  PG could have been about spreading awareness to the SYSTEM controlling all of it.  This understanding does not come in documents and property records.  It requires lots of thinking outside the box and speculative inquiry that opens new doors.

               Why is it that you aren't willing to put the speculative stuff in the speculative sub and the source-backed research in the research sub? I really don't understand this at all.

            She was way too young for it to be a sudden natural death in my opinion. She was also in the witness protection program. George Webb is a high profile target and she was with him daily. The autopsy may come back normal. But we all know how that goes...
           </p>
           <p>
            I’m not the craziest about George Webb anymore. But his emotions were real. I have compassion for him. He is hurting. They were good friends. I stayed in touch with Jem on Twitter. They had a lot of fun together.

             Thank you.  She said that we were on some list of people to watch. I honestly think they try to take off important things on here.  Very sad when kids are dying. I trust you, Srayzie.

            ... Jem777 told me that there were only 3 people here that she fully trusted and you were one of them. I hope that gives you some comfort.
           </p>

            I made this comment in another post. I’ll repost here...

            Omg! That is so sad 😢
           </p>
           <p>
            I’ve known this whole time that she was Task Force and with George Webb. But I didn’t voice it publicly because she didn’t want everyone to know. She was really active here until she left and joined him.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Jem777">
             @Jem777
            </a>
            and
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/mej777">
             @mej777
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            She used to say that she was gang stalked and that she was leaving, and being put in the Witness Protection Program. She left California and joined George Webb and stayed with him until now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since she was in the witness protection program, she wouldn’t show her face on video. She always said they were going to come after her. She said her fiancé was murdered 7 years ago. 🙁

            Who banned Jem777 and what was the official reason from Voat? Thanks.
Edit: Looking further into this it seems that the ban on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Jem777">
             @Jem777
            </a>
            was exercised by

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Two questions:
           </p>
           <p>
            1.Does
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Vindicator">
             @Vindicator
            </a>
            still hold ability to ban users?
           </p>
           <p>
            2.Can we see a list of all bans/mod actions the user
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Vindicator">

            Bless her soul. I still remember her being banned and not understanding why. Now, I read that other people I thought were great researchers are potentially compromised. I am grateful for all the hard work put in by many researchers...I’ve said it a million times since pizzagate broke, but I’m gonna take a break and focus on something else- or nothing at all for a well. Everyone be safe

            Wisc is corrupt was a regular at glp for years. I can't post there anymore but maybe someone should ask around and see if anyone has heard from him over there. I remember his avatar from years before PG. Odd how something has kept many of us in the same crowd through the years ..

             I haven't heard from them in a long time either....Their account always made me feel like they weren't just a regular person here. You could not find the account unless they were active and you clicked their name in a post or comment, then their page wouldn't show the history of any of the stuff they posted.

            alrighty then last night i checked my instagram and there was a disgusting human skull being eaten by a flesh eating disease at the top of my feed and a picture of ethan and hila klein underneath it i posted a pic from 4chan on their twitter after they were banned for interviewing alex jones they are lucifierian child raping pedos and a lot of people would have seen that pic. next minute i have a notification that my apple phone has been hacked from the netherlands. then last night i opened my instagram on my phone to that. i dont follow them so that was planted. if thats jut a taste of the tip of the iceberg when you start to uncover these pedos then its just too terrifying to imagine how people like jem777 were being stalked and harrassed we all put ourselves at risk when we dig for dirt on these people but if you're like me its not voluntary its a compulsion to expose pedophilia at all levels all over the world. you know there were rumours that george was mossad but that was probably a smear campaign during pizzagate. i cant imagine what kind of threats fiona barnett has been receiving since she returned to the arena it breaks my heart that we are all targets for the massive pedo ring that has its grip on the world

             weirdest thing that happened to me about a year or so ago, was I was lazily using my phone and I posted a link (about a (((country))) organ trafficking) then I got a phone call from a weird number i answered it my phone went dead, battery completely gone and so was my credit, weirdly the number was shown and was from somewhere in Turkey. I heard it happened to someone else, but the link between us seemed to be criticism of Israel rather than pedogate directly.

               get Tails for serious browsing and its like it never happened, its a live environment. And maybe switch to Linux Mint as a main os, WaterFox as a browser and startpage as a search engine. and both Tails and Linux Mint can be booted from a usb too if you absolutely have to have windows but if thats the case id have that looked at, lol.
If your hesitant of learning a brand new OS then i would advise creating a bootable Linux Mint usb with persistence (your disk space will be limited) but youll get to try it out, and its like having a laptop you can take with you to another laptop. Its easier than it sounds. safe and secure and stable.

He didn't find her - he couldn't even be bothered to go over there.  I bugged him for 2 days to check on her - he called the hotel, and they went into her room.  George has done nothing!!﻿

            Don't know the particulars but that comment above was posted on her Bitchute site "3 hrs ago". It seems like doing this kind of work requires a buddy system that checks in more frequently than every 2 days.I feel so sorry for her, she was an impassioned warrior.

             I banned her because she kept submitting threads that didn't meet our evidence requirements. I tried to work with her but she didn't think the submission rules should apply to her. She didn't give me much choice. I did not ban her alt Mej.

              I dont recall any of her Pizzagate submissions poor or otherwise.  Nor do I like to speak ill of the dead, especially if she were murdered. But I did read and listen to some of her TaskForce  material. She did feel.entitled to be believed because of her background in law enforcement.  And she does claim she has documents to back her statements but she never reveals her hand. And her knowledge of certain  activities cuts such a broad swath when its not possible to be everywhere over the globe witnessing such activities.  Nor does she provide any documentation of her assault by 4 men, not even a redacted police record or redacted medical record.  So she is a mystery and thus a challenge to mods.

               If you had hard evidence of systemic corruption and were under constant threat to your person and your life, would you go handing out that evidence on the internet? Where would you even begin to disclose it?
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: If she had what she claimed to have, which if murdered for having it or doing what she's doing it leads one to conclude she did, I don't quite think you're seeing things from her perspective. What safety net is there for people to bring forward things like that?

                You’d take everything OFF LINE and first figure out the capabilities of research \investigatve tactical force and replicate a scattered redundant cell structures. Look these are supposedly the same dumb asses that a bunch of rag heads commander planes into the WTC, unless of course, said pathological humans behind the scenes are just evil. Emergence is the antidote of chaos and also the end of chaos and human misary. They can’t control evo and life force trajectory.

                What many people don't know or realize is that her boyfriend was murdered as well.  He was also a Whistle blower.  She lost someone near and dear to her.  Her strength came from her loss and her love of her country and Our Children. Thank you for speaking for her.  Now that we are all aware of her death and what she has experienced, how many would disclose personal information.  I agree.

               did nothing wrong. People have stooped so low to be taking an opportunity like this to give him the guilt trip. Should he never ban someone for violating rules because someday, they could die? What if that happened to one of the people you went off on. Be above this Ian.

               My feelings aren't really relevant, here, are they? It's terrible a pg investigator has died. If she was murdered, it needs to be investigated.

                lol   'IF'   yeah... it's DC, dude.  Have you not learned after all this time how things work there?  Did you watch the video with Webb and how suspicious he looked there?  He dropped the dime that lead to the discovery of her body in an obvious plausible deniability maneuver, too.  I can trust that you won't be doing much investigating, but get the flair up there !!!

                 That is just so much shit, Ian, and you know it. We have an entire anything-goes subverse set up for those who don't or can't meet the main sub's submission requirements. The submission rules + speculative sub system is what the majority of users have wanted from the beginning of this sub, and

                 have repeatedly given folks the opportunity to change that and chose not to. Jem chose not to respect that repeatedly and instead of changing her ways when banned, complained to other users and tried to organize a campaign to get her unbanned, all the while making excuses about why she should be held to different evidentiary standards than everyone else. It was shitty behavior then, and this crap from you is shitty behavior now. You tearing apart this sub and attacking me to vent your toxic spleen is not going to help bust any pedos.

                  And c'mon, MF was a cancer and everybody knows it. He made many people frustrated and was absolutely censoring people for arbitrary reasons and had a hidden agenda. In hind site, it's reasonable to assume it was more about WHAT she was posting that was concerning him.

                  This is the only sub on voat with these multiple restrictions. Whether or not they have improved the quality of the subverse is absolutely up for consideration and subject to opinion.

            A screen shot of George Webb's text says..."Task Force went down swinging. Not a suicide." Marianne Barnard also has a Tweet and screen shot of a DM that Task Force (Jenny Moore). I thought I read that she was law enforcement moved into witness protection. So..this happened in Washington DC..what today? No news

             Out of all the people he's named as conspirators, not a single one of them is a Zionist, said no one ever.
            </p>
            <p>
             Apparently he stated he was in Mossad early on, then later, he explained that he had said that to get Mossad like people to talk to him. We have no idea who George really is, but he obviously knows a lot about everything and everything he says seems to come true. I have noticed he has certain methods that go way above the average reader and I think he's actually trying to help... I don't believe most of the people who wanna complain about his "Mossad activities" because those people always turn out to be CIA paid operatives and shills. You can tell by their actions.

              When I first clicked a link there was no description or name of it, so I had no expectations coming into this video, when that other dude finally got there I felt the same way and was like wtf are they talking about this in that way?  And wasn't sure if they weren't being real. Weird.

               Webb puts on the glasses because 'I'm embarrassed' and then quickly takes them off after wiping a tear that is not there.  He placed the phone call for the motel manager to check on her?  Plausible deniability set up. He immediately is writing her obituary and claiming they were all fighting for the same thing.  That is a veiled threat to all others. SHADY!
              </p>
              <p>
               I never trusted Webb and called him out on YouTube several times, way back around day 40. His answers were weak and evasive.

            Sad, sad news. Her partner, Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt did a lot to educate me on the criminal hub of Racine. I tried to reach out recently to corroborate some research and never heard back. I'm very concerned for all involved. Thanks for the update, despite the nature. My thoughts are with Jem777 tonight. May you rejoin the cosmos from which we've come.

             Obviously you can't do solo research ops and cite Dept of State, Beltway contractors and folks in high places without a system in place; like cells, redundancy, security and serious encryption tech.

              W_I_C all but spelled it out. Sometimes cryptic, I know. Key terms that person used were sustainability, community policing and secret societies and their connections to corporations like Johnson &amp; Johnson. W_I_C lead me on a Q-esque trail of info that had me looking into fraternity chapters and children's organizations and businesses like daycare and healthcare. What I ended up reading was sometimes a dead end, but often clicked into clarity. A lot of these functions are based around the Root River. Red Cross, United Way, Historical Societies, fraternities of middle-eastern influence and Nazi old guard. Its all there and its pretty undeniable that the concentration of questionable organizations exists in such an exploitable region. (Think Greats Lakes, shipping routes, local population heritage and small scale testing of 
agenda 21 tactics.

            Are We Sure sent death threats to her last year. Looks like that fucker went and carried them out. Anyone in contact with a hacker? Cause its time to retaliate.

              Yeah, that doesn't meet Voat's definition of a death threat. The sitewide anti-censorship policy forbids mods to remove comments as threats unless they would be considered illegal speech in a court of law. Basically, unless the speaker makes a direct, personal threat along with info showing they know exactly who a person is in real life and where they can be located, Voat considers it figurative speech.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jem/Mej, if you consider that threatening, I don't think you have the constitution for a full, unlimited speech environment.

              has some soul searching to do and Voat better damn well be assisting with investigators to reveal the identity(ies) of are_we_sure. This isn't a fucking game.

              It is not my style and there was not threat.     If anyone wants to see the thread or discussion where the mods tell her it was not a threat, you can DM me, it's still up on VOAT, but I won't post it publicly.

             I dont think it wise to retaliate. There is alot of viciousness here and all over the Internet that is not a bonafide threat, just ugly manners and poor upbringing. No one should be doxed.  Truth Will Out, I honestly believe that. We might have a Seth Rich situation here and we will just have to wait.

              Thank You!  Funny thing, my husband and I were just discussing the bathroom bill yesterday.  What a HUGE miscarriage of justice.  I think a couple of states have abolished it.  We should push the other states to join in.  Would be great if we could get half of them to turn it around.  It's probably a Badge of Honor for BO.

            Dear god :( Poor Jem777.... I remember her and stood up for her when she was banned. Did you see what her last comment on here was?
           </p>
           <p>
            "I have actual documents. When my life is no longer threatened I will produce them. They are in safe places." Jem777 had something. She was banned her and now killed.

             He was a regular at glp for years. I can't post there anymore but maybe someone should ask around and see if anyone has heard from him over there. I remember his avatar from years before PG. Odd how something has kept many of us in the same crowd through the years ..

             She had told me she had Dead Man Switches in place.  I had not spoken to her in a long time, but she was passionate about her work in DC. She was a gutsy, bad ass. I remember when she was jumped outside her place by four people. They beat her up and they stole her car keys. They started taking her car and she ran back to her car pulled opened the driver’s door pulling the guy out punching him in the face.  At that point I thought she was a guy.  She was pissed. The cops found her car later that week, if I remember.
