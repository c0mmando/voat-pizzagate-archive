<p>Andy Stern was former SEIU president... SEIU dumped tons of money into the Dems....It is also interesting how he is considered one of the top 10 most powerful people in healthcare. Basically there was trouble for &quot;hiding&quot; 50,000 in a layer\'s trust account and internal SEIU locals fighting....here\'s a snippet from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stern</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Political influence</strong></p>
<p>During the years of Stern\'s leadership, the SEIU became the largest political action committee in the United States,[36] and funneled vast amounts of financing to the Democratic Party and its candidates, far outnumbering the contributions of other unions during the last two election cycles. SEIU contributed $65 million to the 2004 presidential campaign of John Kerry.[37] The union spent another $85 million on Democratic candidates in 2008; $60 million going toward the election of President Barack Obama,[38] with a significant chunk of that money funding door-to-door canvassing and other GOTV efforts,[39] as well as voter registration.</p>
<p>Stern has been the most frequent visitor to the White House since Obama\'s election.[40][41] Between Inauguration Day and February 23, 2011, Stern visited the White House 53 times.[42]</p>
<p>Stern is referred to as one of &quot;the chief architects of healthcare reform&quot; in Modern Healthcare magazine, ranking in the top 10[43] of the 100 Most Powerful People in Healthcare. Stern has been named to Modern Healthcare\'s annual &quot;movers and shakers in healthcare&quot; list for five years in a row. SEIU poured millions into a group called Health Care for America NOW!, which, at times, fought strongly for universal healthcare including single payer. Stern was an ardent supporter of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[44]    iconOrganized labour portal </p>
<p><strong>Controversy</strong></p>
<p>&quot;He\'s arguably the most important labor leader we\'ve had in a long time: aggressive and controversial,&quot; says Philip Dine, an authority on labor issues and author of the recent book State of the Unions.[45] On January 27, 2009, SEIU placed UHW West under trusteeship and dismissed 70 of the local\'s executives, including president Sal Rosselli.[46][47] Rosselli and other ousted leaders reformed under the National Union of Healthcare Workers and pushed for UHW West members at 60 facilities to vote to decertify SEIU.[48] SEIU filed a lawsuit in mid-2009 alleging that UHW West and NUHW officials embezzled millions of dollars.[49] In 2009 Former Labor Secretary Ray Marshall issued a report, &quot;Acting as hearing officer, Mr. Marshall found that the local\'s president, Sal Rosselli, and other union officials had improperly transferred union money to a nonprofit group to use in a feud with the parent union. Mr. Marshall also concluded that the local had wrongly hidden $500,000 from the parent union by placing the money into a lawyer\'s trust account.&quot; On March 26, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court ruling that a jury awarded, &quot;... individual judgments ranged from $31,400 to $77,850, and NUHW was assessed damages of $724,000&quot;.</p>

<p>And this a huge strange coincidence.... a Bob Mook that works for cclp.<a href="http://cclponline.org/team/bob-mook-manager-of-communications/">http://cclponline.org/team/bob-mook-manager-of-communications/</a> it isn\'t the same Robby Mook nor does he appear to be related....odd nonetheless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_Mook">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_Mook</a> and some more insight on him in this <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/robby-mook-hillary-clinton-campaign-manager-profile">article</a></p>
<p>From the nonFBIAnon post:</p>

<p>Please look more into the dates/times of SEIU events around the time he died.
Also realize that you are taking on an octopus that has its tentacles in every aspect of politics,but if you keep pushing the head will be cut off.</p>

<p>One other thing to note of importance found in the<a href="4http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/126633206/srg-seth-rich-general-seiu-edition"> 4chan posts</a> is specifically the salary increase notice for the local SEIU 722 around the time of Seth\'s murder because of the contract ratification <a href="https://seiu722.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/160713salary-increase-mwhc.pdf">https://seiu722.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/160713salary-increase-mwhc.pdf</a> the same SEIU 722 that was 2 miles away from the murder scene as well <a href="https://voat.co/v/SethRich/1889667">https://voat.co/v/SethRich/1889667</a>...the local 722 received raises as they renewed the medstar contract.
Now, if Medstar Washington Hospital Center is in fact where Seth died at, it is pretty interesting considering the local 722 already had a contract,but it was ending...so they ratifed the new one around the time of Seth\'s murder...but the key thing is that they would have already their SEIU officers/security in place at the hospital! </p>
<p>Another thing I thought might be of significance is the annual art show the SEIU puts on, why art?</p>
<p>And now we turn full circle:
SEIU was seeking to help in Haiti  <a href="http://action.seiu.org/page/s/helphaiti">http://action.seiu.org/page/s/helphaiti</a>...and we all know about Clinton in Haiti.<br />

            What an excellent piece of work

            , well, well, well done !! Having just read through it all, goodness, when they say 'the deep' they're not exaggerating, are they.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears there's nothing that the SEIU aren't involved in. The Haiti connections you've found are intriguing and alarming, and the powerful Andy Stern appears to be someone we should all be aware of.
           </p>
           <p>
            What stood out is Andy Stern's connection to Colorado Center on Law and Policy (CCLP), and the Bob Mook who is the communications director.  Well spotted there!  He could be a relative, as you mention? I found his page on the CCLP website -
            <a href="http://cclponline.org/team/bob-mook-manager-of-communications/">
             http://cclponline.org/team/bob-mook-manager-of-communications/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The salary raise looks like it could be extremely important.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Now, if Medstar Washington Hospital Center is in fact where Seth died at, it is pretty interesting considering the local 722 already had a contract,but it was ending...so they ratifed the new one around the time of Seth's murder...but the key thing is that they would have already their SEIU officers/security in place at the hospital!
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That the salary increase was announced for one area, the local of 722, at the time of SR is very interesting point, and could well be the lead Anon is alluding to? It's an SEIU 'event' in SR's locale, around the time, which leads us to the leads you've found here.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point I feel we should keep digging, and collate all our research on SEIU.  I'm gathering all of it together and will make a megathread with everyones posts and findings. This one of yours is first on the list : )  Keep digging my friend, and please ping me if you find / post anything else and I'll add it. Kudos to you!
           </p>

             Yea, I was thinking that but this art is amateurs. Wondering if they use it for a cover to move items or something. Seems like the ENTIRE SEIU does the art shows by the workers.
