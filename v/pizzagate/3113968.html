             Former Labour peer Lord Ahmed, 61, appears in court charged with two attempted rapes of girl and indecent assault on boy under 13 in the 1970s
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Lord Ahmed has appeared in court charged with two attempted rapes of a girl and an indecent assault on a boy under 13.
            <br/>
            Wearing a white shirt, black suit and tie, Lord Ahmed spoke only to confirm his name, age and address but did not enter a plea during a short 10-minute hearing.
           </p>
           <p>
            He appeared today at Sheffield Magistrates Court beside his two brothers who were arrested as a part of the same investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mohammed Farouq, 68, is accused of four counts of indecently assaulting a boy under 14 between 1968 and 1972.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mohammed Tariq, 63, is charged with two counts of indecently assaulting a boy under 14 between 1970 and 1972.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pair, from Rotherham, South Yorks., both pleaded not guilty to the charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            District Judge Tanweer Ikram said: 'I'm going to bail you to appear in Crown Court at Sheffield.
           </p>
           <p>
            'If you do not attend that is an offence in itself.'
           </p>
           <p>
            All three were released on bail and will appear at Sheffield Crown Court on April 16.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ahmed was born in Pakistan-governed Kashmir but his political roots are in Rotherham, where he grew up and still lives.
Educated locally, he joined the Labour Party at 18 and served for a decade on Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council.
           </p>
           <p>
            After studying at Sheffield Hallam University, he ran a chain of shops in his home town and became a property developer.
He was made a life peer in 1998 and made regular appearances in the media, where he was often called on to comment on issues facing British Muslims.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Of course.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Ahmed resigned from the Labour Party in 2013.
