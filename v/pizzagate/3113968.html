            This post is very important, since it's another case of a local councilman having been involved in rapes.

             Former Labour peer Lord Ahmed, 61, appears in court charged with two attempted rapes of girl and indecent assault on boy under 13 in the 1970s
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Lord Ahmed has appeared in court charged with two attempted rapes of a girl and an indecent assault on a boy under 13.
            <br/>
            Wearing a white shirt, black suit and tie, Lord Ahmed spoke only to confirm his name, age and address but did not enter a plea during a short 10-minute hearing.
           </p>
           <p>
            He appeared today at Sheffield Magistrates Court beside his two brothers who were arrested as a part of the same investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mohammed Farouq, 68, is accused of four counts of indecently assaulting a boy under 14 between 1968 and 1972.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mohammed Tariq, 63, is charged with two counts of indecently assaulting a boy under 14 between 1970 and 1972.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pair, from Rotherham, South Yorks., both pleaded not guilty to the charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            District Judge Tanweer Ikram said: 'I'm going to bail you to appear in Crown Court at Sheffield.
           </p>
           <p>
            'If you do not attend that is an offence in itself.'
           </p>
           <p>
            All three were released on bail and will appear at Sheffield Crown Court on April 16.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ahmed was born in Pakistan-governed Kashmir but his political roots are in Rotherham, where he grew up and still lives.
Educated locally, he joined the Labour Party at 18 and served for a decade on Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council.
           </p>
           <p>
            After studying at Sheffield Hallam University, he ran a chain of shops in his home town and became a property developer.
He was made a life peer in 1998 and made regular appearances in the media, where he was often called on to comment on issues facing British Muslims.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Of course.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Ahmed resigned from the Labour Party in 2013.
