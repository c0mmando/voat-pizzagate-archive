            woud like to Add, New Mexico has tons of "adoption" agencies including:
All age adoptions plus
la-familia Namaste
Christian childrens home
LDS Family services
christian child placement services
           </p>
           <p>
            there are many others, but these are the ones that stick out the most on google maps. Also, one of their main lines into New Mexico comes from Ohio, a place called "house of samuel"
            <a href="https://www.houseofsamuel.net/adoption">
             https://www.houseofsamuel.net/adoption

            My fiance` was trafficked through this place. all the over flow, they send to NM, AZ, TX and CA.

            here is my post about her experience and it's connections
           </p>
           <p>
            call it personal.... but i think my girlfriend is one of the children who was trafficked in the united states. it's been a nightmare to get any of her paperwork including birth certificate. she was purchased by Pastor Mike Haggard ( FB-

            ) from a now closed "adoption" house in Texas called House of Samuel (

             https://www.houseofsamuel.net/adoption
            </a>
            ). the adoption was HIGHLY illegal given he was a convincted felon. he proceeded to sell her out, and abuse her sexually himself...just his profile picture is enough to send off red flags. before his profile went friends only, he had several references to pizza parties at his church nights, as well as sleep overs in the church with the Pre teens and teens. he has embezzled, flipped churches for cash, and ran through 4 different states to avoid being stagnant. the guy is a clown, in the literal sense since he graduated from rodeo clown school.. been banned by the courts from seeing his grandchildren on his adopted son's side (Stephen Haggard FB -

            house of samuel is owned by Jim and Candy Barr, but was run originally by Jenny woods out of Phoenix Arizona where we met. something that bothers me is the blank page that is part of the house of samuel called "enriched and explorer's club" which as we all know is code from NAMBLA and several other Pedophilia groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            Candy L. Barr had a lawsuit in ohio at some point for personal injury against a B&amp;B where her and her husband frequent. a place called "Applellees" owned by a "water edge retreat" in Ohio. (

            I think New Mexico is a hotbed of trafficking. Epsteins racnch El Zorro is a CIA "brownstone" operation and a billionaires playground where children are ordered by the rich and flown as captives to their owners.
           </p>
           <p>
            The New Mexico Goverenor was embroiled in a huge scandal where she called 911 intoxicated involving some type of strange party.

            If everyone remembers Governor Susana Martinez of NM who is a republican was against Trump and he spoke out directly to her with aggression about doing her job.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone jumped on him then and HRC took her side.
Maybe Trump knew it all along
