<p>W. Lewis Amselem is now a retired senior U.S. Foreign Service officer. In 2009 when he wrote that email, Amselem was the head of the U.S. delegation to the Organization of American States (OAS). It is said that Amselem had concealed the identities of individuals, one of whom was a U.S. national, who in 1989 kidnapped, tortured and raped Diana Ortiz, an American nun in Guatemala.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder what other  Foreign Service  shit   he was involved in that the public hasn’t known about?</p>
<p>Amselem  attempts to make a joke by  titling his article with the word  \'\'stooopidity\'\'  to downlplay  any seriousness and put the stupidity and shame-guilt on  the reader who interprets it as anything but a joke.<br />
His blog url title  makes a bigger  joke of it by spelling it   oh-stoooopidity.   
</p>
<p>Yeah,  we get it,  you\'re trying to belittle people\'s intelligence and call them   stoooopid  for thinking you\'re anything but ethical, upright and   funny!   I see Amselem has been   trained very well in the art of  shame and guilt, and if he can\'t use intelligence or reasonable logic or rational  to excuse himself he\'ll just belittle   normal  ethical people\'s  I.Q. </p>
<p>The problem is that   the name  moloch has been verified with  Bohemian Grove, and private politics for over a century. <br />
Moloch just isn’t a household name that average people would know anything about, unless they’re politicians who know about Bohemian Grove activities involving moloch.    Even Christians who read their bible rarely know about Molech,  so it\'s difficult  to excuse the name as a joke for many reasons.</p>
<p>But seriously,  even if a person did know about moloch - who says that!   These people are removed from the norm  and that in itself seems to be their norm.</p>
<p>It just isn’t even a joke that  NORMAL  people  would find funny,  unless you’re a  Lewis  Amselem,  Cheryl Mills,   Hillary Clinton type who knows about  the Bohemian Grove Moloch activities.  
</p>
<p>Below is a link of  Amselem’s  degrading     attempts to secure his innocence while demeaning anyone who doesn’t share his humor.   
</p>
<p>The comments are interesting, and I’ve never  in my life read information written quite the same way as his blog followers….  They have a very specific writing style, which all appears to be similar to each other.   
</p>
<p>Notice how  Amselem  completely  shuts down a comment  about Diana Ortiz.</p>
<p>All these people need to be investigated,  and now I’m beginning to see a bigger picture as to why it’s not.

Oh, the Stooooooooopidity!!!! 
Quick note.</p>
<p>I have been hit by some nasty digital comments re a memo of mine that appeared in one of the Hillary &quot;What Difference Does it Make?&quot; Clinton bathroom closet server dumps. A few of my things have shown up, but this one in particular seems to have attracted the ire of some really very stupid people--people who prove that not all stupidity comes from left field. You can go here and read some of these comments.</p>
<p>They respond to a little light-hearted unclassified note I wrote years ago when I served at the OAS (Organization of American States) and sent to the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs (WHA). You can read that ancient memo here in its full leaked glory. The original recipient sent it to Cheryl Mills and others in the Hilary inner circle, and, apparently, it went on to the then-Secretary of State where it lodged in her illicit server.</p>
<p>The memo concerned the state of play in long-forgotten talks on Honduras\'s political situation in the wake of the removal of their President by their courts and their military. The note was written after a very long day (18-20 hours) and had as a closing line, &quot;With fingers crossed, the old rabbit\'s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .&quot;</p>
<p>It seems some people, to judge from their comments, take that line literally, and as proof that I was somehow involved in a Satanic cult at State.</p>
<p>First, let me reassure one and all that no chicken or rabbit was actually harmed in the writing of the memo. I, in fact, do not have a rabbit\'s foot, and, furthermore, did not sacrifice a chicken in my backyard to Moloch. While I have eaten a lot of them, I have never sacrificed chickens, goats, lambs, or cattle to any idol or false god in my backyard, or anywhere else . . . way too wasteful of expensive protein.</p>
<p>Second, I was not involved in any Satanic cult at State--they wouldn\'t have me because I did not belong to AFSA (American Foreign Service Association), AKA, the &quot;union.&quot;</p>
<p>Third, I did not then nor do I now worship at the altar of Moloch, Ba\'al, Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness, Satan, or at that of his representatives on earth, the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Now, please . . . move on!

            I never assumed they were literally going to sacrifice a chicken after this email, what I questioned was, why is this the sense of humour there"? You don't really just come out with this stuff, unless its on ur mind, it made me think that somebody in that circle talks about it or something.

             I knew that there are groups who do this kind of thing, and I knew about the history / rumors of Bohemian Grove and Crowley, Santeria (which michelle obamas mom is said to be involved with) and other kinds of sexual rituals involving children,  so to me it just confirmed, because like you I think normal  people don't talk  obscure Moloch  jokes unless they're  educated about it, and if they're educated about it they wouldnt joke, unless it's an inside joke.... cause that shit ain't funny.
