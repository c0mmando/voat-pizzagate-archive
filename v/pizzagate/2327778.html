            The legal system in Canada is TOTALLY fucked by Masonic obligations. It is a massive problem, since even just one or two of the Judge, defense, prosecutor, or investigator being a Mason means they'll be obligated by their vows to tank the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evidence of this happening:

            - interesting case where it was brought up in the court room
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly you will have a very hard time making it through the entire legal system without running into this. You might get a good investigator, and a reliable lawyer, but be totally ruined by a Judge or prosecutor working to destroy the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anything, your best bet is publicity first, and legal recourse once public opinion is guaranteed to be on the right side. Make them pay for tanking a case, make it very known and unquestionable that there is solid proof those events happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you share any info about perhaps what province she was in or what sort of criminals were connected to her trafficking? Canada has a HUGE PROBLEM with this but I don't see very much discussion here at all. There doesn't seem to be enough dot-connecting in terms of the Golden Rectangle (Buffalo, Niagara Falls/Toronto, Montreal, NYC) of trafficking (Gambino Crime Family, Ndrangheta, etc. are big here) or shipping in the Great Lakes, or using the Foster care system to steal kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            We'd all be very grateful if you could share some leads...
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: To be clear, I'm not saying it's impossible to get a legal case happening, I'm saying it strongly depends on what jurisdiction it is in. Depending on the province or city, you can either have a totally normal and proper legal handling or you can be the one who gets the "mole" assigned to your case at some point along the line. If you can't share information due to identity concerns, then try investigating similar local cases or find a way to convey some information about the circumstances anonymously to give a starting point?
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT2: By "publicity", I also mean trying to connect to other instances of abuse or find other victims. Obviously for most, leaking information about your case will link directly back to you. Not great if anonymity is desired. Linking to other cases hides your identity within the web. Find patterns about one case and use them to find others. Did it happen near a military base? Trenton? Did it happen in a military family? Any Masonic family members? Was Foster Care and the Child "Protective" System involved? Or the Catholic Church? Perhaps it occurred in a "new age" commune in BC? There's a lot of ways it can happen that are related to systemic causes. Very helpful to identify what those systemic causes are.
