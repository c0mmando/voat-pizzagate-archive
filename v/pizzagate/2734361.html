<p>Court documents show 80-year-old Arthur J. Perrault was arrested Thursday in New York, and has been charged with criminal aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact in assaults that federal authorities say happened at Kirtland Airforce Base and Santa Fe National Cemetery.</p>
<p>He is scheduled for a first federal court appearance Friday in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Perrault, who served in New Mexico under the Archdiocese of Santa Fe from 1973 to 1992, is charged in a seven-count indictment with engaging in acts constituting aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact with a minor under the age of 12.  The indictment alleges Perrault repeatedly sexually abused the minor victim in 1991 and 1992 while on federally-protected land</p>
<p>Perrault vanished in 1992, just days before an attorney filed two lawsuits against the archdiocese alleging Perrault had sexually assaulted seven children at his parish.</p>
<p>The former priest turned up last year in Morocco, working at an English-language school for children, where he was subsequently fired.</p>
<p>Moroccan law enforcement authorities arrested Perrault on October 12, 2017, in Morocco on a provisional arrest warrant issued based on the charges in the indictment, which was filed under seal on Sept. 21, 2017. </p>
<p>The FBI assumed custody of Perrault from Moroccan authorities on September 20, 2017. The indictment was unsealed earlier Friday after the U.S. Attorney’s Office notified the Court the FBI had arrested Perrault and transported him from Morocco to the United States, and was in the process of transporting him to the District of New Mexico</p>
<p>If convicted of the aggravated sexual abuse charges in the indictment, Perrault faces a statutory maximum penalty of life in prison.  The abusive sexual contact charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment</p>

            if i'm reading this correctly, this is one of the first indictments to be unsealed, correct? or would this indictment have been filed before the ~51k current sealed indictments that we have pending?

             The Morocco language school sounds fishy
            </dt>
            <dd>
             <p>
              Perrault by age couldn't qualify for a Moroccan work permit as he's well over 60, the school's legal headquarters is in Calif, the umbrella group that covers these schools appears to be based in Herndon,VA. The Moroccan school franchise is run by a Karl Stanzick who formerly worked IT for USAID, known to be CIA front abroad. He also has a company introducing internet to Morocco as part of Bush's Digital Freedom Initiative to foreign countries which also involves USAID.
             </p>
            </dd>
           </dl>
           <p>
            Using internet access as bait, USAID/CIA gains entrance to countries with a carrot. At the same time, ex employees such as Stanzick run language schools that gain access to the youth of those countries. Less than vigorous background checks allow fugitive Catholic pedophile priests to teach in these facilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            . Perrault found in 4/16 working in Morocco, at American Language Center in Tangier; living there off and on for 30 years.

            The American Cultural Association (ACA) is the not-for-profit, bi-national parent organization of the American Language Centers (ALC) in Morocco, which teach English as a foreign language.
The American Language Center, commonly referred to as the ALC, is part of the American Cultural Association (ACA).  The ACA is a private, non-profit [IRS 501(c)(3)], bi-national educational institution, registered in the State of California, as well as in the Kingdom of Morocco. There are 12 ALCs in Morocco, serving as a conduit of cultural exchange and providing English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction for students

            Hall said investigators working with an informer in Morocco learned this year that Perrault was working at an English-language school in Tangier.
           </p>
           <p>
            2016:
Hall sent a FedEx package to the school in April containing a copy of Wolter’s lawsuit and a legal summons. An employee at the school signed for a FedEx package addressed to Perrault, court records show.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perrault was subsequently fired from his job at the school, Hall said.

            January 13, 1966 Fr. Perrault began treatment/therapy  with John Salazar due to "homosexual  approaches to some of the young men 
Sometime around 1970 Archdiocesan priests, including Fr.  Robert Sanchez, confirmed to concerned St. Pius X high school  board members that the hearsay of Fr. ~-- Perrault being a '~practicing~~ -~ homosexual" was true, The board members met with Archbishop Davis who did not want publicity around the matter; He told the board members that he had placed Fr. Perrault under psychiatric care and that Fr. Perrault had voluntarily removed himself from that care,    1972 Perrault asked Victim #20 to move into his apartment
September 14-21 1992 , Fr. Perrault negotiated a recurring  salary and insurance benefits while on  sabbatical from the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. 1991-1992 Fr. Perrault repeatedly abused Victim  #38

             This is happening all over the country.  They send them for treatment that doesn't work.  They don't have to release their names because they are covered by the HIPPA law because it is under the mental health guise.  The Church is moving priests around like men on a chess board.    St. Louis is another place like St. John Vianney.
