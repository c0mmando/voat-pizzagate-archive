<p>This is related to Pizzagate because it concerns the dark underbelly of the international adoption industry which as one critic describes it, has been &quot;a Wild West, all but free of meaningful law, regulation, or oversight&quot; where babies and children from poor countries are bought and sold by unscrupulous entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>Russian adoptions have been in the U.S. headlines for the last few days because of the sensational news of the meeting in Trump Tower last summer between Donald Trump, Jr., and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian attorney who claimed to be lobbying influential Americans for the restart of Russian adoptions in the U.S. which were banned in 2012 by Putin in what many observers believed was retaliation for the Magnitsky Act.</p>
<p><strong>NEW DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
<p>In Trump\'s startling interview yesterday with the NY Times, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/19/trump-putin-discussed-russia-adoption-g20-">he revealed</a> that during his private conversations with President Putin during the G20 summit, they discussed adoptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I actually talked about Russian adoption with him,’’ he said, in the Times interview. “Which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don had in that meeting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we\'ve talked about in the past here on VOAT, it\'s puzzling why the female Russian lawyer, as Donald Trump, Jr, said in his initial statement about their Trump Tower meeting <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-statements-russia-lawyer-meeting-natalia-veselnits">was so intent on</a> restarting &quot;a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government.&quot;</p>
<p>Puzzling, because it is pretty much general knowledge that Russian adoptions in the U.S., despite the huge number of them, with over 58,000 Russian adoptions in about two decades from 1995 to 2013, were fraught with problems. Russian orphans became notorious for having psychological and health problems and adoptive parents were poorly trained and completely unprepared to deal with their adoptees\' difficult behavioral issues. Many Russian adoptees ended up in state mental institutions, and Russian authorities have blamed US adoptive parents for the deaths of 19 children.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-adoption-ban-lavrov/24898056.html">said in Feb. 2013</a>, that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the U.S. is the only country from which we get genuinely alarming reports about how many families treat our children. And I use the word &quot;many&quot; intentionally,&quot; he added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lavrov explained that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the number of cases is believed to be far greater since American families change the names of Russian adoptees, making it impossible for Moscow to track them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, a year after the Dimi Yakovlev Law was passed, the Russian govt. <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/criminal-probe-child-trafficking-769/">launched a criminal probe </a>into online trafficking of Russian children in the U.S. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Investigative Committee spokesperson Vladimir Markin said the case was started due to a journalistic investigation by Reuters and NBC initiated in September.According to investigators, illegal markets were created in the US on Yahoo and Facebook websites, on which illicit transactions concerning children adopted by US citizens were performed,&quot; he said. He added that, following the reports, the committee had checked the information and decided to open a criminal case on human trafficking involving minors.</p>
<p>Thus, among others, transactions involving 26 underage Russian citizens were made and moreover, it was established that as the result of the deals some of them were sexually abused,” Markin said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reuters investigative report, filed Sept. 9, 2013, entitled &quot;Americans use the Internet to abandon children adopted from overseas&quot; is here: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1">http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1</a></p>
<p>Lavrov has said the Russian govt is working on a database of Russian children adopted in the U.S. to monitor Russian adoptees until the age of 18. He also announced that Russian MPs intend to ban changing of citizenship of adopted Russian kids over fears that NGOs specializing in adoptions might send children to the United States via third party countries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Despite the fact that we are no longer sending orphans for adoption to US families,** the USA has not given up on its policy of purchases of children. If we fail to impose a legal ban on the shipping of children across the ocean, they will transport them through third countries,” State Duma deputy Yevgeniy Fyodorov (United Russia) has told the mass circulation daily, Izvestia.**</p>
<p>“The growing number of registered foreign NGOs [specializing in adoptions] is a direct proof that the transit of Russian children to the United States is growing,” the politician added.</p>

            I'm working on connecting the ways that Orphanages enable global trafficking, pedo tourism, (in addition to poor parents losing their children to them, either abducted outright and sold to orphanages or the orphanage takes money from the parents to "care" for the kids, not telling them they are giving up parental rights; the ENORMOUS amount of time and money stolen from volunteers, who give to places where only 10-20% of kids are actually Orphans, thereby feeding the "Orphan Tours" industry.  Poor kids just attending school are labeled orphans to boost numbers to receive more donations, places where abuse, starvation, neglect are common).
           </p>
           <p>
            This find from last night makes it even more important to check the areas where CF supports woman's health and babies, because it links woman's shelters to corrupt orphanages to child trafficking.  Are those places also telling moms that their kids are stillborn?  Not to mention selling babies for their body parts.

            Same here. They sometimes talk in double meaning over the media, it goes unnoticed or at best, noticed. Trump sometimes does this, I noticed it when he went to Poland.

             Yes, I think this was a message by Trump to TPTB. Those who know are very aware of what he's saying. It was a threat - or a promise. (And no doubt a taunt.)

            Thanks for the international adoption link, great work.  I came across a recent adoption fraud case last night and posted in my orphanage thread, but it's better highlighted here.

           <p>
            In the fourth such case of baby sale crackdown by the police in the last three months, On Feb 20, 2017,Chandana Chakraborty the chairperson of an NGO, Bimala Shishu Griho, was arrested in the Falakata area of Jalpaiguri ,district in West Bengal. She was reportedly running a racket of illegally selling children at high prices to buyers including childless couples in India and abroad. She sold at least 17 children between the ages of 1 to 14 years.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “What is shocking is that the head of the (orphanage) was also running a shelter for destitute women and selling their babies,” Rashmi Sen of the West Bengal state women and child development ministry told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Ongoing investigations will also probe if the women were trafficked to the home to keep the adoption racket going,” she added.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CID is suspecting Ms Chakraborty’s links with a local BJP leader who had been helping her with the funds and other concessions. Juhi Choudhury, the local BJP leader, is allegedly on the run.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              As many as 18 people were arrested including doctors, midwives and the owners of charities and clinics, who were suspected of taking babies from women immediately after they had given birth and telling them their children were stillborn.
             </strong>
             Reportedly they used forged documents, fake stamps and certificates to sell babies and had been warned multiple times by the government in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
             The orphanage was registered with the Central Adoption Resource Authority and was the only orphanage in Jalpaiguri district that was permitted to put up children for adoption.

             The accused were also involved in running two other homes in the area. 'Two people were arrested after raids in three charitable homes on Saturday night,' Sashi Panja, state women and child development minister, said.
            </p>
            <p>
             One (Child Welfare official) said the accused ran health camps to identify poor and unmarried pregnant women and convinced them to give away their babies for adoption after paying them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police are also said to be investigating whether the adoption racket was part of a wider human trafficking operation.  The latest scandal comes four months after police arrested 18 people over the sale of newborn babies in the same state. Thirteen babies were rescued and skeletons of two other infants found near the port city of Kolkata.
            </p>
            <p>
             'Our own enquiry last year revealed that the children had not been entered into the government system, which mandates recording of every abandoned child,' Sen said.
            </p>
            <p>
             'In January we moved 15 children from the orphanage to other homes for their safety. They were all below the age of five, some just a few months old.'

             Feb. 19: The arrest of two women officials of a Jalpaiguri orphanage has unearthed alleged sales of babies to couples from America, Singapore, Spain and France, besides India.
            </p>
            <p>
             Chandana Chakraborty, who runs the NGO and the home, and Sonali Mondal, chief adoption officer with the NGO, were arrested by the CID yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sleuths are looking for Juhee Chowdhury, general secretary of the BJP Mahila Morcha's Bengal chapter. "She's a key suspect. She visited Delhi several times to get renewal papers for the home," an officer said.
Officers claimed that Chandana, a schoolteacher, had admitted that Juhee had introduced her to some central ministers and officials. "A couple of days ago, she stayed overnight at Juhee's home," an officer said.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Chandana told reporters some government officials were involved in the racket. "Some people in Jalpaiguri have hatched a conspiracy against me. I shall reveal the names of these people and some government officials to the CID," she said.

             Chowdhury‘s arrest could have political implications as investigators may go after other BJP leaders after quizzing her.
            </p>
            <p>
             The head of the NGO Bimala Sishu Griho, Chandana Chakravarty, who was arrested on February 18 reportedly told the CID that Chowdhury took her to Delhi to discuss the matter (trafficking) and she has spoken to BJP leaders such as Kailash Vijayvargiya (national general secretary) and Rupa Ganguly (Rajya Sabha MP).
            </p>
            <p>
             Chowdhury is the fourth person to be arrested so far in connection with the trafficking case. Bimala Sishu Griho head Chandana Chakraborty, its employee Sohini Mondal and her brother Manas Bhowmik were arrested earlier in February.
            </p>
            <p>
             CID officers are now trying to find out who are the influential people that Juhi Chowdhury contacted when she was on the run for about 10 days before her arrest Tuesday night.
            </p>
            <p>
             Earlier, a Salt Lake-based doctor Dilip Ghosh was arrested for his involvement in the child trafficking case that was busted also by CID in south Bengal last year.

            I have had that feeling from the beginning of it.  Also when the papers were covering the adoptions years ago.  I had a sinking feeling something nefarious was going on, why so many and some lost.  But that was before we knew what they were really up to.  So very sad.  They blamed a lot of Russian parents for drinking vodka and thus causing brain damage to those poor sweet little babies. Oh the horror of it all.

            I fear they eat the black kids on sacrifice days but do the whole raping mkultra thing on white kids....it is why they are so intent on getting their access to russian kids again.  The Luciferian is racist in the extreme.

            What's telling is that Trump brings it up as a subject. I wonder why. Also interesting is the timing of McCain's brain cancer. This make McCain now pretty much off the hook for having commissioned the Steele/russia piss dossier.

                  no, that's not what I said. I said that the bloodlines argument pushed buy a nutcase like Equivnlur is not going to win anyone over. Equinlr is a one trick pony who has lost credibility.

                   he's a shitbag, no doubt..  and his statement about McCain is likely a limited hangout, but it cannot be denied that McCain is an agent of the Deep State. I am convinced that not only do Elites treasure the bloodline, but they are practicing eugenics while placing hundreds of those agents throughout corporations and governments.

                    Yes on McCain, completely, I made comments earlier today against McCain. He is a shit and he hasn't been arrested. You are probably right about the eugenics, and "over population" tactics,  Monsanto comes to mind and how convenient, Facebook and Geneology.com has everyone all sorting themselves out
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    All of this is probably true but lame horse and her jew shilling isn't a convincing argument - that is my point.

               LOL...your the one sounding stupid.   Blood is the only thing that matters to them.  DNA can be the key to this.....we need to break into the Moron/CIA DNA data bases and leak all the information to the public....they need to understand our leaders are all inbred.  It will lift veil of this whole damn plot.

              McCain, when a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy was a Navy pilot (they call themselves aviators). July 29, 1967 while on the deck and in his plane on the carrier U.S.S. Forrestal he managed to screw up procedures (officially denied and covered up by him and the Navy and also even promoted on Wikipedia if you care to look–reason to follow). He did a smart ass punk attention getting trick by doing a “wet start” up of his jet.
