<p>He appears to live in a tropical environment, which if in the US is either Hawaii or a territory, or else it is possible that he lives in some 3rd world hellhole where the kids are easier to grab.

In fact he is said in the interview linked above to have NO fixed address.</p>
<p>He has a website and gives rather expensive online classes: <a href="https://www.regenerateyourlife.org/about-dan/">https://www.regenerateyourlife.org/about-dan/</a></p>
<p>I think we should ask this guy why he donates to an organization that &quot;massages&quot; critically-ill babies and all the other sick shit. It would be interesting to see what his response would be, or, if unwilling to give one, ramp the pressure up on him.</p>',

            I was trying to post  they have weird rules that you can't post unless you have popularity and figured that a post with with little attraction will get attention if I comment about someone that can make a new post about this news. Thank you.

             I just found these listed on Tina Allen's Facebook page:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Cortiva Institute (Scottsdale, AZ), Cortiva Institute, Mariana Espejel, Juan Hernandez Berna Suiza, Sombra Natural Pain Relieving Gel, Yoga with Annu Gaidhu, Young Ones Paediatric and Infant Massage, Mandani Bay Cebu LifeStyle District, Mandani Bay, Motoziel Xperience, Young Kid Custom's, Aurelio Voltaire, INSH, Bobby Duke Art, Sheroes Hangoutand more"

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             When you search Bing for a string from the image, it returns her Facebook page as a hit, but the specific text from the image has since been removed. This tells me that her own Facebook page previously had these people and organizations listed, but that they've since been removed. The Facebook page itself no longer shows them, but Bing's cache of web page DOES still have the list.
            </p>
            <p>
             From my Bing search result:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Tina Allen | Facebook
Tina Allen is on Facebook. ... Kalye MusiKa, Pediatrik Terapi Organizasyon, KD Family Massage and Nutrition, TED-Ed, EXPAT Living in BKK, ALRES, Tip Hero, ...
[Search domain www.facebook.com]
             <a href="https://www.facebook.com/liddlekidz">
              https://www.facebook.com/liddlekidz
             </a>
             "
            </p>
            <p>
             That is the text I searched for (""KD family, massage and nutrition, ted-ed, expat living"). I wasn't expecting any results because it's a very specific search term -- but BAM! It hit straight to her own personal Facebook page, even though it's since been removed. So is that not some form of confirmation?

              It is, but we need a screenshot. :-)  Both as proof of what you're typing here, and also to archive what has already been wiped. That way they can't claim we made it up. Has anyone checked foreign Facebook? As I recall, that's how we captured a bunch of Podesta and Alefantis stuff that was being taken down from archive.is.

                 Ahh shit. I don't know who first said it was a donor list, now that you mention it. I don't even know what that "Other" category means on Facebook. I guess the best we can say is that this man is simply "connected" to Tina Allen, and conceivably she just put these names on there without any of them knowing her, though obviously I doubt that. We would need access to financial documents to see who their donors are I suppose, though it looks like this organization SELLS "therapy" training and other products as well.

                  ? Sometimes there's good stuff there about donations.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  However, don't sweat it too much. The "Unverified" flair isn't meant to be a brand of shame or anything like that -- just a heads up to everyone that more research is needed before we can claim anything definitively. It's precautionary to make sure those who want this info buried know we are serious about research and won't be dismissed as witch hunters.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You can avoid the flair by writing a title that makes a less bold assertion. Instead of "Macdonald donates to Liddle Kidz", which then has to be proven, you can write "8chan claims Life Extension guru donates to Liddle Kidz" or something like that. Then the 8chan jpg becomes the verification.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  However, I like what you did here, better. Why? Because it has galvanized research and made people look beyond the 8chan post, consider that it may have been fake from a nefarious source, and look for corroboration. That makes everyone better researchers and much more formidable enemies to the deepstate manipulators who want to direct public discourse and bury the truth.

              I just realized that the image hosted on 8chan is actually a screenshot of the same Facebook listings I just cited. Her Facebook page and the "Other" listings are still there, but it's now much shorter.

             Fair enough. I'm not that great at navigating the depths of 8chan for what that particular sauce was, but from the sheer number of people and organizations listed in that graphic, would be "big if true." Lots of leads. In fact I find it difficult to believe that such a list would be compiled as a prank, though that is still not proof of its authenticity of course.

              Ah...but if you were trying to galvanize a bunch of deep-pocketed titans of tech about the need to shut down an army of "Russian trolls" and "alt-right hate extremists", floating a fake graphic of a donor list to a legit infant "healing touch" charity to trigger the Chan hivemind...would that not be a good day's work for an up-and-coming CIA analyst?

            I'm in to New Age chakra-opening shit but I don't rape and eat babies and he is correct that we are all Divine Beings. Maybe he donates to them because he thinks they are a legit foundation doing real work and not kidnapping kids to sell.

             I can understand that but when you are dealing with these Nancy Pelosi types that keep talking about energy, and Satanists saying that the Satan they worship is an energy, etc., then there are definitely overlaps here. You might be into New Age shit and not eat babies, but that doesn't mean a bunch of rich fuckers aren't walking around in Druid robes at Bohemian Grove and throwing infants into fires. They're into the occult too. AND they believe themselves to be divine, so much that the rest of us are cattle to them.

             And no, I do not personally have a source for it. I assumed it was doxxed somehow but maybe you think it's fake?

              I looked everywhere and I couldn't find any list of donors on LK website, IRS returns, etc. A random list from 8chan is hardly a source we should go down rabbit holes for. 4chan and 8chan have been infiltrated for a long time by shills. if this is fake, which we have no other corroborating evidence it isn't, they've succeeded greatly in wasting our time.

               For what it's worth, I was digging around on the Liddle Kidz website too, and it admitted that they've taken down information lately, for example information on teachers affiliated with their organization. So if this information is out there, their donors certainly aren't going to be on their site anymore unless they are completely stupid, but some legal documentation would probably bring them out.

               Thanks for this comment, gaystapo. This is a fact we must never lose sight of. Not only could it be a waste of time, it might be an attempt to trigger a witch hunt against a genuine kids charity to make use look bad.
