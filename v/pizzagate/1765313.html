<p>I\'ve taken a first look at the SSIC, to try and identify possible enemies and allies. Obviously, nobody on the SSIC has been publicly investigated or charged.

<p>I will post the Democrats on the SSIC, and then the Republicans. Both are in rough order of concern, worst to best. Those who are flagged &quot;ex officio,&quot; are automatically on the committee because of some other function they perform elsewhere in Congress. </p>

            Just wanted to add the SSIC.... Senate Select Intelligence Committee is feverishly pushing the Russia story. Some of them " the gang of 8" are all tied into trafficking, oil plays, laundering, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a reason the whistleblower went to R-Nunes and none of them. This whistleblower now their are (2) are NSA and exposed unbelievable surveillance on Trump and all Americans. Illegal &amp; unconstitutional does not give it justice. The Whistleblower had attempted to go through proper channels for two years including FBI Comey &amp; the senate intelligence they took info but did nothing.,Allowed it to continue for the last two years knowingly. Then lied to congress and the American People. That is why Nunes was called to meet secretly with the source. They are all caught in lies now except Nunes and some House select Intelligence memberss.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their only option blame Russia.

             This is a very valid point, and it leads to several interesting lines of research. For one, their control over the House committee is clearly weaker than over the Senate. Why? How did Nunes wind up as Chairman if he's not one of "their" people?
            </p>
            <p>
             My first goal is to profile the two committees in a basic way, so people have some idea who the players are. Still working on the House side. This sort of analysis is EXACTLY what we should then attempt. So thank you very much. I'm interested to know your thoughts on how Nunes got the job.

            , please add links to your post, as it currently does not satisfy Rule 4. You can do so by linking to examples of things in the body of the post, the official page of the SSIC showing membership...that kind of thing. You've provided a good research framework here, and I would hate for mods to have to take it down for a silly submission guideline violation. I will leave it up for now to give you time to do this. Thanks!

              Awesome. Thank you. Please feel free to add more that might be useful to someone attempting this research. The goal of Rule 2 is both to allow people to vet the veracity of the post (especially to avoid disinfo, which is being spread deliberately all the time), and also to make it easy to start digging. The best posts are those where people don't just mention things they've seen that connect, but actually link to it -- even in comments. What that does is turn the post into a mini-library of all the connected information, so that someone coming onto it from outside the investigation can see all of angles.

            I am very encouraged by the start that Trump and Sessions have made. At this point I am not so worried about World War III breaking out, or Trump being assassinated, or other "doomsday" scenarios. I am more worried about the civil side of this remaining stuck in a relatively loose, find-the-freaky-Instagram mode. It's easy to get stirred up about children getting raped and murdered, and stay up all night clicking BREAKING! links and just spiraling around in angst and despair. I've been doing that myself, off and on, for the past seven months.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe it is time to start taking a more methodical, long-term approach to this problem. I've said in other posts that this is likely to resemble Sicily's 30-year struggle to get rid of the Mafia. Trump and Sessions can do a lot, but no matter how wildly successful they might be in prosecuting top-level people, they won't get them all, and this will not stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            Organizations exist that rank members of Congress for how pro-gun or pro-abortion they are. For this horror to stop, there will have to be a very public, well-funded, absolutely transparent and independent civil watchdog that looks at every public official's actions on trafficking and pedophilia, and routinely rates and confronts them.

            The first and most helpful thing would be for you all to check my work. I've only spent a few days on this. What have I missed? What would improve this list?
