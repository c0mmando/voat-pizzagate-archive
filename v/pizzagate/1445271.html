            There must be thousands of trafficking stations world wide and most of them probably wont be connected to each other with tunnels, so the traffickers must have good solutions to do their buisness without tunnels, so I don't understand why people think those alledged tunnels are so important.

            Even when they exist, you think we could find ANYTHING there now after they had like a whole month to remove all evidence?
Believe me comet ping pong atm is probably the cleanest pizza place in the whole world.

            They already closed that branch and moved to one of their thousand alternatives or what do you think?
