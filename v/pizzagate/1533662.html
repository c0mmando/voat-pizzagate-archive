<p>Firstly Nick Bryant thank you for your work uncovering the Franklin Scandal. </p>
<p>Secondly I mean this respectfully: you can\'t knock us for our &quot;journalism&quot;. We\'re not journalists! We\'re only here because of clear evidence a crime has taken place and the MSM is doing NOTHING besides saying &quot;There\'s nothing to see here. Move along!&quot; Whenever you get the &quot;Nothing to see here&quot; treatment you know something wrong right off the bat.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the sketchy details that really need explaining:</p>
<p>1) Edgar Welch firing a rifle inside Comet Ping Pong and through a miracle of fate manages to hit the very same computer that serves up CPP\'s web site which has a secure page where customers can download files: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AsyOxk21i0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AsyOxk21i0</a></p>
<p>Have you ever downloaded a Pizza before? No? Me neither.</p>
<p>2) What about the bartender crawling on the floor drenched in blood. Seen any bartenders do that before? No? Me neither.</p>
<p>3) WikiLeaks emails, for example John Podesta writes to his brother Tony at 3:27 AM on the Tuesday their old friend Dennis Hastert is on trial for child molestation: &quot;This traffic is really warm and weird in the light of Hastert. Boy that\'s sad.&quot;</p>
<p>Why traffic is &quot;warm&quot;. The only time I\'ve heard of warm traffic is something like an e-commerce web site reading their email traffic. &quot;This email traffic is really warm and glowing with praise.&quot;</p>
<p>Does that sound like what John Podesta is writing to his brother about? Email traffic? No? Yeah me either. Any sentence with the words &quot;traffic&quot;, &quot;warm&quot; , &quot;[Dennis] Hastert&quot; and references a trial about child molestation is about.......wait for it......Child Trafficking.</p>',

            Do you have a link to photos of the CPP computer? Also, if there is a real investigation by the DC police into the shooting, shouldn't they (the police) have the computer now as forensic evidence? Would there be a list somewhere available to the public of the evidence they took from the crime scene?

             The CPP computer with bullet hole is here:
             <a href="https://youtu.be/2AsyOxk21i0?t=135">
              https://youtu.be/2AsyOxk21i0?t=135
             </a>
             . Note the impact looks like someone stood in the doorway and fired in a horizontal motion. That's very sketchy. If Edgar Welch went to Comet Ping Pong looking for children he wouldn't fire randomly into closets. There could be children hidden in there. ;-)
            </p>
            <p>
             As for an investigation sadly there was no investigation into the allegations that CPP has ties to child porn. Worse the DC police implied there was:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omlQHWrgmd4">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omlQHWrgmd4
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             So let's call a spade a spade. The Edgar Welch dude didn't really go into CPP looking for kids. The whole event was staged. And that means a conspiracy to silence an investigation which is exactly what happened 20 years ago with the Franklin scandal.

              I'm completely on your side here. I'm just wondering why the computer wasn't taken as evidence for the case against the shooter. And Welch would have to be like 11 feet tall for the angle of the bullet to go thru the lock and then the computer.

                They would need it IF they were actually going to build a case against Welch, which I don't think they had any intention to do. I think they were hoping this would all just die down and they would quietly let Welch off on some "technicality." We need to keep this active and call their hand.

            Nobody here has clear evidence of that.  At best there is a lot of circumstantial evidence, but nothing proving a crime.

             Who says that computer serves up their web page. I have seen PG people claim that, but that seems ignorant of how most business put up a website. Most people go with a hosting service and it's the server's of the hosting service that serves up the webpage.

             The bartender is also also a drag performer and that is a picture for Halloween.   My guess was he was doing Carrie.

             Where's your evidence for this?   I would have thought Buck meant a strapping adult man. (Which would still be gay reference.)

             Replace traffic with "thread" and it fits perfectly.  The quoted email that Podesta quotes (your link) is not the only email that talks about a reunion of old friends

            Search WL for rknipp and and you find there's a handful of emails involving these folks who all studied together 50 years ago in Japan.  The thread is a long lost friends getting back in touch. Dennis Hastert was part of this group.

            The warm part is these folks are reminiscing about the time they were all in Japan together and the folks in Japan probably haven't heard about Hastert yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once you realize that, Podesta's comment makes perfect sense.
"This traffic is really warm and weird in the light of Hastert. Boy that's sad."

             The way it was described to me is that panda or racoon eyes has something to do with child abuse either through physical trauma or putting a child on drugs. Remember we're talking about potential Satanic Ritual Abuse of children. And remember Nick Bryant wrote a book on the Franklin Scandal which involved some highly disturbing SRA of children.
