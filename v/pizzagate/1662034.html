Sexual revolution, break up of the family unit.</p>
<p>Alfred Kinsey August 24 1953 – appears on the cover of time magazine in a portrait called
●“Reflections in the mirror of venus”●
which features “birds and bees” a term used euphemistically when a child is first educated about procreation. <a href="http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19530824,00.html">http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19530824,00.html</a></p>
<p>Here a modern free UK magazine speaks in a relatively positive light about Kinsey (published in the past three years I think) <a href="http://www.stylist.co.uk/life/why-scientists-want-you-to-have-more-sex">http://www.stylist.co.uk/life/why-scientists-want-you-to-have-more-sex</a>
●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●
Venus is often termed The Morning Star.
Lucifer only appears in the latin Vulgate bible text. Otherwise mentioned as the Greek Phosphorus (Greek Φωσφόρος Phōsphoros), a name meaning “Light-Bringer”
The Hebrew text has הֵילֵל בֶּן־שָׁחַר (helel ben-shakhar, “Helel son of Shachar”), which is probably a name for the morning star (Venus) or the crescent moon.
●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●</p>
<p>Kinsey was a follower of Crowley and oddly enough, he was friends with Kenneth Anger.
Kinsey was also friendly with a sadistic nazi. (Of course, that’s just what Kinsey was himself)</p>
<p>Kenneth Anger was:
“Getting to know several notable countercultural figures of the time, including Tennessee Williams, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, Marianne Faithfull and Anton LaVey”</p>
<p>Friendly bunch then. Have i written of the concert yet? Oh yes it’s down the page a little, in the future.</p>
<p>Father of Marianne: Glynn Faithfull, a British Major in MI6
To the anger of both their families, Faithfull’s grandmother married an Austrian aristocrat, Baron Sacher-Masoch (a relative of the author of the notorious masochistic novel, Venus in Furs)</p>
<p>(Venus In Furs is also a track by the Velvet Underground)</p>
<p>“The Titian painting Venus with a Mirror, from which Severin (character in masochistic novel) gets the idea of Venus in furs.”</p>
<p>IF FREEMASONRY BEGAN IN 1717 WHY DOES ROSLYN CHAPEL HAVE INITIATION SCENES ENGRAVED UPON IT? The man with the noose around his neck. The hanged man… Sharon Tate was found in the hanged man position. These acts of unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity set forth the end of the hopes which were flared in the drug haze of the 1960s – this coupled with the Altamont Free Concert on December 6 1969 (which the Grateful Dead were scheduled to play at but later refused due to increasing violence.)</p>
<p>“The event is best known for considerable violence, including the death of Meredith Hunter and three accidental deaths: two caused by a hit-and-run car accident and one by drowning in an irrigation canal. Four births were reported during the event”</p>
<p>That doesn’t sound ritualistic in the least. Least of all with the Hell’s Angels involvement, who were the subject of one of Thompson’s books.</p>
<p>Part 5
Courtney Loves Father mentioned Ginsberg as being a paedophile.</p>
<p>Her father describes himself as a psychologist who “took care” of the those participating in the acid “tests” of the day – “managing” the Grateful Dead. He has also described himself as a psychopath and claims his daughter shares this trait with him. Courtney Love claims she was given LSD at three years old by her father, who passed a polygraph to say he did not. Although the funny thing about psychopaths and polygraphs is they feel no guilt in lying and deceiving so “register few biological stress indicators.”</p>
<p>You might find it interesting that Alan Ginsberg was a member of NAMBLA
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Man/Boy_Love_Association">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Man/Boy_Love_Association</a></p>
<p>Obscenity trials abound! Love also appeared in a film relating to that very area, The People VS Larry Flint. She first appears as an underage stripper who Flint falls for.</p>
<p>Also the relevance of Mia Farrow/The Beatles visiting India together.</p>
<p>Mia Farrow was in a relationship with Frank Sinatra prior to her role in Rosemary’s Baby, which was set in the Dakota building, the place where John Lennon was shot dead by allegedly MKUltra’d Chapman, who held in his hand Catcher In The Rye, which is thought to be part of his “trigger.”</p>
<p>Now interestingly enough, Sammy Davis Junior, was an “honorary” member of the Church of Satan. As invited by Michael Aquino (and/or associates) (mkay?) here is a snapshot of them together:</p>
<p>Here is Sammy Davis JR with Marilyn Monroe (presidential diamond)

<p>Here is Anton Lavey with Jayne Mansfield, who died in a car crash along with Sam Brody, who was said to be cursed by Anton LaVey by his daughter: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02M3pWoqcw8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02M3pWoqcw8</a></p>
<p>Here is a telling picture involving Jackie Kennedy.
“This is the “wink” photograph, a shot of LBJ receiving a wink from Congressman Albert Thomas after the swearing-in, the day John F Kennedy was murdered”</p>
<p>Part 6
Back to the rat pack-</p>
<p>“As Sammy was getting stoned and serviced, one of the ritual’s leaders tilted back his hood, revealing himself as Jay Sebring, the singer’s barber. Hollywood’s all-time greatest hetero hairdresser, Sebring was responsible for the shaggy style sported by Jim Morrison, helped get Bruce Lee on TV, and was engaged to actress Sharon Tate. During the Manson Family’s infamous 1969 massacre, Sebring would be bound to Tate, shot, then stabbed seven times.”

<p>Sharon Tate was the pregnant spouse of shamed director Roman Polanski at the time of her death. Roman Polanski filmed Rosemary’s Baby. An affluent apartment block turns out to be the home of a coven of witches. Johnny Depp defends Polanski but this isn’t the first time he has defended criminals… Oh no no. “Johnny Depp defends convicted murderers ‘West Memphis Three’</p>
<p>“She (Mia) agreed to appear in his (Sinatras) 1968 film, The Detective, but when she reneged as her filming schedule for Rosemary’s Baby overran, Sinatra served her divorce papers in front of the cast and crew.”</p>
<p>Part 7
Also you might it interesting to note the sacrificial undertone to 9/11 – and the Tavistock induced mass mind control element, to make people believe planes managed to turn two buildings to dust mid air (hence lack of seismic impact) and also the very interesting magnetometer reading from Alaska the morning and time of “first impact” the impact (location of HAARP) and also why a hurricane named Erin approached the coast of New York before sharply turning away, around about the time of the first impact? Odd isn’t it? However faking planes isn’t much of a moral dilemma for these individuals, all things considered.
The Towers also holding symbolism in the Tarot (said to be used to communicate stories between Templars) (and according to wikipedia tarot relates to the storytelling in the film Holy Mountain which George Harrison was said to be keen to play the part of the “christ” like thief, the fool card) – The film apparently makes Eyes Wide Shut seem quite tame in it’s allusions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the director of the film was the original adaptor of DUNE to screen, before (financial?) problems meant it was later made by David Lynch.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note, the TAROT is a 77 card deck, as the fool counts as 0.</p>
<p>The Sphinx (underwater) Sphinx was built as long ago as 7000 B.C.</p>
<p>Jacques DeMolay (Bill Cooper was a member of the DeMolay society for a while) was a Knights Templar who was apparently crucified in a doorway after a charge of heresy is apparently an image on the Turing Shroud as it dates to the 14th century.</p>
<p>(Bill Cooper’s “Behold A Pale Horse” <a href="https://ephraiyim.wordpress.com/william-cooper/behold-a-pale-horse-milton-william-cooper-pdf/">https://ephraiyim.wordpress.com/william-cooper/behold-a-pale-horse-milton-william-cooper-pdf/)</a>) Bill Cooper was shot dead outside of his home by police. Alex Jones tried to ruin the reputation of Bill Cooper by claiming him to be a venomous alcoholic (falsely.)</p>
<p>Jacques de Molay was the 23rd and last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, leading the Order from 20 April 1292 until it was dissolved by order of Pope Clement V in 1307</p>
<p>On 14 September, Philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the Templars, sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of France to implement a mass arrest of all Templars at dawn on 13 October.
Where we get the idea of Friday The 13th.</p>
<p>“During forced interrogation by royal agents at the University of Paris on 24/25 October, De Molay confessed that the Templar initiation ritual included “denying Christ and trampling on the Cross”. He was also forced to write a letter asking every Templar to admit to these acts. Under pressure from Philip IV, Pope Clement V ordered the arrest of all the Templars throughout Christendom.”</p>',
