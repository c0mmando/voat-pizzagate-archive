            Every time I make detailed points, you don't respond to any of them with anything other than opinion. Then of course, as you get frustrated you start lashing out. You wouldn't be such a bitch about it all if you weren't so insecure. What you're unwilling to understand here is that I would really love to see you grow as a person and move past this sort of mentality.

            Its easy to see how weak your arguments really are when you must resort to name-calling and hostility. I'll gladly discuss this if you can behave like a civilized human being. You are in no position to judge others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its very clear you didn't understand my point on the issue of the churches; I was pointing out how subcultures and organizations get hijacked by psychopaths. You're able to see how that can happen to a church, but somehow you can't understand how that can happen to a group of gay people. I don't hate you for this, but I do pity that you can't understand such a basic point. You're so ideologically stuck that you can't see the forest through all those trees.

            Are we going to ban every organization or subculture that has some creeps in it? That's going to be a long list. First we better ban Republicans and Democrats because of Hastert and Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            How about the Catholic church? Does Catholicism cause pedophilia or do the pedophiles hijack it? There's been Mormon pedophiles and cultists. Do we ban Mormonism? Where do we draw the lines?
           </p>
           <p>
            So your point in this post is to honestly try to convince me that any position counter to yours' is going to be wrong before you even hear it. Nice objectivity bro.

            ANY position has "data" to back it up. You can argue some sort of positive for damn near any theory. One could argue that auto shows cause pedophilia using similar logic.

            In the late 1990s, Virginia Roberts was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a $9-per-hour locker room attendant at Mar-A-Lago (at 15 yrs. old - Florida legal working age is 16). (Groomed and culled from Mar-a-Lago by Trumps lesbian/hebophile friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who implicitly works for Jeffrey Epstein). Roberts' father also worked at ** Mar-A-Lago**, which is located about 3 miles away from Epstein's estate, as a maintenance manager.
           </p>
           <p>
            During this same period, Epstein and Maxwell were repeat guests at Mar-A-Lago. In 2000, they hung out there with Prince Andrew, who arrived for vacation on Trump's private plane. That same year, the Palm Beach Post reported that Trump, Epstein, Prince Andrew, and Maxwell were all at a tennis tournament/celebrity event at Mar-A-Lago.

            This is a pizzagawhatever thread. We need to keep this main thread focused on pizza gate, if you are not specifically focusing on alefantis, podesta, clinton, or related by only a few degrees, than you are intentionally or unintentionally engaging in thread sliding, an intelligence tactic. However, some mods odd subjective hypocrisy only compounds this situation and thread's that should have been sorted out remain on the main forum, only reinforcing the rumors of thiel's ownership in this site. However relevant or altruistic your endeavor is this thread is only contributing to the mess the pizzagate forum has become and should be relegated to the pizzagatewhatever column. Better threads have been straight deleted by these mods. time to clean this circus up.

            The Democrats are desperately trying to figure out a way to impeach Trump. They want to shut Pizzagate down immediately. Trump's okay with Pizzagate. I think he may even like it. But even if they impeach Trump,  Mike Pence takes over, and unless Pence is a closet pedo, or ows the Rothschilds, I don't think he'd care about pizzagate either...so!?

            If Podesta said the same shit that Milo did, you guys would have a field day. The double standards are real.

            Can we just fucking forget about Milo and get back on the research? The media have a fuckton of reasons to hate on him, totally unrelated to pizzagate.

            I agree, they may have misplaced this move.
           </p>
           <p>
            They wanted to destroy the right by saying Milo is pro pedo and the right, alright especially, are in bed pun intended with Milo. After all Milo is ediot of Breitbart, Breitbart knew Podesta was a pedophile. Brightbart was probably murdered. One of Trump's top guys is Steve Bannon, this is all guilt by association.
           </p>
           <p>
            They want us to choose. Defend Milo for being a pedophile. This makes sense to the because it's all or nothing with them. Will I elect Milo of he's a pedo, no. Will I listen to him of he makes good points, yes. I won't be listening to him pro pedo stuff. The left doesn't understand there isore than identity politics, and that there is aovent underway. A movement that is largely on the internet of people who are rising up and fighting the real tyranny,/the NWO,/the Illuminati. Is Trump perfect? Are we worshipping Milo and Alex Jones. No, we are not like the left we don't deify people. Thos ovent goes beyond any one name. If they assassinate Trump it won't make a difference. Trump currently is in the position and power to do things. If they took him out there would be civil war and a new person will raise themselves up to take on the weights of the many, to fight for others, as countless good men have done before. There is no going back no. The left doesn't understand this.
           </p>
           <p>
            They want us to either defend him or cast him out. Prove we are not pedophiles the worst thing ever. They get a two for one because if we do that they will just link all his good ideas with being a pedo and throw the baby out with the bathwater.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is where they messed up.
1) we are smart enough to separate people from ideas, and know true movements are leaderless, this is such.
2) Now every time we uncover a pedo we make a me saying you did this to Milo for being am accused pedo. How will you treat these convicted government pedophiles ? Hmm, I though pedophilia was so bad.

            Milo is just another attention seeking Narcissistic whore, who just uses his Gayness to  promote himself. Thats all he is Gay and got a big mouth, well looks like its now trashed his career. And no I don't think it was some elaborate 4D move, more like another embarrassing Alt Right Fu$kup.

            I heard Milos comments, and while it made me cringe, I also had to remember he was a victim of child molestation, and was discussing his own experience of being victimized. for some reason has minimized what happened to him in his own mind so he can deal with it. It's actually somewhat typical for a victim to take a stance like this to not have to feel like the victim that they were. i also believe him when he says calling a guy a "boy" doesn't actually mean boy, but young man. I know gay guys who talk like that and my female friends and I would often refer to guys as "boys" when we were in our party days. This is being blown out of proportion.

            Milo admitted to going to underage Hollywood sex parties. Pedo defenders also get the rope. You might want to watch all 4 podcasts where milo defends this before you start shilling for a guy that says outing pedos is a feminist strategy, and anyone who is NOT attracted to those under 15 is a dreary nitpicker. For fucks sake man at a minimum watch the first joe rogan one. Putting a pedo as the head of pizzagate is the ONLY way to kill pizzagate. Stop walking into the obvious trap.

             Trump is not 'the biggest' anti-gay person, he waved a rainbow flag at a rally and said he doesn't plan to change LGBT laws atm, he's not a fire and brimstone fundamentally religious person, and I think everybody with decent moral fiber hates thieves, saying that somebody is a crook because they hate thieves is absolutely ridiculous. If you don't hate thieves then that's because you're a thief.

              I know we are in disagreement, but my comment wasn't insinuating that Trump is a closeted homo...it was just a general statement on the point that I was trying to make.

              Im actually very aware of how LGBT friendly he is (despite the recent thing about bathrooms - I see that as sticking to what his voter base wants more than anything though).

               I understand what you meant, and I think that it's true in a few cases, but not the majority.

               As far as the bathroom thing, I don't want some pervert to be able to go into the women's bathroom and pee next to little girls because he says 'I identify as female' because that's literally all it would take.
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: Trump has been pro LGBT for a long time (tapes from the 90s), but MSM didn't play those tapes during election time because 1) Fox News didn't want to make it look like he was pandering to that community for sake of the very far right crowd 2) liberal media didn't want to destroy their narrative that he's an awful bigoted monster that wants to kill all black people and put the gays in concentration camps.

            I dont think hes a puppet per se, but I dont think hes innocent when it comes to the elite worldwide pedo conspiracy that Pgate uncovered.  There are creepy pedos throughout all of politics, Trump included.

            This whole thing is staged in that Milo is a CIA cutout, Bill Maher is an insider sicko, and both their comments were made in a bid to condition the public into accepting pedophilia. If you stand with Milo you are playing right into the sickos hands in that you are consenting to his comments regarding lowering the age of consent! This is how they do it, they keep lowering age of consent until its legal for adults to have sex with 6 yr olds, wake up people!

              As my username indicates, Im a proud left leaning libtarded liberal.  I have no shame in that.  I also feel that Pgate has some validity, and thats how I found myself here on voat.  I found it encouraging that this subverse exists.  However, the political narrative associated with the whole elite-pedo-conspiracy is discouraging to me.  Especially lately, it seems that along with the Milo stuff recently, that the dems vs. Trump thing is now associated with Pgate, and I dont think thats the right direction to go.

               Voat leans to the right as a whole, so individual subs like this almost all tend to lean that way as well. Just like how almost all subs lean to the left in that other shit hole because that site leans to the left as a whole.
              </p>
              <p>
               While the majority of people here may lean right, I can guaran-goddamm-tee you that you're no the only liberal in this sub, and good on you for seeing past the MSM in the first place.

               There are many repubs involved.  But the trump vs. globalist thing is The truth whether you like trump or not.  HE has the power to clean house and take these sickos down.  Look at all the trafficking arrests that have been made since he took office.  It seems like law enforcement across the nation needed PERMISSION to arrest pedos and traffickers.
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing is, I disagreed with most of obama's policies.  Well pretty much all of them.  But if he would've been the champion to take down the pedos, I would have sung his praises for that.
              </p>
              <p>
               It TRULY is President Trump versus the establishment globalists - both republicans and democrats.

                I do not like him very much. But if he ends up being the hero to fight that dirty worldwide establishment of pedos and satanists (instead of trying to destroy the environment and abusing federal powers for personal gain) then I'll gladly eat my hat and sing his praises.

               There are many fingers in this voating pie. There are the real ones with realistic concerns; parents, teachers, etc. There's CTR. There's the lurkers who don't post, just up/downvote. There's FBI/CIA/NSA/DHS, etc. (they know who they are) There's the do-gooder crowd. There's the redpillers :) There's the absolute filth scum shills. There's some of the mods who delete whatever wherever whenever. I call it Cuckleberry Soup...
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, the messengers from reddit/chans and there are some from the Youtube hall of lame; perhaps some fame but mostly a lot of posts (recently) like OP's b.s. meant as a shiny-thing-over-there distraction piece. There is a
               <strong>

                </em>
               </strong>
               of Identity Politics here. As well, most of the political b.s. is intentional from people (paid) to post disinfo (shills) purposely to persuade/distract/etc.

               You are absolutely correct. Anyone who has researched the Franklin Coverup knows that there as many Republican pedos as Democrat pedos. Pedophilia is a bi-partisan problem. They all need to be outed and arrested. The last thing we need here is bickering about the fake partisan divide. The function of politics in a democracy is actually to keep the peons divided and keep the oligarchs in place.

                Jeez - never heard of Franklin until you mentioned it. 
How is it that pgate is immediately shunned the way it is in main stream culture yet there are literally proven instances of some of the things discussed with PG ?

            Everyone has a different tipping point. I was dismissive of 911 theories until a few months ago.  All the MSM shenanigans around the election are what opened my eyes.  I know plenty of people who are still fast asleep and think I'm nuts.

            There is a satanic transgender/gay army out on

            </a>
            today...I have seen this army myself on the IMDB message boards where they defended Brian Singer and Fox Studios with the X-Men movies and they were also defending the Ghostbuster 2016 movie.  Every account that I looked into on IMDB that were defending these movies and trolling were gay men and most of them denied it.  There truly is some kind of satanic homosexual/transgender agenda going on here and they are all working together.

             Wow so he knew them, so fucking what? That default means he participated in satanic rituals and ate children with them? Trump is the last hope we have. It's time to grow up and get over your virtue signalling identity politics. He is a good man and right now in light of all that we know about the DNC and their entire Hollywood support ring, that is all that matters

               Most people who voted Trump were just picking the lesser of the two evil gangsters, not that they thought he was a saviour or anything...if he turned out to be a saviour, rather than just another gangster, would be a plus.

                I don't think so. My only comments here when I came and wanted to see pizzagate stuff especially when the first post I see is about Milo who has said some really disturbing things. It's so blatant with downvotes already because I expressed a legitimate concern.

             Yea, every New Yorker, or politician/businessman of note did. Trump cut relations with him before Epstein was exposed which I'm hoping is indicative of him not liking him. Obviously its hard to know, to me, anyone in politics or big money is suspicious. I'm just hoping for the best outcome, not surprising people are pro-Trump, infairness he's the most immediate and possibly only hope.

              It's getting hyper-partisan and it's honestly disgusting. I'm a democrat voter and I would burn Podesta at the stake. People started accusing others of being pedophiles, especially if they were liberals, with no actual evidence. Somehow we are not talking about how Milo said he was at these parties with underage kids. No one is stopping to think that could be apart of the entire ring?

            I don't understand you guys, you want us to stand with a guy WHO with his own mouth, no one elses, said that pederasty is OK? Him being a victim of child abuse should also make you guys even more cautious of him, why? Because children that got molested are stastistically more likely to engage in the same disgusting behaviour themselves when they become adults. He should not get a free pass on his views on pederasty because he himself was abused , that should only raise further red flags around him. 
Another thing to note is that Milo is greek and Greece has had a long tradition of accepting pederasty, just another connection that is interesting to point out...

             Did you miss the part where he agreed with current age of consent laws?  Milo has never advocated having sex with children and he WAS the 13 year old, not the other way around.

              Did you miss the part where he said he went to child rape parties in hollywood where shockingly young boys were plied with drugs and raped by older men?  Did you miss that he went to more than one of those parties?  The guy is scum.

               He never said "child rape parties"..nice try.  Milo is not a pedophile and he is not the enemy.  The real enemy is HRC and crew who traffic in children and the harvest their organs, skin and bone marrow when they are done with them.  Start here and work your way forward...

                Listen to the Joe Rogan podcast man.  He said "schockingly young" - anyone objective knows he is talking about illegally young.
               </p>
               <p>
                If Milo went to a party where your 11 year old son was being raped by a man that got him hooked on cocaine so he could use him sexually - would you still be cool with Milo.   If he sat and had a drink and watched your 11 year old blow a 50 year old - maybe offering pointers --- would you still be cool with Milo?
               </p>
               <p>
                Milo is a character this man plays.  It is not his personality.  He has 3 aliases. I thought he was a great troll - but I cannot accept anyone that would go to not just one - but multiple Hollywood child rape parties.

              I don't condone what he said, he is a victim I can understand that but condoning it because you are a victim I don't get.

              You can't be against Podesta and make excuse for thirteen year olds having sex with old men and thanking them for blow jobs.    I like what Milo did for exposing the left, liberals are fucking hypocrites and they don't give two shits about children but I'm not down with the excuse making for what he said.

            Not sure if this is helpful at all, but an anonymous Facebook poster under the profile JR FA was trolling Milo's page. I went back and forth with this person. They responded to me..."You have no idea"...meaning, this person claimed to have "knowledge" . I should state that this person was not a fan of Milo. I did a little digging and found out who this person was...I am illiterate with technology in general so I have to say it wasn't that hard to figure it out... Here's her real Facebook page. Anyone have info?

            Again, the tape was deceptively edited, he absolutely did not defend pedofiles at all. Actually in the same podcast he agreed that the age of consent was correct. A good age. YOURE the one that is twisting the situation into something it's not. And they are.. the fact is milo has exposed 3 pedofiles in his time as a journalist and one of them he was the first to expose. The tape IS DECEPTIVLY EDITED TAKING TWO CONVERSATIONS AND EDITING THEM TOGETHER. He never advocated or defended pedofiles. YOU ARE SPREADING DISINFORMATION.

              That is an outright lie...that video is cut and they intentionally left out the part about him agreeing with current age of consent laws.

              Again, he says right there that the age of consent is correct. When he says BUT he is talking about his own rape. Then goes on to talk about his relationship as a 17 year old with an older man. The word boi (boy) is a term in gay lingo that means younger man, not underage but younger. Because of this being a podcast with an audience that is supposed to understand this, and you don't, then you're misentereting him. I suggest watching milos response. This video STILL IS NOT THE WHOLE VIDEO.

                  So what? If you don't know what pizza means.... pizza was one of my favorite foods before all of this. Pizza in itself is nothing, only when used as a code word or with children and sex.

            Well, Mr. Trump in his knowledge of skyscraper construction knew immediately that something wasn't right about 9/11 and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fE1wxdgdpk">
             hinted at an inside job
            </a>
            long ago, perhaps so that someday people will look back and admire his wisdom.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me, 9/11 should have been the event that serves as a watershed moment for the public and causes some kind of massive revolt or upheaval, and the fact that it hasn't been that is troubling because this means something bigger and more dramatic is probably coming.  That's why I randomly talk about it in threads about things unrelated to 9/11 like Milo. Lol.

            Great movie.  This guy Dennis Cimino, he used to be an electronics trouble shooter for the Navy and also worked for Lockheed Martin at the time of 9/11, and also is a pilot. He goes into detail about a radar delay that would have prevented the military response that should have occurred. And of course Dick Cheney himself might have simply "called off the dogs."  The real answer turns out to be that there were no hijacked flights and no planes hitting buildings. Anyway, he goes into great detail about some of the obscure details of the flight recorder data etc. You may enjoy.

            It's the same Dem move. Deny, deflect, then accuse others of the thing that you (Dems) are doing. Clinton's have done this for 50 years now. The people who set this 'Milo' up, are pedophiles without a doubt. It is the same pattern over and over.

            If there is foreknowledge of what is supposed to be a surprise attack, that my friend is called an inside job.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly enough if such hijackings were to happen in real life, there would be foreknowledge by our own military and the planes would have been shot down. The fact that this didn't happen is a clue in itself. And of course like many staged events there were simulation and training exercises occurring simultaneously which made the hoaxing easier to accomplish since even people who weren't "in on it" might have been working for NORAD at the time and would have been fooled by fabricated data.

            Its a riot to watch the meltdown personally, they took Milo down which was not a bad thing in that Milo can self publish his book (Simon &amp; Schuster is owned by CBS), he is free to be his own brand and Brietbart is free from the Milo show and can position themselves more seriously, and in the process the people who are not "woke" are saying what happened as they are seeing videos posted of Bill Maher defending Pedophilia, George Taki defending it and diddling a guy on national TV (OMG you will need eye bleach if you watch it) and Rothschile and Hillary and Podesta all stupidly twittering about... while back in DC the master studies the chess board for his next move. Gotta love it.

            The Milo apologists give him way too much credit, and I won't get started about the fact this has nothing to do with PG. I have had much more relevant posts deleted immediately. But what is actually at play here is, you have a sexual abuse victim (Milo) who is in denial of abuse because he doesn't want to admit it. And as a coping mechanism he joked about it, the way British people would. They think about sexuality differently than us. Anyways, Milo wants to sell books so he doesn't have a filter, it just so happened that the subject matter of his jokes doesn't play in this country. There you have it. He said the same thing himself in not as many words, there is no conspiracy here.l, other than the one distracting us from the real stuff which Is Edible Schoolyard and Chez Panisse...

            That's not what it is. Trump is giving the other side some success so they won't resort to more desperate things like killing him.

             Who are you keeping company with? Did you vote for the woman who raised billions for Haiti and spent it bribing the government out of their natural resources and give it to her friends, leaving the most vulnerable to be sold as slaves or die of easily preventable cholera a year later?

            I would say not neccessarily on the "patriot" theory. The calls from Washington could have been threats to his family and/or friends, and "not yet" could have meant Trump needs to do some structural changes before this is safe to talk about. Can't know for sure, yet. I wouldn't totally reject either case.

            I'm not saying play the victim, like how the left would. He said he's a victim, but has his own way of dealing with it. I think if he continues to do what he does, he'll be okay.

           <p>
            I just think that now that pedophilia is in the spotlight, surrounding someone who was a victim, and as someone who has called out pedophiles... I don't know, I'm just picturing a Chris Hansen "To Catch a Predator" fill here, where Milo can expose pedo's for real.

            Milo was raped as a kid, the podcast that everyone is using to slander him was edited to. Be deceptive. In the very same podcast, milo agrees that the age of consent laws are correct. You are the one being hypocritical, to go after child rapists, is to also defend those falsely accused and proven innocent. If you're only doing one and not the other, you're part of the problem.

              He also doubled down on that stance in the Joe Rogan podcast last year. He even admitted to going to a Hollywood sex party with illegal drugs and unprotected sex with "very very young boys." combine that with milo bathing in a tub of pigs blood doing his own spirit cooking stuff even before pizzagate and then milo looks like he should be a suspect. Or at a minimum not making him the face of a faceless movement.

            No thanks. He has spoken out against white nationalism. Whilst also promoting that white women should have sex with black guys. That goes against everything I stand for.

            I think this may have been a mistake to put Milo in a Pedophile related spotlight. This only gives him the attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I believe they have done, is put someone who the left views as "deplorable", and now that they labeled him a pedophile, this makes them angrier. This, I think, is a great place to have Milo. He could now openly talk about Pedogate, not from a Trump's "puppet" position, but from now, a victim's perspective.
           </p>
           <p>
            What he should do, is start having victims of pedophilia, human trafficking, etc, on to talk about their story. He could turn this attempt to de-legitimize him, and eventually Breitbart/Bannon/Trump, into something. If Fox news gave him 20 minutes to speak on the issue, maybe in person with Hannity, or someone else, he could build a massive anti-pedo platform. He wouldn't even need to name anyone, but just the action of human trafficking, sex trafficking, pedophilia, and CP.

             What I'm worried about is now that Milo was "outed" by MSM as a pedophile and then said he was a victim, what is going to happen when all of these other people start getting arrested and then claim they were just a victim as well? I hope that's not something the MSM could use to their advantage.

              There is a difference between a child having intercourse with an adult(victim), and an adult having sex with a child (pedophile).
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, unless you're in Mike Rowe's position, where you're 22, at a bar, and meet a girl there, and go home and are recorded having sex with her... and she turns out to be 16, but with a fake ID, I think in this case, Rowe would be a victim.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's all circumstantial really.... But what Hollywood is doing to child stars, or child trafficking, I can't see how the adults are in any way victims.

                It was, in my opinion, a VERY, poor, desperate decision to attack Milo. They shouldn't be giving him attention if they don't want people to be aware of him. Discrediting him with this poor, low energy attempt, is a version of "slut shaming", except 100x worse, as he was an actual victim. What the Antifa-Beta-Cucks and Pr'aggressives in Berkeley did only put him in the spotlight.

                What they've done is greenlit his platform to hand our redpills to way more people, and expose actual Pedophiles.

             In chess, the equivalent would be the Dems/MSM assuming Milo was "leaving the Queen en prise" (pun intended). In reality Trump/Populists are "sacking (sacrificing) the Queen".
             <br/>
             Not accepting the Queen sac would have been to their positional disadvantage, but it's the route they had to take. Instead they are thinking "one-movers", and couldn't see the forced "mate-in-three".

              Milo was definitely a Bannon / Trump tool. He's a symbol of free speech, which any American should respect. He's also, a "conservative", he could bring those folks in the bible belt who hate gays because "Jesus", to be more accepting of gays. I see him as a tool used to bring people together. He's pushing the pr'agressives away from the typical leftist/liberal, which is part of the plan. Once those pr'aggressives are so far out of the picture frame of reality, Trump can focus on reuniting the people. Imagine that, Trump bringing those who would have normally disowned their gay children, to be accepting of it.

                Trump and team have known about what is going on for years. Everything they do has been a strategy planned by advisers, known or unknown. Trump and team are always steps ahead of the Deep State. The Deep State infiltrated the government many, many years ago. But the Deep State itself has been infiltrated, by people who have been helping Trump and team from the inside.

                Deep State is a small part of this game. There is McCain, Soros, CIA, and many other players. How they're all working together, I'm sure is known.

                 Think about how Trump must feel about the comments by pervs he no doubt heard regarding Ivanka, assuming Trump is innocent of pedophilia. Plenty of junior Epsteins and wanna-be Polanskis were at the events where Ivanka sat on her father's lap or hugged and kissed him, or at least saw the published pictures of these events.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No doubt this lead to invitations and innuendo that must have enraged him (again, assuming he is innocent). And with many involved being influential and wealthy, beyond his level, what could he do about it at that time?  In the fullness of time, Trump may have realized he could, in politics, see some justice done. Fighting pervs may even have been one of Trump's main motivations to enter the Presidential race.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Taking a less rosy view of Trump, perhaps he is dirty as anyone, but more ruthless and believes he is a whole level more untouchable than the rest. Personally I doubt this. I don't think Trump is a pedo or in the same cabal, order or clique. He has been famous for getting to the top but not fitting in, for 30+ years.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Either way, strategically speaking, maybe Trump's pussygrabbing machismo talk and other minor indiscretions were intentional useful positioning, a gambit repeated this week with Milo.

                  Maybe Trump saw everything that was going on for long enough to know how to become President. The left is pushing it that he won on hollow promises and money, hoping people will eat that up.

                    Check this out.  It's crazy and VERY hopeful.  A hermit 30 years ago had a premonition.  It's a video of a priest telling about the hermit and trump. Lol.  But it can be proven.  Just watch

            Yeah, whether it was planned or not, Trump Bannon etc know how to counter punch.  I think the left is like a fighter backed into a corner, dazed - just wildly throwing punches that are easy to counter effectively even if they land a shot or two (makes me wonder if Trump can flip the Flynn thing?)...with that said, I have seen desperate fighters land lucky knockout punches from the ropes.  We all need to keep the pressure on, and keep praying for smart tough vigilance for those on the front lines (IMHO)

             Flynn was used so that they can use it against McCain (He leaked the information) because he led the charge to wire tap Flynn illegally. McCain also did the same thing in 2008, so now that McCain has spoken out against it he cant fall back on anything

               I said "fall back on anything" because in 2008 McCain did the same thing Flynn did, he talked to Russia "when he wasn't supposed to." Now that he is highly against it, he'll have nothing to defend himself with because he himself spoke out against it. Trumps team will use him illegally wire tapping Flynn to investigate him, using that will uncover his pedo activity and connections to Soros.

            I agree. Milo is clearly a victim of catholic molestation and the way he spoke of these events make that clear. We must commend him for dealing with the situation immediately, bringing truth and justice to light. That is what the alt-right is all about, truth and nothing else. We all need to know and understand the truth if we are to continue inhabiting this planet.

             The alt-right is right about identity politics and race relations and biology but they're certainly not very much into "truth" when it comes to major controversial events like 9/11 for example. At least from my experience they are wholly averse to anything conspiratorial and thus have been duped by hoax after hoax over the last several years. If they hear Muslims did something they don't bother questioning the mainstream media, which they also say they hate. In this way they show a lot of cognitive dissonance.

               Look them up for yourself. There's MOUNTAINS of evidence out there that shows this was a set up if you actually want to find the truth. This is not a partisan issue! People seeking and bringing forth the truth on this come from everywhere on the political spectrum. Just look into it for ourself!

               If you want to delve into 9/11 - take it from someone who has spent possibly 100s of hours watching or reading material on it - it was an inside job. No doubt whatsoever. If you spend any more than a few hours on it you will reach the same conclusion. 
But where to start given the huge amount of material on it (much of it daft disinfo designed to discredit all other theories).

               Finally if you still react negatively whenever you hear the term "conspiracy theory", understand it's because the term has been weaponised by the CIA in 1967 ON RECORD to use as a weapon against anyone who pointed a finger of suspicion at anyone in power.
              </p>
              <p>
               In short it's a cultural meme weapon whose purpose is to entrain the public into disregarding any "conspiracy theory" aka skeptical critical thinking as an impulse, and to recoup and reject anyone who puts forward or entertains any such thoughts.

               Let's see.....just one example: the BBC reported the collapse of WTC7 no less than 23 minutes before it happened. There you go, 100% unequivocal proof of an inside job. The rest is just figuring out how it was done.

                The controlled fall of the buildings was quite... odd.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you actually have a source on this?
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't disagree that it was a Saudi backed inside job due to the secrets that were held and destroyed in those specific buildings.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why didn't any other nearby buildings collapse? Just the ones that harbored intelligence offices.

              There is no alt right, there is an alt left. On the right there are pro establishment and citizens. The citizens are being referred to as alt right are actually the ones that hold traditional right values. Not the other way around.

              Well then start presenting that truth to the alt-right and they will start talking about it. And I don't agree. I believe most people are aware 9/11 was a conspiracy whether consciously or not.

               Yeah there are some who are open to this sort of talk, I mean so much research has been done about 9/11 that only an ignoramus can believe the government narrative.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the leaders prohibit any talk about any of this to the point that it seems suspect.

            Things are gonna start rolling. I have very good sources plain and simple that have steered me straight the past few months. This was all planned and allowed to happen by Milo and Trumps team. Now that they have attacked Milo simply for talking somewhat in favor of lowering the consent age, now the Democrats have made their stance Anti-Pedo. With the CNN tapes leaking tomorrow and arrests coming in the next few months, they'll have to turn on their own or flip stances. Both being bad moves for them

             This is such Bullshit. Now it's a "few months" till arrests? First it was "Sessions has to be confirmed first" then it was "next week, you'll see" and now it's "a few months". Next it will be "after midterms" then 'after reelection". Sure, whatever.

                Yes.  I know it's stupid to believe the anon's but I get really impatient and moody with all the waiting.  The anon's pacify me.  Lol.  We are ABSOLUTELY certain that they are all trolls, so I keep the faith that at least one is telling the truth.

              CNN leaks will be HIGHLY damaging, possibly ending them all together. Lots of collusion and openly admitting to censoring/spinning stories for their agenda. As far as arrests go Im gonna leave it at what I said, Ive been told that is as much as I can say so I'll leave it at that until I hear otherwise.
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT: Sorry forgot to answer you later half questions. Weiner hard drive stories are legit, worse than what you've heard probably. Take the Fatherhood video that leaked and multiply it by 100

               I worry that they only arrest one republican and one democrat but let the rest off the hook.  Like maybe they'll arrest posesta, Alefantis, and McCain but no one else evens though they have Been raping children too

               Oh good grief :(
It must be live recordings of rapes and murder.  If the nypd or FBI don't tell us what they know and don't make arrests within the next 3 months, I will lose it.  I mean we will have to be like the left and protest in front of the nypd and FBI headquarters. We can't just stay quiet forever

               Thank you...this is comforting.  We got SO spoiled with daily Podesta leaks....and we've been chasing rabbit trails after we digested all that we were fed.  Can't wait until meat is back on the menu.

             I almost think it's the opposite and just a psy op against all forces Trump. They will try to chip away at his strongest voices until he is left to stand alone. This is also probably why Info Wars was just dropped from a major advertising company to the point of them backing out of a contract. It's why this attack on Milo was manufactured all of a sudden. It's the elite playing their chess game.

             Anyway, I hope you're right and I'm wrong.

               Again, THAT IS NOT WHAT HE SAID. And just before he said it he mentioned consenting adults. He was talking about HIS OWN OF AGE RELATIONSHIP, NOT OF 13 YEAR OLDS quit spreading deep state propaganda. You have been lied to and are now spreading the lies. When he said that he was talking about ADULTS NOT KIDS.

             I have been thinking this too (or hoping).  When Milo had to cancel his PG speech a month or so ago, i wonder if that is when he was approached about this.  Someone on the inside knew the ammo the left / never trumper's had, waiting for him to speak out about PG.  Then when he cancelled, the left (Soros, et al) staged the Berkley protests to get his name in the national spot light, then he was invited on to Bill Maher, furthering his attention and spreading people's knowledge of him.  The left thought they had him... set him up to fail with the recordings they found.  But he knew all along and set
             <strong>
              them
             </strong>
             up to position themselves as anti-pedo's.   Might be a little far fetched, but this is what i am hoping to be true.

             <p>
              EDIT: Reason he cancelled his PG talks in December was that Bannon and Trump had their PG plans laid out, Milo talking about it that soon was jumping the gun. Milo has said many times that he owes everything to Bannon and he is a father figure to him so he respects him as much as any person can

               The only difference is this wasn't a left plan. This was a RINO plan. I'm sure cheered on by the left. Maybe it was simply a pedo plan from both sides.

               I am curious if you know when Milo started working for Breitbart. This was my theory also except I think this was all planned out a long time ago and if Trump didn't win it was still the plan.

             I really hope you are right about this being a staged thing.  Regardless, I don't think of Milo much differently, aside from him just making another comment that I personally think is a bit much or pushing too far (I love his defense of free speech)... but that's what he does.  He says things as provocatively as possible to trigger people, provoke them into thinking differently.  Milo doesn't defend pedophiles.  I really think he was making light of his own personal experience, and like I said pushing the envelope.

              I agree.  He didn't choose his words as carefully as he should have.  But as a victim, I'm giving him a pass for seemingly still being confused by what happened to him.  he followed up his poor choice of words by clearly stating he thinks pederasty is wrong.

              I think at least part of the reason he was talking about 13 year olds with adults gay relationships in a positive light was about protecting his "inter child" or ego and projection since he was a victim of child abuse himself. his behavior is that of someone who has experienced multiple adverse childhood experiences

               Milo vindicated my claim that homosexual relationship is predatory in nature. It is a relationship steered by an adult, molesting and seducing minors, or young man which in lexicography of gays is 'boy.' In Russia for instance, the word homosexual and gay is not even used, the word used is Pederast. Milos account of Hollywood parties with producers and directors going after very young boys is an eye opener. Milo gives us a glipse into the true predatory perverted nature of the gay world - straight from the horses mouth. Alifantis instagram
photos are incriminating because photos if children are incongrous with adult men who do not have children due to their sexual orientation.

              Milo is a sick fuck, a perfect example of why homosexuality needs to be outlawed. At least Putin has the balls to stand up for what's right and not bow down to these sick demented, degenerate brainwashed fucks
