            So it was a mausoleum with no secret baby deaths. Just like I predicted in the first thread.

            I see a couple of previous posts that did not raise much awareness. I'd encourage everyone to also read through the wikipedia link.

            The mention of 1000 babies illegally sent to the US for adoption is the key here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, this ominous statement: The report states that if thousands of babies were illegally adopted to the United States, without the willing consent of the birth mother, then this practice was facilitated by doctors, social workers, religious orders, and many more people in positions of authority.
           </p>
           <p>
            The report states that there is a REAL DANGER THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE MAY STILL WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM.[81]

             The fact that pregnant unwed mothers showed up at that place is evidence that they wanted the babies to have a good home.  That was the entire mission of the place I think you'll find.

             The secret satanic nuns baby killing ritual was a bust so have more evidence for the back-up scandal please.

              What an ignorant response. I suppose that is the goal of a disruptor/agitator.

              Unwed single women who became pregnant were sent to give birth there, rather than at a hospital or at home. The nuns were trained nurses and midwives.[26] In 1927, the Board of Health directed that a maternity ward be added to the Home so that the mothers could be segregated from the public wards. This was built in 1929.[27] The mothers were required to stay inside the Home for one year, doing unpaid work for the nuns,[26] as reimbursement for some of the services rendered. Some women who had had two confinements were sent directly to nearby Magdalene laundries after giving birth, as punishment for their recidivism.[28] According to Professor Maria Luddy, "Such a stance, though not intended to be penal, allowed for the development of an attitude that accepted detention as a means of protecting society from these reoffending women."[29]
For each mother and child in the home, the County Council paid the nuns £1 a week.[26] At the end of the year, the mothers left while their babies were typically kept at the Home.[30] The children stayed there until they could be adopted, fostered, or until they were old enough to be sent to industrial boarding schools.[31] There were some complaints of fostered children being exploited. An October 1953 article in The Tuam Herald said "an effort was not always made to find the home that most suited the child or the child that most suited the home. The allowance given to foster parents was not always spent on the child's welfare".[32] Local historian Catherine Corless also uncovered one case where a mother found work in England and paid the nuns to care for her son in the Home. The nuns did not tell her that her son had been fostered and "kept each instalment that she sent them".[33] Some babies were sent to clergy in the United States to be illegally adopted by Catholic families there.[34]
A 1947 report by an official inspector who visited the Home says some of the children were suffering from malnutrition, and 12 out of 31 infants examined were described as being "emaciated and not thriving". It also says that the Home was overcrowded, with 271 children and 61 mothers living there.[35] Death rates were extraordinarily high: 34 per cent of children died in the home in 1943; 25 per cent died in 1944; 23 per cent died in 1945; 27 per cent died in 1946. The report states "The death rate amongst infants is high... The death rate had appeared to be on the decrease but has now begun to rise again. It is time to enquire into the possible cause before the death rate mounts higher." The report went on to say, "the care given to infants in the Home is good, the Sisters are careful and attentive; diets are excellent. It is not here that we must look for cause of the death rate".[35]
An inspection two years later in 1949, conducted by inspectors from the Galway County Council, reported “everything in the home in good order and congratulated the Bon Secour sisters on the excellent condition of their Institution.”[36]
The Home closed in 1961, and most of the occupants were sent to similar institutions, such as Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea.[37] The building lay mostly disused until its demolition in 1972,[1] and a new housing estate was built on the site.[38]
