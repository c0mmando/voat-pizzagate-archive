             Unfortunately for you, that's not how it works.   Thread is about Rod Wheeler's accusations.  They will be true or false completely independent of little ole me.

              You are not here to discover the truth. You have never ever posted anything that wasn't part of the Deep State's party line. Your only purpose here is to "Resist" because you are a noxious bigot and a Limousine Liberal who's incapable of believing Hillary Clinton has ever committed any crime anywhere at any time in the History of the Universe.
             </p>
             <p>
              You have never changed your mind about anything. Any objective person would openly admit an error but you never do. As far as you're concerned you've been 100% correct about everything. You're batting a thousand. You can easily prove me wrong by pointing us to any error in your analysis thus far. I've admitted my errors countless times. But you can't admit an error because as far as you're concerned you've never been wrong.

              Unfortunately for you, the fact that you're a known shill with at least 3 alts IS relevant to the credibility of this thread. You only seem to post and comment things either to defend leftist elites or to oppose those who oppose them. You have no problem with the scandals of those you defend, such as that thing about Hillary and white phosphorous you're always silent on whenever pressed about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The agenda of the shill is to distract, mislead, demoralize, and misdirect those pursuing truths that oppose the shill's agenda. Since you're a shill, then your motive in making this post is blatently obvious.
             </p>
             <p>
              GTFO shill. Nobody wants you here. You contribute nothing of value life, society, nor to the cause of exposing pizzagate. In fact, this community is discussing a change to our rules and policies specifically to deal with people like you because we're sick of your constant efforts to undermine us.

                If you're as dedicated to the truth as you say you are (yeah right), then explain why not a single post of yours has ever had anything to do with exposing pedophiles, exposing satanists, exposing possible human trafficking suspects/routes. Instead, every single one of your posts is with the intention of defending the people we're looking at (using namely MSN aka "true fake news" as your source) or attacking those opposed to leftist elites?
               </p>
               <p>
                Your source is WaPo, a site with direct connections to John Podesta. Known Fake News outlet. Thus the credibility of your claim is suspect.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why do you feel the need to have 3 alts besides the purpose of giving yourself upvoats so as to downvoat threads that oppose your agenda?
               </p>
               <p>
                Why are you okay with Hillary Clinton's connections to a certain white phosphorous incident but not with anything when it comes to someone who's right wing?

           </p>
           <p>
            First off, The assumption is that Seth is dead. There are different sides right off the bat on this one,  but I am starting to lean with the naysayers.

             Express an unpopular opinion here on Voat, and you'll be downvoated and called a "shill."

              I've just been running different scenarios,  and I did say I'm leaning.  But you have to admit, the Seth story took over PG.

              also always on my mind is mockingbird

              When my Mother started going to the Doctor a lot I asked her whats up?  She would say she just having things checked out. Anytime I brought it up, she would steer away from the subject
             </p>
             <p>
              I let her do it thinking she would tell me if it wasn't good news. It wasn't until I saw all the meds that I said that's it and wouldn't leave it alone till she told me.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's what the Seth story makes me feel, so until I get better info, it will remain questionable.

              As for being called a shill, I've been called worse lol
