            Its about time that people come out against this pedo and abuser --- IMHO!!! Just worried that these actors are not that famous enough to say what really happened and people believe them...

            Do you people remember the "Bill Clinton Is A Rapist" campaign in 2016?
           </p>
           <p>
            What about a "Woody Allen is a Pedophile" program in 2018?
           </p>
           <p>
            Question. What if someone who's good with technology were to design those square symbols that you can point your phone at, and it takes you to a webpage with information? And what if those squares were put on posters that said "Woody Allen Is A Pedophile"? And what if those posters were glued to the walls and street poles around theaters where the Woody Allen movies are showing? And what if all people had to do was point their phones at the posters and they'd go straight to articles about Woody Allen's pedophilia?
           </p>
           <p>
            LOL, would you go into a theater and still buy a ticket if you read this article:
            <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mira-sorvino-letter-dylan-farrow_us_5a56b660e4b08a1f624b47e0">
             https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mira-sorvino-letter-dylan-farrow_us_5a56b660e4b08a1f624b47e0
            </a>
            or would you buy a ticket to some other movie in the theater? Maybe that would hurt his enablers where it counts, in the wallet!

            I know she is telling the truth. In 2009 I was at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel with a client waiti g for our car. ( I am a publicist and it was award season). Woody, his wife and two young tween daughters were there waiting as well. He was gripping them, grabbing them and the two young girls seemed very angry and uncomfortable. Now I know why

            America needs to know and understand that MALES are our sexual abusers of children --
           </p>
           <p>
            Just knowing that will help you protect your children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Females are NOT our sexual abusers of children and neither are Homosexuals who are 100X LESS likely to sexually abuse a child.
In fact, don't think any lesbian has ever been found to have sexually abused a child.
In Hawaii -- before the coming of the "white" man -- homosexuals there were held in high honor and esteem for their care of orphaned children.
It is Christianity and all male-supremacist religions which present a threat to the minds and bodies of children.
And we see this over and again, especially in regard to "Church" involvement in the Hampstead case and the 
Dutroux case in Belgium where many higher up's were involved -- before the investigations were turned against
the victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just tuned into CBS to see if they were running the preview and will try to remember on Thursday.  Thanks!
           </p>
           <p>
            I've long believed Dylan Farrow and Mia Farrow.  The physical evidence also supports the reality that she 
was sexually abused by Woody Allen.  Something strange also happened between Moses and Woody
where at one time Moses was making clear that Woody Allen had been "grooming" Soon Yi Previn since
his first days visiting Mia Farrow's apartment.  Those claims petered out in a new and even stranger 
relationship between Moses and Woody.
           </p>
           <p>
            What has to be understood in ALL of the revelations we are hearing now of sexual harassment and sexual abuse of females -- especially in Hollywood where there is great evidence that women have been held back in their careers -- is that NATURE put her trust and confidence in females in giving them everything to do with childbearing, the nurturing of children and the protection of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            When women are oppressed as they have been for a minimum of 2,000 years by Christianity/Vatican-RCC which underpins Elite-patriarchy, they Mothers are unable to protect their children from male sexual abusers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The rare occasions when we see females/mothers involved in abusing children usually shows that they have been under the influence of a heterosexual male.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are all new realities -- if you want change in the world -- if you want to protect children -- then you must listen to what women and children are telling you.

             /But blaming anything on 'MALES' only isn't going to fix anything. You're just making an accusation without any tangible solution.. that is: you're just laying down the blame.  Kinda counter-productive to the overall goal here.

              Quest --
             </p>
             <p>
              Actually, parents can't protect their children unless they know who the abusers are likely
to be.  And studies show that our sexual abusers of children are MALES.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's times for males who don't sexually abuse children to wake up to this reality and understanding it.
             </p>
             <p>
              And it's not "counter-productive" in protecting children from abusers ... it is making parents aware.
             </p>
             <p>
              INCEST is one of our most common crimes ...
and it is sexual abuse of young males and females by adults in their families ...
Grandfathers, Fathers, Step-fathers, Uncles, Male cousins -- and male friends of the family.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, right now Prof. Sigmund Freud is under suspicion of having been a pedophile himself -- 
likely generational -- but the lie of the "Oedipus Complex" still stands and confuses the public.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sure you recall that Freud made the outrageous suggestion that it was infants, toddlers and 
young children who were the sexual aggressors against adult males in their families?
             </p>
             <p>
              Freud betrayed the many males and females who had confided in him their sexual abuse
as young children by adult males in their families -- and friends of the family.

             Beliefs like you've just stated are why female pedophiles can operate so much more easily than male ones.

              Females are NOT our sexual abusers of children ...
unless they are involved with a heterosexual male.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look at the cases, you will generally find a heterosexual male involved
with the woman in some way -- Step-father is very common for INCEST.

               <strong>
                While experts agree the majority of paedophiles are men
               </strong>
               , Dr Sullivan says women are responsible for more offences than previously thought. 
"What I can say for certain is that it's way more prevalent than people fully appreciate or understand," he told the ABC. 
"There's some research to suggest it could be as high as 25 per cent. 
"However, when you look at the representation within the criminal justice system it could be as low as 3 to 4 per cent of overall convictions."

             <p>
              And the figures I've seen of 3000 pedophiles imprisoned in one case, only 12 were female.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, you have to understand that when someone is sexually abused it can cause
them to become a pedophile.  (See MKULTRA)
Haven't seen recent percentages on this but from memory I think it's in the 20% to 40%
range.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for LESBIANS what I've said is true -- it is RARE, extremely RARE for a Lesbian to sexually
abuse a child ... like almost never...
             </p>
             <p>
              Evidently, you and others remain confused when an adult female has sex with a teenaged girl.
That's pedophilia NOT homosexuality.
Many tend to think of pedophilia as only involving very young children -- but there are other names
as the ages of the child increase.  And here are separate terms for those who sexually abuse 
teenagers.
              <br/>
              Pedophilia is about the AGE of the victim -- it's not about homosexuality.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know ... people still think that Sandusky was a homosexual ... but he was a pedophile --  !!
             </p>
             <p>
              I did look at your links -- but you're working on basic misunderstandings.

               Yes, the are many more male pedophiles than female ones.

               <p>
                Think the last ratio I saw in one prison was 3,000 males pedophiles and 12 female pedophiles.

               <p>
                Sometimes it is also difficult to see into the background as to who is controlling the operations.
Consider Female Genital Mutilation in African nations where there are still today 100 MILLION 
women alive today having suffered that mutilation.  It is women who are often doing the cutting.
But it of course males in the background threatening them.

                Sorry, but even the right wing women's group - Family Research Council -- confirms the findings
of studies which make clear that it is MALES who are our sexual abusers of children.
And, that they are heterosexual males.

                This has always been true -- INCEST is our most common crime ...
committed by fathers, step-fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins -- and male friends of the family.

                  In general, females are NOT our sexual abusers of children.  It will happen when females
are under the influence of a heterosexual male or males.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  HOMOSEXUALS ... including lesbians are not either our sexual abusers of children,

                   in general

                 <p>
                  And it is RARE, in fact to find that a lesbian has sexually abused a child.
Often people think that if a female rapes a young female child that she is a homosexual ...
and same in the Sandusky case ... but it doesn't work that way -- 
Pedophilia is about AGE of the victim.
Homosexuals seek adult relationships with other adult homosexuals, in general.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As for homosexuals, in Hawaii at one time -- before the arrival of the "white" man -- 
Homosexuals were held in high esteem and honor for their care of orphaned children.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Vatican/RCC has been spreading fear and intolerance for homosexuals for 2,000 years or so.
That hatred has been well taught to members.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What I am reciting to you is based in studies -- nothing that I've invented.
Studies show that males are our sexual abusers of children and that they are heterosexual males.
Heterosexual males are 100X MORE likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.

                  No -- I don't see that "male-centric religions are preventing all women from following their inbuilt, biological, nurturing urges" ...
in fact they have often forced women to have children by preventing the public from access to birth control and abortion.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I mention organized patriarchal religions because they underpin Elite-patriarchy.
And most of our societies are still under patriarchal control.
That is most of the WORLD which certainly not only complicates the lives of women, but the entire world.
And this continues to be ongoing violent oppression of women.  We've seen some of it revealed in the 
Weinstein accusations where there was beyond the actual "events" very deep and harmful long term damage
to their ability to make a living, to continue with their acting careers.
We've also seen in both Weinstein and Woody Allen the use of their wealth to try to disparage what these
women are saying.  Weinstein actually employed very high level and investigators ... Woody hired at the
least publicists to plant damaging stories about Mia and Dylan with media.
"The Bird with One Wing" doesn't quite fly ... it behaves erratically in the sky..
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When we understand the "complications" from the highest perspective they are easier to understand.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Christianity's violence was transferred here after soaking the soil of Europe in blood with Crusades and
Inquisitions and Burning Women at the Stake whom they called "witches."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And having been brought here under Papal Edict to "enslave or kill" the native people here
they actually did so in the most horrific violence seen since those days in Europe when they
set new precedents of violence. 112 million native people killed to steal their land.
You might even be familiar with the instruments of torture they invented solely for that purpose.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Our Founders further complicated things by supporting genocide against the natives ..
and by supporting the system of Slavery for the benefit of Elites/wealthy.
That also guaranteed the Civil War ... which further benefitted Elites by splitting the nation into two camps
of hatred which still echo on today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Our Founders actually created an Elite-Patriarchy while proclaiming "All are equal" in betrayal of the people.
They endowed them with land grants, gave Elites immense influence and control over our "people's" government, 
the nation's wealth and natural resources.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'd recommend "prioritizing" from the top down -- that's where the stink is.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'd of course also be interested in what you are saying of female pedophiles .... if you have any links,
please pass them along.  Also with what you mean specifically by "the priorities of our legal system."

                  Once again, let me make clear - as you seem to not be hearing it -- what I'm repeating to you are the results of studies.
Not something I have personally invented.

                  If you don't understand the treason of the CIA which was the organization used to move
the next opportunity for the rise of the Fourth Reich to this nation and to other nations
over which the US had influence and control at the end of WWII ...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you don't understand it as an arm of the Catholic Church - after all where did its armies go? -- as made
clear by John Stockwell/former CIA and whistleblower featured a number of times by C-span.in telling us 
that the CIA is "Catholics in Action" ... and all to be found on YouTube, as well.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you're not familiar with drafts of CIA operations being made two years before the end of WWII
to control our press, to move 200,000+ Nazis into the US to found the CIA, funneled into the FBI
and other government agencies -- and to "hot spots" all over the world ... then you are unaware
of the true "complications" of the world...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also that the US created the means to keep right wing in power in nations over which they had
control at the time -- Japan, Germany, Italy, France.  In fact, in Italy the US actually resurrected 
the Mafia there in order to carry out the program.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At the same time, higher ups in Hitler's military were visiting our Pentagon to make deals/
arrangements.

                  I have some of the Original versions of these programs as they once appeared on Wiki ...
which has been under general whitewashing since last June.
But I do think they still tell enough of the story to be informative enough.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also that much of MKULTRA and Monarch programs were ordered destroyed.
That program continued experiments by Nazis which were being conducted in concentration camps.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Patriarchy is a system of oppression just as Colonialism was a system of oppression.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm sure you're also familiar with MKULTRA and Mind Control programs which actually created 
new personalities in children who would perform as homosexual prostitutes, as drug runners, and as 
spies involved with espionage for blackmail.  These new personalities created by torture and sexual
abuse could also be programmed to learn new languages and to have photographic memories.

            CBS - Fuck - I mean did you hear the way that bitch at CBS was condescendingly asking the questions? - They are trying to discredit her. They will try to discredit now. They want to start the narrative that the #metoo movement is the witch hunt Woody Allen claimed it would be. Who better to corroborate this narrative than Woddy Allen himself. They'll get that fucker on record for TNYT and the New Yorker, etc, - and they'll paint him out to be a misunderstood genius or whatever. They'll end it with something like "His actions were ill-conceived but not predatory, he is a misunderstood eccentric. Thank you for your time Mr.Allen. - etc.  Fuck Woody Allen.

            There is going to be a breaking point. Like a damn that is starting to leak. Weinstein was the first to start squirting. He was contained, and little drips and drops have been oozing out since, a couple of quick plugs have been stuck in here and there... but a rumbling sound, a creaking is rising...

             Soon-Yi was simply the adoptive daughter of Allen's ex (Mia Farrow), and there was no father-daughter relationship between Allen and Soon-Yi. There's no reason to think that she's a victim here. The allegations of Dylan Farrow against Allen are the real issue.

             He did not.
            </p>
            <p>
             A.  She was not underage.  She was 20 when Mia found the photos.  She had just returned from her first year in college.  Allen never really spent any time alone with her prior to that.
            </p>
            <p>
             B.  She was not his stepdaughter.  Soon Yi Previn was the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and her then husband Andre Previn.   Woody and Mia were not married and were not living together.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can mention the lines he did cross but those are the facts.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Dlyan Farrow, this was looked at pretty much as soon as it was alleged.  And it the multiple doctors who examined he said no abuse occurred and that is why he was not charged.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is by no means whatsoever a cut and dried case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately we know that if you have a 7 year old tell you a story over and over and over you can actually imprint a memory.

            </p>
            <p>
             So I think you have to go back to original events.   This allegation happened after the Soon Yi affair was discovered and during Farrow's and Allen's custody battle.  That is the backdrop.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a good timeline of those events

            <blockquote>

              January 1992: Mia Farrow finds intimate Polaroids of her (adopted) daughter Soon-Yi Previn, age 20, under a box of tissues on the mantle in Allen’s Manhattan apartment. After confronting Soon-Yi and confirming the affair, she tells all but the youngest children what she has learned.

             The incident with Dylan was said to happen in August, two days before they were sign their custody agreement.  There is a lot about Mia Farrrow's behavior at this time that had observers concerned
            </p>
            <p>
             Among the folks who either say no abuse occurred or raise significant doubts are the following

            <ul>
             <li>
              Dr. Susan Coates, a child psychologist, who was working with the family for two years.
             </li>
             <li>
              The pedatrician Farrow takes Dylan to, the day after the incident.  When asked where her father touched her she pointed to her shoulder.
             </li>
             <li>
              The doctor's who examine her 5 days after the incident
             </li>
             <li>
              Dr. Nancy Schultz, Dylan's therapist
             </li>
             <li>
              A group of child abuse experts at Yale-New Haven Hospital investigating the abuse allegation for the Connecticut State Police.  The interview her 9 times, their statement
             </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              describes inconsistencies in Dylan’s accounts: “Those were not minor inconsistencies. She told us initially that she hadn’t been touched in the vaginal area, and she then told us that she had, then she told us that she hadn’t.” In interviews, he testified, she had “a rehearsed quality,” and once said, “I like to cheat on my stories.”
             </p>
             <p>
              “We had two hypotheses: one, that these were statements that were made by an emotionally disturbed child and then became fixed in her mind. And the other hypothesis was that she was coached or influenced by her mother. We did not come to a firm conclusion. We think that it was probably a combination.” But, he stated, “We don’t have firm evidence that Miss Farrow coached or directed Dylan to say this.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Leventhal noted one “very striking” consistency in Dylan’s accounts of the abuse: she connected it with “one, her father’s relationship with Soon-Yi, and two, the fact that it was her poor mother, her poor mother,” who had lost a career in Allen’s films.

              As Moses originally made clear, Woody Allen was "grooming" Soon Yi Previn on his very first visits to the Mia Farrow apartment.  Granted that story has been changed, but so was the relationship between Woody and Moses changed in what seems to have been new financial support for Moses.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sue Coates, child psychologist, confirmed the warnings of friends and relatives of Mia Farrow who were greatly concerned about his behavior with Dylan -- which was described as an "obsession."
             </p>
             <p>
              Nannines in the Farrow household were told to WATCH Woody carefully with Dylan and that he wasn't to be alone with her.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone who feels inclined to believe this hogwash should actually review the records -- all of them are on the internet.
             </p>
             <p>
              What would Yale's involvement be with this crime, except to represent and support Woody Allen who has given a great deal of money to the university?  PLUS, they wouldn't testify under Oath.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course a child will be "inconsistent" in discussing a subject should could barely understand at her age.
DYLAN is here and present now in adulthood to tell you the reality of her sexual abuse by Woody Allen.
The records of Dylan at the time when she began to reveal Woody's abuse to her Mother are also evidence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again -- males are our sexual abusers of children -- not females.
             </p>
             <p>
              And they are heterosexual males who are 100XMORE likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual according to studies.

All you did is spoil the little ones, Dylan and Satchel…. Everyone knows you’re not supposed to have an affair with your son’s sister…. I don’t consider you my father anymore. It was a great feeling having a father, but you smashed that feeling and dream with a single act.”

                Guess I forgot this part ...

               <p>
                <strong>
                 Again -- males are our sexual abusers of children -- not females

               <p>
                They are heterosexual males -- homosexual males are 100X LESS likely to sexually abuse a child.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes, we do see the occasional female involved in sexual abuse of a child, but it is generally 
connected to involvement with a heterosexual male.  Sometimes under threat.
I believe out of 3000 prisoners only 12 were female.  And that is far less that the number you
are suggesting.
               </p>
               <p>
                We also have to consider that 82% of females are sexually abused, usually in youth
and often by family members.  Without study, it can't be said whether that has had
an affect on these women which caused them to commit those crimes.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>

                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Let's try for a change, not to attack and try to blame the victim.
All studies and science -- even the right wing women's group (Family Research Council) confirms
that it is males who are our sexual abusers of children.
And they are generally males who are adult family members, or friends of the family.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think it's interesting that you're not questioning Woody's memory ... perhaps he sexually
abused Dylan and just forgot about it?
               </p>
               <p>
                As parents, we all know that children want to be friendly -- even when they don't understand
what they're being asked to do.  That's where pedophiles have the advantage, btw.
                <strong>
                 The first time they deny it.
                </strong>
                Of course THAT is true... but they will surrender to adult 
pressure especially when they have no understanding of why someone would ask them 
to lie.  And you're also making clear that after weeks and weeks of harassment of the 
child trying to confuse them that they succeed -- how charming!
As parents what we do know about children is that they very early on know the difference
between a LIE and the TRUTH.

                <p>
                 "Unfortunately the nature of human memory is that it is malleable. 
Psychologists have studies where they ask young children about an event that never happened. 
Week by week they ask the children about it. Within a very short time period, the children not only 
say it happened, but the children can tell you all about in detail."&gt;

                And did any of them suggest to the children that they should suck their thumb or tried to 
influence or "groom" them in any other way.  And how would we know?
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd suggest to parents that should there be a need for psychiatrists to have anything
to do with your child that you insist that you are present even if by a two-way mirror.
I would not leave my child alone with any MALE doctor.

                 It is, of course, not BS.   And yes we all should absorb it because we now understand much, much, much better how human memories works.  The human memory is not a tape recorder and our memories do change over time.

                   Where have a I said a single distortion?   And where did Moses say Allen was grooming Soon Yi.  Her certainly seems to be taking his father's side these days.  You can check his twitter feed for that

                   You seem very resistant to hearing how human memory actually works, but you should check out this video with memory scientist Stephen Ceci.  It's eyeopening.

                   His "mouse trap" experiment was very important in the study of memory and children.   They asked the kids about a painful event that did not happen to the children
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    Did you ever get your hand caught in a mousetrap and have to go to the hospital to get it removed?
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   They first week they kids all say no.  They go back and every week and ask the question again.  After several week many of the children are giving detailed accounts of where the mousetrap was, who was with them, the nurse at the hospital taking the mousetrap off their finger, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Basically kids tell you the truth the first time.   Subsequent times, they remember something about a mousetrap.  This "memory" of the mousetrap becomes stronger by subsequent events and they start to fill in the details.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Another thing that happens with kids is they are persuable, if the adult acts like their first truthful answer is the "wrong" answer and keeps asking over and over again, the kids pick up on this and change their answer.

                    Early in the scandal, Moses suggested that Woody was paying inordinate attention to Soon Yi from 
his very first visits to Mia's apartment... 
Bear in mind that Mia &amp; Woody had a 12 year relationship ... how old was Soon Yi when it began?
Moses also asked the Court NOT to force him to have honor visitation rights with Woody Allen.
Much, much later Moses changed and began to support a story that Mia had coached Dylan ...
this is also denied by Justice Wilk in Court hearings where he makes clear there is no evidence
for Mia having coached Dylan.

                   <p>
                    I have much better info on it but it's late and my filing system seem to have a lot of flaws!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Let me suggest to you that those who created the syndrome may be males with false memories?
Why wouldn't Woody Allen have false memories of what he did?
Rather this is a continuing and insulting effort to try to suggest that women and children who accuse
males of sexual abuse are somehow unreliable in their memory ... but the abuser isn't?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And in speaking of being "resistant" ... I'm sure I've suggested to you previously but it seems something
that you really don't want to acknowledge.  Yes, Woody Allen is likely lying but he may also be so old
that he just doesn't any longer remember sexually abusing Dylan.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The BS of psychiatrists being trained to fool children as to reality is sad and shameful.
Could be it challenges their previous abuse of patients by and their families by "only reflecting back to them what 
they have said."  A practice now overturned as shameful.
Psychiatry has been used as a means of torturing of patients with brain imbalances likely caused by chemicals ...
and VACCINES are a likely bet.  Especially that we see parallels between Autism and Schizophrenia now ...
both damage to the brain which controls the entire body. 
Vaccines are also now being connected to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ... Colic and Projectile spitting -- disorders of
the gastronomic system.
In Autism we see under-pruning of synopses of the brain -- in Schizophrenia we see over-pruning of the synopses.
Certainly VACCINES are to be challenged in this damage to children at very early ages -- even in infancy.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    What you're repeating In this BS harassment of children is that these children are being made victims of psychiatry.
Obviously, you think it's cute.  You're very easily convinced of the usefulness of pressure and harassment of children who
are already under extreme stress from sexual abuse by adults.   And I will remind you that these are ADULTS further 
harassing them in what is falsely called "medical assistance."
Your willingness to support this kind of nonsense is sickening and shows how little regard you actually
have for children.

                   Dylan Farrow's memory of the event like Woody Allen's would likely be more accurate the closer to the event than further away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Dylan Farrow did not initially say she was molested by Allen that story evolved over days and days of her mother asking about it.

                  <p>
                   She is very specific about details of what went on, but according to her brother Moses, those details don't match how the house was setup.   She claimed to look at train set when it happened.  But the train set was not in the attic, it was done in the house where a bunch of people were.  If it happened where the train set was it would have been visible to other people.

                    When you're talking about a 7 year old child there is no "initially" ... and her original comments
were recorded by Mia Farrow as she began to divulge them.
Later she makes clear that she did not tell the doctor on the first visit where Woody Allen had touched her because she was embarrassed.  That's when Mia returned to the doctor with Dylan so Dylan could make clear why she didn't at first tell him what Woody had actually done to her.
IF you are a parent and have any experience with children you readily understand this.
"False Memory" is BS -- it's a lie -- and it's over.  Try something else.

                    What Dylan said was that Woody took her to a third floor dark attic.  He told her to lie on her stomach.  Her underwear was removed.  Woody told her to look at a toy train she had in her hand.  Woody then penetrated her digitally.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And let me make clear to you and all readers here ...
DYLAN WAS FOUND IN THE ATTIC WITH WOODY ALLEN ... AND WITH MISSING PANTIES.
HER DRESS IN THE AIR.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And long before this Woody had been sent off to discussions with a psychiatrist because family and friends were making clear their concerns over Woody's very odd "obsession" with Dylan.  The psychiatrist made clear that Woody should not be alone with Dylan.   Everyone in the household was assigned to ensure that Woody wasn't alone with Dylan.  Nonetheless, Woody did manage to take Dylan off to the attic ... and this was going on while everyone was frantically searching for Dylan throughout the house in Connecticut.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    There was another incident where another Nanny or baby sitter entered a room where Dylan was sitting on a couch with her dress up and Woody Allen had his head in her lab, his face pointing into her lap ...
and Dylan explains also what he was doing at the time.  But a Nanny or a Baby sitter witnessed that behavior.  It's unusual of course for there to be witnesses because this is something that happens when children are isolated -- taken out of the view of their parents and guardians.  Just as men don't rape women when there are witnesses unless it is gang rape which is also becoming more common.

                      August 4, 1992: Allen visits Farrow and the children in Connecticut. Farrow has gone shopping with a friend, Casey Pascal. Babysitters, a number of children, Allen and other staff are at the house. Farrow has instructed babysitters not to leave Dylan alone with Allen. When Farrow and Pascal return from shopping, no one tells Farrow that anything was amiss between Allen and Dylan. Later, Sophie Berge, the children’s French tutor, notices that Dylan has nothing on under her sundress; she tells Farrow, who asks Kristine Groteke to get Dylan some underpants. At night Pascal’s baby-sitter, Alison Stickland, tells Pascal that she is bothered by something she saw (that day): Allen in the TV room, according to court documents, “kneeling in front of Dylan with his head on her lap, facing her body. Dylan was sitting on the couch staring vacantly in the direction of a television set.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      August 5, 1992: Pascal calls Farrow to tell what the baby-sitter said. Later Farrow will testify that she asked Dylan “whether it was true that Daddy had his face in her lap yesterday.” Farrow will add: “Dylan said yes. And then she said that she didn’t like it one bit.”

                     Farrow calls Dr. Coates to say Dylan has begun to complain that Allen abused her. “I was puzzled, because in that conversation she was very calm,” Dr. Coates testified. “I did not understand her calm.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     After consulting a lawyer, Farrow takes the child to a pediatrician. “When they arrived home [from the doctor], Farrow said Dylan had been ‘afraid to talk to the doctor,’ ” a nanny at the time, Monica Thompson, will testify in a sworn deposition. Farrow will testify that the child gestured to her shoulder when asked by the doc to indicate her “private part” and later confided that she felt embarrassed.

                    <p>
                     Depending on accounts, over twenty-four hours or a matter of days, Farrow videotapes Dylan. “I was present when Ms. Farrow made a portion of that tape outdoors,” Thompson, who had not been at the house on August 4, testified in her deposition. “I recall Ms. Farrow saying to Dylan at that time, ‘Dylan, what did daddy do…and what did he do next?’

                    <p>
                     “Dylan appeared not to be interested, and Ms. Farrow would stop taping for a while and then continue.”

                      This may have been yet one more attempt by Woody to set one member of the Farrow household
against the other as noted by Justice Wilk.

                       There was no witnessing or allegation of sexual abuse when Woody Allen left Connecticut.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Everything happens after this point.  Dylan does not come forward with any allegation of sexual abuse.  The process that starts the allegations are external.

                      <p>
                       The article you link to is from Mia life-long friend. Is it possible she will give Mia's story? That she might be biased?   On the flip side you have claimed the medical doctors and child sexual abuse experts who looked into this to be biased for Allen. Why?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Is it because of what they say?  That they believe no sexual abuse occurred.  These were either independent authorities or doctors who knew Dylan.  Do you think they would if they believed Dylan was abused they wouldn't say so?  Why would they do that?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Is there a single doctor or child abuse expert who looked at this case who believes child abuse occurred here?

                       That is a statement from Mia Farrow's lawyer to the press.  It carries no legal weight.    Thompson would testify in the custody case.  Here's what she said on the stand.

                        Nanny says Mia selective in taping abuse allegation
NEW YORK -- Mia Farrow was selective in interviewing her 7-year- old daughter about alleged sexual abuse at the hands of Woody Allen, a former nanny testified Monday at the couple's bitter child custody trial.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Under direct examiniation by Allen's attorney, Elkan Abramowitz, child nurse Monica Thompson said in state Supreme Court she was at Farrow's rural home in Connecticut last August when Farrow began questioning Dylan, asking, 'What did Daddy do?'
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        'Did Daddy ask you to take off your underwear?' Thompson quoted Farrow as asking.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        'Dylan had her head hanging down and did not seem interested in the conversation,' Thompson testified, saying she did not hear the child's answer.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        She said she continued to watch the interrogation and notice Farrow turned the video camera off and on as the child's interest in the conversation warranted.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        'She'd turn it off when Dylan didn't seem particularly interested,' Thompson testified.

to be the one who happened to walk into the DEN to see Woody on his knees in front 
of Dylan Farrow, with his face facing her vagina.

having nothing to do with Woody Allen.

actually went down between Woody Allen and Nanny Thompson ...
And by the way Woody Allen paid Thompson's salary as Nanny in Mia's household -- $40,000 a year.

                         Wilk was not in charge of determining if the abuse occurred.  The authorities that were said it didn't happen.  I think Wilk was going to award custody to Farrow no matter what.  I think he would have crucified if he didn't. I think awarding custody to Farrow was the right thing to do.  I do not believe any sexual assault occurred.

                         When you say he saw no evidence of coaching, he basically substituted his own expertise over people in the field.  He outright rejected testimony from a sex crimes detective that her questioning on the videotape was leading and suggestive.

                          Again, Wilk is a Supreme Court Justice who will review the records -- ALL of them.
It was obvious everything he had seen and heard caused him to be suspicious of Woody Allen as a 
manipulator and as someone trying to "pit one member of the Farrow family against the other" ...
for his own benefit.  Woody Allen was denied custody of Dylan, Moses and Satchel.

Yale team were saying ... but that he was unable to review the Yale investigation because they had 
destroyed their notes -- and refused to testify under OATH.

                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Wilk also saw evidence that the investigation was "sanitized" ... 
Needless to say that would have been done only for the benefit of Woody Allen.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Dylan Farrow has always made clear that she was molested by Woody Allen..
It also looks like Woody Allen had his eye on Soon Yi over the 12 year relationship between
Mia and Woody.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The babysitter very CLEARLY related what was happening in the DEN between Woody Allen
and Dylan Farrow ... a young child sitting on a couch staring blankly at a TV scree while Woody
kneeled before her, with his face in her lap, facing her vagina.
Dylan describes what he was actually doing.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Mia has encouraged all information coming out -- sadly for Woody.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And now Dylan Farrow has decided that it is important for her to continue to pursue this case in media.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Woody has done nothing from the very beginning but engaged in some very harmful (and traditional BS comments)
against Mia who as a Mother of a daughter he was taking NUDE AND PORNOGRAHIC pictures of behaved as any
Mother would.  Plus hiring of publicists and I believe other investigators ... similarly to what Weinstein did.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Something made it very obvious to Wilk that  Woody was trying to manipulate witnesses... including family members.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Likely that when Dylan came along he interests changed from Soon Yi to Dylan.
And when he realized that Mia was still involved with Frank Sinatra it was possibly revenge
which caused him to not only abuse Dylan further, but to begin a relationship with Mia's daughter.

                Are we --
               </p>
               <p>
                Obviously, you didn't read Thompson's deposition which YOU linked to ...
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Farrow's attorney, Eleanor Alter, issued a statement Monday saying, "It is my understanding . . . that Ms. Thompson has totally recanted" the statements attributed to her. She noted that Thompson's salary, upwards of $40,000 a year, was paid by Allen. Thompson could not be reached for comment.
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Justice Wilk portrayed Mr. Allen as devious, hurtful and unreliable, a father. 
You'll also note that Judge Wilk of the State Supreme Court denounced Woody Allen 
for his attempts to pit one family member against the other
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                This also makes clear the reasoning behind Woody's attack on Mia and Dylan - financial losses... .
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Assessing a Reputation 
Mr. Abramowitz said that as a result of the case, Mr. Allen's reputation had taken "an enormous hit."
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                And it is very clear that at that time
                <strong>
                 Moses did not want to be "forced" by the Court to see his father.
                </strong>
                <strong>
                 As for Mr. Allen's third child, 15-year-old Moses Farrow, the justice said he would accede to the boy's 
wishes that he not be forced to see his father
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Justice Wilk, however, questioned the manner in which the Yale-New Haven team carried out its 
investigation of the allegations, as well as conclusions by two psychotherapists who treated Dylan 
that she had not been abused. "I am less certain, however, than is the Yale-New Haven team, that 
the evidence proves conclusively that there was no sexual abuse," Justice Wilk wrote
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 The justice said he believed the conclusions of the psychotherapists had been "colored by their
loyalty to Mr. Allen." He added that the unwillingness of members of the Yale-New Haven team to 
testify at the trial, except through a deposition by the team leader, and the destruction of the team's 
notes had "compromised my ability to scrutinize their findings and resulted in a report which was 
sanitized and, therefore, less credible."
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Ms. Alter said that Dylan had only a vague conception of the battle that has been waged over her 
and her siblings for months. She said that in the months away from Mr. Allen, the girl has become 
a happier child. "She has flowered in school and psychologically," the lawyer said.
                </strong>
                **http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/farrow-verdict.html
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd further add to this that once the ORIGINAL statements are made, they are usually the
best version of the truth we will get.  I don't know who was paying the nannies other than
Thompson, but once again that would have given Woody Allen another point of manipulation.
                <br/>
                And Mia Farrow was very aware of that reality ... as the Judge was.
               </p>
               <p>
                And - I do note that you want to "get the facts straight" ... as long as they are your facts.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sorry, but it isn't going to work that way.  Again, the records are available on the internet for 
all readers to access.
               </p>
               <p>
                The psychiatrist first consulted because of friend and family concerns about Woody Allen's behavior 
with Dylan made clear that his behavior was inappropriate.
Which is exactly what the family was seeing.  And which was also made clear by Dylan at that time...
and now.  Woody's Allen's behavior with Dylan was seen as an "obsession" by friends and family.
               </p>
               <p>
                And the Justice agreed ...
                <strong>
                 Referring to what Dylan's own psychotherapist called Mr. Allen's inappropriately intense behavior 
toward the little girl, the justice said it was unclear whether Mr. Allen could ever develop "the insight 
and judgment necessary for him to relate to Dylan appropriately."
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                As for Yale -- BECAUSE Woody Allen was a large donator to the University they should NOT
have been involved in this case ... which was a crime ... and a very important case.
               </p>
               <p>
                AND, if you have read Justice Wilk's comment's about the fact that they would NOT testify
under oath, had destroyed their notes -- questioned the manner in which they had carried 
out their investigations -- you also see that Yale's findings did not impress him either.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wilk also challenged the conclusions of the psychotherapists as having been "colored by 
their loyalty to Mr. Allen."
Wilk added:  All of this had ..** "compromised my ability to scrutinize their findings 
and resulted in a report which was sanitized and, therefore, less credible."**
               </p>
               <p>
                A report which was "sanitized" ... and "less credible."

               Women abuse children too! Women have allowed men to rape their kids, pimped out their own kids, and sexually abused their own kids themselves! Do you not read the news and see how many female teachers are sexually abusing students ALL THE TIME!? This isn't a male only issue!  Stop with your blame men for everything and women are innocent saints bullshit! It has to be so exhausting to live in that twisted reality in your head!

                Shizy --
               </p>
               <p>
                IF you bother to look into the stories you will usually find that when a female is
involved in the sexual abuse of a child that there is usually a heterosexual MALE
involved somewhere in the story.  Often a Step-father which one of our most 
common  crimes of INCEST.
I do read the news ... and I've started a file on "sad daily stories" about MALE abuse
of women and children as reported every day.
Not only sexual abuse of women and children -- not only sexual harassment --
not only coaches abusing female gymnasts -- the stories go on and on.
MALES are also our serial killers.
               </p>
               <p>
                And we haven't even gotten yet to the many MALES killing the women they allegedly love!
Chocking them, beating them -- and shooting them!
The guns here have made it much easier for males to cut down on the female population --
women in the US have an 11X greater risk of being shot by a male with a gun than women
in other wealthy nations.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I guess there weren't any "Witches" burned at the stake by Christianity, either ..?
That happened over hundreds of years both in Europe and on this land.
Why -- because they had knowledge of plants which are our medicines, including 
information about birth control which Nature provided in these plants.
All of this -- and the women -- were destroyed by patriarchy out of their own paranoia
and fear of women.

             Thought the interview with Dylan Farrow was weird -- but will try to catch what they play on Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do think that since Dylan has come on camera it may be more effective.
But this is actually a battle with Elite-patriarchy and its propaganda about women.
Pornography is part of that propaganda which seeks to make females only worthy of sexual abuse
and violence.  And it's a whole industry providing Billions every year to Comcast and Verizon.
            </p>
            <p>
             As this male sponsored history of females is overturned, the truth of male violence will begin dismantling Elite-patriarchy.
That's what they fear.  Again, if you want to protect children, then you must support women and their ability to protect children from males.  And, yes -- it is males who are our sexual abusers of children and they are heterosexual males.
That's always been the truth -- and it's still the truth today according to studies.

             There's been 2,000 years of persecution of homosexuals as well by the Vatican/Christianity and their lies.
Time to recognize who the liars are.

               It's important that women gain their rightful place in our societies in order to 
protect children.
               <br/>
               And right now it looks like fascists want to take us back to the Victorian Age and 
the days of the early Industrial Revolution here and Child Labor ...
And that's, of course, where children were made highly vulnerable to sexual abuse.

                  The kids I saw at the store I worked at they had just gotten out of college and they worked at the store for free.  They got trained in Sales and Merchandising and Marketing.  This was quite a few years ago, but I think they are still doing it.  So they just stayed after college and the parents would be footing their bill.  I was flabbergasted.  Of course I did know a couple that got a really good job there, but it was not a guarantee actually.  You might just end up with a sales job if not chosen. As everyone can expect they had their pets.  Also you know, the Govt. has Pages that have jobs that are of course given to the donors.  I believe this is just a start.  Even if they are paid they get a low salary in these jobs.  I have been worried about the intern positions though. Remember Monica was an intern.  But in the stores there are no guarantees.  Either free or very low pay depending where it is.  I have felt before that this may be the precursor to returning to Child Labor.

                   What kind of a "store" ... ?

                  <p>
                   There was a time when our government was subsidizing places like MacDonald's (fast food places) to take in
new workers and they'd subsidize the salaries for a period of time -- good profit for Mac's and other fast food
restaurants.  But what was happening finally at the end of the "training" period, either the job being offered 
wasn't worth while, or the company didn't like the employee -- and so the worker moved on elsewhere.
No unemployment benefits ... and then ... MacDonald's would take on NEW trainees and play the whole 
game over again.  Subsidy would end after the training period.  So continue profit for these fast food place
where they didn't have to even really pay the kids in training.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What you're saying seems to be a totally new step forward in free labor!
And agree that there will be some who are "favored" above others --
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What you're saying about Congressional Pages also makes sense ... do a favor for a donor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Well a little different from "child labor" as they were kids in factories only two years old and four years old!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In England, they had 8-10 year old girls on the street prostituting themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also remember the sexual scandals with the Pages in Congress ... ???

                  <p>
                   It looks like Monica was a plant ... easy to predict what would happen with Bill if they 
moved her in.

                    I no longer live there,   Very fancy store.   I hear that the programs still exist.  Just was surprised when I ate lunch with these kids who were a lot of fun, that I found out they were not getting paid.  Shocked is what I was.  Loved the store, but not the work.  On my feet all day.  Glad I am away from there now.

               Facts are facts...I would blame the culture as well...fascist in nature. Big "tell" as they say in poker. They hate women and children...Don't believe me? Look at Amazon's logo. Hint..it is an erect penis.

               Let's see ... YOU don't hate males who sexually abuse children?

              <p>
               That's surprising because most people here trying to save those children often express
hatred for them.

              Yes and it has been going on for years.  They have gotten away with plenty.  We know that at least one of these people in Hollywood has the power to rub someone out.  All of those that are close to this person are Accessories to the Fact.  And now  WE ALL KNOW.

              Yeah, they are trying to Test The Waters.  I have a Sinking Feeling that they are hoping to run her in 2020.  They are going Muddy the Waters for Trump until they are Thick With Lies and then they will bring out our Savior.  Oprah will be the Coming of Christ.  She will be our Lady in Shining Armor.  Yuck.  I am going to vomit.

             Gayle did ok in her interview with Dylan. But prior to that , her interview with Ann Curry was strange and combative. Thought Gayle seemed very hostile to Ann for most of the interview. Only after Ann refused to give details of how Matt Lauer treated her at NBC did Gayle finally settle down and act normal. She is getting very transparent to me, coming down on the side of those in control , rapists or not.

              There are many of of that think that he may be  involved in her death.  He is the one that discovered her and directed her in Poltergeist.  There was a CDAN Blind and a lot of people mentioned his name as allegedly  involved in her sexual abuse and her rape at the studio.The reading of the Blind is especially hard to take.  Some of us can't read it over again.

             They and others have been covering for him for years.  They know that WE know so they have to start throwing him under the bus.  They can't look like they have KNOWN all this time.  So now they have to agree that we are right.  His signing the Roman Polanski petition Speaks Volumes.

               Agree --
Alec Baldwin, some may recall, behaved rather weirdly towards his daughter with ex-wife ....
and left a very unpleasant message for his daughter which was widely circulated.
              </p>
              <p>
               What Alec Baldwin does best is impersonating the moronic Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live.
              </p>
              <p>
               The physical evidence of Dylan Farrow's sexual abuse by Woody Allen was ignored.
And Yale University's HUGE influence on the case is questionable, including the fact that they refused to testify under Oath.
              </p>
              <p>
               Woody Allen's work has long been acclaimed and rewarded.  This is about his personal behavior which ultimately effects audience support of artistic work.
              </p>
              <p>
               And, as I've said elsewhere, the early statements from Moses were that in his view Woody Allen had been "grooming" Soon Yi Previn since his first days visiting Mia Farrow's apartment.  It was AFTER 
that that that there was some kind of a dust up between Woody and Moses and in the end Moses'
original revelations disappeared and were replaced by new support from Woody Allen which seemed
to be a reward for Moses' new and negative stories about his Mother and denials of sexual abuse by 
Woody Allen.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I often wonder about the TWO children adopted by Woody and Soon Yi....

               He will.  They are getting ready to sacrifice Allen, imo.  He has gotten too hot.  He has his defenders in the Public Arena, but there are too many that are on to him.  It is a Roaring Train that will soon arrive at the station.

              True. Plus they're pretending that they'll all PC correct and everything, and like they care that children are raped. Meanwhile, lovely young women are getting raped in the men's room during the Golden Globes. Yeah, whatever, PedoWood. We know what you do and are. You pretend for a living so we're not buying this latest disguise.

             <p>
              What’s your favorite Woody Allen movie? Before you answer, you should know: when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies. I remember staring at that toy train, focusing on it as it traveled in its circle around the attic. To this day, I find it difficult to look at toy trains.
             </p>
             <p>
              For as long as I could remember, my father had been doing things to me that I didn’t like. I didn’t like how often he would take me away from my mom, siblings and friends to be alone with him. I didn’t like it when he would stick his thumb in my mouth. I didn’t like it when I had to get in bed with him under the sheets when he was in his underwear. I didn’t like it when he would place his head in my naked lap and breathe in and breathe out. I would hide under beds or lock myself in the bathroom to avoid these encounters, but he always found me. These things happened so often, so routinely, so skillfully hidden from a mother that would have protected me had she known, that I thought it was normal. I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different. I couldn’t keep the secret anymore.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I asked my mother if her dad did to her what Woody Allen did to me, I honestly did not know the answer. I also didn’t know the firestorm it would trigger. I didn’t know that my father would use his sexual relationship with my sister to cover up the abuse he inflicted on me. I didn’t know that he would accuse my mother of planting the abuse in my head and call her a liar for defending me. I didn’t know that I would be made to recount my story over and over again, to doctor after doctor, pushed to see if I’d admit I was lying as part of a legal battle I couldn’t possibly understand. At one point, my mother sat me down and told me that I wouldn’t be in trouble if I was lying – that I could take it all back. I couldn’t. It was all true. But sexual abuse claims against the powerful stall more easily. There were experts willing to attack my credibility. There were doctors willing to gaslight an abused child.
             </p>
             <p>
              After a custody hearing denied my father visitation rights, my mother declined to pursue criminal charges, despite findings of probable cause by the State of Connecticut – due to, in the words of the prosecutor, the fragility of the “child victim.” Woody Allen was never convicted of any crime. That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up. I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls. I was terrified of being touched by men. I developed an eating disorder. I began cutting myself. That torment was made worse by Hollywood. All but a precious few (my heroes) turned a blind eye. Most found it easier to accept the ambiguity, to say, “who can say what happened,” to pretend that nothing was wrong. Actors praised him at awards shows. Networks put him on TV. Critics put him in magazines. Each time I saw my abuser’s face – on a poster, on a t-shirt, on television – I could only hide my panic until I found a place to be alone and fall apart.

             Don't know about anyone else, but since that time of the original revelations, I haven't been able to watch any
Woody Allen film.

               At the time the charges were brought against Woody he very well understood the impact
this would have on his movies... that's why he so strongly attacked Mia and Dylan.
It was financial loss.
              </p>
              <p>
               And he kind of did what Weinstein did -- where Weinstein kind of hired Mossad to trail his accusers
to find something on them.  Woody also hired a profession to plant stories in media.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the end, Woody had to begin to realize that the kid he thought was his was actually
Sinatra's child.  That was one hell of a reason for him to push the "romance" with Soon Yi.
