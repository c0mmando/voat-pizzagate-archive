            Pretty good, but MAJOR OMISSION as you failed to grasp the MAJOR CONNECTION with Stanford University.  It's not just a footnote relating to the founders having attended Stanford -- It's about the

              SRI (Stanford Research Institute).

             The first paragraph in the first part of the Esalen post states that this is too large a subject for one person to cover everything, and asks others to please research as well. So..
            </p>
            <p>
             "The subject is such a massive one, that it is impossible for one individual to properly catalogue all of the connections and implications rising from the Esalen Institute. I happily invite readers to dive into their own research on this subject, of which I can only provide a small part. I am aware that I cannot see all the important connections coming from Esalen; it is a difficult task to remotely attempt. More research needs to be done honestly and carefully in this area, and develop further interpretations on the significance of this deeply multifaceted NGO.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note: Each subject discussed in this post deserves further research."

             Excellent work. Everyone should start realizing the NAZI's never stopped their work they exported it. It seems impossible for many to grasp that the NAZI experiments or Torture was never halted in fact American Politicians gave the top scientists safe haven here in the US as well as in Canada and they have their top Torture facility in the UK.. Many of us know exactly where these locations are and that they currently have children in them but can do nothing because the US government guards them.

            "B.F. SKINNER
B. F. Skinner was another significant early visitor to Esalen. He developed operant conditioning, as well as the infamous "Skinner's Box."
           </p>
           <p>
            He was also associated with the "Human Potential Movement," which I have previously explained might be read as a 'multiple personality development' movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Skinner's studies on conditioning animals in cages with electric shock, bright lights, and noise - are extremely reminiscent of ritual and MKULTRA type abuse recounted by many ritual abuse/mkultra survivors. His possible association with the CIA should also be noted, and continues the previously discussed connections between Esalen and military intelligence, the Human Potential Movement, and Tavistock.
           </p>
           <p>
            This situation may be what we are witnessing in the "Skippy" "Fatherhood" video provided by Worldcorp.
           </p>
           <p>
            This the extremely disturbing film, a child is screaming in what appears to be a shower, with flashing colored lights filling the space, adding to sensory confusion for the child. The child is in a shower, screaming. I believe this is the result of water on the floor of that shower being electrified. In this case the child could not escape the electric currents applied to their feet and legs, no matter where they jump. The flashing lights add to totally overwhelm the child, and creates a horrible version of a skinner's box.
           </p>
           <p>
            This results in the interaction we see in the film - the child tries desperately to escape the pain, but finds no safety and no escape. Meanwhile, "Skippy" screams at the child, with statement like "I am your father." This shocking instance may show a segment of how multiple personality disorder is intentionally induced, with "Skippy" giving authoritarian commands as the child's mind and selfhood are broken.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this case the child is taught to obey the person screaming at them at a deep unconscious level, through the trauma which breaks through cognitive processes and sears a vivid experience on the level of the deepest self. In As the child is still forming their sense of self, this type of abuse would have profound effects on the child's ultimate development. It is an example of the methods used to create 'controlled controllers' as perfected by the military intelligence psychological psychiatrists including R.D. Laing, who authored "The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness." He worked at Tavistock for a number of years, and was connected to Esalen and the Human Potential Movement, as was BF Skinner.
           </p>
           <p>
            In one report on the video, "Skippy" tells the child to STAY IN THE WATER, - which I believe is proving my point that this child is being electrocuted in this water exactly as skinner electrocuted doves and rats in his boxes, and used flashing lights and noise in the exact way we see in this film.
           </p>
           <p>
            -- TRIGGER WARNING --
I link to the video here and here with a preface that this video is extremely triggering, and ask that readers ONLY view it with the utmost warning in mind that this is extremely disturbing material which documents serious child abuse. Another clip is here
           </p>
           <p>
            This series of videos appears to directly show a child being abused in the same method Skinner developed. The shower replaces the animal cage in this case, but the electrocution, lights and noise remain. That BF Skinner is connected to Esalen provides an extremely disturbing connection which would possibly strengthen my argument that locations like Esalen study, "improve," develop and monitor this type of practice. What we see in the worldcorp video may have been developed in part as a technique of practice at locations including Esalen, - the Allen Institute at McGill, and others.
           </p>
           <p>
            The child shown in severe pain and terror is in a shower with flashing lights as the person, possibly John Podesta in an altered state, screams at them. This is a horrible human version of a Skinner's box, which creates a fractured personality with methods of extreme abuse and encodes obedience by repeating phrases like "I am your father" / you will obey me etc, encoding these statements at a deep level of consciousness at the moment that the child's mind breaks."

             This is the horrible end point of operant conditioning, and it gives us the controlled controllers I've discussed in previous posts. It also - very conveniently- creates enough suffering and trauma to fracture a personality, while leaving no physical traces of abuse with which the abusers could be identified, and no injuries which would be able to serve as evidence. The only scars left on the child which goes through such torture are left on the mind in a broken psyche. Children who go through this method of torture are left with no physical scars, only a confused memory and a dissociated "part" of themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             The public must understand what is being done to children and the environment in which our establishment is created, if there is ever going to be be hope of ending such abuse and/or freeing ourselves from a system of endless corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
             It should also be remembered that other methods of breaking a child's personality without leaving scars/evidence of abuse is to force them to witness or participate in the torture of others, sometimes under the influence of drugs.
