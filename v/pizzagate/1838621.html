<h1>Operation Hamlet (2002)</h1>
<p>&quot;Operation Hamlet&quot;, named after the the Danish Shakespearian prince, was executed simultaneously in Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Great Britain, Denmark and the United States in August 2002. It was initiated after it was discovered a Danish couple was abusing their child and exchanging the photos online with several others, including a chiropractor in California.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/09/us/high-tech-helps-child-pornographers-and-their-pursuers.html">(1)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten months earlier in Denmark, Dr Lloyd Alan Emmerson, a 45-years-old Danish chiropractor, was exchanging photographs of his 9 years-old daughter. Twenty-five members of an Internet criminal organisation called “Fun Club” were arrested, mainly fathers photographed or filmed with web-cams, as they abused their daughters, aged between 2 to 14 years. Dr Emmerson had a half million pédo- pornographic photographs and films. He pled not guilty, but was condemned to 30 years of prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Operation Hamlet was conducted over 10 months by 11 different states of United States, the Danish National Police, as well as six other European countries: Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and the U.K. It uncovered 45 exploited children from 2 to 14 years old, primarily from the United States.<a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/commissioner/speeches_statements/archives/2002/aug092002.xml">(2)</a></p>
<p>Emmerson and others in this ring had been contacted by Sergio Marzola, an Italian webmaster and child porn producer with connections to the original DuTroux Affair. Apparently Emmerson attempted to make an appointment with Marzola as they both were arrested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The criminal was arrested in full discretion. He had contacted by Internet Sergio Marzola {photo}, an Italian man living in Ferrare, webmaster and producer of child pornography, who gave him an appointment in a hotel of Bruges. He had been paid 250 euros to let his daughters filmed dressed in paedophile lingerie, 500 euro to film them naked and 750 euro for him to rape one of them. The Italian authorities and the paedophile network were informed on the spot. Sergio Marzola hastened to organize his emigration to his second residence Ukraine. The Italian police let him do under high supervision and phone-tapping, which had the advantage of being able to surprise him with his &quot;bare essential&quot;, all packed up and intended to be sent on the first aircraft to Kiev:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wardrobe of 500 erotic clothing for children;</li>
<li>Hundreds of child pornography DVDs;</li>
<li>An important computer and video equipment;</li>
<li>An archive of 30.000 electronic letters;</li>
<li>And 100.000 euro hidden into two loudspeakers.</li>
</ul>
<p>He was arrested, suitcases in hands, this 11 August 2006. Suspected be the manager of approximately 30 Internet sites intended for the exchange of child pornography, Sergio Marzola earned from two to four hundred euro per transaction, for the modest monthly investment six hundred euro: a Web space at that cost, able to stand an important traffic.</p>

<h1>Operation Joint Hammer/Koala (2008)</h1>
<p>Following Operation Hamlet, international law enforcement agencies would subsequently uncover a <em>massive</em> child pornography ring formerly connected to the &quot;Fun Club&quot; which led to the arrest of 700 individuals around the world.<a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/700-arrested-in-pedophile-ring-bust/">(3)</a></p>
<p>From these leads, in 2008 the United States conducted another pedophile bust codenamed Operation Joint Hammer. European agencies conducted a simultaneous operation alongside Joint Hammer titled Operation Koala. More than 1,000 were arrested around the world this time in connection to the international child pornography ring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operation Joint Hammer has resulted in the rescue of 14 girls—some as young as 3 years old—who were being sexually abused by pornographers. Approximately 170 people have been arrested, more than 60 of them U.S. citizens. Seven major child pornography rings, hosting the worst of the worst, have been dismantled. And the investigation is far from complete.</p>
<p>Belgian police identified and arrested the molester, who provided information about the video’s producer, an <strong>Italian national who ran a pornographic website</strong>. When Italian police arrested the producer and shut down his website, they retrieved 50,000 e-mails to the porn site. <strong>Those e-mails formed the basis of Operation Joint Hammer.</strong> They were routed by Europol to the 28 countries from which they originated—with more than 11,000 coming from the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilder: Based on the intelligence and the additional evidence obtained during Achilles, a separate joint international investigation involving 28 different countries was launched, titled Operation Koala. Today, Koala has resulted in greater than 850 arrests and the identification or recovery of greater than 20 additional child victims.</p>

<h1>Operation Nest Egg (2008)</h1>
<p>Operation Nest Egg was a &quot;spin-off&quot; operation of Joint Hammer which started in 2008. Nest Egg focused on a website known as &quot;The Cache&quot; which had been used by one of the Joint Hammer perpetrators. The Cache was a highly secretive website which facilitated (and even offered tips) on the exchange of child pornography for over 1,000 members.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, of the 26 top usernames on The Cache, 22 were successfully mapped to real people. Relying in large part on digital forensic evidence, prosecutors got every other person arrested in Operation Nest Egg to plead guilty, including leader Delywn Savigar in England. (Savigar would eventually plead guilty to possessing 100,000 child pornography images, to running The Cache, and to sexual assaults on two 13-year-olds and one 16-year-old in the north of England.)</p>

<h1>Operation Delego (2009)</h1>
<p>Operation Delego was launched in 2009 in response to the findings on Operation Nest Egg and the users of The Cache. It resulted in the largest prosecution (at the time) of a community online child pornography traders, a total of 72 around the world. Following the shutdown of The Cache, Operation Delego targeted a different website named &quot;Dreamboard&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dreamboard was created and operated to promote pedophilia and encourage the sexual abuse of very young children in an environment designed to avoid law enforcement detection.</p>
<p>Members allegedly traded graphic images and videos of adults molesting children 12-years-old and younger, often violently. They collectively created a massive private library of images of child sexual abuse. The international group prized and encouraged its members to create new images and videos of child sexual abuse. Numerous Dreamboard members sexually abused children, produced images and videos of the abuse, and shared the images and videos with other members. </p>
<p>&quot;The members of this criminal network shared a demented dream to create the preeminent online community for the promotion of child sexual exploitation but for the children they victimized, this was nothing short of a nightmare,&quot; said Attorney General Holder. &quot;This operation marks another important step forward in our work to protect children across – and beyond – this country. Our nation\'s fight to protect the rights, interests, and safety of children goes on, and it will continue to be a top priority of this Justice Department.&quot;</p>

           Operation Delego (2009)
          </h1>
          <p>
           Operation Delego was launched in 2009 in response to the findings on Operation Nest Egg and the users of The Cache. It resulted in the largest prosecution (at the time) of a community online child pornography traders, a total of 72 around the world. Following the shutdown of The Cache, Operation Delego targeted a different website named "Dreamboard":
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Dreamboard was created and operated to promote pedophilia and encourage the sexual abuse of very young children in an environment designed to avoid law enforcement detection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Members allegedly traded graphic images and videos of adults molesting children 12-years-old and younger, often violently. They collectively created a massive private library of images of child sexual abuse. The international group prized and encouraged its members to create new images and videos of child sexual abuse. Numerous Dreamboard members sexually abused children, produced images and videos of the abuse, and shared the images and videos with other members.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The members of this criminal network shared a demented dream to create the preeminent online community for the promotion of child sexual exploitation but for the children they victimized, this was nothing short of a nightmare," said Attorney General Holder. "This operation marks another important step forward in our work to protect children across – and beyond – this country. Our nation's fight to protect the rights, interests, and safety of children goes on, and it will continue to be a top priority of this Justice Department."

            Great info. Thank you. Think it's a good idea to study the past to connect to the present. The players can't be too different.

             Thanks! I thought it was about time to start piecing them all together as they were once seemingly isolated.
