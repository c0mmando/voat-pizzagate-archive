<p>This has been discussed before here, very recently. The owner of the Worldcorpo website is Robert Robinson. The Worldcorpo website is the same website as &quot;scatfreak99&quot; and &quot;shitfreak99&quot; tumblr accounts. He is a Maine <strong>convicted sex offender</strong>. His youtube channel is here ---&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwqlug6CJN8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwqlug6CJN8</a>, we can hear his voice and see his face and body clearly. </p>
<p>This man is the owner of this website/the main procurer of the content on there. </p>
<p><strong>Three new videos have been uploaded TODAY</strong>. &quot;windex&quot;, &quot;matchhead&quot; and &quot;vaccuum&quot;. <strong>In &quot;matchhead&quot; we can see the face of a man ------&gt; <a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/matchhead.webm">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/matchhead.webm</a></strong></p>
<p>Someone is still procuring this website to this day. The man in these new videos is not Robinson, but we should be able to identify him.</p>
<p><em>The questions we need to answer are these.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is this a personal project of Robinson\'s whereby he is simply uploading all of his own content, which would lead us to the conclusion the voice in the &quot;father&quot; video is of Robinson\'s and not Podesta\'s?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this website just Robinson uploading content he has amassed himself from the internet, meaning the &quot;father&quot; video could quite literally be anyone? Could Robinson have been sent the &quot;father&quot; video by someone in Podesta\'s ring? Could Robinson himself have been in the room filming this happening with Podesta?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What links does Robinson, if any, have to Podesta and why are we jumping the gun to assume the &quot;father&quot; video is Podesta? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could the FBI be aware of Robinson; as he is a convicted sex offender; and have knowledge the &quot;father&quot; video is of Podesta and have leaked this website on purpose? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the Worldcorp website belong to a ring of pedophiles, not just Robinson, who upload their content individually? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is the identifiable man in the &quot;matchhead&quot; video ----&gt; <a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/matchhead.webm">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/matchhead.webm</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to get to the bottom of this instead of blindly spamming this video. For all we know this is a distraction. We can\'t afford to invest in this and only this and be distracted. We need solid links between those that procure Worldcorpo and Podesta, or that Robinson/any other identifiable members of Worldcorpo iare part of a community that Podesta is also a part of and have obtained this video somehow. </p>
<p>I want this to be real as any of you do. But it is pointless blindly screaming about this being Podesta when our current evidence points to this website belonging to Robert Robinson and his associated ring of pedophiles.</p>',

            I do not think that it is Robinsons voice in the fatherhood video. He speaks to slow.

            Well that was rather uncomfortable to watch! I'm pretty sure matchman is the urine drinking guy from one of the other vids. The problem is that the shouting man in the videos could be anyone. Could be Robinson, could be Podesta, could be someone entirely different. It could also still be staged, creative audio work, found footage or a combination of those things. It's good to keep an open mind on this.
