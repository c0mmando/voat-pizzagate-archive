            THIs is not the place for hero worship. How many of your favorite things have you had to turn your back on when the truth cam out?
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump supporters: be prepared in case this goes the wrong way. If the truth reveals something about POTUS, will u stick it out with us?
           </p>
           <p>
            People on the fence: sometimes the wisest place to be... sometimes not. That’s why it’s the fence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ones who don’t have hope in Trump... if he’s vindicated, can we work here as a team?
           </p>
           <p>
            Everybody: think about the worst case, prepare. Hope for the best, but check your guts and get ready. Keep your eyes open and be sharp.
           </p>
           <p>
            My gramps always said: “Believe half of what you see and none of what you here.” He didn’t live in the age of cgi and deep fakes, so adjust your percentages likewise.

            I haven't looked at this material yet, but I already knew their would be downvoats from the member and cough cough, the mods. The phony Trump vs Deep State psyop is pushed in here and I think is the #1 goal of the mods. That is why Q is pushed in here. Watch, don't do anything, Good guys are at the top fighting for you. All blatant lies. No matter how many times I show that Trump ic connected to Rothschild, Rockefellers, CIA, MOSSAD,  Roy Cohn and his pedo entrapment rings, Epstein, Clintons, NYC MOB, MSM media fixture, is a Jesuit,, is a Freemason, Was allowed at debates and on ballot that only controlled candidates are allowed, the mods and members refuse to ackowledge this and go back to selling Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            One can only reason that they are not ignorant, but they are here to push the lie. Because the truth is no use to them.

            Let's face it and call it for what it's worth - We have a need to place our trust in someone, a leader - someone who is presently human and alive.   IF that person exists, remember, he is neither God nor a god.

           <p>
            As my late, good mother used to say, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket."  The final outcome may very likely prove that there is no one such single person who will fix all the wrongs.

            Evil exerts every power to divide us and pull us apart, and this is what is happening in our world.  We are the ones who have the power and who will be rewarded, whether alive or dead; and someday, we, or another generation of "us," will exist in a peaceful world.

            Roy Cohn is an infamous pedo gangster that Trump considered a mentor. Trump's first wife alleged in her divorce he assaulted &amp; pulled her hair out. He had various scandals around his modeling agency including palling around with John Casablancas &amp; underage models at parties with drugs &amp; alcohol, there were lawsuits filed by underage girls retracted due to threats, questions about numerous real estate deals with Russian mobsters besides if he was a real threat to the NWO he'd be taken out by a MKULTRAed SJW. His cabinet stuffed with billionaires, gutting EPA protections &amp; appointing Monsanto cronies might be a further hint. But then recent Popes claimed to crack down on pedophiles too. You can find links to all the above fairly easily.

             And I hung out with all the girls who smoked in the school toilets, but I have never had a cigarette in my life, even though I smelled like smoke from being around them.  I guess people, who did not know, would be quick to charged with smoking.

            What exactly are people pointing out? A picture with Epstein, some kind words any businessman could say to another businessman, or photos of Trump being affection with his daughter, or remarks about young girls? None of this is evidence of any crime, so WHAT exactly are people trying to point out? Nothing ever came of this. Before Trump became president, no one in power wanted Trump in power. If Trump was guilty they would have gotten him BEFORE he was in office.
           </p>
           <p>
            A picture with Epstein while suspect, its just hype. Trump is a celebrity businessman that is around thousands of people. Its very common for businessmen to say nice things about other businessmen. I could be doing business for 30 years with someone and say very nice things about this person and have no clue he has kids tied up in his dungeon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alpha males can be blunt, especially about pieces of sexy ass because they're not afraid of sexy ass or of being "politically correct". So many betas don't understand thats why Trump acts the way he does and it's why so many people, like me, love him. I love the Alpha Male, Non Politically correct style.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what betas think...

            If this was NEW, NEWS, it could be worthy. But its old as hell and nothing came of it.

            Upvoated because we need to be honest about Trump's ties with Epstein.  I hope he is innocent but the topic needs to be addressed.  Honestly it is the most troubling thing about him by far.  The Democratic party would be all over it if not for the fact that they are terrified to talk about it because it also applies to Bill Clinton.  Instead they would rather talk about the Russiagate farce rather than admit the polls were dishonest during the election.   Donald's comments about his daughter are disgusting as well.  I think criticisms here are well founded.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would love a full investigation into all the politicians and figures associated with Jeffrey Epstein.  If they are guilty let them burn.  Won't happen though.

             It has been my experience that Donald says stupid stuff sometimes, and I believe he is proud of his daughter. The only concrete evidence, so far, of being part of Epstien's inner circle was when he hitchhiked a ride on his plane for time reasons, and the pictures at social gatherings for rich folk. Maybe knowing and learning about these people and their ways were a large part of his decision for running in the first place? My Dad says awful stuff to his kids and he is still a great Dad. I am on the fence until I see empirical evidence. This looks like a political hit piece by Blackstone Intelligence.

             Here! Here!  Could not have said it better.  I have given him chances and have never said anything derogatory about him and  I am hoping he is on the right side, but the remark is indeed off limits as far as your own daughter is concerned.  You are right about the Dems not wanting to raise this subject!  All some of us wanted was to look into and question of an off color suggestive statement and we are being pelted by our own people.  Those that we have researched with and supported.  I am really mortally shocked, truthfully quite hurt.

              No, I acknowledge that.  I just think it is important to maintain scrutiny on Trump as well.

            I proudly gave this link a downvoat.  I'd give it more if I could.

            1) There is ZERO proof of any affair with Stormy Daniels.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) His response to Epstein's proclivities was exactly what any public billionaire would say.  Almost every filthy rich person has creepy shit in their closet.  He also had Epstein barred form Mir-A-Lago over young girls - that was conveniently omitted.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) The Ivanka thing - If you are a person that values beauty, then as a father, having a beautiful daughter is something a rich man would show off, but not "pimp out".  I'm pretty confident that if one were to look at many, many father-daughter relationships - you will see the same type of physical interaction.  Yes, his actual comments are a little uncomfortable, but in no way indicative of any illegal relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is an intentional hit piece mixing partial truth with misinformation.  I don't watch a lot of videos, but Morphoneus' (sp) name always comes up associated with other "controlled opposition".
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why I don't pay any attention to the online talking shitheads.

            I was watching it earlier. Basically Trump could be the softcore agent by their Podesta/Luzzatto standards, but paradoxically more blackmailable since public can relate to Weinstein shenanigans as opposed to grasping concepts such as infant torture and cannibalism!!!!!!!!! Trump's appointment of Pompeo to head the State Dep. says it all.

            Okay, I watched the video. Although I remain steady in my apprehension about these issues, it was a hit piece. And there was photo manipulation. The image where he is going in for an embrace with Ivanka and his hand is near her chest is followed up with the exact same pose from DJ and Ivanka has been rotated to seem like she is fleeing. That kind of unnecessary tampering really degrades the overall point of the video. And the music and production are seductive as well. I was hoping for a more "Black Pigeon Speaks' approach.

             That suggests that one of these political parties will solve our problems. Neither one will. That means we have to come up with a creative solution of our own. The sooner people stop cheering for the problem the sooner the public will come up with a real solution. Both political parties are a slave to Rothschild's money and our political system operates on that money. Both parties. Until we solve that both parties will party on our sweat and blood.

               I know it seems that way but supporting these political parties is the deadest end we have. People are stuck in the thought of "if not Trump, then we are fucked, because Trump is our last hope."
              </p>
              <hr/>
              <p>
               This is a trapped way of thinking that leads to more of the same we have now because Trump is a Zionist. This is exactly how the deep state wants people to feel. Until Trump supporters understand that supporting Zionism is exactly supporting deep state activity they believe they are fighting against, the Trump supporters will only drag us farther in the hole. This is so obvious that a lot of us don't understand why the Trump supporters can't see this.

            I would certainly hope that Trump is going to work to end things like pizzagate but could Trump possibly be as wealthy and powerful as he is without being an "insider" with all the horror that goes along with that?  As some have said, maybe he turned over a new leaf, if he were a part of it all.  Or is it all one big deception...

             To be honest, the whole passage seems to be taken out of context, seems to me like DJT is calling Jeff Epstein out, read the
             <a href="https://imgur.com/a/OL1lC.jpg">
              entire quote
             </a>
             some may see him challenging Epstein's claims that he is a loner and has no social life, especially knocking him for the girls being young... guess it's all about perspective.

              You know what tells me 100% that ALL of us are being played by Trump and his administration?The FACT that although the mainstream media is debasing him on a daily basis they are STILL not reporting on the TRUE nature of his past and instead are focusing on more current legal age sex issues.
             </p>
             <p>

             <p>
              They are NOT reporting on the FACT that Donald Trumps father stole $4 million dollars from Housing and Urban Development from minorities in the Bronx to help build the International Chabad-Lubavitch Organizational HUB in the Bronx . They are not reporting that this is most likely where Donald GOT his first startup million.

             <p>
              They are NOT reporting on his mentorship and GOOD FRIENDSHIP with HOMOSEXUAL AND CHILD SEX EXTORTIONIST ROY COHN, who he also hung out with at STUDIO54.

              These things are all common knowledge among the most conspiracy researchers, but not you, and a handful of others that decided to get in on this, why is that?

                Excuse me for my misinterpretation of the above comment, I thought you were implying that trump was somehow conscientious in his decision to ban Epstein from his Mar a lago property.
               </p>
               <p>
                I believe that this decision was made out of haste for an event that he could not cover up, one of Epsteins MAIN ACCUSERS Virginia Roberts (nee' Guiffre) was GROOMED from the Mar-A-Lago at 15 yrs of age where she worked as a 'towel girl' in the spa and pool areas, her father was maintenance. MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN HAD BEEN GROOMING THERE FOR YEARS UNTIL EPSTEIN HIT ON A MORE POWERFUL MEMBERS DAUGHTER TRUMP COULDN'T CONTROL.

                Well, I don't know much about your position on Trump, that's good to know. I was only lightly prodding you for a reaction because I hope you understand you might have to get much more vocal about this aspect of Trump as we progress through these investigations. Which, I'm sure, will hurt your viewership. But the point I want to make is that I believe people are being horribly mislead about Trump in several different directions all at once as a sort of conditioning, a Hegelian dialectic whereas although the MSM is debasing him on a regular basis they are still not reporting on the legitimacy of his past, like I stated earlier his association with Roy Cohn is paramount. Do you see what I am saying? They are clandestinely SUPPORTING HIM however much they debase him with these legal age issues. There is also an OVERWHELMING amount of support for him in these forums and other 'conspiracy' channels and all of it leads me to believe that there is a much deeper mode of control in operation here. It is some sort of magickal formula hampered by AI and hired fusion centers to create a faux aura of support and are trying to achieve this by melding conspiracy, the 'far right' with conservatism and even nazi fascism, at the same time the MSM is debasing trump to such a degree that I believe it is almost as if the chiding is designed to piss the president off enough to become an outright dictator.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is alot of high magick afoot and I do not see many people trying to break it down.

              His comments are not taken out of context. There is no context that explains why he thinks if he wasn't married to his wife he would go after Ivanka. And when Stern called his daughter a piece of ass, he agreed and said she is tall too.  Your angle is very forgiving of Trump.

               I''m not excusing the creepy pervertedness of Trump. Why is everyone so jacked the fuck up about this? I agreed it was really perverted, but the article is weak evidence connecting him to raping kids at Little Saint James, get over it I'm not taking sides.

                Although you do have a point there Honeybee, people here are really jacked up about it because it is so perilous, period. The possibility of being deceived again is too great a matter concerning it could plunge us into a third world war. We have also been fighting what I tried to describe, which I'm sure you are aware of I'm not assuming anything of you, as an artificial assault on the sensibilities of those researchers that already know trumps true nature by AI and fusion centers. The frustration of seeing people up trumps ass on a daily basis here is mindnumbing.

               Chill bruh, I'm talking about Trump''s quote, he wasn't proclaiming that he was chumming around raping little girls at Jeff's resort, that's you're projecting, insane delusions by filling in information where there is none, maybe you need a valuum. The context of the article, which I clearly outlined, is that Epstein was trying to tell everyone in the media that he was a loner and a...  if you can't understand, I'm not wasting my time teaching you reading comprehension. It's above, grasp the information or take that valuum, your choice.

                mmmm, valuum is my fav. Valium's not bad either. In terms of context with trump and his associations, associations that include not just Epstein but also Casablancas, Cohn, and of course the Clintons themselves (there's also the over priced gambino concrete he built his buildings with), the only hope was that he was some sort of "double agent" against the pedo elite, which requires a heavy dose of wishful thinking. But I was more responding to the out of context claims made against Morphonios in the comments of his YT vid, so I apologize and will be taking my valuum now.

              As a hetero red blooded male, I can tell you that I do not know one single normal father who would talk about his daughter that way. Howard Stern injected 'Hot piece of ass' on purpose, to see the type of reaction he would elicit. Howard was testing Trump! Something isn't right. Of course this is worlds apart from the child torture murder rings that is taking place among the other elites.

              I too agree that the comments about his daughter are over the top and pervy, this kind of talk was probably how a lot of people in the 'industry' talked, he was involved in Miss World Pageants which was all to do with assessing womens beauty etc.,  I didn't say I think its okay, or that I agree with it personally.

               We need to ask ourselves this question; How would we, or this sub as a whole react if it were a democrat like Joe Biden or Podesta who this post was about? Would we extend the same benefit of the doubt to them?

               We need to remain consistent in our ideology, that anybody in power regardless of party should be subject to the same degree of investigation and consideration. Especially the president.  Pedophilia is an issue in both parties. Actually, it's a bigger issue outside of government itself, with the ruling class elites, who don't serve in government. The elites, the big kahunas are our real target.

Comments on the Howard Stern show. Anyone who has listened to that show knows it's a silly shock fest where people say a lot of over the top things in either joking or sarcastic ways. I never take too seriously anyone has ever said on that show

                  You make a good point and I agree with the double standard thing, but yes I honestly think if it were one of them on Howard stern saying stupid or unsavory things I would write it off as well. To me it's more about the Howard stern factor being in the mix and not taking any of that seriously

                   Exactly. We could hardly cling to something like that as evidence. Personal emails and Instagram posts have a different context. Stern colors everything to be useless as evidence.

                That is true, so has Joe Biden or Podesta or Clinton or Obama ever drawn attention to or called out the human traffickers?   Or have any of those requested or signed an Executive Order to be signed to stop it? - Well I have not looked into politics until Trump, so I am not sure but he did.  That's something positive....no?  Surely if he were guilty he would know there would be a trail back to him........they have tried the Russia conspiracy and nothing, after 14 months, has led a trail back to him.......and believe me, if they DID have even a smidgen evidence it would have been all over the news 24/7 and they would not have had to make up so many lies. -

                 Perhaps the cabal used Trump's sexual abuse past as a way to compromise him?

                 His secretary of commerce is Wilbur Ross, a former Rothschild consigliere who once bailed Trump out of bankruptcy back in 1990, when his Taj Mahal investment was failing.

                 When asked why he helped Trump, Ross said,

             Who judges what allegiences are blind? Are you
             <em>
              telling
             </em>
             people their allegiences are blind? 
How much power is in place to stop pedophilia from being exposed? Is it the whole global power structure? Yes or no? If yes, then it will be IMPOSSIBLE to defeat without an equally powerful alliance-- where is that fact in your attack on "blind allegience"? Did you forget to care?
How important is it to the global power structure to pull down ANY leader the speaks out against pedophilia? Yet you don't address this in your attack on "blind allegience"--- why not? Do you not actually care about overcoming the global power structure? Then why aren't you addressing the reality of power?
Please explain, I'm baffled.

               I read somewhere that it's Globalists against Zionists... This made perfect sense to me, they were both working together not so long back. Something has happened where these two side are now against each other instead of fighting together to bring in what is their ultimate goal, A New World Order. Maybe the Zionists want the ruling force to be Israel, but the Globalists want it to be Brussels, perhaps as it's getting closer to the end part of their decades old plan, the key players are not quite seeing eye to eye anymore.

              Its not up for judgment. It was just a statement based on popular opinion. I do see people completely willing to ignore Trump's red flags. His past with Epstein and the Clintons is a cause for concern. It probably can be explained away, and it probably will be in time. But Trumps opposition are freaking out because they don't know what he is going to do. We are also out of the loop. You think Q is reading us the playbook? We are part of the play, and we are an ally for the mission (public awareness, pressure). All I'm saying is stay away from the 'Hail Lord Trump God Emperor' rhetoric unless its just for keks. He is still OUR employee. Don't put him above the Republic.

               Still not a peep about Spirit Cooking in the so called 'right wing' FOX! If it was about ratings that would surely gather ratings! Folks, shadow government was exposed back in the 60's in Tragedy &amp; Hope, a book by Carol Quigley - top think tank at the Jesuit Georgetown University and Bill Clinton's mentor.

            It's no secret they have done business together in the past.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's no secret that Trump stated for a long time he thought the girls, were Epsteins nieces.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump instructed his staff to call the police on Epstein, and banned him the resort.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of that is creepy, however their is no sources for any of it. Were those photos taken from a video? How do we know
his hands weren't in motion?
           </p>
           <p>
            One comment Trump made makes me want to vomit.

               I don't care what anyone says. He's building the wall, improving the economy, strengthening our defense, fixing the VA, and not feeding us to the NWO wolves. A+ would vote for again. So he's an ass and puts his foot in his mouth. He can continue to be an ass AFAIC. I don't believe for one second that he's a pedophile or "in on it". I mean, I certainly don't believe for a second he's some kind of anointed one, but he's a useful tool. I'll put up with the sturm and drang all day long because he's running the country like a boss. Everything Hillary touched turned to shit. Did you guys forget that? 😌

                Based on the evidence, Trump is another actor agent doing bidding for his masters. Whether he is going along to get along or he is part of the cabal makes little difference. He abandoned Mike Flynn who would have exposed PG. We need others like Flynn. If I see actual investigation into Podesta brothers I will believe Trump is for real. So far not a peep in the MSM.

             His hands probably were in motion but it's still a bit weird. All I'm doing is posting it here for people to make of it what they will. Seems like something we should all be at the very least aware of.

            Posting to watch later. Most of us are aware Trump socialized and fraternized with bad people. I can think of many reasons why he would other than being a pedo cabalist, but the possibility of that is fairly strong. We need to know difinitively whether he has gone to the dark dens to fully understand his enemy, or he is doing this whole theatrical big reveal before destruction that is so popular in cimema thrillers. Who's money is where? I am choosing to be optimistic.

             We know that the Rothchid controlled media would not give air time to anyone unless he/she was in their camp. Remember Ron Paul in 2012 - hardly got any air time.

              Remember Trump briefly ran and decided to drop out? Ron was great at the debates even though he is a crappy speaker. They actually had to steal votes from counties to stop his momentum at the beginning. Trump realized that the fix was in with the crowded stage and he probably knew that Mitt was on the same team as the so called Democrats. What Syn says makes sense to me because, if it was not illegal, I would just collect me some CP ,find out where it comes from, and shoot them with my gun. The only legal way to infiltrate is to hang out with creeps and take notes/other evidence.

               The Fix seems to be always in since JFK!  I read 'Votescam' by Collier Brothers (1993). Elections are decided by those who count the votes. Look what they did to Roy Moore - a real anti-establishment candidate! David Icke summed it best: 'Would the same establishment who would run a criminal psychopath who's under investigation (HRC), have given any chance to Donald unless he was acceptable to the system?' 
To quote Ali G - 'We have to keep it real' 
BTW - in an ideal world Ron Paul would be president. A true libertarian. Shame voting system is rigged. Trump is right it is rigged, but not against him. No candidate has ever gotten as much attention from MSM than Trump, the same MSM who won't even peep about pizza emails! Do we need more to see the big picture?

             you also have to keep in contention a theory that Trump is a pedosatanist who has been better at hiding his tracks than others, and that what we are witnessing in the Trump/Deepstate war is a FACTIONAL SPLIT in the pedostocracy

              And that might be getting to the actual truth (too hard to handle for most) Basically what we could be witnessing is a schism between the Epstein's Heterosexual 'soft core' pervert (dealing with under age girls) Jesuit-satanists vs the hardcore Homosexual, pedo-satanists(Jesuit also) child torturers, baby rapists, Spiritcookers of the JA / Podesta cult. And here is the naked truth.

               I dont think the split is along 'methods of pedophilia' lines.  Its more likely just some higher in the pyramid were vulnerable - or made vulnerable (wikileaks cough) - and others decided that's their opportunity to climb higher. The public recognition of this is too high now, after the Saville and Vatican scandals too, so you could have a split along the lines of those wishing to still pretend nothing's happening, and those who say we have to sever a couple of tentacles, throw a few of our more exposed members to the wolves and only THEN can we go back and pretend its all been 'fixed'

             It's likely shills who downvoted this. They have a vested interest in propping up the trump Trojan horse.

              Very powerful online presence, it's unmistakably evident. Much of the MSM is villainizing trump while the PTB are ALSO paying for his defenders in cyberspace CREATING A HEGELIAN DIALECTIC, THEN A CONUNDRUM,  AND FINALLY COGNITIVE DISSONANCE, CONFUSION AND INACTION.

               Lol, I do what I can. I can't sit around and watch my fellow theorists get tricked by the False Prophets of Q and Trump. Deep State psyops. Some people here aren't aware of how complex and deep the psychological "tricks" go with the social engineers.

              - I downvoated you too.  We see the little game you member of 6 days play.  The tactic is obvious.  Post something with a shred of truth in it, get your little bucket brigade band of merry homos to come in an pontificate on it's validity and upvoat each other.  Nice try.

                - I downvoated you too. We see the little game you member of 6 days play. The tactic is obvious. Post something with a shred of truth in it, get your little bucket brigade band of merry homos to come in an pontificate on it's validity and upvoat each other. Nice try.

               I have known that the two party system is really one big party for many years and I don't consider myself a shill. I'm not a bucket brigade homo either. I'm also not playing a game. I consider myself smart enough to see through it. You can call us homos and shills all you want. We are the largest part of the truth community outside this bubble.

                  Yes, but you forget about the American people.  The millions or armed and patriotic Americans who actually can take the country back if needed.  The Rothschilds may control the banks but we control the bullets.

                 I considered it but it didn't last long when I also considered who he surrounded himself with otherwise. He was chosen to be the new puppet head. The Republican party is under the yoke of the Rothschild bankers just like everybody else in Washington and until that changes our lives will not improve.

                 I guess the fact that he comes without SJWs is a bonus because they get on my nerves. He is a Zionist and there is no place for the common people's lives to improve under that system. Zionism brought us 911, the Patriot Act, and now intends to strap us up with a 5G Network that will put the Patriot Act to shame. We won't be able to take a piss without big brother knowing. He is still adding trillions of debt to my wallet playing King Zionist Warlord for his masters. None of this will improve my life and it will damn sure make it worse.

                 If he wants to make himself useful he should grow some balls and do something like speak out against these predatory student loans that have the entire next generation in debt before it gets out of the gate. I could go on forever but I won't. He has done exactly jack shit to improve our daily economic situation and he will not by adding debt on our backs.

                        Laughter is the best medicine.  I believe the next iteration of the GOP, if it continues its current trendline, will be reborn in a Tea Party movement.  The middle class received a pretty substantial bonus in the form of the tax cuts.  They received additional relief in the form of elimination of Obamacare penalties.  Jobs are becoming plentiful.  The stock market is roaring (pension funds).

                        Not to mention, if you follow the industrial indices, put money in the market, and manage it, you'd know there are plenty of investment opportunities all over in manufacturing.  I'll have driven about 4,000 miles through middle America by the end of Q1.  I see what's out there.  I hear what people are saying.  I see hope in people's faces for the first time in a long while.

                  Kinda hard to undo 2 centuries of exploitation by the banks in 20 months.  You need to take a step back and realize the breadth and depth of what is going on.  This is a war.  It isn't going to be won overnight.  Or next month.  Or next year.  You see all of these "patterns" and "associations" and "relationships", and it's obvious it is driving you a bit batty.

                  Go enjoy some real world and reflect on the fact that POTUS isn't going to turn things around overnight.  Things won't always go "our" way.  There are wins and losses.  And right now, the wins outweigh the losses about 50:1.

                  Give it time, I can guarantee (as long as the noobs aren't as retarded as they seem), that we will eventually divorce ourselves from Trump and realize we were hoodwinked/set up with a Trojan Horse and phony "good guy" as part of a psyop.

                  Every election seems to be orchestrated and engineered with a little "spin" narrative on it that divides the truth movement. Just keep calling it out and keep waking people up, relentlessly, and slowly but surely things will realign. It's already happening on several forums.

                   Its not possible for a Zionist to have our best interest at heart because Zionism has no heart. Trump proved that he is no different than the rest. He is advocating for gun control based on false flags instead of calling out the false flag itself. He just appointed a CIA torture expert to the State Department. etc...you know the drill. This forum is particularly resistant to reality but i'm hoping it will change. I do my part but its tiresome. I don't read this forum as much as I used to because the Trumpism got on my nerves.

                    It can also be very stressfull, so take breaks when needed. Get sleep, exercise, good diet and consider meditation. Remember at the end of the day, you're doing your part and contributing what you can, and the creator is taking note. Keep up the good work.

              It amazes me that some cannot be open minded enough to see this.  The sheep that followed BO and HRC should be proof enough that they are Masters of Deceit.  We should at least admit that since they have placed a Manchurian Candidate into office, that they can well put in place anyone in line with their thinking.

                I am not accusing Trump of being a pedophile.  There are just questions that need to be answered.  I have said all along that I was willing to give him a chance.  But when he makes remarks about his daughter that are seriously questionable, it needs to be researched just like others.  I remember there was a huge take down of Bernie Sanders.  Accusations and even out and outright branding him a pedophile.  I begged people to not accuse of such a horrible deed but they would not stop.  I would Never make such accusations and hope no one else is either.  I am willing to discuss not accuse.

               Yea, but I think we're starting to turn the corner and reestablish our independence from this Trump/Q nonsense. It's hard enough waking the masses up, we shouldn't have to wake up people within our own culture, and hold their hand through the concept that the elections are rigged and that the two party system is fake. People here should know that shit already.

                I am sure you have noticed that many have left this board.  They rarely come here even when pinged.  Some when pinged quickly answer or say thanks and leave.  They were and are great researchers that we have lost.  Not only have they divided us by parties, they have succeeded here as well.  This is the Big Board, the one that people come to check out whether pizzagate is on the level or not.  What they see now is abandonment and division.  I have not stepped on toes for I believed we were all smart enough to see the truth, and that others are free to make their choices, but deserting the pizzagate board has worried me.

                 to be frank, the investigation is pretty much done. Its beyond doubt there is a real element to pizzagate, the evidence in the public domain is well enough to warrant formal FBI investigations let alone arrests, so really if the powers that be arent acting then the only other thing we can do is raise awareness

                    I was so disappointed at all the name calling by some of our members.  It does not speak well of them when they cannot have an adult discussion.  If someone really believes in something then they should stand up to defend it, not slam someone else for their opinion.  Unfortunately, I also believe a lot of the down voating was not only done by shills.  Sad.

             Thank you :) I'm surprised nobody else has posted it yet and I was hesitant too but we all need to see it and be honest with ourselves about it. Also about the downvotes, do you notice that a lot of the time when videos like this get a bunch of dv's really quickly and irrationally, the video is quite frequently surprisingly worth watching? I have a feeling that we get brigaded on videos such as this so as to discourage people from even clicking on them and following that particular scent. I may just have my tinfoil hat on too tight, but I've noticed this many times.

              Exposure of PG and thus the take down of the Rothchild World Order is bigger than any Trump. Notice how the controllers recruit men like Reagan or Trump when they are way past their prime!!!!  Imagine a real renegade, about 45, super fit, who would lock himself in a tower, wear titanium armor ala Batman and launch a military tribunerals in exposing pizzagate while issuing debt free currency...... am I a dreamer...... no it was attempted by JFK who missed the titanium armour part!!!!  So close!!!

               That was a wonderful comment.  Yes, we were close once.  I was hoping Trump was the one, I am still hoping but that remark is echoing in my brain.  Photos can be shopped, but the mouth moved with the words.  That is obvious. How people are explaining that away is something I just can't understand.  I know that friends I worked with on here are down voating me.  So sad.  I thought we had passed that point where we worked for the children and politics were aside.  You can bash Dems but God Almighty don't touch a hair on the head of a Republican.  By the way, Sessions Just Fired McCabe.

              Well, thank God that some have their hats on too tight, otherwise the might fly off and we would never know about the many things that have come to light!  Everyone please pull down hard and tug real hard.  We don't want those hats to fly off!  You may well be right though.  I also think there are an army out there to downvoat anything put up against Trump as well.  We must keep our minds completely open.  I have said repeatedly I did not vote for Trump but decided to give him a chance.  This is another log on the fire of Evidence.  I don't like it, but it is what it is.

            Well, get ready for the downvoats.  Many on here will gladly upvoat any post about Biden being a pedo groper when placing his hands in inappropriate places on young girls, but let's see what happens today.  Will people recognize that there is inappropriate placing of hands in this video by Trump on his daughter Ivanka?  We shall see.  I agree that there is inappropriate touching regarding Biden and Trump.  I am sickened by both.

              What do you mean?  I never saw that movie.  I have not been in favor of any of too many of the actors after the 50's.  Mostly watch black &amp; white Film Noir.

                Whoa.  That would be hard for many to admit.  I don't know if I would go that far right now, but if there is proof it must and should be faced.  He has made a few sketchy remarks and one that really is Very Inappropriate and Out of Line for a father to make.  We will have to see where this takes us.  I have a feeling there may be more info coming after what has been exposed.  Hopefully we can all hash it out with less vitriol.

                 We know what the Deep State does to real anti establishment candidates - JFK, RFK...... again, there is a reason why ther allow renegades like Reagan or Trump when they are way past their prime. 
Let's admit that 70 is old in anyone's dictionary. Place age limits? Say 60 for the first term. Just listen to Donald interviews when he was in his 50's, sounds so different.

                  Much easier to control.  Reagan was way out of it at the end, for quite some time.  They were in complete control.

               What an inscrutable statement.  Seems to me the criminal part was how to get the state of Israel itself, a 2000-year old goal based entirely on religion.  This goal was ultimately achieved of course by Jews promising to get the U.S. to save the British in WWI in exchange for Palestine, which the British had of course already promised to the Arabs.  Furthermore the British royalty was even before that known to believe in "British Israelism" which held that they were literal racial descendants of the Jews.  Didn't you learn as a child the interesting factoid that Jews are the only "race AND religion" category.

                I understand the Balfour Declaration pretty well. Sounds like we pretty much agree so I don't know why you are using the shill word. I am saying the Zionist movement is a criminal globalist juggernaut and a plague on humanity. If you agree with that then we agree.

                  There are few excuses for the behavior of Jewish gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s. The best known Jewish gangsters –Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Longy Zwillman and Moe Dalitz — participated in the numbers rackets, illegal drug dealing, prostitution, gambling and loan sharking. They were not nice men. During the rise of American Nazism in the 1930s and when Israel was being founded between 1945 and 1948,

                 This is the root of the particular ethics of Jews and why they're so successful.  It's not just their intelligence.  This is a website called myjewishlearning.com stating openly that someone may be a vicious murderer and spread vice and disease and misery, but by god he treated his fellow Jews well, so let's be fair in our assessment.  It should be NO SURPRISE all the biggest swindlers in history have been from the tiny minority of Jews because that's precisely what a parasite-host relationship IS.

                  Helping the Haganah in Pre-State Israel
Jewish gangsters also helped establish Israel after the war. One famous example is a meeting in 1945 between Bugsy Siegel and Reuven Dafne, a Haganah (precursor of the Israel Defense Forces) emissary. Dafne was seeking funds and guns to help liberate Palestine from British rule. A mutual friend arranged for the two men to meet. “You mean to tell me Jews are fighting?” Siegel asked. “You mean fighting as in killing?” Dafne answered in the affirmative. Siegel replied, “I’m with you.” For weeks, Dafne received suitcases from Siegel filled with $5 and $10 bills–$50,000 in all.

                 This is direct contradiction to your claim that Zionism is somehow separate from Jews.  Do you understand that openly atheist Jews can lead prayers in many American synagogues?  That immigration to Israel is based on having Jewish blood not faith?

                  I have known all that stuff for 20 years. I have my own strategy for exposing those fuckers and it includes using jewish sources sometimes because even the Trump supporters call me a shill and anti semitic. People are so Trump stumped ignorant that they are defending Israel and Zionism. I walk a fine line to keep from getting snarled into the anti semitic bullshit argument and it works for me. I learned all the stuff you just posted 20 years ago.

                   Nice try asshole.  You explicitly divorce Zionism and Judaism which is nonsensical on its face, then elite Jews from nonelite, then when faced with a nonelite Jew writer defending an elite Jewish criminal for funding the Zionist state you say "I know that, I'm doing a thing just go with it kthx".  Zionism IS Judaism which IS "we are chosen by God and we can treat the others how ever the fuck we want" which is textually what their religious tradition spells out.  ALL their holidays are celebrating mass murders of nonJews.  No surprise at all that some of them ritually slaughter nonJew children, which is why it's a forbidden topic on this board.  You don't walk any fine line bitch you just obfuscate and avoid the truth, which is that Jews have different ethics that whites can't even comprehend.  And Chinamen have different ethics and Mexicans and every group.  In Japan there is open fascination about Jewish power as proven by book sales, so they clearly have some admiration or affinity for it.

                   But while you further refine your bullshit distinctions and these clowns are following Q for 7 years the unique beauty of white ethics, which is trust and altriusm taken to extremes by the influence of the cursed Jesus-cult, and the entire white population goes further down the toilet, which is the ultimate goal of Pizzagate and every other conspiracy.  Well done professor!
