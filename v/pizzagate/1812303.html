            It takes a truly special person to be appreciated in so many different ways this long after their untimely death. He was FAR ahead of everyone else by light years, and while mostly everyone appreciated him/his intellect/his insights even before he RIP, it continues to grow to this day. So fucking sad. We lost a true thought leader, patriot and brilliant mind.

             1950s: Origins of the CIA's "Pedophile Academy"
            </p>
            <p>
             “Oh we do have our stable of weird people working for us. Did I ever tell you about the Pedophile Academy? We actually had one down at Camp Peary, (in Virginia) right near (the CIA’s) Jim Critchfield’s place. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but we called it ‘The Farm,’ and it was supposed to be a secret training center for young agents. Allen Dulles set up this training center down there for pedophiles. They were in training to seduce, molest, and most especially photograph the young children of targets. Not only, Allen reasoned, would our graduates have a spanking good time but they could get wonderful action photos of the wee ones to blackmail their families with. I understand they broke it up when one of the graduates nailed a (CIA) Deputy Director’s son at a summer camp.”
Robert Crowley, CIA Domestic Contracts Division 1959-1962; Assistant Deputy Director of Operations (ADDO) 1980

             Is it possible Alefantis was referring to "The Farm"? (And, when the CIA claims an operation is closed, are they always telling the truth?)

            Yeah, he was the founder of #pizzagate and definitely knew what was going on. I suppose he didn't say more given the political climate of nothing being done. I mean, he said enough and nothing was done.

             Breitbart was the son-in-law of Orson Bean.  Don't know if you remember him.  I was not into him since I was just opening my mind around the time he died.  Seems like he was really on to it then already.  Well it had  been going on for decades.

              Yeah, but you wonder what he had and what disappeared. You don't want some scumbag ruining people's lives for no reason, but pedophilia is a really good reason to release the hounds.

              1950s: Origins of the CIA's "Pedophile Academy"
             </p>
             <p>
              “Oh we do have our stable of weird people working for us. Did I ever tell you about the Pedophile Academy? We actually had one down at Camp Peary, (in Virginia) right near (the CIA’s) Jim Critchfield’s place. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but we called it ‘The Farm,’ and it was supposed to be a secret training center for young agents. Allen Dulles set up this training center down there for pedophiles. They were in training to seduce, molest, and most especially photograph the young children of targets. Not only, Allen reasoned, would our graduates have a spanking good time but they could get wonderful action photos of the wee ones to blackmail their families with. I understand they broke it up when one of the graduates nailed a (CIA) Deputy Director’s son at a summer camp.”
Robert Crowley, CIA Domestic Contracts Division 1959-1962; Assistant Deputy Director of Operations (ADDO) 1980

              Is it possible Alefantis was referring to "The Farm"? (And, when the CIA claims an operation is closed, are they always telling the truth?)

               I keep hearing about all these " camps " for the Elites and ones they are sending children too . It struck me as odd that the Norway attacks were done at a camp and most of the people there were the Elites children.  Anders Behring Breivik was the child of a diplomat they also claimed he was sexualized by his mother , does anyone see a pizzagate / pedogate victum here ?

I remember you said the bags under the eyes today.  I very much agree.  Some syndrome. I think he is obsessed with her.  Yes it could be the same "farm". But there is a farm that

               clued me in on.  Claude Moore Colonial Farm and that is the one Podesta worked at.  I think anything is possible.  Yes, they could be lying, they are so good at it.  And that it now is hidden, and all the more better to be able to hide the children.

I believe you are onto something here as well. There has been some research here on this but it should be a focal point. This Registry involves people with Rh- blood types which can lead to coloboma and because of how rare it is there has to be a worldwide registry. Also that would mean the baby at birth like in McCann case would be identified and registered so she might have been tracked or as mentioned before there is dispute of biological parents.

                    It would be presumable, the calcified pineal glands are the result of a lack of amino-acid within the diet, or speculatively genetics.

                    Perdiccas appointed Ptolemy, one of Alexander's closest companions, to be satrap of Egypt. Ptolemy ruled Egypt from 323 BC, nominally in the name of the joint kings Philip III and Alexander IV. ... As Ptolemy I Soter ("Saviour"), he founded the Ptolemaic dynasty that was to rule Egypt for nearly 300 years. source:

It was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty which started with Ptolemy I Soter's accession after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and which ended with the death of Cleopatra VII and the Roman conquest in 30 BC. source:

                    The village was noted as "Ra" (see below) in the 4th century AD by the Roman geographer Rufus Festus Avienus. In the 6th century, the archbishopric of Arles was active and created a monastery or church in the town, named St. Mary, a favorite of the fishermen. The village became known as Notre-Dame-de-Ratis (Our Lady of the Boat - Râ being used in ratis, or boat) in reference to the three Marys arriving by boat. (Droit, 1963, 19). The name was later changed to Notre-Dame-de-la-Mer (Our Lady of the Sea, a synonym for the Virgin Mary).

                    The current Church of the Saintes Maries de la Mer was built from the 9th to the 12th century, as a fortress and a refuge. It can be seen from 10 km away. It has a fresh water well inside, for when the villagers had to take shelter from raiders. In the 9th century, the town suffered raids from the Mediterranean Sea by the Vikings and later from the Saracens. In the 15th century, someone "discovered" the relics of Mary of Clopas and Mary Salome, who were said to have arrived there by sea (together with Mary Magdalene). The 500th anniversary of this event was celebrated in the 20th century by Pope John XXIII.

                    The Orion correlation theory (or Giza–Orion correlation theory)[1] is a hypothesis in alternative Egyptology. Its central claim is that there is a correlation between the location of the three largest pyramids of the Giza pyramid complex and Orion's Belt of the constellation Orion, and that this correlation was intended as such by the builders of the pyramids. The stars of Orion were associated with Osiris, the god of rebirth and afterlife, by the ancient Egyptians.
