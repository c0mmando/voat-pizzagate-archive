<p>The accuser is Justin C Smith</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Justin_C_Smith">https://twitter.com/Justin_C_Smith</a>  (Does Not Exist)</p>
<p>Please help work this. Thanks</p>
<p>&quot;Other names of people Bryan uses to scout, round up boys for him and the many pedo sex parties are Wayne Castro and Tommy Johnson. They also would use LA club &quot;Tiger Heat&quot; for a part of the many party after party after party they would set up for the same day. Do searches and find old stories about this going back many years in media, blogs etc.</p>
<p>Singer partnered with Gary Goddard, and Roland Emmerich for these parties, and the whole pedo network. This ties into David Geffin, David Neuman, Garth Ancier, Clive Davis, Kevin Spacey (also tied to Clinton sex ring, and Epstein, in his black book and plane passenger logs). Other actors who are many pictures along with Bryan Singers hords of twinks are stars from his films and others involved in those films and project. Hugh Jackman would be a witness (if not participant) as in pictures on private plane full of Singers young boys. Big name who does all of this with Singer is the Director of Usual Suspect (can\'t recall name right now). Sony executives were very tied into Singer\'s network of abuse.</p>
<p>Singer was major investor in the whole sex ring with Marc Collins-Rector, and Chad Shakley.</p>
<p>This also ties all to Ari Emanuel, and his brother Clinton/Obama croney and Mossad agent from Mossad crime family, made Chicago boss, and part of the USA Continuity Government, aka Deep State via Counsel of Governors Rahm Emmanuel</p>
<p>Other old time Hollywood and NY families tied to this crap are the family and Rob Reiner, Sutherland, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Hunter S. Thompson, Dennis Hopper, Sean Penn.</p>
<p>Peter Theil, and some how Paul Singer fits into things here also.</p>
<p>For older known networks that also connect to Weinstein cronys in NY days 70s up the music concert promotion stuff, the Father and Son and family from Don Kirshner\'s rock concert (notice son\'s name scrubbed from the net. Recall in old days before internet huge sex scandals). Viacom, Columbia Records those companies were hard core a part of all of this.</p>
<p>The Hoffman family who\'s pedo son set up the NY and Hollywood private disco for minors in the entertainment business called &quot;Alphy\'s Soda Pop Club&quot;, that tied into the other partner from the NY company owners of &quot;Original New York Seltzer&quot;, Randy Miller (the guy with all the wild cats) and his creepy day Alan Miller. The Hoffman family ran Bobby Hoffman Casting, The Hoffman Company, Helinet Aviation, KLS Limousine Service, Diva Limo, Teem Entertainment Minute Hollywood, Stone Group (talent agency w/ pedos invoved too. this one was registered London OH), Knightbridge Humanitarian Relief. Alphy Hoffman can be found under many variants of his name because he needed to hide alot of things. Chris A. Hoffman, a bunch more. They had the planes, limos to move people around. And the youth could get picked up by limo and then they had no transportation to leave club w/ out it being done by the club, unless the kids could drive and brought a car. The clubs were attached to buildings w/ pools and bars on other levels for adults. Look up the many kids that got hooked into these clubs, all were in some way sexually exploited, used, and drinking and drugs. Recall Alyssa Milano as a minor became the live in girlfriend for that McGiver actor. This is where Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, Nicole Eggert, and so many kids hung out.</p>
<p>Major Major mover and user of children and young people, and even trafficking/selling/pimping of washed up starlets is Diana Jenkins, aka Sanela Diana Jenkins Catic. She is huge as massive global international network tied to Arabs, white slavery, trafficking. Due to all her network he ex husband who worked for Barkelys bank became the highest paid UK banker (if you know anything about UK banking networks you will understand THIS means alot). This involved alot of money laundering also. Diana tied into all sorts of charities and &quot;childrens&quot; charities/orphanages in Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia (where it is well known children have been exploited) Diana Jenkins has all sorts of &quot;businesses&quot; she is tied to in her name records/music companies, acting/modeling companies, Casting, fraudulent energy drink, and SHE was tied into the whole HAITI scandal, and her on paper business partner was Sean Penn. Penn was protege of Dennis Hopper even named his kid after him. She is majorly tied to Clinton foundation and being the networker for Arab money. She pimps out and moves kids and people to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE (United Arab Emerites) Dubai. why do you think certain washed up, used, prior drug problems women you can find are in arab countries now, or travel their often, they are sold/rented out and get goodies. Look up the very creepy picture book she did, and look at whom see seems to have power over in her web. Very revealing. Many of these men are on the down low and their career image would be ruined so they have beards/wives even kids. </p>
<p>Recall Drew Barrymore at age 11 was set up by Studio for promotion to be &quot;dating&quot; Corey Haim when he was 14. See audio and vid stating she was at 11 trying to get clean, and had already years before been in major drug rehab clinics. Recall that at age 13 Drew Barrymore was the LIVE IN Girl friend of Jack Nicholson! I remember all of this stuff back then. </p>
<p>Recall the scandals from the kids on Saved by the Bell and sex abuse? Leonardo DiCaprios agent was actively molesting and grooming kids and even got convicted. </p>
<p>Disney and Nickelodeon both hire and keep on even convicted pedos. Dan Schnieder is a pedo, and has a major foot fetish with kids and uses his programs to also make other films. Bryan Singer of Xmen even has his convicted pedo buddy working on set with all the kids, puts him in cameos in his projects, and even had him sitting with him and doing the directors commentary for films.</p>
<p>All this and the old school names families tie into Bohemian grove too. The DC Call Boy Scandal, Boys Town USA, Franklin Scandal, &quot;Boys for Sale&quot;, &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;, etc. Kids at DC parties, kids taken to whitehouse. The massive networks out of Louisiana (New Orleans businesses and ports also. Never forget the massive Boy Scouts scandal had largest scandals in Louisiana. Some of the major players in the sex rings even set up their own Troops and used those to ship child sex slaves in state and ship out of state to service politicians, judges, businessmen, law enforcement majorly involved, in all of these for many decades is FBI, CIA and DOJ involvement), all over DC Metro area w/ MD and VA for politicians, theater folks, Arts, businessmen, lobbyists, bankers, tech, Pentagon, State Department, Mil industrial complex. Global networks also done all over w/ FBI, CIA, State Department. Recall all the old scandals they try to scrub off internet, how State Dept was connected to prostitution, and child sex rings in other countries.&quot;</p>

            Harvey Weinstein's Buffalo years: Celebs, pols and a punch in the nose
            <a href="http://buffalonews.com/2017/10/15/harvey-weinstein-buffalo-years/">
             http://buffalonews.com/2017/10/15/harvey-weinstein-buffalo-years/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It all began in Buffalo.
           </p>
           <p>
            The brashness, the swagger, the overwhelming drive to make something of himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood film mogul now cast as a sexual predator, traces the roots of his show business dominance to his arrival at the University of Buffalo campus in the fall of 1969.
           </p>
           <p>
            It didn’t take long for the kid from Flushing, Queens, to make his mark. He sold ads for an alternative student newspaper. He got his first booking at the old Century Theatre for a Bonnie Raitt/Jackson Browne double bill. And with Corky Burger and $2,500 in borrowed money, they formed Harvey and Corky Productions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Harvey and Corky brought some of the biggest names in show business to Buffalo: Frank Sinatra, the Rolling Stones, Stephen Stills.

            Patrick Nehin, a North Buffalo guy with diplomas from St. Mark School and Canisius High School, was starting his video production career back in the early 1980s. He had spent months preparing for an early morning shoot in the lobby of the Buffalo Hilton Hotel – now the Adam’s Mark. His ad agency was promoting the hotel’s “Runaway Weekend” package with a TV spot featuring footage of the upscale hotel and its luxurious restaurant fare...

             Buffalo native Patrick Nehin punched Harvey Weinstein in the nose in 1984 at the then-Hilton (now Adam's Mark).
            </a>
            Nehin arrived around 6 a.m. and found his girlfriend at the time sitting in the coffee shop with Weinstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I asked her ‘What the hell are you doing with this guy?’ ” he recalled.
           </p>
           <p>
            That’s when the girlfriend recounted what now sounds like a familiar story.
           </p>
           <p>
            “She told me he tricked her into going to his apartment to watch 'Casablanca,' ” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            A confrontation ensued. Nehin said Weinstein followed him through the lobby toward LeClub, the Hilton’s popular night spot.
           </p>
           <p>
            “He came at me,” Nehin said. “That’s when I closed my eyes and hit him as hard as I could. His nose exploded.”

              Donald Clark Kirshner
             </a>
             (April 17, 1934 – January 17, 2011),[1] known as The Man With the Golden Ear, was an American music publisher, rock music producer, talent manager, and songwriter. He was best known for managing songwriting talent as well as successful pop groups, such as the Monkees, Kansas, and the Archies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don Kirshner was born to a Jewish family[3] in The Bronx, New York.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kirshner achieved his first major success in the late 1950s and early 1960s as co-owner of the influential New York-based publishing company Aldon Music with partner Al Nevins, which had under contract at various times several of the most important songwriters of the so-called "Brill Building" school, including Carole King, Gerry Goffin, Neil Sedaka, Neil Diamond, Paul Simon, Phil Spector, Howard Greenfield, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and Jack Keller.

            from that article &lt;50% Diana Jenkins:
           </p>
           <p>
            She is a major investor and project stakeholder in the Clinton Foundation, and in March 2010, she raised more than $1 million for Bill and Hillary Clinton’s "charitable" organization. Ms. Jenkins was also named in the Congressional Pay-to-Play Clinton Foundation inquiry letter. It has also been alleged that she is connected to global human trafficking networks, and if what Mr. Downey is saying is correct, she may be one of the biggest players in the largest trafficking and pedophilia rings in the United States, if not the world.

            Clive Davis the devil incarnate. Take his ass down and you did something huge. I have seen his estimated worth to be 800 million dollars. He is a major lynch pin in the Hollywood satanic cabal. He is directly responsible for the sacrifice of stars like Cobain, Whitney Houston, and many others.

              Davis is the founder of Arista Records. He named his record company after the elite Arista Honor Society of Brooklyn, New York where he was born. Arista’s logo and symbol is the
              <strong>
               “Lighted Torch” of the Goddess Columbia.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              “Their most used symbols are the lighted torch, the symbol of knowledge and the Sun. When an initiate reaches a certain level in the pyramid they are said to be ‘illuminated,’ more symbolism of the lighted torch. One of the recurring stories in the ancient world is of a hero figure who takes fire (knowledge) from the ‘gods’ and gives it to the people – the chosen few people, that is … At the Rockefeller Center in New York today is a gold statue of Prometheus (gold, the solar metal of the gods) and he is holding the light, the fire, in line with the legend. To the Rockefellers this is not just a statue; it is a symbol of the whole scam they are involved in.” -David Icke, “The Biggest Secret.” [39]
             </p>
             <p>
              Following the Illuminati torch symbol begins to unravel a larger mystery. The Brotherhood Goddess Isis/Semiramis holds the torch of enlightenment in the Statue of Liberty as well as the Columbia Pictures and Columbia Records logo. Columbia University’s symbol is also the torch/flame. CBS, “Columbia” Broadcasting System’s logo is the all-seeing eye of the Illuminati. The capital of the United States is Washington D.C. which stands for “District of Columbia.” America was discovered by a man named Columbus. The Fraternal order Knights of Columbus have been exposed aided the drug trade in Columbia the country. Columbia is the NASA space shuttle that blew up. Columbine is the high-school that suffered the mass shootings.[40]
             </p>
             <p>
              “It goes back to a group of Freemasons that came to this country before the founding of our constitution, who were called the Colombians, known as the Colombian faction. They founded what we know as Columbia University. Out of that has come Columbia space shuttle, Columbia Pictures, and Columbia Broadcasting, CBS, with the all-seeing eye on the pyramid as their symbol. As a matter of fact, our government, our so-called government, is not even a part of our country. It is in an area called the District of Columbia, It is a separate district, not part of America at all. The simple truth behind that fact is that there was a section of the geography in this country that was set aside by a very powerful group of Freemasons, called the Colombian faction, working behind the scenes during the founding of this country.” -Jordan Maxwell, “Matrix of Power.”[41]
             </p>
             <p>
              It was this very same “All Seeing Eye” Columbian factor (CBS) and its CEO William S. Paley of the CIA that brought Clive Davis and Arista into illumination in 1966 at the top of one of its power structures and record divisions. Clive Davis’ visible net worth is estimated to be around 800 million dollars.

            When I was arrested he (and his friends) delighted in my jail time* and made snide comments about me getting into trouble.  Their arrogance, like most sexually unmanageable people, was legion.

           <p>
            Bryan and I have discussed his boy obsessions and sex tourism. We have discussed his prescription drug addiction.  We have discussed his drinking problem.  We have discussed his point that it is useless to know anyone socially unless there is a sexual point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today Bryan finds himself at the center of a roiling  sex scandal.  It is of his own making.  Everyone one knew… but no one said a word.  Young boys on his arm, on his set, at dinner with equally vile boy obsessed Hollywood grandees… the lamentable Adam Press, the teen dating Dustin Lance Black.

             who is mentioned in that documentary?  James Toback, director of films such as Black and White, has been accused by literally hundreds of women of a range of sexual harassments. He has since vehemently denied the charges, while Beverly Hills police have launched an investigation whose scope includes both Toback and Harvey Weinstein.  Tyler Grasham, the Hollywood agent, has been accused of sexual assault and sodomy by actor Tyler Cornell, who has also filed a police report. Grasham has since been fired by his agency, ACA. Ethan Kath, the producer/performer behind Crystal Castles has been accused by former bandmate Alice Glass of sexual assault. Kath denies the allegations. Chris Savino, the creator of Nickelodeon’s The Loud House, has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment.Toronto Actress Targets Harvey Weinstein, Disney in Sexual Assault Lawsuit... Disney responds, "There is absolutely no legal basis for this claim against The Walt Disney Company and we will defend against it vigorously." HarveyWeinstein offered RoseMcGowan $1 million in hush money. She said “boy, bye” Sorry, can’t be silence.  George H.W. Bush, the former president, has been accused by several women of groping them while making a bad joke (punchline: “David Cop-a-Feel.”) Rather than denying the charges, Bush has issued a statement through his spokesperson, introducing the world to the concept of a “good-natured” groping. Kevin Spacey, the star of Netflix’s House of Cards, has been accused by actor Anthony Rapp of making unwanted sexual advances when Rapp was 14 years old. Spacey released a statement claiming he was drunk and did not remember the encounter, and Netflix has since suspended production on the sixth season of House of Cards.  and news on Roman Polanski lots of rape victims?

             You know, all he wants (this kid) is a job, a chance, an opportunity, the dream of celebrity…freedom. He can almost taste it. He knows that these men make all the difference.
            </p>
            <p>
             His desire for a better life is palpable.  He’ll drink the drinks. Undress, get into the hot tub.

             You know, I love beauty. I love it. Look, I’m surrounded with beauty.  My ex-friend might say, oh your just jealous. You’re just jaded because you want what they’ve got,  Believe me, I do just fine. But on terms that do not compromise my integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would I show random strangers the body of some boy who stands feet from me? Knowing that those artless, semi pornographic images suggest that we are more than just…innocent friends?  The network head winks, smiling…dribbling over the screen on the smart phone.  Dobby’s nose is dripping from undisclosed snorting.
            </p>
            <p>
             He says, without saying anything: That teen boy…the boy with the perfect abs. He’ll do anything..because he thinks I’m going to get him a role, find him an agent…make him the next teen sensation. LOL.

             Bryan films a group of eastern european ‘barely legal’ porn performers ejaculating over him… then shows the video to who ever wants to see.   Many do.   Bryan audaciously dresses as a catholic priest for Halloween, amusing his friends with his ‘ironic’ choice of costume.  Bryan loses his Ferrari in The Beverly Center parking lot and has a panic attack.  He drives with the parking attendant in a golf buggy until he locates the car.

            "Look up statistics from the International Centre for Missing and exploited children. That globally USA is #1 for the MOST missing children every year, about 1/2 a million. With the Centre above and FBI stats showing they can prove over 18% ended up being trafficked into sex trade, snuff, porn, slavery, etc. The rest just "unknown". USA has the MOST children go missing! and the numbers far exceed the numbers of the 2nd and 3rd place, let that sink in. Why do you think that is? Because it is a real concerted long time well run system. 1 in 3 girls in the USA is sexually abused in some way. 1 in 5 or 6 (depending on year) for boys. Think about this. These are our own government, and US and international orgs stats here.

            It starts with these cabals subverting our culture, and sexualizing children, this is full on concerted effort through education system, music, TV, hollywood, magazines, internet, fashion etc.. The removing of family values, of encouraging disrespect of parents, and the schools do this through removal of parental authority, and the enhanced sexual "education" programs. The public libraries are in on this now to. Look up just this year the problems with Maryland Library systems programs where hard core deviant militant perverts run programs the give out to kids condoms and lube and teach them masturbation, sex toys, and anal play. This org even had videos online for the kids who' parents supervise them and made sure they were not exposed to this at the libraries.

            This whole new BS of gender fluidity pushed on kids and the major devastating personal damage to healthy self confidence, and security this creates, and the confusion. These are not by accident, there is much money put into this by NAMBLA and other groups, you know the ones who back and fund and give legal support for Antifa, BAMN (By Any Means Necessary) etc. They use brainwashing techniques to tear down the pyche and identity, self esteem of kids/youth and then fill them full of garbage, self hate, loathing, snowfake, total dysfunction. What this creates is dependency upon the system, while tricking all the kids that they are fighting the system. Which in the end is really just making them skrews for the system and thugs and willing pawns and tools for our wardens in this corrupt globalist system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thing is this is all part of their own written out and taught agendas going back to Lenon, Marx, Sal Alinsky, the "protocols" of the elders, Fabian Society, the Frankfurt School, it is all failed corrupt soul damaging, Socialism, and Communism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cure is Nationalism (to counter Globalism, meaning our Nation must take care of it's citizens 1st and foremost), States Rights, enforcing the Constitution, less government/restructuring a over invasive controlling and privacy and 4th amendment violating government. Of preserving history (to learn from it), and valuing the cultures that this sick globalist system is trying to destroy, erase. Promote merit,work, effort based systems. Don't expose children to sex and violence. And if that means removing them from the corrupt schools now do it. Promote voucher programs (the only reason the left fight this so hard is then the globalists/communists/pedos can't brainwash your kids, and corrupt and abuse them, and allow the State, and CPS etc to have full rights and invoke claims over them), and to at least instill in the child a sense of a higher power, force, creator in some healthy manner without the BS and dogma, but not allowing the communists, z ionists, and Jesuits to tear and destroy their souls and damage these wonderful pure creations of humanity and pure love."

             That sounds delusionally stupid without stating the fact that "education system, music, TV, hollywood, magazines, internet, fashion etc.." are provably Jewish-dominated and that a rival ethnic group is the most logical perpetrator of sabotaging cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
             The "cure" is not "nationalism" which is a civic political ideology having no relation to mass culture.  The cure is physically removing Jewish individuals from positions of influence.  This of course merely reinstates previous policy of wariness towards Jews elite or otherwise up to exclusion and quotas, which is precisely what they're doing to whites now.  Go try to work at the post office in a big city as a white man -- there's no test score high enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe Hitler is demonized so much because his policies were so effective at restoring his country.  You did just admit Hollywood Jews push nonstop lies.
