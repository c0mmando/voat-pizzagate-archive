<p>One place name jimmy-comet, and that was GQ long ago. The idea that a fuck-boy, one of Brocks throw away boy toys can be the 48th most powerful person in DC is pure BULLSHIT. This is just to cover who is really in power.</p>
<p>Think People, Think.</p>
<p>Today Pizza Boy ( jimmy comet) is in bankruptcy, he owes back taxes, he hasn\'t paid his janitor ( $25k) debt, and this is a powerful man? Your meme is that he supplys the richest ppl in DC with baby\'s, but he\'s too broke to pay &amp; file his payroll tax.</p>

            It's on GQ.com.  So not a fake site.

            Tony and Heather Podesta are also on that list.
You are just making them look even more guilty with your obfuscating.
