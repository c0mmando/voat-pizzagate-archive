<p>Ivanka is also a bit of an obnoxious tramp by some accounts, consistent with girls sexually active since 14, and conceivably MK Ultrad since a younger age.  Also she dated <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-446056/The-richest-Rothschild-all.html">Nat Rothschild</a>, poised to become richest of the family and best buddies with Roman Abramovich.</p>
<p>Her husband\'s brother Joshua Kushner, has also been given a model of Casablancas, the same Karlie Kloss mentioned in The first link about Gay Mafia leader Geffens yacht parties.

<p>This barely scratched the surface.  There are so many other pedos like photographer Marc Jacobs and Brunel discussed on voat before as he provide slaves to Epstein.</p>

            I privately pondered awhile ago that it may take some time for an AG to build up a case, convene a grand jury, etc. etc. Could probably take several months from swearing in. I was hopeful, however, that something may turn up earlier.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have my doubts now that I see Sessions barking more about weed than pedos, and Howdy Doody Comey STILL seemingly running the FBI roost as a police arm of the Clinton crime family. This, AND Chaffetz.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "swamp" is only getting worse, and I fear our best chance and candidate at actually draining it was lost long ago, in the mud and hell of the primary races.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just my 2c on the matter. I hope Trump proves me wrong. I really do.

            Sad to see we have political bias involved in our investigations. Let's stick to the investigations and help to expose the ring.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             There's been serious rise in pedophile arrests during this year
            </li>
            <li>
             There's NOT a significant rise in arrests of high profile pedophiles, however
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Neither Trump or any earlier president has managed (or been willing / been able) to expose pedophilia in large scale among the elites. This job has been done, so far, by independent journalists (see for example "
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">
             Conspiracy of Silence
            </a>
            "). The elite ring has realized this, and they have taken control of the media to prevent the exposing also in that front. Undercover journalists are still doing a great, and sometimes dangerous, job.
           </p>
           <p>
            People posting here about Trump or any other politician should not be voted for political reasons, not up or down, but instead for the value of the post itself regarding investigations. Should we give clearance to any politician, considering what we've found so far, until they've shown efforts to get some high profile child rapers in jail.

             The fuck are you talking about. This post does expose Trumps daughter as member of the ring, and it's not even complete. And the media has always been a handful of jewish education corporations and has always been an utter sham since before that NYT asshole got a Pulitzer for saying how awesome Bolshevik Russia was. so thanks for that circle. Like the blind leading the blind y'all are.

            Lol precisely zero addressing the evidence put forth.  As if you must know the exact circumstances and motivation of Trump's election to say his commitment to fighting human trafficking, as a former trafficker of humans, is dubious at best.

             I hate Trump.  I also hate Hillary.  They're all shit and they're all a part of this problem.  So...yeah..just because we're not addressing evidence still does not tackle the issue of this post's relevance to PG.  No matter what you say here...there are those that realize Trump is just as complicit as all the rest of the elites (which i where I lump myself) or you have a hard on for Trump still, you bleed MAGAnation and you believe he's the savior that is going to drain the swamp (Which, if you're woke enough..you'll realize it won't happen); and again, no matter what you say, the latter will be quick to hate you.

             My thoughts exactly.  I'm definitely NOT a Trump supporter.  They're all in cahoots and they're all complicit. Every last one of the power hungry, money hard elites. And I'm also definitely not a Christian.

              I'd say I am a trump supporter, yet still skeptical as one should be, and am a Christian. TBH I don't care what else you believe as long as you are trying to help fight the pedos. An enemy of my enemy is my friend. Divide and conquer is the motto of theses sick fucks and we CANNOT let that happen.

            Was never hardcore MAGA, so this wouldn't be shocking to me. Actually thought T was being used to run interference for HRC. Now that he's in, and since I don't believe any president has been really voted in, sure seems like a classic double cross. There's also just so much occult significance, if you're into that, of Trump getting into office. The trump card is the fool card, which is the foundation of the tarot occult system. There's also the issue of predictive programming which is everywhere in relation to T getting into office. It also fascinates me that T was made to eat in the kitchen with the help when he'd come over for Epstein's dinners. Weird, since that seems like the Epstein group thought of him as the help too. Anyway, I get the resistance to this idea, and I'm hoping for the best, but the owls, as they say, most times are not what they seem.

            This isn't a necessary subject to our investigation...you may go ahead and dump him if you like. I will personally hold out hope that he is at least not one of them even if he isn't getting our desired results...maybe he is using the info to blackmail them to get stuff done for now till they have what they need or maybe keep on using it but at least he is trying to cut off their supply of immigrants and refugees.

              Haha.  I know.  All politicians before him, especially the dems were all evil pedophiles.  But Trump?  Nope.  No way, no how.  He's their savior.

              Gah.  It drives me crazy seeing you Trumpsters still thinking he's your knight in golden everything.  All of these crazy elites, be it dems or repubs..they're all in on it!  They're all complicit.

            I'm going to give Trump a little more time. But seriously the wall needs to be built and tax reform has to get done before his first term is up. This backtracking on NK is BS. Trump is too concerned with comparing dick sizes with Kim Jong. We need a cruise missile strike just like in Syria and special forces to take out the nukes. I'm watching this BS Comey questioning on TV, they are so concerned about the "Russian" hacks and nothing about the contents of the email. This whole thing is trumps fault for taking his foot off the gas pedal and not prosecuting Hillary. I don't give a shit if the whole government goes down with her, this shit needs to stop. Trump has under 4 years to at least attempt to fix this shit or he has lost my vote.

             They will just use rope and jump the wall or find other ways of getting across such as tunnels, by sea, river or air. They will ALWAYS find a way. We desperately need that money for Americas infrastructure.  There is no way every inch of the wall will be able to be patrolled 24/7. It will take 15 years and 20 billion tax dollars to build and you know that years later there will be a social movement to tear it all down. The wall is a horrible idea that will go down in history as a " huuuuge" mistake.

             i don't think it's time to dump him yet. I'm going to give him the few years and then make my decision. I do not regret my vote for Trump at all, he was the best candidate. Could you imagine if Hillary, Bernie, or Jeb Bush got in? I'm not sure about Ted Cruz, all of a sudden he is kissing Trumps ass.

               This, this, 100% this.  No such thing as a good candidate in a world where they're all in on the corruption together and only give us the illusion of a choice while they continue to have sex with kids, line their pockets in gold and stay at the top while we stay numb and dumb.

                 Understandable. I didn't vote for him, but I understood why many were convinced he was a better option since I wouldn't give HRC the nod over Dahmer either (yet her base was unaware of her war mongering). They're all psychopaths in my book. The only positive that I could see of T getting into oval is that the HRC pop, the ones that think HRC is some sort of peacenik, might actually criticize regime change foreign policy. Was dead wrong about that though. Instead, the "libs" celebrated the missile strikes and only criticized him for not dropping more bombs, not leveling out damascus, and  not immediately clearing the way for al queda, isis, and the muslim brotherhood to rule syria.

                   It's a shame. Honestly, after 2016 and now 17, I'm really disappointed how easy gen pop, all of it, are manipulated and how much BS they're willing to believe just because CNN tells it so.

            What makes you think we have any control over whether Trump stays or goes? We don't.

             So you're telling me that Trump's election win over Hillary was just an elaborate ruse by the Rothschilds, Soros, CIA and the rest of globalists? I don't think Soros enjoyed losing billions of dollars fighting Trump. I don't think the Clinton's enjoyed losing their bribe money in the loss. I don't think the CIA enjoyed exposing their bias against American interests.

              That was an election. Deplorable shit lords such as ourselves are given a choice every 4 years. Dumping Trump during intervening years isn't on our dance card. To get rid of a sitting President you must belong to "The Club".
