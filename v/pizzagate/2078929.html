Police: Brothers in their 70s, 80s arrested in child sex abuse investigation
by: Gary Horcher, DeeDee Sun Updated: Aug 22, 2017 - 2:24 AM </p>
<p>On Aug. 19, Seattle child sex crime detectives say they say the acted on a tip from a relative who arrived to clean out the garage of three elderly brothers and immediately called 911. </p>
<p>At the home detectives collected a staggering amount of child porn. They also found evidence of the sexual exploitation of young girls as well as children\'s worn clothing and underwear, children’s shoes, toys and movies. </p>
<p>Homeland Security\'s Internet Child Exploitation team assisted in the search, which involved digging for potential buried evidence under locked sheds and garages.</p>
<p>Seattle police say the brothers, ranging in age from 78 to 82, began molesting their own sister and eventually molested other young relatives for decades.</p>
<p>None of them had ever married, none had their own children or many relationships outside their own siblings.</p>
<p>Police arrested 82-year-old Charles Lee Emery in a Queen Anne nursing home. Eighty-year-old Thomas Edwin Emery and 78-year-old Edwin Harold Emery were arrested at their home.</p>
<p>Neighbor Don Smith saw piles of porn and news clippings about murdered children taken from the home\'s old crumbling shed, where police say the walls held horrifying secrets for five decades, and it was all closely guarded by the three brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have interaction with typical people it\'s one thing, but with them it\'s like \'grrrrrrr!\'&quot;</p>
<p>Detectives say Charles, Thomas and Edwin sexually molested young relatives for years, and collected pictures and even children\'s shoes.</p>
<p>But detectives say it was Charles\' &quot;manifestos&quot; about Satanic rituals, kidnapping, raping and killing girls that led them to dig under sheds, searching for evidence of potential murder.</p>
<p>Detectives say one of Charles\' writings was found buried and partially burned -- along with a child\'s hat.</p>
<p>&quot;Their writings express desires to kill children,&quot; said Capt. Mike Edwards, who leads SPD\'s Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force.</p>
<p>The search extended from the home in the Green Lake neighborhood to another home the brothers owned 90 miles away in Shelton.</p>
<p>&quot;It\'s very clear that these three individuals have an obsession with young female children, they\'ve had this obsession for most if not all of their lives, and they acted on it,&quot; said Edwards.</p>
<p>Charging documents indicate SPD detectives questioned Edwin Emery and his relatives about child porn found on his computer in 2013, but no charges were ever filed.</p>
<p>Now detectives are hoping to identify the children in the photos and they hope to find victims who may have been molested decades ago and never came forward.
Neighbors react</p>
<p>Neighbors in the quiet Green Lake neighborhood along Northeast 59th St.Street say they always wondered about the dilapidated house and the three guarded, mysterious Emery brothers who lived there since 1962. </p>
<p>&quot;I\'ve never seen a girlfriend, a wife, a woman of any type visit that house,&quot; said Don Smith, who lives next door.</p>
<p>Neighbors have been wondering exactly what happened in this home since investigators swarmed the home over the weekend. The new details Seattle police and court documents revealed leave them stunned.</p>
<p>For decades, neighbors didn\'t think much about the three brothers who\'ve lived there for 55 years.</p>
<p>“I just thought they were harmless weird old guys,” said Julie Vandenberg, who lives directly across the street.</p>
<p>“They\'re just kind of your average recluses,” said Noel O’Shea, another neighbor.</p>
<p>Then neighbors saw the investigators in HAZMAT suits and police bring out box after box of evidence on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>“It was shocking. I didn’t know what to think,” said Smith, who watched investigators work late into the night Friday from his home next door.</p>
<p>“It just makes your skin crawl,” O’Shea said. “It’s just a real black spot on a quiet neighborhood in Greenlake,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s way worse than I thought. It is sickening, it\'s really sickening,” Vandenberg said. “Something happened to little children here - it sounds like little girls, and that\'s horrific.”</p>
<p>Neighbors say many young children live on the block.</p>
<p>“There are a ton of kids,” O’Shea said.</p>
<p>“I think they\'re cowards because they pick on children. It is it\'s disgusting to think what they might\'ve done to some mom and dad\'s little girl, or little girls.”</p>
<p>The neighbors say they wish they would\'ve noticed some sign earlier, about what was going on in the house but they\'re just glad the three brothers aren\'t there to victimize kids any longer.</p>
<p>Don Smith said he was surprised the allegations were kept quiet for so long.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, to be next door to these guys for all these years, if. If they\'re going out every day and doing something like that, I was like, wow. This is too much&quot;</p>',

            Could brothers in life-long sex abuse investigation be tied to missing children?
by: Ashli Blow, KIRO 7 News Digital Producer Updated: Aug 24, 2017 - 6:23 AM
           </p>
           <p>
            SEATTLE - There was no immediate connection between three Seattle brothers who police believed collected child pornography for decades and local missing person cases.
           </p>
           <p>
            But at least one law enforcement officer is investigating the possibility. The Gray's Harbor Sheriff told KIRO 7 he's investigating whether the brothers have any connection to the 2009 disappearance of Lindsey Baum in southwest Washington.
           </p>
           <p>
            Charles Emery, 82, Thomas Emery, 80, and Edwin Emery, 79, are charged with possessing child pornography.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It's very clear that these three individuals have an obsession with young female children, they've had this obsession for most if not all of their lives, and they acted on it,” said Capt. Mike Edwards, who leads SPD's Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force.
           </p>
           <p>
            Detectives discovered a staggering amount of child pornography along with children's worn clothing, underwear, small shoes, toys and movies. Investigators believe each of the men spent the majority of their lives sexually abusing children.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it was an unearthed “manifesto” about Satanic rituals, kidnapping, raping and killing girls that led detectives to dig under sheds, searching for evidence of potential murder. Charles’ writings were found buried and partially burned -- along with a child's hat.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Their writings express desires to kill children," Edwards said.
Baum flier found at family home
           </p>
           <p>
            Lindsey Baum disappeared from McCleary while walking back from a friend’s house in 2009. The 10-year-old’s disappearance sparked a nationwide investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            McCleary is a roughly 30-minute drive from Shelton, where the brothers also owned a property. Charles – and his now-deceased brother Donald – remained in the Shelton home until 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            Grays Harbor County Sheriff Rick Scott confirmed to KIRO 7 News that a flier about Baum was found in the Shelton home, but there is no known connection between the brothers and the disappearance of Baum. Police are investigating.
           </p>
           <p>
            “When we heard of the link to the Shelton property, and its proximity to McCleary, and the nature of the paper work they found at the [Seattle home] … We immediately began to see if there’s anything that would link to our investigation,” Scott told KIRO 7 News.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The Lindsey Baum case has been and will be a priority until we find closure or find Lindsey safe. We’ve worked on the case every day in some shape or form.”
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Scott, detectives intend to do an extensive search of the Shelton property, but it will take a large team as it sits on 14 to 17 acres of land.
           </p>
           <p>
            Viewer questions about 1956 case
           </p>
           <p>
            Back at the brothers’ home near Green Lake, detectives on Wednesday set up a tent on the lawn to search and remove items.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some neighborhood residents and people on social media have speculated on missing persons cases connections in the North Seattle area, but police have not indicated any links. A commenter on the KIRO 7 Facebook page mentioned a case where a young girl’s body was found in a garage in the 1950s.
           </p>
           <p>
            KIRO 7 News ran an archive search that showed in June 1956, the body of Kathryn Ruoff was found in a garage at 4718 Sixth Ave. N.E. – a site that was bulldozed for the construction of Interstate 5.
           </p>
           <p>
            But a mentally ill man, Ray John Earl Barker, admitted to molesting and killing Ruoff when he was 12. Barker was charged with second-degree murder in April 1963 and was committed to Western State Hospital.
Former Seattle cold case detective gives perspective
           </p>
           <p>
            KIRO 7 News talked to a retired Seattle homicide detective about the social media speculation and possible connections between the Emery brothers and missing persons.
           </p>
           <p>
            That detective, Mike Ciesynski, said it would be out of the ordinary for missing persons cases to line up.
           </p>

            But nothing changes because this evidence will disappear forever, just like all the evidence in prior cases. This problem also fuels the bastards that pen articles claiming that snuff films don't exist. SHOW the snuff films on CNN NOW! "You're just a pervert that wants to see and get your rocks off." FINE! Then allow the public to sign up and go to a facility where they can examine the evidence in a public setting. THIS PROBLEM is the main reason why pedogate is ongoing.

            An anon from Seattle said mk ultra in the music industry is rampant there.  He said they had him bond with a boy a few years older him then after he fully trusted the boy and was best friends with him, they had the older boy rape him.  He gave other details but I can't remember.  It was a while back.  He talked about DJs abd a boarding school. I posted about it on voat a couple months ago.  I think carmencita helped me look into his claims.  The pictures he posted did pan out.  He was definitely very MKUktra though - you could tell he was smart but his brain was fried.  Sometimes he made sense and other times I was like whaaaaaattttttt????
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, just wanted to add that I have come across Seattle being mentioned as a pedo haven.  Didn't  soundgarden start there???  There was also a band that had a pedo slayer that came out during performances to pretend to slay pedophiles.  That was literally her name "pedo slayer" Look up Seattle grunge music scene.  I would find the links now but I don't have time - helping my son with geometry

            I am aware of a  bisexual kiddy fucker being murdered in Korea who used to work at SBS Hukwon (school) in Gojan-Dong around 2004. I helped a Canadian (now ex) Girlfriend Jodie Lynne Thompson move into his quickly vacated apartment who was his replacement. In there was a hat belongong to a small boy who followed the state of NSW Rugy Legue team football team. These pedophiles travel internationally and take memrobillia with them like hats - like this fucker had too. Anyway that American pedo I learn't this intel from he fiddled with a police officer's daughter and was caught on Camera by the schools CCTV. That means normal judical procedures were not followed. Direct to the bottom of the lake. He never applied for a new passport and his passport was left in his room. ;)

             Lord bless  you if have the stomach and the skills to dig into these stories to uncover a much as possible.  Nearly all police investigators I've worked with  had weaker internet skills then a typical millenial.

             My point being there is low hanging fruit here and work to be done that won't get done otherwise.

             Vancouver B.C. is overflowing with this sick shit. Unfortunately many RCMP are actually in on it as is or was the B.C. coroner and Vancouver mayor. The Pickton farm is a prime example and much like these 3 brothers, the local authorities were always looking the other way. WHY!!??

            Funny how some homes can be raided on zero hard evidence or the flimsiest of pretexts, but places like this somehow escape attention for decades.

           <p>
            Hell, they even talked to one about possession of actual child porn while his garage and shed were apparently creaking and bulging at the seams  with amassed piles of murder and abuse evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Creeps like this must have a sixth sense for police "blind spots". And even now, this is probably only happening because Trump has put an aggressive taskforce in place that won't allow shit like this to get quietly lost in the back of a filing cabinet by some Sheriff who doesn't want a dark spot on his record.

              The symbols are a distraction. The fact that is takes a ballsy prosecutor and complicate police department to squash any investigation is on point.
             </p>
             <p>
              Throwing shit into a legitimate investigation is why they will get away with it. Yet if one exposes the duplicity of humans throwing excrement, the only defense is to retort with personal attacks.
Better yet, rebuttals that assume some are Jew lovers because we know not all Jews are evil.
             </p>
             <p>
              Idiots who think all Blacks are thieves, all Orientals brainiacs and all Jews are evil are the real racist bigots. Good cops will never win if Blackmail and Extortion make their loved ones collateral damage.

              It's time for collateral justice and let God sort them out.

                i think it's impossible that there are innate psychological instincts. personally, i think that behavior is generally learned and passed down through generations. except for the occasional psychopath (born), if there are distinct patterns, they are probably cultural.

            Police: Seattle Children’s janitor, brothers hoarded evidence of child abuse
Investigators discover trove of child pornography, children’s shoes, handwritten descriptions of child murders in elderly men’s Green Lake home
By Levi Pulkkinen, SeattlePI Updated 6:50 pm, Monday, August 21, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            King County prosecutors have filed child pornography charges against three Seattle brothers – including one who for decades worked as a janitor at Seattle Children’s hospital – caught with a disturbing collection of images, child’s clothing and handwritten notes in their home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Charles, Edwin and Thomas Emery lived together in a Green Lake-neighborhood home covered “floor to ceiling with child exploitative images, children’s clothing articles, toys and movies,” Senior Deputy Prosecutor Cecelia Gregson said in charging papers. Gregson noted that the investigation is ongoing into handwritten notes found at the home describing the murder of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Charles Emery maintained an extensive ‘collection’ of materials related to the sexual assault and murder of female children,” Gregson said. “Edwin and Thomas Emery referred to Charles Emery’s manifestos detailing child rape and homicide and his extensive collection of items related thereto as ‘Charles’ hobby.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Childless and unmarried, the Emery brothers lived together for more than 50 years, most recently in the 100 block of Northeast 59th Street. A police investigation was launched Aug. 9 after a woman contacted officers claiming she they sexually abused her.
           </p>
           <p>
            The woman pointed police to boxes of child pornography, girls’ clothing and magazine clippings related to missing or murdered young girls. Investigators claim to have recovered handwritten notes describing the kidnapping, torture, rape and murder of girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seattle Police Department Capt. Mike Edwards said investigators are combing evidence recovered from the home to determine whether the brothers may have killed or hurt children beyond the identified victims they are believed to have sexually abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            “A lot of these writings were very specific about harming children, abusing children and even murdering children,” said Edwards, who leads the regional Internet Crimes Against Children unit based at the Seattle Police Department.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The house itself was like one of the worst houses you’d ever see on an episode of ‘Hoarders,’” Edwards continued. "We don’t want to miss anything.”
           </p>
           <p>
            According to charging papers, the woman discovered the boxes while cleaning out Charles Emery's possessions. Charles Emery, 82, was recently moved into a nursing home due to dementia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interviewed by detectives, Thomas Emery, 80, and Edwin Emery, 78, initially claimed they hadn't entered the garage where those boxes were stored in years, Detective Danial Conine said in court papers said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators searched the Emery home on Saturday. They spent more than 30 hours scouring the home, which they described as a "hoarder" house.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edwards said the men appeared to have closed themselves off from much of the world, except for a fourth brother who lived in Shelton and died in late 2016. Police searched his property as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Detectives will attempt to piece together a history of the Emery brothers in coming days. What appears clear, Edwards said, is that they had been abusing girls known to them for decades without a report to police.
           </p>
           <p>
            One woman told police she had been abused by Charles and Edwin Emery as a child, according to charging papers. Charles Emery was working at Seattle Children’s hospital when the abuse occurred.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The one message we beat the drum over all the time is, ‘Report it, report it, report it,’” Edwards said. “These types of cycles can only be broken if someone speaks out.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Printed child pornography was found throughout the home, according to charging papers. Thomas and Edwin Emery were arrested at the scene.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Both Emery brothers remained nonchalant and relatively unconcerned about the serious nature of the investigation," Conine said in court papers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edwin Emery admitted to being sexually attracted to children, while Thomas Emery told investigators he kept hundreds of items of child pornography because he "considered it art," according to charging papers.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Both Thomas and Edwin Emery denied knowledge of child homicide, but would reply to law enforcement questions on the topic that it was 'possible' if everything the officers was saying was true," Conine said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators will now undertake the difficult work of identifying the girls displayed in child pornography taken from the homes. Edwards said some of the material appeared to have been obtained online, but that it was too early to know whether the brothers had produced any on their own.

             Police: Elderly brothers spent lifetime collecting sexual images of children, sexually abusing young girls

             Three elderly Seattle brothers were charged Monday with possessing images of child-sex abuse, with police still investigating them for allegedly sexually abusing and killing young girls, according to King County prosecutors.

            </p>
            <p>
             The house in Seattle’s Meridian neighborhood where three elderly brothers have lived for more than 50 years was jampacked with sexual photos and videos of young girls, toys and girls’ clothing, as well as notes, books and other documents about child-sex abuse and homicide, according to police and prosecutors.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Monday, King County prosecutors charged each of the brothers — Charles Emery, 82; Thomas Emery, 80; and Edwin Emery, 79 — with two counts of second-degree possession of depictions of minors engaged in sexual conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
             All three have been booked into the King County Jail and are each being held in lieu of $500,000 bail, jail records show. They are to be arraigned Aug. 31.
            </p>
            <p>
             “At the time of filing, law enforcement is actively executing search warrants and interviewing witnesses to determine the extent of the defendants’ child exploitation crimes as well as evidence of homicide,” Senior Deputy Prosecutor Cecelia Gregson wrote in charging papers, noting the brothers “have spent a lifetime accumulating” their collection of images and videos.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The investigation revealed that each of the defendants has a sexual interest in minor children and have shared the majority of their lives sexually abusing children to whom they had access and exploiting children depicted in child pornography,” Gregson wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the charges:
            </p>
            <p>
             On Aug. 9, one of the men’s relatives contacted Seattle police after finding boxes of obscene materials in the garage of the house the three brothers have shared since 1962.
            </p>
            <p>
             The relative is the legal guardian of Charles Emery, who was moved into a senior residential home because of his dementia, the charges say.
            </p>
            <p>
             The charges note that he was a janitor at Seattle Children’s Hospital from the 1970s through the 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
             The relative turned over a large quantity of items from the garage, including “hand written notes detailing the kidnapping, torturing, raping and murdering of young girls,” according to the charges.
            </p>
            <p>
             When detectives interviewed Thomas and Edwin Emery, police say the brothers claimed they hadn’t gone into the garage for years, and that it contained “Charles’ hobby,” say the charges.
            </p>
            <p>
             Starting last Friday, members of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, which includes Seattle police detectives, searched the brothers’ home for more than 30 hours, with one detective describing it as “a substantial hoarder home,” charging papers say.
            </p>
            <p>
             They found sexual images of children throughout the residence along with dozens of pairs of girls’ penny loafers, panties and toys. They also found a single-serving vodka bottle and a note indicating the alcohol had been given to a child victim to facilitate her sex abuse, according to the charges.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the house’s crawl space, detectives also found a girl’s pink hat partially buried in the dirt, along with a handwritten note that had been burned but was similar to other notes in the house about sex abuse and homicide, charging papers say.
            </p>
            <p>
             As of Sunday, detectives were still searching additional properties associated with the brothers “for the presence of child exploitation materials and evidence of kidnapping, abuse, and child homicide,” say the charges.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police say Edwin Emery admitted to molesting female family members, according to the charges.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2013, Edwin Emery took his computer in for servicing, and staff at the computer store contacted police after finding sexual images of minors, the charges say.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was investigated for possession of depictions of minors engaged in sexual conduct but was never prosecuted, say the charges, though prosecutors don’t indicate why charges weren’t filed at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             None of the three brothers ever married or had biological children of his own, and none has any known, prior, criminal convictions, the charging papers say.
