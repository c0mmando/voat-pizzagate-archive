<p>In 1995, Nicole Kidman appeared in the film Batman Forever.</p>
<p>In 1999, Nicole Kidman, with then husband Tom Cruise, starred in Eyes Wide Shut, the final film of Stanley Kubrick.</p>
<p>In 2004 she appeared in the film, Birth, in which Kidman shares a bath with her co-star, 10-year-old Cameron Bright.</p>
<p>Some of these films are said to be linked to CIA mind-control.</p>

<p>Fiona Barnett says &quot;The main perpetrator of my child sexual abuse, Antony Kidman, is dead after I filed formal complaints accusing him of the rape, torture and murder of children in an exclusive Sydney pedophile ring.</p>
<p>&quot;As a child victim of mind control I feel he\'s been sacrificed for failing to adequately program me.</p>
<p>&quot;Kidman was responsible for ensuring that I never disclosed pedophile ring activities that I witnessed as a child...&quot;</p>

<p>Since the age of three Fiona Barnett had been trapped inside Australia’s vast pedophile network where children were sex trafficked, hunted down for sport and murdered.</p>
<p>**Fiona Barnett **says: &quot;Perpetrators took turns sneaking up on me. A large group of men arrived in pick up trucks. They carried rifles and had a pack of starving Doberman dogs.</p>
<p>&quot;I was told that the group of naked children huddled nearby were my responsibility. I was to run and hide them.</p>
<p>&quot;Every child I failed to hide would be killed and fed to the dogs.</p>
<p>&quot;They painted something on my back and chest, and then released us. I pushed the children up over the first steep hill.</p>
<p>&quot;It was about the second or third hill that the hunting party reached us. Shots were fired and children began dropping all around me. With all hope lost of my saving the other children, I took off and ran for my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Barnett’s Nazi grandfather\'s (my step-grandfather and Nazi war criminal <a href="https://independentaustralia.net/life/life-display/fiona-barnett--candy-girl,8248">Peter Holowczak</a>) pedophile network was said to include clinical psychologists Kidman and John W. Gittinger who developed a popular test among psychiatric professionals known as the Personality Assessment System.</p>
<p>Who, undoubtedly worked alongside Psychologist Dr. Henry Alexander Murray of Harvard University who was the CIA’s preeminent elder statesman. During World War II, he left Harvard as the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as a lieutenant colonel.</p>

<p>&quot;Now one month following my notification against Kidman, he is dead. Kidman’s death comes as no surprise. In the past week alone, two people predicted his imminent demise.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2004, ID Models boss Zampolli was exposed as a former business associate/partner of the infamous convicted Pedophile Island financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In 2004, Zampolli and Epstein unsuccessfully tried to buy Elite Model Management at auction. Now, very few if any tie these two figures together in the inner circle of Donald Trump, who\'s daughter Ivanka modeled for ID, Bill and Hilary Clinton.</p>
<p>Paolo Zampolli has a Dominican diplomatic passport and is officially the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of Dominica for Oceans and Seas- an absolute joke. According to the UN’s Blue Book, Zampolli is Dominica’s (lone) Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN. There is great concern that Zampolli is using his stable of MK ULTRA Sex Kittens at the UN to compromise and bribe foreign heads of state, officials, diplomats and ambassadors.</p>
<p>ZAMPOLLI is an old world BLOODLINE of the Italian AGNELLI/FIAT family. The Agnelli family intermarried with one of the leading ruling families of old Europe that goes back to ancient Etruscans. They are part of the ancient HOUSE OF BOURBON.</p>
<p>The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma, Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs, OLD WORLD SATANIC POWER ELITE.</p>

           "Now one month following my notification against Kidman, he is dead. Kidman’s death comes as no surprise. In the past week alone, two people predicted his imminent demise."

           In 2004, ID Models boss Zampolli was exposed as a former business associate/partner of the infamous convicted Pedophile Island financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In 2004, Zampolli and Epstein unsuccessfully tried to buy Elite Model Management at auction. Now, very few if any tie these two figures together in the inner circle of Donald Trump, who's daughter Ivanka modeled for ID, Bill and Hilary Clinton.

           Paolo Zampolli has a Dominican diplomatic passport and is officially the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of Dominica for Oceans and Seas- an absolute joke. According to the UN’s Blue Book, Zampolli is Dominica’s (lone) Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN. There is great concern that Zampolli is using his stable of MK ULTRA Sex Kittens at the UN to compromise and bribe foreign heads of state, officials, diplomats and ambassadors.

           ZAMPOLLI is an old world BLOODLINE of the Italian AGNELLI/FIAT family. The Agnelli family intermarried with one of the leading ruling families of old Europe that goes back to ancient Etruscans. They are part of the ancient HOUSE OF BOURBON.

           The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma, Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs, OLD WORLD SATANIC POWER ELITE.

            In the original Kubrick's ending Nicole Kidman kills Tom Cruise with poison during breakfast the next morning, and before he dies, she explains to him that she is an MK Ultra slave who obeys everything she is told to do, like the prostitutes at the orgy. It was cut off and substituted with the meaningless ending at the mall.

             Interesting about that alternate ending. Maybe that's why Kubrick was offed? Exposing too much? And the weird mall ending isn't exactly meaningless- one commentary I watched pointed out that while Nicole and Tom are talking in the toy store it shows the two shadowy men lurking nearby and then the little daughter runs off towards them. Kinda like "hey we're gonna get your kid". Also there was something weird about the toy that was in the background of the store. It was made just for the movie only I can't remember what it was now. It made some type of reference. I will look it up.

            Melania was raised as a Roman Catholic in the Nation State of Slovenia bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast. Slovenes believe that they are descendants of Slavs who came to Central Europe in the 6th century AD. Some nationalists say that Slovenes are a master race that their ancestors (Venetic Theory) have lived in the lands of modern Slovenia since prehistory. The “Windischar Theory” argued that the Slovenes were actually Windischars (Slavicized Germans).[22]
           </p>
           <p>
            On April 6, 1941 Slovenia was occupied and divided between the Nazis, Italian, and Hungarian invaders. The Nazi racial and purification policies were instituted and the mass killings began in Slovenia. ” … There is hardly any trace of Jews within today’s Slovenia, and in Slovenian contemporary history.”[23] Melinia is not a supermodel, and never has been a supermodel. Out of Central Europe, she became a notable model, but not a supermodel.

             Melania is something very Sad and Eerie.

            Is she like Marina Abramovic, also out of Central Europe, Serbia, caught up in the Old World of powerful international Satanic shadows- mind controlled and taught to consume blood and flesh?

           <p>
            He brought Marina out of Milan, Italy to New York where his front, ID Models, paid her rent. A Slovenian magazine, Suzy, investigated Melinia and Zampolli. Their conclusion was Zampolli was a pimp, and she was a Zampolli executive “WHORE.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Zampolli runs an illegitimate international escort racket with stables of mind controlled East European Sex Slaves. He passed down a “sex kitten”  charter from the Old World Ruling Houses of Europe, Knights Templar, and Freemasonry  to Donald Drumpf, Jeffrey Epstein and the Mossad [Ehud Barak].

            The wife of this disgraced politician has been raising a lot of eyebrows the past month. The wife of that foreign born A++ list criminal has been a frequent visitor at her home.

           <p>
            Do you remember a few weeks ago I wrote about this A list celebrity with A++ list political connections who was meeting several times a week with the wife of an A+++ list criminal. Yeah, well it turns out there is some money laundering going on which our A list celebrity has been coordinating. This is going to blow up and look so bad. I guarantee someone will be able to piece together some way that a percentage of the money taken as a fee for laundering is supporting terrorists or something akin to it.

            All that laundered money involving the foreign born infamous A+ list celebrity and his wife and her very connected political friend is being put to a new use now. Buying a jury member.

             I often have people tell me "you can't red-pill people by starting with the Satanism and the pedophilia," but at this point, we're too late in the game, and if you can't handle these concepts, best to sit things out in the Kiddie Corner. Only strong-minded people can handle these subjects, and we don't need anyone on our side who isn't strong-minded.

                 Sadly, not only is it not behind her but she is likely perpetuating it. This is not something you can just walk away from. If she did get away from it she would probably be dead, but at the very least her career would be dead. Instead it's thriving!

                 Fiona Barnett discussed that Nicole was present one occasion while Anthony was abusing her. Her description of the looks Nicole gave her indicate Nicole is fully aware of what her father was. I have no doubt, knowing how these intergenerational satanic families operate, that Nicole was abused. what's really scary is what is possibly happening to her children now.

                 The only way I can see it being behind her is if she were to break programming, but since she is still in Hollywood and affiliated with certain people I highly doubt this has happened. She may also be a perpetrator. Her adoptive children want nothing to do with her it seems.

             she is also a bad sport and a sore loser who doesnt support her female contemporaries kerry armstrong the australian actress won an award for best actress in lantana and nicole kidman thought she was getting it for moulin rouge ( which i hated by the way ) lantana was a masterpiece ..... anyway instead of standing up and applauding kerry..... nicole and her entourage exited the building .... fiona also described nicole kidman as nasty because she would stand behind her father when he was tormenting fiona and laugh at her being tortured  :/  she did the same thing to naomi watts when 60 minutes asked her for input on their story when naomi was nominated for an academy award ... she was too busy to do one  :/  ......as for keith urban this is how she described their baby together .... She's like a doll, she's like a little, little thing......nicole has been described as .....
To me, Nicole Kidman seems more machine than human. She has a response for "this is when I need to say something funny, " or, "this is when I need to laugh." Every response seems forced, every reaction planned well in advance. It's actually very creepy. .... her marriage to tom cruise was a sham and probably more of a business contract than a marriage and the same goes for her current situation with keith urban. whatever happened to her as a child has left an indelible mark on her
