            This video seems to suggest that the Corey Haim/Feldman sodomizers were carl reiner, rob reiner, Richard dreyfuss and Charlie sheen.

            Franken is a tool and his election was rigged. He is definitely involved in pedo shit considering he is a leader of the Talmud sect of Satan.

            So strangely, after I pulled this article, the website from whence it came, crashed and I could not go back to refer to it on something I wanted to check. My phone/internet has been acting strangely. Anyway, the point of the post is:
(First, this relates to pizzagate In a very obvious way, the known documented documented stories, Woody Allen, Paul Bonacci,  The recent story of the actress from weird science recent submission Kelly LeBrock, Roseanne Barr, etc) and the fact that Al Franken is a sitting Senator having to navigate Washington.
           </p>
           <p>
            -If  there was an underlying message being communicated during this comedy roast, wow.   Especially since it dates back to 2000.  17  years ago, although he's only more recently a US senator, since 2009

            I cannot NOT Connect the dots with Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, both of whom had early career experience with Rob Reiner. Apparently Feldman was up for the same role River Phoenix ended up getting.

             I have really been struggling with the anti-Semitism and horrific hateful disgusting comments regarding not just Judaism (but also Islam and Catholic, Mormonism, Athiesm, etc.). While I can  criticize foreign-policy having been hijacked by Israel and AIPAC &amp; there are lot of Jews in Hollywood, Wallstreet, Big Media etc, So WHAT?!  It is supremely shortsighted and simple to finger point and demonize and isolate and try and define every qualification and metric of those who would: fight to end the horrific reality of child sex trafficking and those who would NOT become conscious &amp; want to vehemently oppose and reject this awful devolution of humanity. People are not all good OR all bad.   I'm sure I don't have to tell you folks about the disgusting horrific lowest vibration that permeates the Catholic Church ( watch documentary The Keepers  or feature film Spotlight), nor  debate the ridiculousness of many aspects of Mormonism, the oppressive creepy cultish mind programming brainwashing Church of Scientology. The fact is both of those so-called religions have some positive aspects to them. Reality is multidimensional, to the 33rd power actually, It is circular &amp; timeless, both this AND THAT, AND AT THE SAME TIME-HELLO LIGHT IS BOTH A PARTICLE AMD A WAVE and Schrodinger's cat is both alive AND dead! Life is layered, like fractal geometry, it is anti-science to think in such a limiting, linear fashion, which speaks to Newtonian physics, (so post-war) and "particle physics," both of which have no true value, once we understand existence at the quantum level, IE we are all connected, this is STRING THEORY, it is a "multi-verse" so get the fuck over it.

            People are people and each individual has his/her own cross to bear and lesson to learn. We are on on a UNIQUE PATH.  But we have a common shared value, because we are all Homo Sapiens trying to exist on this fucking doomed planet that is going to hell in a handbasket soon. And the sooner we recognize "your extinction could very well mean my extinction too,"   We can start to grapple with the hurricanes and the earthquakes and fires and the nuclear disasters and the starvation and so on and so on. We do not have one moment to waste. If WE do not get on the same page and start operating from a place of deep introspection.    And recognize that there are people of all shapes and colors and sizes and persuasions and perspectives fighting a very dark energy.  And here in lies a strength of the so-called LEFT or the "liberals," Libtards who are  so pilloried on this website ( and often as well they should be fucking idiots!) But in this case, actually they are the ones who are able to link religion and science, because they understand alchemy and the power of prayer,  while remaining logical and inclusive and science-based, YET not falling prey to "Scientism," which throws religion and spirituality and miracles with your bound at the quantum level out the window ( see Rabbi Michael Lerner and his 30 year organization
            <a href="http://spiritualprogressives.org/">
             http://spiritualprogressives.org/
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            We need one another!  Let them not divide us!!  They just passed a $700 million it's probably really 1 trillion on a defense budget that enriches the top 1/10 of 1% of the global elite population. Let that sink in.
           </p>
           <p>
            We must not let this Injustice stand, these politicians need to be voted out, they need to be tried and convicted we need a truth and reconciliation commission, there has to be a punishment and accountability, but do we really want a bloody witch hunt massacre? I don't.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm guessing there are a lot of people on this website who claim to follow Jesus.  So be like Jesus, the Jew, and don't be a dick. Al Franken will thank you.  So would Einstein who said: "Science without religion is lame, but religion without science is blind."
           </p>
           <p>
            Question: what does Al Franken know, if anything?
 Oh yeah and Shana Tova!

            God I can't stand Al Franken.  Rob Reiner either.  Now that I know what they are and what they are doing. Actually my bubble was burst about Reiner in those Corey stories. Shameful.

             Rob Reiner was on TV today saying he is pulling together as many of his big shot friends as he can to attempt to expose this horrible Trump/Russia scandal.  People should take notes when he names the names. It might just fill in the blanks of who is who in the elite Hollywood child trafficking rings.

              Yes, We must start taking names and researching all of them.  Now when I see an article about some Kids hospital or about the UN filled with names.  I write them down.  Yesterday I saw an article about the UN and wrote down names.  When I have time, they will be looked up.  We must start questioning these idiot elites.  They are not above it.

             OK that does not shock me, but what if Al Franken is onto something and this is his version of red pilling people. I'm not saying that's what's going on, but I'm using it as a hypothetical to illustrate my deeper question.

              I think we are being fooled about Franken.  Think how screwy Sat. Night Live has become.  He is from there.  I have been a Dem. for 25 years and I am now an Independent because I am so disgusted with both sides.  I am going to watch Franken.  To think I even sent him $20 when he started out.  They have the nerve to ask us for money when they get so much from the Elites.  They do what they say anyway.  They are beholding to them.  Not us.  He is on notice as far as I am concerned.  I would like to red pill him.
