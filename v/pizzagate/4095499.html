<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft Corp. joined international law enforcement agencies today to unveil an unprecedented computer system that allows global police agencies to share information for tracking online child predators. The Child Exploitation Tracking System (CETS) was developed by Microsoft Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Toronto Police Service following a personal e-mail plea from Toronto Police <strong>Detective Sergeant Paul Gillespie</strong> to Microsoft Chairman and Chief Software Architect Bill Gates in January 2003.</p>

<p>A number of law enforcement agencies use or are deploying the CETS tool, these include:</p>
<p>United Kingdom: Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command of the National Crime Agency.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft contributed technology in creating NCMEC</strong> which furthered the development of a system which captures criminals in addition to removing offensive images. &quot;Microsoft has implemented PhotoDNA on its own online properties including Bing, SkyDrive and Hotmail, which has already resulted in the identification, reporting and removal of thousands of images of child pornography&quot; (Microsoft, 2013).

<blockquote>
<p>A video content security company has donated its digital fingerprint technology to a global effort to tackle child abuse content online.</p>
<p><strong>Netclean and Microsoft have already been working with the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC)</strong> to help law enforcement assign digital signatures to illegal photos distributed online. In March, ICMEC announced it was coordinating the formation of <strong>Project Vic</strong>, a cloud-based database of these fingerprints that content retrieved in police investigations across the globe can be compared against. The idea is local law enforcement runs the fingerprint software to seek out these markers, saving them time so they can focus on the unidentified material and the victims featured in them.</p>
<p>ICMEC is due to distribute the tech to all its partners in law enforcement, including those at Interpol, Homeland Security in the US, Europol and the Swedish, Dutch, Australian and New Zealand national police services, all of which are part of Project Vic.</p>

             Thank you. I'm going back to have another look at those early years when Epstein started investing in particular companies, Gates got involved with the child exploitation field and Palantir started.
