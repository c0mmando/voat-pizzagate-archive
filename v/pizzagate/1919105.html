            Its not a bad idea, not because it will work in the classic sense. Yet because its important to make attempts at exhausting all administrative remedies in the pursuit of further remedies. As many commenters stated, the cops are controlled by those who are "in on it" and they will usually be run-out of their departments or possibly killed. If you try that route enough, then you at the individual level will be looked at has having given the advertised remedy for wrongdoing a valid effort. Once due diligence done, you may find other remedies easier in finding and/or implementing.

            City Cops would know even more than the average person how the evidence supporting this wild theory is paper thin.
           </p>
           <p>
            City Cops would understand you have zero of evidence a crime being committed in confines of Washington DC and pictures you don't like on Instagram are evidence of nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            City Cops would  know how actual prostitution and trafficking rings behave.   They would know how front business operate.  Trafficking rings don't open ambitious farm-to-table pizzerias and make that the center of their trafficking and then open their doors to thousands of random people every month.
           </p>
           <p>
            City cops would see through this much, much easier than regular folks.
           </p>
           <p>
            City cops would not find those pictures disturbing.    They would understand a bartender's drag queen's persona's Halloween costume is faggy-fantasy-nonsense, not evidence of a crime.  They might even know exactly what Stephen King book/movie the character was from.  (Hell in NYC, the campy Halloween Parade is broadcast on the local TV channels.) Most people would not find the baby-money picture disturbing at all.  It's only disturbing to you because you see it in this context and thus your mind is primed.  (Not a slur on you, that's how our minds work.  See the Kuleshov effect
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleshov_effect">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleshov_effect
            </a>
            and priming.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's an experiment.   Print out that photo of the baby.   Show it to people and ask if they have ever seen it before.    If they have never seen it before, see how they react.   Are they disgusted?  Are they neutral?   Are they happy to see a cute baby?   Don't influence them in any way and see if they say anything.                Then like 10 minutes later ask them what they thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your assumption on the Billboard Van seem off to me.  I would think that of anywhere in the country the folks who live work by Comet Ping Pong are the most aware that this theory exists.   And CPP customers still go there and eat and watch shows?   Why?    Because their are coastal elite degenerates?   Or because their reject this outlandish theory as having no basis in fact, no connection at all to their first hand experience of actually going to Comet Ping Pong?   They know it's full of kids with their families during daytime.  They know all-age rock shows are held at night.  And they know that all-age shows are a common thing in DC.   They know that they can sit right down in front of that mural folks on VOAT were horrified by and have a completely different reaction to it and sit down for dinner in front of it. And they know their kids are not afraid of it.
           </p>

            You don't even need to be a Coastal Elite for this response.   See this family blog from a family in Indiana visiting back in 2012

             "City Cops would understand you have zero of evidence a crime being committed in confines of Washington DC and pictures you don't like on Instagram are evidence of nothing."

            <p>
             No one has implied that Alefantis Instagram is evidence of PizzaGate. It is evidence that he (Alefantis) and his friends (Amanda Kleinman) are total fucking psycho, yes. What we are working for here (some off us at least) is to put so much pressure on TPTB so an INVESTIGATION is started. My question to you Are_We_Sure is what are you working towards?

             TLDR:
            </p>
            <p>
             John Lang found out Fresno cops were running a ticketing scam then he reported it to the Fresno Bee paper and someone at the paper gave the police his IP address and the cops harassed him then possibly murdered him and FBI and Internal Affairs did nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             The police + media + ABC agencies were all together and did nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             John Lang documented the whole thing on his youtube channel.

              A retired army friend of mine admitted that lots of cops strap a drop gun, just in case. And just last week the FBI "lost" some guns implicated in a politically related murder. Corruption is the rule, not the exception.

             Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham is most likely a sadistic pedophile.

            The cops answer to the Chief, the Chiefs are always subverted. That is why agents leak things. They can never do anything. And if they are found out., their house burns down and they and their spouse get suicided inside of it.

            I often wonder what happens if people go up to cops in DC and try grilling them about the pizzagate cover up, see how they react. Even just cops in America in general. And there must have been a few cops that have become aware of this like we have but can't do anything about it. That would be weird.
