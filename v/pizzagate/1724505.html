<p>In 2015 Ashton Kutcher was spotted coming out of a Thai massage parlour <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3373381/Ashton-Kutcher-pictured-leaving-Hollywood-massage-parlour-solo-visit.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3373381/Ashton-Kutcher-pictured-leaving-Hollywood-massage-parlour-solo-visit.html</a> .  Their website: &quot;<strong>http: losangeles.backpage.com/TherapeuticMassage/ancient-massage-free-table-shower-grand-opening-818-760-2288/50587668</strong>&quot;  <br />
 [<em>URL is in quotation marks and slightly modified because the address is not an accepted link</em>]</p>
<p>The parlour is listed under a number of different names but I digress....</p>
<p>The place has been troubling me for a number of reasons and so I went back to have another look today.  If you use Google maps to look up the address (11335 Moorpark St, North Hollywood, CA 91602 )  you will see that it is in a retail centre with other businesses right next to it. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lAVZe">http://imgur.com/a/lAVZe</a></p>
<p>So, looking up the massage parlour\'s address I came across this database : <a href="http://datagovus.com/los-angeles-business.php?id=0002804276-0002-8">http://datagovus.com/los-angeles-business.php?id=0002804276-0002-8</a></p>
<p>It included a long list of businesses at the adjoining address of 10333 which I thought strange after looking at the physical location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first business that jumped out at me was <strong><a href="https://www.ca-registry.com/C2749548-smack-ass-productions-inc">Smack Ass Productions inc.</a></strong></p>
<p>Agent is Christine Karasseferian at business address <em>10200 Sepulveda Blvd #140, Mission Hills CA 91345</em>.  
</p>
<p>She is an accountant at <strong>AGI Accounting</strong>  <a href="http://www.agiaccounting.com/">http://www.agiaccounting.com/</a>  . She is also Finance officer at <strong>First Christian News</strong> <a href="http://fccnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-27-01.pdf">http://fccnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-27-01.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Her partner at AGI Accounting is Jyoti Gaur (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyoti-gaur-0194877/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyoti-gaur-0194877/)</a>) According to the Linkedin profile Jyoti 
worked at <a href="http://www.rocket.com/">Aerojet Rocketdyne</a> for 17 years.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a world-recognized aerospace and defense leader that provides propulsion and energetics to the space, missile defense and strategic systems, tactical systems and armaments areas, in support of domestic and international markets.</p>

<p>Also Jyoti also follows this boys\' orphanage in India: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahara_Ramakrishna_Mission_Boys\'_Home_High_School">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahara_Ramakrishna_Mission_Boys\'_Home_High_School</a></p>

<p>Jyoti\'s passion for environmental and sustainability issues led her to Marshall\'s Society and Business Lab.

During the summer of 2010, Jyoti interned at the Deshpande Foundation in India. She created a network for NGOs that works with the HIV/AIDS community by using mobile phone technology in rural India. Her experience was invaluable to her career goal of working for a socially responsible investment fund that focuses on international development and emerging energy projects. Jyoti was selected as a 2011 Clinton-Orfalea Fellow with the <strong>Clinton Global Initiative</strong> in New York.</p>

<p>Another listing for Smack Ass Productions inc. showed a Steve Valentine as President <a href="https://www.productionco.org/smack-ass-productions-inc">https://www.productionco.org/smack-ass-productions-inc</a>.  Now, I don\'t know who this person is, I haven\'t spent much time looking but a quick google search did bring up a character from the series <em>Dexter</em> with the name Steve Valentine <a href="http://dexter.wikia.com/wiki/Steve_Valentine">who was a pedophile that targeted small boys</a>.</p>
<p>There is an actor with that name but I haven\'t checked to see if they are one and the same.  I did have a look at one other company listed at the 10333 address and it seems to be connected to another Hollywood actress.</p>
<p>So, my point is that looking at the location and the odd circumstances, I feel that going through those business addresses listed in this <a href="http://datagovus.com/los-angeles-business.php?id=0002804276-0002-8">document</a> might be interesting.</p>',

           <p>
            IMO, you're right on w/ Ashton Kutcher's seedy connection to PedoGate &amp; Human Trafficking.
A couple of things already known about Kutcher:
           </p>
           <p>
            His ex girlfriend was stabbed to death (by a serial killer) in 2001. Ashton testified that he called her, then went over to her apartment after no response. Her car was in driveway &amp; lights on at her place. Kutcher knocked on door &amp; called out w/ no answer, then he said he looked through window &amp; saw what he thought was red wine pooled on the floor.
He dated Brittany Murphy from 2001-2002. She got into drugs (w/ Kutcher), eating disorder &amp; now looking back, she was MK Ultra (Mind Controlled), IMHO. She died in 2009 under bizarre circumstances.
I lived in LA &amp; went to house parties &amp; clubs w/ friends of mine (a model &amp; actress - both semi-successful). We would often see Kutcher at functions. What I remember most about him, in particular, was his insistence that he was going to be an A Lister. I mean he was into drugs &amp; would sex-up many men/women, but on 4 different occasions he would tell us how famous he would be &amp; willing to do anything to become an A Lister.
He began dating Demi Moore in 2005. Kutcher became a devout Kabbalist after Demi introduced him to Kabbalah (definitely worth digging into further).  Madonna, as well as MANY other celebs are Kabbalists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once Kutcher &amp; Demi got together, we would still see him out A LOT! I'm guessing that we'd see him out without Demi about 1/3 of the time &amp; the other 2/3's w/ Demi &amp; oftentimes her daughters would be out with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what myself &amp; my 3 girlfriends thought/think was the most bizarre was when Kutcher, Demi, &amp; sometimes her girls would go to Lucky Strike bowling alley (all ages hot spot in LA). Ashton would obviously &amp; aggressively hit on MUCH, MUCH younger girls blatantly in front of Moore. It was awkward &amp; pathetic to watch...he would actually leave Lucky Strike w/ YOUNG girls &amp; come back int the bowling alley 30 minutes later. It seemed like Demi only cared if somebody noticed it &amp; pointed it out, which embarrassed her. 1 time in particular, he was really putting the moves on a 15-17 yr old girl (underage to say the least) &amp; Demi looked away for most of it. Then some couple came in &amp; said, hey, it's Demi &amp; Ashton. To which Demi cheekily scolded Kutcher (not in normal, pissed way)...then they gathered up their stuff &amp; changed shoes. Demi went to the counter &amp; Kutcher darted over to this young girl &amp; got her phone # &amp; he scurried out to catch up with Moore.
           </p>
           <p>
            He cheated on Demi w/ string of younger girls, many at same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kutcher &amp; Demi Moore started DNA Foundation in 2009. Once they divorced in 2012, they changed the name to THORN. Both remain w/ THORN, as co-founders, as well as Board of Directors, along w/ Ray Chambers UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Malaria &amp; Jim Pitkow, co-founder of Attributor.

             Thank you very much for  your story.  The background information about Kutcher's insistence that he would be an A lister fits in very much with other stories that I know of with other celebrities who 'made it' and are now known Kabbalists. I had recently begun to suspect that his marriage with Demi was somehow arranged/contrived...and I'm wondering how many Hollywood couples are like this.  Mila's response to the story of him coming out of the Thai massage parlour was interesting I thought..and from what I've recently read about them, I think that's another arrangement.  The whole Hollywood bubble goes much deeper than most of us understand I think.  And I'm really moving into new territory now exploring the whole idea behind the film industry.
            </p>

             Anyway, I have written quite a few posts about THORN and this one in particular is about Ray Chambers :

            Isn't he helping sex trafficking victims? I thought he might be good with his organization or whatever he has. I do recall when he had the trucker hat phase he sported a blue masonic cap weird how I recalled that haha.

            Ashton Kutcher has always had dead shark eyes to me.  I have never been able to watch anything he's been in.  Creeps me the F out, even 10yrs ago, something looked off about him.  I think he was passed around like a joint to all the other men when he did male modeling as a teen.

            Here is a short TMZ article from 2/15/17 about McCain and Kutcher.

             http://archive.is/Nkxrm
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Ashton Kutcher and Sen. John McCain really did hit it off on Capitol Hill ... due to the actor's passion for something other than Hollywood.
            </p>
            <p>
             We got McCain after Kutcher testified about the horrors of human trafficking, but as we told you McCain still snuck in a playful jab at Kutcher's expense as they were closing the Senate hearing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seems there's mutual admiration, because Ashton hung out with McCain afterward for a private tour of the Capitol. The Senator's clearly heard the bromance buzz sparked by his and Ashton's exchange, and based on this clip ... he doesn't mind a bit.

            This stuff is spreading.  People are talking and they know it.  Ashton is being put out there to calm the storm that they are possibly expecting. I believe they think they can head us off at the pass by having actors look like good guys.

             That's one of the reasons I'm looking so much at Kutcher because it's clear to me that he is not what they are trying to portray him as.  Meanwhile that THORN company, partnered with the McCain Institute is working with all the tech companies.  It's clear that the people in charge of all these systems shouldn't be there.  We have to wake up the public to the facade.
