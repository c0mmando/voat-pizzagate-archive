<blockquote>
<p>President Donald Trump’s attorneys made a solid case for preemptively pardoning Julian Assange in a motion to dismiss a WikiLeaks-related lawsuit against the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>In defense of the Trump campaign, the 32-page filing by Michael A. Carvin argues that the publishing of the DNC leak passes both aspects of the Bartnicki First Amendment Test.</p>
<p>The first part of the case law is that a defendant may not be held liable for a disclosure of stolen information if it deals with “a matter of public concern.”</p>
<p>Addressing this portion, Carvin’s filing asserts that there can be “no serious doubt” that the disclosures from WikiLeaks satisfied the “newsworthy” and “public concern” portion of the test.</p>
<p>The motion argues that ‘”punishing truthful publication in the name of privacy’ is always an ‘extraordinary measure’ — doubly so when the publisher did nothing illegal in obtaining the information.”</p>
<p>The second portion of the test requires that the speaker (or publisher) was not “involved” in the theft. Given that WikiLeaks does not steal or hack the documents that are provided to them, and most rational people would agree that all of their leaks have been newsworthy, the Bartnicki First Amendment Test is not only satisfied by the Trump campaign — but also by Assange and his organization.</p>
<p>“They certainly make no effort to show that the Campaign was ‘involved’ in the initial theft of the DNC emails, in effect conceding that the Campaign satisfies the second part of the Bartnicki First Amendment test. The dispositive question is thus whether the disclosure in this case dealt with ‘newsworthy’ and ‘public’ issues. There can be no serious doubt that it did,” the filing reads.</p>
<p>“That ends the case: The disclosure satisfies the First Amendment test.”</p>

            Unfortunately, my suspicion is that he is dead already.  After he went dark last year, nothing made sense after that on Twitter.  WikiLeaks was sourcing HuffPo and WaPo.  I just think a lot of our truthers are overtaken then subverted using technology.  We thought we saw an interview of him, but there were anomalies in the video, and with SnapChat type technology, anyone could be anyone at any time.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s not that I disagree with Trump on this, I just think everything is worse than people realize..

             Agree with everything you said. I personally feel that when they seized him from the Embassy. they flew him back to the states to be tortured to death. That is of course if he is not one of their assets. The entire thing doesn't add up really.

              I agree he coulda been CIA or whatever from the beginning.  Kinda like Snowden.  They could have fabricated the entire story just to get the masses to accept and shrug at the complete invasion of our privacy.

              F’ing sucks around here.  I’m not even so mad at the elite anymore.  What frustrates me to no end is the amount of people who are complicit to it all.

             While much attention has been focused on Trump’s access to the nuclear launch codes and the President’s Daily Brief—the classified intelligence report delivered inside a locked briefcase each morning to the Oval Office—those represent only a tiny sliver of the massive top-secret universe that Trump personally will suddenly be privy to. He will have the ability to see inside the most sensitive and covert programs run by the United States and its allies around the world; he will have access to surveillance tools, covert payrolls and personal secrets about foreign leaders. He will know about blacked-out special forces raids and UFO-like spy planes, the next-generation cyberattacks that would come in the opening minutes of a new war, and the dozens of secret classified procedures and laws written down by his presidential predecessors.

             Ya... for all the classified information he may be privy to, I’m sure there are 10 more special access programs for each black op that he’ll never even know exist.  And of course, those are the ones that probably actually matter.

              <p>
               One of the relatively new powers of the presidency is the ability to sign off on strikes from Predator and Reaper drones run by the CIA and the Pentagon. While political assassination is forbidden by Executive Order 12333, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush have enjoyed wide latitude in designating suspected terrorists for lethal strikes in areas like Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan. The exact process for such “kinetic” attacks, never publicly revealed in depth and not beholden to any judicial oversight, will be explained carefully to the new president. We’ll never know who exactly will be named to the new administration’s “kill list,” and we may never know what happens to them. But Trump will: After such attacks, the president and vice president are also among the select group of government officials who can, if they choose, watch the high-tech videos of the drone strikes themselves. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney regularly watched such “kill videos” during their morning intelligence briefings. As president, Trump will also have sway over the opaque process itself, so he could well tweak or expand the lethal authorities of the commander in chief without any public disclosure that the rules have changed.

              It's stunning to think of the Executive power nowadays and to think that arewesure or anyone would think that HRC would not designate Assange a "terrorist" and then drone him is ridiculous. Everybody seeks the broadest interpretation of the  rules (life ain't fair and it's tough) and one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. Sorry for the rant.

               You’re right Bopper. He has a need to feel powerful so he patrols Voat and tries to find anything he can to pick at. I’m used to it. He does it daily. He has no personality. It’s almost like he’s a bot.

            Giving this the "Share!" flair. Like Trump's tweets on Iran, this is the sign of a sea change -- the War on Whistleblowers is coming to an end. I think we can expect many great leaks in the future. This also implicitly recognizes Assange as a journalist/publisher, which is the reverse of what Obama, Clinton and their international globetard cronies have been pushing. Bye bye MSM!

             As usual, you but in to promote any Trump vs the Deep State thread, while you guys delete threads on the Catholic church and CroWn murdering 1000's of children in Canada. You can be read with braille. The only thing this forum needs from you is your absence.

             I think this is part of why anti-trumpers where leaking so much when trump first took office, he couldn't simultaneously stop the war vs whistle blowers, while also clamping down on people leaking partial politicized items without context to hurt the presidency.

            WikiLeaks is one of the only reliable news sources left in this country - no wonder the federal government wants to eliminate Assange and silence or control WikiLeaks. Assange is a hero regardless of any criticism that may have become attached to him.

             Your statement is so absurd that my curiosity lead me to your comment history.
             <br/>
             Where I learned that if Denial was a nation state, the citizens would attempt to crown you as Emperor.
             <br/>
             But you'd deny that position too, because you don't believe yourself to be a real person.

               I remember the article.   It was fake news source quoting an anonymous source   There's no evidence she said this.  US policy does not allow drones in a location where regular law enforcement could suffice.  Assange has never been in danger of being droned by the US.

              When will people realize that they can try to sue the pants off him but "he has broken every law in the United States"  just does not cut it.  He was not born here.  End of Story.  People never look into things.  They just believe the Talking Heads of Their Beloved Parties.  Yuck.
