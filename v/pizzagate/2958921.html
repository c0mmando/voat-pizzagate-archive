<p>Prostitution rings are providing young boys to male customers in Washington and are reportedly selling information about their clients\' sexual preferences to foreign intelligence services, a private investigator testified yesterday.</p>
<p>The investigator, Dale Smith, who works for the New York State Senate\'s Select Committee on Crime, said he had learned that British, Israeli and Soviet agents had bought information from several call services in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith appeared before the committee at the opening in New York City of a two-day hearing on prostitution among young males and on pornography.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith said that an accountant for five call services had told him about the sale of information to foreign agents. He refused to elaborate on the allegations when questioned by reporters, but the committee counsel, Jeremiah McKenna, said that the information concerned \'\'government officials.\'\' He declined to be more specific. Profit in Information</p>
<p>\'\'They\'re making more money selling information than on the prostitution itself,\'\' Mr. McKenna said. Allegations of homosexual sex and drug use on Capitol Hill among Congressmen, pages and other employees have circulated in Washington recently.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith also said that \'\'call service operations in Washington have some connection with organized crime in New York.\'\' He described how male prostitutes between the ages of 13 and 16 were shuttled between the cities, and were paid from $50 to $250, with younger boys commanding the most.</p>
<p>Earlier, a Washington detective testified that she had uncovered a six-city prostitution network that used 12-year-old boys and allowed customers to pay for sex with credit cards.</p>
<p>The cities involved are Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans, New York, Washington and Houston, said the detective, Anne Fisher of the Washington Metropolitan Police.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'\'You could call a number in Houston from Washington and have a young boy brought to your room in Washington,\'\' the detective said.</p>

            Greg Bucceroni was a young prostitute based primarily out Philadelphia during this time frame.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has a number of highly enlightening video interviews online touching upon Sandusky, organized crime and wealthy pedophiles regularly engaging with him and his peers.
           </p>
           <p>
            When he was drafted into helping distribute snuff films, he broke away from all of this.

             YET AGAIN.  Maybe I read about Ed Savitz in the past here on PG, if so, I thankfully had forgotten the details. This is the shit progressive Democrats and libtards are enabling and worse, and digusting hypocrite rhinos are covering up.  Deepstate is creating hell on earth.

              I think it is great you are spending the time researching on this and sharing on Voat.
             </p>
             <p>
              To get a glimpse on how far reaching this goes, you may want to see how prosecutor Ray Gricar investigated Sandusky years before the spotlight shone on Sandusky's activities. Gricar dropped the case despite clear evidence of wrongdoing.
             </p>
             <p>
              A few years later, Gricar himself mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is most probably a tie in to all this with former prosecutor and Pennsylvania governor Fast Eddie Rendell.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fast Eddie caused an international brouhaha when he rushed to Haiti after the earthquake and "rescued" several supposed orphans.

               Ed Rendell from Penn. used to be on cable tv news all the time representing democrats. Same for Joe Biden...for years he was on  political programs every Sunday morning .... The media attn. is a big red flag for me. Don't think you get on those shows unless you have the clinton stamp of approval/ pedophilia friendly. Close knit group.

             Thank you.  I'm hoping it will add to some info I uncovered while looking into my last
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2951343">
              post
             </a>
             .  I've been trying to figure out how to approach it.  While researching the convicted murderer Michael Alig after submitting it, I found one article that claims there was much more to the case then what is generally available.  Claims of sexual mutilation, possible grisly premeditation (foreshadowing in a birthday party promo poster BLOODFEAST), possible occult related factors (the other murderer 'Freeze' was heavy into occult, Alig allegedly dabbled in it), speculation of some cannibalism:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <em>
               As Michael had already been revealed to be a pedophile Ecstasy and heroin addict who drank his own urine at parties, a new question had to be posed; ‘had Michael and/or Freeze cannibalized Angel’s body?’
              </em>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Also the death of two people who likely knew more than they could/would tell before one died suddenly, and the other committed suicide.  Michael Alig was involved with Peter Gatien and his chain of nightclubs. and a lot of mafia backstory in the article.  Also some backstory to the clubs involves Israelis smuggling ecstasy for the party goers at the famous nightclub scenes. I came across a video, the swiss born queen of it (like the Club Kids' house mother) came from London, and with celebutante flippancy she gushed about herself on in the first minutes on the Geraldo show in 1990, about creating the club scene in NYC (she found the existing nightlife soo dull. (a young Michael Alig and up and coming RuPaul were on the show too) and of all things she mentioned, she said that adding muslim men was an element to her parties.  Following Q as I have been I thought what the heck?  And get this, she also hosted weekly? parties at the Standard Hotel in 2018 I believe and had huge parties prior to then.
            </p>
            <p>
             All told there are several

             </a>
             , I can't describe anymore now but  to tie back to my post of the photo shoot of Desmond the Amazing at the art gallery. It occurred to me that the creepy artwork included a torso with a head, a skull and what could be interpreted as angel wings.  The victim known as 'Angel' wore angel wings as part of his drag, he was dismembered.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before Michael Alig told one person he murdered Angel he brought 3 of his...

              favorite movies, which he and Rachel watched during his visit. One was ‘Rosemary’s Baby,’ the 1968 film about a group of Devil worshippers in New York City. Also in Alig’s possession were his favorites "Seven," about a psycho who dismembers a drug dealer, and "Angel Heart," the Mickey Rourke thriller about the Occult and murder in New York and New Orleans.
             </p>
             <p>
              '...Rachel then noted that her friend Michael was a practical joker and that she wasn’t convinced he was telling the truth. The speed with which Rachel downed her next drink, and then another, convinced me that she believed Michael had in fact murdered Angel.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Now
             <em>
              that
             </em>
             is some backstory to the funny little ex con that 11 year old (autistic spectrum) Drag Kid Desmond Napoles is hanging out with thanks to his mother.  And when he says his greatest fear is being murdered by a serial killer, she shucks it off, and death isn't a big deal anyway, lights out.  But global warming...she agrees, oooh that's very scary!
            </p>
            <p>
             What I find scary is the thought that something like a lucrative sale of blackmail info over child sex rings, ordered right to your hotel room, may have given some ideas to organized crime on going all out for the future of drug trafficking, child trafficking, and to really get more info to sell, push a new wave of young narcissistic clubbing performance artists, to entertain and let the world know that anything goes!  And now we have drag kids, and pedos are taking another bite at the apple, ready to convince everyone that they deserve to join the gay rights movement.

              Interesting because I'm currently looking into the people surrounding Desmond is Amazing and I believe there are connections with the United Nations and also a New Age guru Dr. Donny Epstein.  He's into something called Epienergetics

             <p>
              I'm still trying to work out if he's related to Jeffrey Epstein somehow. There's very little background information.

               Epigenetics is very interesting and may well connect to your other post about Lupron. Epigenetics is the study of how environmental factors such as obesity, starvation, or depression in grandparents or parents cause genetic changes in children or grandchildren. One could imagine women given Lupron for IVF might be more likely to have kids and grandkids with epigentic sex hormone issues (which could then be exacerbated by adding estrogens to the food supply or failing to remove them from the water supply).

               I agree, some of the people surrounding Desmond Napoles are suspect in the bigger picture.  I almost hate bringing up his name, not wanting to associate him with Michael Alig, but Desmond's mom is to blame for that.  At any rate Michael Alig is a key lead in researching the pedo related organized crime cabal imo, as well as the Club Kid origins...
              </p>
              <p>
               Consider this:

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                ...after being released in 2014, 52-year-old Alig has stepped back into the New York City nightlife, hosting a weekly party called Outrage on the Lower East Side with fellow former Club Kid and DJ Keoki. He says he tries not to read negative reaction online about his re-emergence on the scene, and the weekly party actually turned out to be rather fortuitous – landing him a free four-bedroom loft in Paterson, New Jersey.
               </p>
               <p>
                ‘One night at Outrage, this man approaches me; it turns out that he’s a multi-billionaire,’ Alig tells DailyMail.com. ‘I don’t know how this happens in my life, but I’ve had a series of very rich, white, heterosexual men – kind of father figures – come in and just kind of take care of me, for some reason.
               </p>
               <p>
                ‘It must be something in my DNA, in my personality, that I’m seeking these people out, because I never really had a father … so that must be what it is, because it’s too much of a coincidence, because it’s like the fifth one in my life,’ he says. ‘But he came up to me, and Party Monster is his favorite movie, and his wife’s, too.’
               </p>
               <p>
                This businessman, Alig says, owns property in Paterson and is converting many warehouses into lofts.
               </p>
               <p>
                ‘He offered me a beautiful four-bedroom, 20-foot ceiling loft, which is where I’m living now for free, if I would move here and kind of promote the town as like an artist enclave and invite my artist friends to come here and maybe live here,’ Alig tells DailyMail.com. ‘And create like a community of creative people that will kind of … be a counter-effect to the ghetto-type of danger element to Paterson. So that’s kind of what I’m doing … kind of like a spokesperson for Paterson.’

                The Agony Of Ecstasy:The Fall Of Sammy Gravano And Peter Gatien

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Mapplethorpe was a rising star in Manhattan’s hot art scene. Along the way, Mappelthorpe descended into a subculture of New York nightlife which dealt with drugs, sado-masochistic sex rituals, and involvement in the Occult. Already a denizen of this scene was an art dealer named Andrew Crispo, who found a lucrative business in procuring art objects for rich and/or famous clients worldwide.
               </p>
               <p>
                ...In late 1983 Peter Gatien opened The Limelight in New York City. This was actually the third incarnation of Gatien’s club by this name, the prior two having been hits in Florida and Georgia. The setting for the nightclub was an abandoned Episcopal Church in the heart of Chelsea, home to many of Manhattans artists, models, gays, and drug dealers. The theme of the club was ‘post-Disco’ decadence, with a deliberate sacrilegious scorn and disdain for the religious symbols that flanked the walls and stained glass windows of the former house of worship.
               </p>
               <p>
                ...On February 22, 1985, Rothbell-Mista Fred welcomed celebrity art dealer Andrew Crispo and two of his associates into the VIP room at the Limelight. Crispo and his associates repeatedly tried to convince Fred to join them in a ‘party’ some distance away. Rothbell-Mista politely refused, as there were several other VIPs on hand at the Limelight that night.
               </p>
               <p>
                Crispo’s young employee Bernard LeGeros would later claim that Crispo was trying to lure Fred to a house upstate where he was to be murdered. Failing that, Crispo and LeGeros left the Limelight and headed downtown, where they hooked up with a young model from Sweden, Eigel Vesti. The three then drove to Rockland County, where Vesti had his face covered with a leather S&amp;M mask. Vesti was tortued and sexually assaulted for a lengthy period of time and then shot to death with a rifle. The body was then thrown into a ditch and set on fire with gasoline. By the time authorities found the body, all that was left was the flesh on Vesti’s face, protected by the leather ‘Death Mask.’
               </p>
               <p>
                ...The Limelight received a lot of negative publicity as the investigation into the murder of Eigel Vesti revealed the earlier plot at Peter Gatien’s club. Partly as a result of this event, the nightclub began to lose its popularity. As the decade was coming to an end, Peter Gatien knew personnel changes were in order if his clubs the Limelight and the Tunnel were going to regain their former stature. Gatien decided to hire two young men as party promoters, the ‘two Michaels;’ ‘Lord Michael’ Caruso, a pathological criminal and con artist who hailed from Brooklyn, and Michael Alig, a slight, effeminate kid from the Midwest.

               Interesting, yet another another new age guru.  Sounds like hypnosis and cultish group think techniques in play, (recall multiple level marketing seminars too), in addition to the demonic angle., targeting people 'seekers'?  Lukewarm or charismatic Christians can be a ripe target audience, and new agers of course.

                I stayed in the room while Donny worked on the other 10 – 12 people left. Everyone freely gave themselves to him and their bodies where contorting, some passed out at the end, some uncontrollably laughed and some cried and sobbed while they were laying down. This whole experience did not feel spiritually right.

                I decided to look up Donny Epstein again and I started watching videos on gurus and yogis who were executing these contortion practices on people and I freaked out when I discovered that the origins of all of this comes from demonic occult practices.

               Some of the descriptions reminded me of the Podesta sculpture hanging in his house.  Is there an occult connection to that particular contortion? (just curious).

               Yes, it's a slippery slope and people don't realize what the potential consequences to giving over their ability to reason to 'gurus' or (MKULTRA traps for that matter) whether promoted as secular, counter-culture or cult.
