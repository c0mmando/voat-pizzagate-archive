            After nearly a year of undercover operations, the Australian police dismantled a vast platform of child pornography on the dark web. But for this, the investigators administered the site and even supplied it with content.
           </p>
           <p>
            To identify a pedophile network, the Australian police took control of a child pornography site between October 2016 and September 2017. The police involvement was highlighted by the  Norwegian newspaper VG , after a long and tedious investigation published on October 7, in partnership with the British newspaper  The Guardian .
           </p>
           <p>
            In the article, Argos, a Queensland police department dedicated to combating child pornography on-line, has administered the Childs Play Forum, which gathered hundreds of pedophiles and posted pedophile images.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We do not create these sites. We do not want them to exist, "said Jon Rouse, one of the policemen in the working group interviewed by  VG  , about the infiltration of what some consider to be one of the most important forums child pornography of the dark web . And to explain: "When we find them, we infiltrate them and we go as high as possible in the administration structure [of the site] in order to destroy it."
           </p>
           <p>
            In October 2016, Argos took control of the site after arresting its founder, a Canadian by the name of Benjamin Faulkner and his American "partner", Patrick Faulte. The latter gave the investigators the identifiers which then allowed the latter to control the site. But, in order not to compromise their coverage, Queensland police officers regularly posted pedophile images. In Australia, the law allows law enforcement agencies to commit certain illegal acts in order to carry out their investigations. Once controlled by Australian police, the site thrived: in 2017, the number of pedophile users doubled.
           </p>
           <p>
            In less than a year, despite the questionable nature of the method, tens of thousands of consumers of pedophile images have been identified. But more importantly, the police were able to unmask some 100 producers of pornographic content. The mission accomplished, the site was dismantled on September 13th. A list of 900 likely to be prosecuted was passed on to other police forces around the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            The child pornography website Childs Play appeared in April 2016 on the dark web , part of the internet which benefits from anonymity through inter alia the scrambling of IP addresses.
