<p>Ruskin said that among the causes mentioned for the surge of sealed indictments, he believes it’s more plausible they are related to human trafficking. Even his work investigating the mafia didn’t generate anywhere near as many sealed indictments as those currently pending; but with a human trafficking network, he said, there would be multiple groups operating in multiple districts—which fits the profile.</p>
<p>This would also fall in line with recent actions of President Donald Trump, who on Dec. 21, 2017, signed an executive order declaring a national emergency over human rights abuses and corruption; and who declared January 2018 as “National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.”</p>
<p>Ruskin said, “It would be consistent with the large number of sealed indictments, because it is a problem that’s nationwide. If there was a national initiative involving the justice department and the FBI and ICE, let’s say, focused on that issue, then that would be a crime problem that would be bi-coastal and would involve multiple districts.”</p>

            They could be for human trafficking and or gang members.  Remember that many MS 13 members do horrible things like SRA and whatever it takes to rake in the money.  This large group of Indictments could be a mix.  Either way I hope it involves the Trafficking of Children because Heads Need To Roll.

            A few weeks before Christmas one local DC new station, WTOP, kept running blurbs that the sealed indictments were for local gang members.  It was very fishy.  They did the same thing for CP.  They ran blurbs for three days that a local pizza shop was maligned and to go out and support it. This station has real news but also seems to be a propaganda machine.  The days following these statements there was never any follow up about gang shake downs.  This was a huge diversion tactic I don't think many knew about.
