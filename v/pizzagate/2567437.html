<p>‘Roseanne’ Canceled by ABC After Roseanne Barr’s ‘Repugnant’ Comments, Network President Says</p>
<p>&quot;Roseanne\'s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,&quot; ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey said in a statement to TheWrap on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;muslim brotherhood &amp; planet of the apes had a baby=vj,&quot; Barr said earlier on Tuesday in response to a Twitter thread about Jarrett, a former adviser to Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Barr apologized before ABC\'s statement on Tuesday, saying that her statement suggesting that former Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett is a product of the Muslim Brotherhood and the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; was a &quot;joke&quot; that was &quot;in bad taste.</p>

<p>Saw this tweet today. It might be a good one to keep tucked away and use because it brings up an uncomfortable truth: </p>

<p>Hollywood punished Roseanne for a tweet faster than they punished Woody Allen, Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey for being sexual predators.</p>

<p>Here\'s another tweet with a spot on take of what happened. There are some mighty good thinkers out there: </p>

<p>This Rosanne thing was always a proxy for Pres Trump. They brought the show back so they could inevitably cancel the show when she said something they didn’t like. They can’t beat Trump so this is a symbolic show of force. Rosanne was always going to end this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup. </p>
<h1>ALWAYS GOING TO END THIS WAY</h1>
<p>That was the plan. Why? Because they get to deactivate media support for Trump which means he now has no starpower support on TV and MAGA has no starpower support for the midterm elections. It also punishes, brands, and DEFUNDS Roseanne in retaliation for her speaking out. While she was inactive and collecting checks, it was fine. But she chose to actually speak out and up and now ... no more of those nice checks pouring in. </p>

            The game is rigged, fellow anons. The enemy owns Hollywood and all the media, including twitter. They decide what is permissible to say or not in our society. If you don't like the status quo, bring on the day of the rope and change it. Otherwise keep posting your messages of shock on enemy media and watch as not only nothing changes for the better, but things get steadily worse. It's not being hopeless to say things will get worse. It's reality. Also it's reality that this cancer will never go away on its own and you know it. A general uprising against the entire system will be required nation wide. Are you ready to do something?

            <p>
             If you look at the video of the presidential election night, you'll see that Clinton's team was STUNNED ... SHOCKED. Trump wasn't supposed to win. They had everything stacked against him, and the miracle happened.

             Hey, what can I say?
            </p>
            <p>
             I understand. I really didn't/don't trust her either. It goes back to that show she had. I spotted something in it and I always wondered why it was there .... why no one noticed it.
            </p>

             I was going to tweet and ask her about it, but I don't have a pic of it. I just remember staring at it and getting more and more creeped out.

            <p>
             But that's why I don't trust her.

            I shared this in an earlier Roseanne thread, but shared it in a few other places too. I was also hoping she was legitimately red pilled, but then I saw this video of her for

            where in the 0:28 mark, you can see her covering her eye and flashing her hand, (you can see the screenshot here:

            ) and it made me question the QAnon posts and whether or not it's all a big See Eye A psyop since Trump has been chummy with her. I sincerely hope he's been setting up the big reveal on all the pedovores and this isn't just a big scheme to keep track of who's in the know about PG. Even the Voat baphomet logo and lack of search bar makes me question this whole site, despite how huge of a resource it's been...

              I brought him up bc Roseanne mentioned it in her tweet which you can see in the OP. And his name pops up a lot in here bc of the intertwined messages connected PG and I've been following Q posts on Twitter. I hope he's real, but with all the twists and turns in the media, it's hard to tell who's for real and who isn't.

            Their fondest desire would be to turn this into a food fight inside a shit storm and pull everyone's attention
            <strong>
             away from the facts
            </strong>
            .  Apart from direct proven lies and projection, it is all they have.  Step aside with a polite smile, and continue to put one foot in front of the other.  Smoke and mirrors and emotion won't win the day on this one.
            <strong>
             Facts will
            </strong>
            .  Too many people already know too much.

             Word up. This thing never depended on Roseanne’s help. We’ll do fine without her. Not the first crazy thing that’s happened since this started. Won’t be the last.

             You're right. If it's making something out of nothing, they've got that down pat. However, if it's actually explaining their bizarre, illegal actions, they no can do.

             False narratives and cries of racism seem to be it.

              I agree with huhWHAT. This post somehow brought out a lot of unifying/clarifying comments. The trash talkers came out too, but there’s plenty of reasonable people reading here to handout downvotes.

            I think that Roseanne has disassociative identity disorder ( multiple personality disorder).  That sort of explains the way she flip flops back and forth about certain issues. And I also think that she just likes to irritate and piss off certain people. She really just doesn't give a fuck. She says and does whatever she wants.

             I tend to agree. She doesn't. She was really trying to stay in control, but you can imagine the pressure she's under. I know a couple of days ago she was talking to others on not going off and just blocking all the haters, so she was really getting hammered.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was most likely a concerted effort. They know she's volatile and pushed the right buttons.

            What a joke.  They have hijacked another white red piller.  They are using her to THEIR best benefit.  They dirtied her.  I don't know if she is one of them or not but this publicity for our case is NOT GOOD.   Depending on Idols is Never Good.   They made her look and sound like KOOK. Since she has been speaking out for Trump and Pizzagate now we look like?  KOOKS.

             She is in on it. It was a psyop, just like Weinstein is and just like all probes are. Probes are theater, as if they are scrutinizing each other. Any child charges against Weinstein? Nope. NXIVM? Nope. PG? Nope. Any charges of anything against the Clintons? Nope. Bushes? Nope. Any coming? Nope. Stop following celebrities and hoping they represent us.

             I have been feeling all along this was a setup.  She may be in on it too. When ABC was willing to put this show on, I believed it was to build her up as a conspiracist, along with all who believed in her and Trump. Of course if you saw any of the episodes they painted all Trump supporters as conspiracist, racist, etc.

              ABC has been identified as CIA controlled I believe the producer or someone connected with the show is married to Podesta's daughter.  Fancy that.  Yeah, well ABC is also of the left so I don't thin they would be helping anyone that is supporting Trump and his MAGA Campaign.  You are so right.  I agree.

               I remember something about Podesta's daughter being married to an executive too. Just like Podesta and Colbert are good friends. They are all connected so closely. We have seen these webs many times. I would really be surprised if Rosanne wasn't in on it.

              ABC’s entertainment president, Channing Dungey, said in a statement that “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.”

              I think we should file that quote away. Might be useful for pizzagaters later.....
as in "Satanic ritual abuse of children is abhorrent, repugnant, and inconsistent with our values.”
LET'S HIJACK THIS PHRASE AND USE IT AGAINST THEM!

               Yes, everyone take a screenshot of the tweet and save it. Really going to be excellent to have a shitstorm of memes featuring that tweet when the next PedoWood perv puts their foot in it.

              This is true.  Not going to make me stop.  Just saying people need to watch out who they get behind.  They will use us and abuse us whenever they can.  They really pulled a fast one and now I am really convinced She Is Still MK Ultra.

               I use social media and you would be surprised what comes hurtling out of me sometimes. Collectively, the insults sometimes get to you. But leaders and those in authority should ALWAYS set the example. She was definitely wrong there.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was always on the fence with her. I don't know why. I was watching what she was doing and saying ... I still don't know, but it seems absurd that she revived her show only to do this. She could have done it without having all those people lose their jobs. I think it's just her. She's always called it like she sees it and I think that side took over. I'm not talking alter ego, I think she was pissed.

                I think it has gotten to the point where we are having to sit on the fence with so many.  Well either she had to get it all of her chest or she is being manipulated.   Hard to tell anymore.

                 I guess I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt because I don't know beyond a moral certainty that she actually meant to harm anyone. But the conduct will now give the crazies on the left the opportunity to go after Trump for even congratulating her on the success of the program.

                  Yes, we have no way of knowing the truth.  Sad.  But if she really wanted to help she picked  a strange way of showing it.  She's done imo.

                      Uncle Joe loves to go to Rehoboth in Delaware.  His fave ice cream place is there and There is a lot of Gay Life on the Boardwalk there:)   I often wonder if he plans on running why he has never tried to sue for all the pedo stuff being said.  Not a peep.  Shh.

            Are we being GASLIGHTED?
Donald Trump has been insulting Roseanne for years. She repays the compliments. Right up to the 2016 campaign they were going at it. Has she suddenly changed her spots? Did she really flip? I think her seemingly off the cuff insult was carefully chosen. Her show set up the Trumpsters to take the fall. GUILT BY ASSOCIATION.

After Fox News anchor and debate moderator Megyn Kelly noted that the real estate mogul had “called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,” he interjected “Only Rosie O’Donnell.”
It’s far from the first time Trump and O’Donnell have gone head-to-head, and the outspoken pair have been embroiled in an all out war for years."

              OOPS! My bad!
Somehow the two seem very similar.
Roseanne's insult was on the same lines as Trump's. Not a mistake?
I still think this incident was premeditated. I never trusted Roseanne either.
The outcome is still the same.....

                That's true. She may be trying to come out of the grip of her handlers and caved.

                 More and more it sounds like an error in judgment based on her belief that Jarret was white. As it turns out Jarret is of Iranian descent (it's what was on her bio), along with using America's Freedom of Religion against itself.

            The problem is her tweet was racist, and makes anyone who supported her pizzagate comments look bad, to people of color. We need everybody to fight for these kids, worldwide together otherwise there won't be a change. I am very disappointed, sadly I can't say I wasn't warned by other Goats.

              The MSM has a bigger voice then us, and this 1 social media platform is catering to millions of sheep, and read the captions. It certainly looks that way whether intended or not.

             Niggers don't give a shit about white children. If they had their way, white children would probably be going through this shit on a much more industrial scale, and probably way worse.

             The only people who give a damn about white children are... whites. Imagine that.

                  You should probably get know some people while your there because people of all races do care. Maybe not that Pedo evil bitch Jarrett, but others do.

             Look, I'm not going to lie and say that I'm unaware of the historical background of referring to members of a certain community to primates.

            <p>
             However, I've always thought of Planet of the Apes as a political commentary. It's making a point of a particular type of politician/political party. If we take the characteristics as articulated in the movie, it closely aligns with her political views/stances.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Roseanne should have held back on saying it. And, no, it doesn't make us all look bad. Stop being a apologist. If the left can continually print lies, distortions, heckle a mother sharing a pic of her child, we don't have anything to be ashamed about.

              You are the one telling people she is fighting for us, and one of us. You promote that just like with Trump. Then she makes you look bad by being a simpleton, a bigot and her opinions are discounted by the sheeple. That is why you want us to follow these elites and celebrities. You are the biggest fraud in this sub, and that is saying a lot.

                Yes, your friend Flynn.  I have prayed for him and urge others to do the same.  This whole thing makes us look bad, aside from the fact that she went way overboard.  I am thinking she used the Pizzagate Community.  Shame on her.

            I will not comment on Rosanne but from Wikipedia you can learn that Valerie Jarrett was born overseas and her parents were public health research doctors who lived in Iran (they probably were fans of the culture, possibly Muslim sympathetic as they worked in the poor villages where Islam was stronger) and the basis of their practice was studying malnourishment related diseases in children. I can't remember which non-profit they worked for but it was definitely some globalist stuff, in the 50s so kind of cutting edge or early adopters of the "global health" field which is intrinsically linked to both overpopulation and human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no idea if any sexual abuse took part in her parents studies in rural Iran in the 1950s, but it is pretty clear Valarie Jarrett is some kind of super-connected (possibly gay or Satanist) globalist when you look at the following facts...
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Jarrett introduced Barack to Michelle
2) Jarrett helped get both Barack and Michelle multiple jobs.
3) she is reportedly Obama's closest friend, advisor, and confidant. It is possible he is closer to Jarrett than Michelle, but I do not know for sure.

             NEW YORK – The recently discovered 1979 newspaper article by Vernon Jarrett – the father-in-law of senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, opens a new dimension to understanding Obama’s youth, as Vernon Jarrett was a close friend of Obama’s Communist Party-activist mentor, Frank Marshall Davis.

             Jarrett was born in Iran and lives in Zero's basement.  Literally.  She moved in with him.  And don't forget the freaky photo of what appears to be her and JP butt naked, painted in Day-Glo, at some freakshow of a party.

             Good stuff ... and really ... Roseanne probably knows a hell of a lot more dirt on this bitch than we do. That also probably played a part in what she tweeted. I mean, if you know someone is scum, it's really hard to play the game and not go for the jugular.

             Jarrett is filthy Satanic scum. With what she's done, her demanding an apology is a travesty. She should be apologizing to us on her way to Gitmo.

              I don't know much about Jarrett herself, more what I've read about her parents from her biography, so I'm sure it leaves out all the juicy details. I do know that an unbiased person looking at her career and then how she boosted the Obama's careers (from very early on) it isn't very hard to say "this person must be super connected", whether or not said person believes in things like the Illuminati or New World Order.
             </p>
             <p>
              IMO Valerie Jarrett makes Condi Rice (who worked for Bush 43rd) look like a nobody. I have also heard rumors that Jarrett gets some kind of special security detail, unprecedented for an advisor, which further backs up the claims (or speculation) that she is the shadowy NWO puppet master of Obama. His handler, so to speak.

Yeah, she makes sure to say he looks like a cross of planet of the apes and you act as if its cool. Sheeple see her as a "conspiracy theorist", cough cough, then she sells herslef as some alt-right biggot. You know, the phony manufactured movement that is supposed to represent...us.

                There is no left vs right. They all work for the Rothschild banking cartel. You guys continue to sell the phony left/right paradigm. Same bozos with all the Trump is our hero bullshit. Trump is a Rothschild crony and you make sure to never address this.  Zero arrest, zero exposure to the sheeple. We are winning!

            Rosanne's situation is a
            <strong>
             prime example
            </strong>
            of why we should NEVER conflate racist or bigoted rhetoric with our prime goal of outing and ousting sex traffickers and abusers of power &amp; positions of authority -- while also raising public awareness to these grave issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rosanne stuck her foot in her mouth, and lost her platform. Verify your facts before spouting off in public, and for the love of god -- Leave your racial/religious bias at home and stick to facts and sourced public information. There are amazing and abhorrent people in EVERY race and religion. Don't take three steps forward, only to take several back. Don't sink to that level. Fight hate, violence, and the secrecy surrounding it with truth and light... not further darkness.

             I'm someone who agrees with lots of the racist or anti-semetic commentary (as long as it is helpful) and I agree that in the context of human trafficking we should leave all the racism and anything bad out of it because unfortunately most people (brainwashed) just shut down to a new idea if they associate it with racism or anti-Semitism.

             Have to agree with this. She should not have used that joke. They can call us anything they fucking want, but we have to tow the line. Of course, the fact that Dubya was always compared to an ape makes no difference. If it can be perceived, twisted, or otherwise used, don't tweet it. It never matters what they call us. Doesn't matter that they openly call for assassination, somehow the rules don't apply.
            </p>
            <p>
             Planet of the Apes is a conundrum/mixed bag of tricks. It's a POLITICAL movie so it sort of is on target to make a political joke about.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not going along with all that shiny bauble new age crap you're spewing. Obviously, no one --- including the editor of the NYT -- checked their facts before using  2014 picture to slur our POTUS with being a child trafficker. So where's the fallout from that? Did the editor lose his job? Stop pontificating nonsense, but your point about laying anything that can be perceived as racists, yup ... we should do that. Not only is it right, we want the Great Awakening to include all good people. And like you said, they come in all shapes, sizes, religions, and colors.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bottom line: She should have hired someone to handle social media so she wouldn't get caught up in this nonsense. Hopefully FOX will pick the show up. It belonged on FOX anyway.

              I'm sure the execs at Fox are keeping close watch on this whole situation. They would snatch her show up in a heartbeat but they also don't want public backlash to fall on them.

              Dumb comment.
              <em>
               Certain users
              </em>
              who do this should be (and are) chastised by the community. This is/ should be a place of research, combing the muck for answers. Those who bring racial/religious bias into the fray only dilute the research and allow those looking from the outside a chance to discredit the community as a whole -- good research and horrible/irrelevant racist comments alike. I'm not going to disagree that the racist shills do exist, they most certainly do... which is a sad and tragic testament to basic human tribal thinking, and to the thoughtless grasps from mouthbreathers who don't contribute to productive discourse.
             </p>
             <p>
              TL;DR -- the internet contains dark material from a minority of users, but that doesn't mean that the internet as a whole is irrelevant as its worst bits. Same goes for the Voat community, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Gab, etc... Good and bad on all accounts.

             This was the vehicle to use ... the crack in her armor. I believe her son had deleted some tweets previously. Followers were questioning what happened, and she explained he was watching out for her. I didn't read the tweets they were referring to, but she was getting a little too real. She had a lot of haters goading her ... shit happens.
