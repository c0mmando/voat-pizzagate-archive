<p>Mexican journalist Lydia Cacho took on elite pedophiles in her country and was threatened, kidnapped, raped, and is harassed to this day but somehow alive. She testified against at least two of them, leaving one with 13 years in prison and the other with over a hundred. </p>
<p>Some important pizzagate-relevant parts: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mexico’s Anti-Drug Czar tried to dissuade Lydia Cacho from going ahead with her book: ‘Your book has evidence that can make an important part of the federal government crumble,’ he warned. ‘This is an international human trafficking network, Ms. Cacho.’ She told him she had made a promise to the children, and would not back down. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Lydia Cacho’s work, we can see two markets exist for the rape of girl-children – one for Pedo Elites and the other for men in general. Both markets are sponsored by syndicates of organized crime. 
For the market for Pedo Elites, where <strong>men from society’s highest echelons rape, trade, gift, and/or sell children to men of like-rank,</strong> the syndicates provide stealth communications and computer-networking technology, as was used, for example, by Succar Kuri’s wife to send endless pedo-pornography to Las Vegas. Details of the terms between the Pedo Elites and the syndicates beyond these arrangements, however, remain obscured. Pedo Elites may in fact be members of the syndicates, which makes it hard to know if their primary interest is raping children, uber-male class-bonding through the “butchering” of a penniless female child, who, as Succar Kuri said, “has no chance,” or if, as in Cancun’s network, it is always also a business, always a franchise of organized crime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly these men are protected and veiled. <strong>Their veiling is institutionalized and paid-for</strong>, often paid-for by the children themselves, who are handed out like gold coins, offered up for rape to politicians, immigration officials, Interpol agents, hoteliers, reporters, bankers, judges, cops, etc. To lift the veil to try to answer these questions, is, – as Lydia Cacho discovered, – life-threatening. But because men’s behavior is everywhere the same, everywhere predictable, it can be extrapolated from this one uncovered, yet still covered, Pedo Elite network, that <strong>the Pedo Elite networks must look alike, that the other networks must look like this one.</strong> As Mexico’s Special Prosecutor confirmed, the Pedo Elite networks are inter-linked and exist within the structure of organized crime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the market for men in general, the syndicates run girl-trafficking and female-trafficking as intertwined operations around the globe, – from which they make a killing. They also run multiple support-sectors. <strong>Support-sectors include the establishment of slave routes, the protection of slave routes, the continual provisioning of “fresh product” for market, and the money-laundering of billions of dollars in annual profits.</strong> Support-sectors are themselves major global enterprises. For example, money-laundering billions of dollars year after year is a massive global undertaking with scores of actors and props – suits, mules, pilots, seafarers, storefronts, fake accounts, phantom clients, fraudulent bank documents, furtive electronic transfers, countless collaborators in a vast eclipsed matrix. Money-laundering colossal sums of money is big business. In fact, according to Lydia Cacho, money-laundering is the third-biggest business in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lydia Cacho believes the syndicates which traffic females work together, and are supported by all the governments of the world.</strong> Lydia Cacho: “The point of the book was to understand how the international markets are connected. As a reporter, I was really frustrated, because every time I interviewed an expert, everyone kept telling me they’re not linked, that this isn’t an international business. But it is… (It may be) an international mafia also involving Las Vegas…<strong>All governments in the world are lying to us about what’s going on with sex-trafficking. The governments are protecting the mafias</strong>. We are much more powerful than the mafias… Their greatest power lies in our fear.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that Lydia approaches this through a feminist lense and some people here might have differing or low opinions on feminism, but let\'s not focus on that. It\'s not the point. This woman is a fucking hero. She created a shelter for victims of abuse and elite pedophilia, she defended this shelter against organized attack, she\'s been kidnapped and raped for writing books about the pedo elite, she\'s constantly facing death threats and harassment, she has fought so hard her body is shutting down on her and it never stopped her, while she was rotting from cancer and other illnesses she created information to disseminate among normies about human trafficking and how to spot it, etc etc. If only more reporters were like her.</p>',

            sigh. i'm not afraid of being called ANYTHING. i'm very vocal with a number of unpopular opinions in my leftist liberal city, so i'm used to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            my problem is there's simply no way to prove it's true, there's no way we will EVER get people on board with "it's the Jews!!!" it will always, always, always create the opposite effect and no one will EVER hear us out. i have talked to real victims of government mind control experiments; this whole thing makes them feel like it's now even harder to talk about their experience. i am in this for the victims, and i simply will not contribute to making this difficult for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            so "The Jews!" have been accused of eating babies. surely they're not the only ones who have been accused of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            besides, this is (for me) about the government's involvement in mind control experiments, which are largely done on children, which requires human trafficking. not only that, but it requires funding, which is where the black ops CP etc comes in. and that is NOT all "The Jews." you can't seriously convince me a whole group of people is just simply predisposed to these things; that doesn't carry any logic.
           </p>
           <p>
            my god the whole argument is so reductive and obviously flawed i can't believe i spend so much time here defending against it. and stop assuming i've "never looked into it" i have, it's bogus, the end.

              in this video, she makes a very interesting connection in the human trafficking ring, one i had not heard of. She claims the Japanese are involved, the yakuza specifically. I didn't read all 4 parts of the paper so i don't know if its mentioned there. But this has really stuck out to me and I keep thinking about. She goes on to suggest that the demand and market for younger and younger girls is being pushed by the Japanese..... I find this to be an incredible and yet completely plausible claim. I haven't done more research yet, but this could be a huge lead.

               yeah, i noticed that too! i don't know if the Yakuza is involved where i am, but there must be a Chinese mafia. i don't want to go into detail and betray my location but i live in a very Chinese part of town. "massage parlors" literally everywhere, looking dingy as fuck like no one would really get a massage there. have seen multiple ones nearby listed on rub-n-tug maps. no doubt these women are trafficked. there's a """restaurant"""" that looks completely uninviting that's surrounded by heavy fences, no-trespass signs and cameras. next to it are two parlours and behind it is a shipping dock.

              <p>
               the Japanese connection makes me think of the Hawaii connection. one of the routes for trafficking meth is Japan -&gt; Hawaii -&gt; Cali and Contiguous US. i assume it's the same for people.

            Just actually began reading Chapter #1 and have saved the links to all 4 chapters ...
Astonishing story and rather obvious why we haven't heard about this in the United States.
Truly a sacrifice of her life by Lydia Cacho -- and because of what she saw so early in her 
life of these abused children.  Clearly she finds it impossible to do otherwise than to sacrifice 
her life in this cause of helping these children and women.
Thank you, again!

It took a long time for me to get involved with this subject, to explore it -- self-preservation.
But I had no idea of the extent of it (MKULTRA involvement/Mind Control) or the actual torture involved
in that program. Or the extent that the US government was involved in the trafficking or how widespread it is.
Someone had brought Franklin Scandal to my attention probably almost 20 years ago and gradually worked
into the rest of it.

            i would really be interested to see some stats on how many "men in general" partake in this terrible behavior vs. men who don't. what is the ratio? exactly how widespread is this phenomenon? and how many elites are in big biz, but don't participate in pedophile behavior? i know that these are impossible questions to answer, but i can't help but wonder what the hell is actually going on. it seems like most men, average men, would never cross that line. but what if i'm wrong? and HOW wrong would i be then? and then what of the women involved? why do they do it? to please men? because they are just psychopaths? just for the money? we know they can be molesters, but how many REALLY do this? more than you would think? yeah, my brain works on overtime, that's for sure! sheesh i need a rest!

             I'd recommend that you begin to read Chapter #1 of this powerful story.
A great deal is revealed about the men who do these things and it is males 
who are our sexual abusers of children as studies show.

             All oppressed people are exploited, but especially females as they are part
of every group, the majority gender on the planet, part of every race and 
every nationality.  Women are homosexual, heterosexual, bi-sexual and 
trans-gender.  As each group is released from oppression, women rise ...

             We are about to once again recall the sadness of the death of Princess Diana 20

             Women do not generally sexually abuse children according to studies -- lesbians pretty much never --
but women will when they come under the influence of a heterosexual male.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's is some info on one study and will try to fill in other info tomorrow . . . 
and hope it is of some help.

             A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
            </p>
            <p>
             Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
             </p>
             <p>
              Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
             </p>
             <p>
              Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
             </p>
             <p>
              Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.

             A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

              great post &amp; thanks for the info! yeah, most of  this pretty much echos my thoughts, but i wasn't aware of the numbers. as a woman myself, sometimes i just get a little creeped out and start jumping at shadows! i start thinking "who the fuck ARE these people?" ya know? is it someone i know? is that possible? just stuff that will drive a person crazy. however, the clarification on gays etc., i have read articles about that too. i guess i just have to remember that for every heterosexual man involved in these activities, there are thousands that would never dream about it.

             i would love to believe that most men are not involved or do not have these desires, but my experience with them (and i'm male) suggests otherwise. pornography addiction is a suspect; when you spend your life watching porn and attaching your sexuality to it, you become desensitized and require even more extreme stimuli to be satisfied. sometimes this leads men to child porn; more often than not they just get into sick shit like rape porn and faux necro porn. so much porn emphasizes young or "barely legal" status for the women. sure, it's a free country and one could argue that just watching this stuff is nothing to complain about but i personally disagree. acceptance of these things and desires is not without social and moral consequence. every time you masturbate to something sketchy or sick you're reinforcing neural pathways and requiring stronger stimuli. where does it end for a person like that? what's the limit?
            </p>
            <p>
             i'm interested in knowing how many women pedophiles are out there. i wish there were some studies and statistics we could draw from to understand this phenomenon better but for obvious reasons there isn't much.  i think it's safe to guess there are less than men, but it's obvious they exist. the average manifestation of pedophilia is a paraphilia that i believe is based on the fact that the pedophile feels inferior and inadequate, has strong anxiety around forming relationships with adults, and is attracted to children because of their helplessness and inferiority in comparison to them. sometimes it's a paraphilia that stems from child molestation; develops when the child is exposed to a sexual stimulus during abuse and their brain wires their sexuality around this. i've noticed this happen in people who were molested by other kids. so in some instances this could be happening to female pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             in other cases, yes, i think some women also do it to please men, the ones you see who "let their boyfriends have their daughters." are they psychopaths? i think they're mostly weak fragile narcissists with no empathy. other conditions that manifest a lack of empathy could lead to a transactional mentality where yes, it's all about the money. some of the women involved are victims themselves. women are much smaller and lighter skeletally than men, it's why the male gender has subjugated women to the degree it has, maintaining a physical dominance over mate selection. this trauma has followed women for centuries and many of them will just do whatever a threatening man is telling them.
            </p>
            <p>
             my problem with the article is that it leaves out all the boy children who are also raped by these fucking freaks. it happens a lot in the middle east.

              true dat. yeah, strangely i have been watching a lot of youtubes about the issue of narcissists. i know a bit about them from reading articles and a book called "without conscience" by dr. robert hare. a great, quick read if you're interested. i have a personal interest in the subject because i seem to be attracted to them and at least one of them i suspect to be a pedophile. i ended up moving out of state to try to start my life over (i ended up with a different psychopath! shit.)
so i didn't get enough proof to go child protective services. it was his own daughters, fucking sick! their behavior tipped me off. i was with them 5 months, so i tried to be a sane person in their life. (mother was a crack head)
             </p>
             <p>
              i felt and still feel guilty about not coming forward with this, but i had already moved out and was getting ready for a big move to seattle. also i had no evidence to bring to the table. what would i really say? "i have this hunch...". except that all of my other hunches proved to be right.
             </p>
             <p>
              ah well, i can't change the past. one thing the vids talk about with narcissists is how great they are at convincing the people around them that they are such great people, and it is YOU that is the shmuck. i bet many of these pedos are psychopaths or narcissists. they fit the bill.

               i know how you feel. i've had to witness many instances of child abuse and be left there bewildered as to what i could even do about it. just goes to show how backwards and sick and dysfunctional our society is, and how it's deliberately set up to perpetuate abuse. i'm sorry you experienced that.

               narcissists are easy to spot once you understand their psychology, and
               <em>
                truly
               </em>
               understand it beyond pop psych symptom lists. those are good for an introduction but they aren't nuanced enough in the many ways narcissism manifests. narcissists are as varied as regular people in their specific motives, interests, and presentations, but they all share a basic psychological pattern of functioning, an archetype of sorts. i personally believe we're facing an epidemic of narcissists, many of the "covert" manifestation. this is particularly dangerous when coupled with uber-liberal "tend to all the shy weak people like they're children" dogma; boy do covert narcs love to manipulate our good will with their victim status.

               narcissists are really good at that. you'll notice the resident shills (mostly the jew haters) play this psychological card almost every time they foolishly open their mouths. the only way to stop being duped again and again is to have strong self worth, self knowledge, and most importantly, STRONG BOUNDARIES!

                You're describing sociopathy. Narcissism and sociopathy go hand in hand. I recommend reading "The Sociopath Next Door."  It's an easy read.  It isn't necessary to have a background in psychology to understand it. Once you start reading you can't put it down.  According to the author 1 in 25 people is a sociopath.  A sociopath has no conscience and doesn't feel love, guilt or remorse. She gives different real life scenarios to help explain how a sociopath operates. It's my favorite book. I gave it to my dad to read because he was having problems with a person I suspected of being a sociopath. I went to his house the next day and he was reading and taking notes.

                 they go hand and hand because they are not separate conditions, but part of a spectrum of disorders of empathy that often intersect to the point where i don't think distinctions need to always be made. the names deserve a renaissance too because i feel they're misleading and loaded.

                 but regardless of what one calls it, i agree that they need to be understood by everyone who isn't devoid of empathy. just as they project their flaws, we project our good intentions on others, and that's what gets us fucked over.

              Good post thanks. I think pornography has become so widespread and normalised that people seriously underestimate the consequences of it. Everyone does it so it must be ok. I think it's had and having a devastating effect in n human interpersonal relationships, fuelling sexual abuse, murder, the breakdown of marriages etc

               it truly is, and people need to step outside of feeling personally attacked when people criticize porn use, and realize this. it's almost just as important as pizzagate because imo it's directly correlated.

                Yes I have so many thoughts running n this. When you reduce sex to mere gratification, self indulgence in the interests of personal pleasure so many problems arise. People are not robots, they're complex psychological beings so treating people's bodies like mere lumps of flesh has such a negative effect on people. People also need to be taught self control in matters of a sexual nature but porn teaches the opposite. It fuels lust and the pursuit of personal pleasure and as a consequence those with more power often victimise those with none.
Rant over for today but these things make me so angry grrrrrrr

                 same on all fronts, but i'm genuinely relieved to see people on here aware of this and talking about it. thank you guys for that. the last time i challenged porn here there was a ton of knee-jerk defensiveness. don't pretend to care about victims of trafficking if you are willing to defend porn.

              There is a lot of information about this on the internet but not answering all the questions about this subject as yet.
From what I've read, pedophiles may not have any sexual orientation.  I'm presuming that means that they are in an arrested state of immaturity.  I've also read a long time ago that in tracking pedophilia they do know that some of those abused will sexually abuse others.  I don't recall the exact numbers -- but thinking possibly less than 1 in every 4.
However, even where there is no prior sexual abuse they will generally always turn up one pedophile.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is also of course a good deal of evidence that Catholic nuns sexually abused children. (See:  SNAP)
About 40% of nuns have also been found to have themselves been raped and sexually abused and physically abused by priests.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I've said elsewhere, generally females do not sexually abuse children, but they will when they are under the influence of a heterosexual male.  Homosexual males are NOT our sexual abusers of children.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is another kind of pedophile called "situational" where a heterosexual male who prefers sexual relations with an adult female, will sexually abuse a child IF there is no adult female available.
             </p>
             <p>
              Much of the world thinks of intercourse as "Making love" while these men who rape children seem to be looking for an excuse to torture, but also obviously want to avoid adult females who are less "controllable."
             </p>
             <p>
              Comcast and Verizon are making billions every year providing internet porn.  Yet Verizon has been allowed by our Congress to buy Yahoo.  Much of the porn is violent.  And all of it is debasing to women and is generally propaganda against women which shows them to be deserving of violent treatment.  It does seem a matter of a disconnect in the human male brain which relieves them of conscience and empathy.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've also read that many males are becoming so obsessed by this internet porn that they are truly addicted to it ...
meaning that it is very negatively effecting their jobs and their relationships with their families - wives and children.
             </p>

               my problem with the article is that it leaves out all the boy children who are also raped by these fucking freaks. it happens a lot in the middle east.

               well, "homosexual" males are occasionally the sexual abusers of children, but maybe not the primary.
              </p>
              <p>
               i think that what is always involved in pedophilia, regardless of what really causes it, is a lack of empathy. every single time. no sane, empathic adult no matter what "cruel orientation" afflicted them, would abuse a child sexually. you have to have no empathy. this would apply for situational pedophiles too; non-empathic people (psychopaths, narcissists, etc) don't necessarily have an orientation because either they hardly even have a sense of self, or because they objectify people too much for it to matter. some of them just like torturing, it almost isn't about sexual gratification.
              </p>
              <p>
               i've gotten downvoated harshly for harking on porn, but i just find it all so grotesque. if money is involved, coercion is most certainly happening, no matter how much the person seems to "consent." how many porn actresses are genuinely happy, functioning people? how many are being trafficked or soft-trafficked? how many aren't even of age?
              </p>
              <p>
               men - boys, rather - start watching porn earlier and earlier in life these days and it's ruining their sexualities. very young men, in their twenties, can't achieve erections or gratification through normal physical sex anymore because of porn. not to mention, like you said, the propaganda aspect that dehumanizes women. this definitely affects their growing brains and makes me terrified of the future of masculinity.

                Very interesting points about lack of empathy where you are looking at this overall 
from a higher perspective and which needs to be given more attention in all of these
instances.

               <p>
                And Porn Industry connection to the desensitizing of males could be seen as majorly being 
responsible for the lessening or overturning of conscience and natural empathy.

               <p>
                As an aside ...
From the beginning of time, Elite patriarchy has been at war with normal human sexuality;
distorting and perverting it.
                <br/>
                And most especially the allure of the feminine for males.

            There must be many other similar stories of people fighting this.  This happened over 10 years ago, and I'm hearing this case for the first time.

             the ritual abuse survivor i've spoken to a few times says that not enough people are taking this on, almost no one will talk about it ): we need to hold our reporters to the standard of Lydia Cacho and ask them why the fuck they're so silent? death threats never stopped Lydia.

              I agree.  The death threats happen because most of the time people are not willing to fight back.  It is because we are not psychopaths, but sometime we have to stand up together and fight.

               what Lydia did was get her family and supporters to make a huge media stink when she got kidnapped and was about to be Clinton'd. this is what our journalists need to do.

                Right!  But, our media is controlled by the Bilderberg Group, and the people in the Bilderberg Group are a bunch of pedos.

              Excuse me I was replying to a comment not your post, I think horsefuker is an apt nickname for equinelvr. I was trying not to talk like an asshole on here. My point was the point you just made, this ismt about altleft altright, its global, the point i took from the LITTLE BIT IVE READ YET,  is that there are two markets comprised of mainly men. I should have indicated who I was calling b.s. on (horsefuker) I used horsefukers language back at horsefuker. Am I understood now? This Lydia cachao stuff is heart rending, and....ugh but try not to intimidate people for talking to you, if you want to be trusted, pungent, you just didn't get my badhumor or my timeline. I agree with you. There is nothing alt anything it's beyond that distraction. Thank you for the post.

               sorry, your post actually did not come up as a reply but as it's own separate comment with no context. horsefucker has a lot of alts on here and i spent a good chunk of time recently dealing with his shit, so forgive me for being trigger happy. it wasn't personal. please stick around, and thanks.

             no, i'm sorry, but mexico is full of amazing, hard working, family oriented people just trying to live their lives. mexico city is the largest metropolis on the planet. so no, that's simply not true. try to remember that the drug lords are a small population within the normally operating population. also do know that the drug lords would never have the power that they do without the help of the american government.
            </p>
            <p>
             i may possibly be moving to mexico, as i have a great respect for the normal people living there. however, i will FLY into wherever i decide to move to, as crossing the borders has become a lot more dangerous. god forbid your car breaks down somewhere!

            Thank you for the info on Mexican journalist, Lydia Cacho.  She is a hero.
           </p>
           <p>
            The US/CIA is a huge source of this corruption of governments around the world
and of our own government ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Elites and right wing succeed through corruption and crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Mafia exists at the pleasure of Elites because they require their services.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two years before the end of WWII, Allen Dulles was helping orchestrate operations to bring fascism
to the world and that certainly meant corruption of all of our systems of government by ensuring that
only the right wing would be elected to governments around the world.  And, of course, US.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also remember that our military is involved in this trafficking -- certainly with Drugs but also with human
trafficking which was made clear by retired NYC Detective Rothstein in this interview with Jim Fetzer.
His comment on the military -- and how little is reported of it -- comes at the very end.

            Our American banks are laundering half of a Trillion in drug money every year.

           <p>
            In order to protect children from sexual abuse -- and the majority of those abused and trafficked are female -- 
it has to be understood that males are our sexual abusers of children.
That of course explains the war on women over thousands of years as women sought to protect their children
from male molesters.

              Hi votes --
             </p>
             <p>
              Well the John Birch Society has a pretty strong lock on government now with Koch Bros. (and other large corporations) having bought controlling interests in both parties.
             </p>
             <p>
              Koch Bros. and other large corporations recruited Bill Clinton and other Southerners to found the Democratic Leadership Council and  Koch/corporate representatives served on the Executive Committee of the DLC.
             </p>
             <p>
              The father was very much involved with John Birch Society - funded it -- and worked much of his life to try
to overturn democracy in US.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you remember ole General Edwin Walker ... 
Walker was fired by JFK for distributing right wing Nazi and John Birch literature to military/Army.
             </p>
             <p>
              As an aside, you might of heard of the "Wanted for Treason" posters distributed in Deley Plaza the morning of the Kennedy assassination.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               After the assassination, Walker’s organization was briefly under suspicion, and the Warren Commission investigation tracked these flyers to Walker’s aide Robert Surrey. Surrey had overseen the distribution of the sheets in the days prior to JFK’s arrival; members of Walker’s organization, acting on his behalf, placed them under windshield wipers and in newspaper racks.
Gen. Walker also led the racist riot at Ole Miss and ultimately ended up before a Judge who recommended that he receive psychiatric care.&gt;

             <p>
              This is also the guy who Oswald allegedly tried to shoot by firing into his home and just missing Walker's head.
Not a story I believe, however..
             </p>
             <p>
              At time of JFK assassination in Texas --  50% of the police force was KKK.

               Definitely agree with you about how both political parties have been hijacked by the ultra-right. I've documented some of the John Birch and JFK assassination connections (including those Nov. 22 Dallas ads) in

                Yes -- Votescam -- The Stealing of America -- a link which I post here often.

               <p>
                Have you read that the electronic manipulation of the hack-able computer voting machines 
is also suggested to being done by satellite now?
               </p>
               <p>
                Great job on telling the story of the computers and history of stealing elections --
and background which permits it all...
And this all begins 50 years ago -- 1965/large computers used by MSM and 
1967/small voting computers -- and imo there is a huge link to the overall concept
of Operation Gladio which sought to keep right wing governments in place in 
nations over which US had influence and control at end of WWII...
Japan, Germany, Italy, France -- presume you're familiar with it all.
US resurrecting Mafia in Italy to ensure it was carried out as they wished.
I'd also include Greece and UK in that list.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also as I checked your link tonight and got into the HUNTs I realized I was reading a lot
of stuff I was unfamiliar with.  Thank you for that!
But it's late and too late to absorb what I'm reading so will be back tomorrow.
I'll pick up the link to remind me tomorrow.  :)

                 Thanks, glad you'll take a look at the article! I hadn't heard of vote hacking by satellite - do you know if that's just a theory or there's evidence for it? I do tend to think of vote rigging here in the US as an extension of the CIA's efforts to prop up right-wing governments. They've been illegally exerting control over the US government and political system ever since their inception (with programs like Operation Mockingbird, to control the media, and Operation Midnight Climax, which probably started the sexual blackmail rings), but after the JFK assassination, they went into overdrive and began using computers to steal elections nationwide. Further down in my article, you can see that some top CIA officials (particularly former director Robert Gates) actually played a direct role in pushing electronic voting machines on the nation.

                  Hi -- re Satellite ... just one of those things I picked up in reading and didn't pick up a link.
It didn't provide evidence as I recall but it was a pretty firm statement that it's happening --
i.e., definitely no evidence, but seemed beyond theory.
And I don't recall where I read it -- except it was on internet.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Not familiar with Operation Midnight Climax, but will check it when I have a chance.
A lot of catch up
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When we see the extremes that the Elites have gone to in order to control voting we KNOW
that they would probably not even have a 15% chance of success at the polls.
Same with Hillary in her stealing operation versus Bernie Sanders.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Gates ... perhaps he was pushing the program in Congress that many
supported -- which required states to take on computers? HA something ...?
I'll have to look it up.

                   Yes, Gates was connected to the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). He was on the board of defense contractor SAIC, which was connected to a lot of the efforts to get HAVA passed:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     Robert Gates and Admiral Bill Owens (another SAIC board member) both joined VoteHere, a tiny little voting system vendor that somehow was the largest industry lobbyist for HAVA. I'm inclined to think they were a front company used to pour lobbying money into HAVA without it being traceable to the major vendors.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     Another SAIC person, Ronald Knecht, led the Election Systems lobbying division of ITAA, which included a cadre of defense contractors (including Northrop Grumman) that were pushing for HAVA
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     SAIC developed the software for Diversified Dynamics, another minor vendor acquired by Northrop Grumman and used as an excuse for Northrop to be pushing for HAVA (even though Diversified Dynamics was not a very profitable business venture)
                    </p>
                   </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                   Basically, SAIC was at the center of an operation that involved defense contractors lobbying for HAVA. This is all from my article that I linked.

              Hi Against --
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes, I've posted that info a few times here -- you mean Rothstein, right?
             </p>
             <p>
              True, he was relating how the NYPD (which also works internationally) had over a 50 year period opened three
very important investigations into prostitution and pedophilia and every time the investigations would produce names of higher up's the investigations would be stopped.  The last investigation went all the way to Hearings in Albany before it was stopped.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rothstein also said that the "book of names" was in the possession of Larry O'Brien, Chair of the Dem Party at that time.  Offices were at the Watergate.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cnT5amf6Y">

              </a>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the break in.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              While in Congress, LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress.   Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress.

              See:  YouTube/Madelaine Duncan Brown also on the assassination, those involved in the coup on JFK and also 
on LBJ's personal killer -- Malcolm Wallace.
Brown also supplies a list of the co-conspirators who met the evening before the assassination at the home of Clint Murchinson -- LBJ included.

              In order to protect children from sexual abuse -- and the majority of those abused and trafficked are female -- it has to be understood that males are our sexual abusers of children. That of course explains the war on women over thousands of years as women sought to protect their children from male molesters.

              That's also what research indicates about our sexual abusers of children.
In fact, even right wing women's groups agree that it is MALES who are our sexual abusers of children.

                There are many men who are feared not only by women but by other males.

               <p>
                We have many males pushing baby carriages these days which is a wonderful sight.

                But the lies of Sigmund Freud's Oedipus Complex which so outrageously blamed infants,
young toddlers and young children for aggressive sexual assault against adult members 
of their families still stands.  It was also a complete betrayal of his young patients who had
confided in him their sexual abuse by male members of their families -- fathers, grandfathers,
uncles, male cousins and male friends of the family.

              Who are you counting as "left" wing ..  ?
             </p>
             <p>
              The McCarthy Era purged liberals from government -
             </p>
             <p>
              Truman replaced the liberal VP Henry Wallace only 45 days before becoming president.
             </p>
             <p>
              JFK was the last of what you might call liberal presidents which ended in 
a coup on him and our people's government.
             </p>
             <p>
              CIA then targeted any "liberals" left in Congress who were bold enough
to either challenge the Warren Report or to investigate the CIA - I.e., Frank 
Church Hearings.
After that the CIA/NRA did the rest.
Actually, not only were all liberals removed from government, so were moderates --
both Dem and GOP.
             </p>
             <p>
              After JFK only those who had been involved in the coup reached the White House ...
or those involved in the cover up.

              Sorry to burst your bubble, but the CIA was founded by and for the right-wing business executives who wanted to spread their ideology all across the world. How else do you explain them toppling democratically-elected left-wing governments (Mossadegh, Arbenz, Allende, etc.) to install right-wing dictators?

               The CIA and the Cold War.  "The Russians are coming!" were created by right wing Elites here/
fascists.
              </p>
              <p>
               Right wing" business executives" also known as CEO's (See ENRON) are Elites ...
and it was Elites in the US and all over the world who raised and funded Hitler/Nazis with
the help of Allen Dulles and his legal firm (Sullivan &amp; Cromwell) and Prescott Bush who 
ran front companies like Holland America Line to hide their activities.
              </p>
              <p>
               See:  Operation Mockingbird which was being written two years before the end of WWII in order to topple our free press here in the US -- and subsequently run out of the CIA by Dulles.
Phil Graham was recruited to contact Elites/Network heads and those like himself who controlled US communication to do the dirty work of moving CIA propaganda and lies.
See:  Operation Paperclip which brought 200,000 ex-Nazis into the US who were used to found the CIA, funneled into the FBI and other government agencies and to "hot spots" around the world.
See:  Operation Gladio which was a program to keep right wing governments in place in nations over which the CIA had control and influence after WWII -- Japan, Germany, France, Italy.  (I'd also add Greece/UK)
In Italy, the US actually resurrected the Mafia in order to ensure that the carrying out of the operation.

              <p>
               CIA coups did take down democratically elected governments all over the world while also supporting dictators.
All for the benefit of Elites/right wing.
              </p>
              <p>
               You might also reread the Constitution where you'll find that Our Founders actually created an "Elite patriarchy" (while proclaiming "all are equal") ... endowed them with land grants and tremendous influence and control over our people's government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
Our Founders also continued the slaughter of the native people here from which this land was stole:  GENOCIDE
The Founders also saved and protected the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy which guaranteed the Civil War which also benefited Elites by splitting the population of the nation into two camps of hatred which continue to echo on today.

              That's not opinion, you faggit!  It's FACT.  Something you're obviously not familiar with...
             </p>
             <p>
              You have a LONG road ahead of you to LEARN.  You'll have to bone up on HISTORY, ECONOMICS, POLITICS, ANTHROPOLOGY, ROYAL GENEALOGY, HUMAN MIGRATION PATTERNS, and MEDICINE, just to name a few.
             </p>
             <p>
              You'd better get busy!!  That's a LOT of info for your pea brain to attempt to absorb.  :)

               You're oversimplifying-organized Jewry is primal when  we  talk  about secret  societies,  but  its more  complicated-its  not  like  crime syndicates and  greed  is  special  to the  Jews, there are  many evildoers  evildoers  in the  world, which includes  the old powerful families of Europe and  England, the  Vatican  to  mention a  few

                I oversimplified nothing.  I have studied this shit -- EVERY TOPIC LISTED IN MY POST ABOVE -- for possibly longer than you're been breathing, depending upon how old you are.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is about JEWISH BLOODlines, pure and simple.  Do you know what a crypto Jew is and HOW to spot one?  Have you researched the genealogy?  Of course you haven't -- I can tell by your comments.  You're just repeating the BS you've heard elsewhere.
               </p>
               <p>
                Well, I HAVE researched the BLOODlines.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Vatican was founded by Danite crypto JEWS (aka "Aryans," sometimes called "Romans").  Every Pope has been a crypto JEW.
               </p>
               <p>
                Russian mafia = JEWS / Italian/Sicilian mafia = JEWS / Mormon mafia = crypto JEWS / Japanese mafia = crypto JEWS ("slant-eyed Jews") /
               </p>
               <p>
                etc. etc.
               </p>
               <p>
                The "old powerful families of Europe," including the BLACK NOBILITY, are CRYPTO JEWS.
               </p>

                You are just mouthing off and have NO CLUE what you're talking about.

                      Why didn't you get it when I made a simple point to equinlvr, abt, how biased it's comment was? You are some kind of paranoid, as if I used equinlvr  same language for any other reason than mockery and to point out how the bias lays with equinlvr for bringing it in. Now i look and, waaah...So stupid that this thread is all fight.   It started out good let's get back on track ? I have to post something soon and I don't like getting talked to treated like that if you guys are professional, I wanna show something.. see what you say. Just have this phone...have to uploaupload to imgbb...then copy paste.NOT EASY, but I wanna get it done today
