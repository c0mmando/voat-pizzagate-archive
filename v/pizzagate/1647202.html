            So, Madeleine has that mutation! OK, now how in the hell would the Podestas, or Soros know that little girl had this? 
Just looking at her eye would not tell them that it was that mutation. As I posted before fetal alcohol syndrome and other factors can cause the coloboma.
Was she registered into some kind of registery for this kind of mutation?, did her doctors secretly let Soros and or his goons know? 
Some how, some way, someone alerted Soros to this little girl. Authorities need to start looking at who had knowledge of her condition that also has ties to Soros.

             You make it sound very "sciency," but basically you present no evidence to support your argument.  Therefore, your post is a violation of Rule 1.  Maybe if you can build at least a decent argument as to how McCann's eye is relevant, your post can satisfy Rule 1.

            This post is pretty scientific.  I must admit I had a hard time understanding it, but I think that possibly that kidney disease may be the cause of the swelling and clouding of the coloboma eye.  I also know that there is some strange stuff going on in St. Louis Mo.  that this may play in to.  I am in the dark about some of it, but what I do know is enough to scare the wits out of me.  I am still researching the connection of the Archdiocese of the Catholic Church and organ trafficking and sexual abuse of children.  Shocking, yes.  Surprising, no.

              Sorry the post was deleted.  Crazy.  No, no evidence yet regarding blood donations or samples.  I am sure as it progresses, the research will connect the Church and the Govt. to more nefarious operations.  The West Lake Landfill has an ever burning fire.  There is organ harvesting, and there is a connection to the Landfill.
