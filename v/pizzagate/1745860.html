<p>Mandi Rei Serra breaks down why she\'s so vocal about pedogate and why it\'s her personal mission to see it destroyed.</p>

I\'ll most likely never find out and so to channel my She-Hulk rage, I\'m doing what I can to bring attention to pedogate because I owe it to my daughter. I am getting my Daenerys Targaryen on because I want to break the fucking wheel that enables the sale and rape of children. I am not the only woman who put a child to the system with hope for the best and now we find out it\'s a big fat lie and so I promise you, there is an army of infuriated and woke as fuck mama bears ready to gut a rotten system fucking with their children. And the sad thing is, if we count the mothers of kidnapped children, we\'re even bigger and more angry.</p>
<p>The system is clear. It is our enemy. It must be removed for safety of the country as a country that depends on a slave system will eventually face uprising. If you\'re not all up on your history, I suggest giving the French Revolution a go, because that\'s the direction we\'re heading. The average lifespan of an empire is 250 year and we\'re already at 240. It\'s not hard to see the decline this country is afflicted with; corporate masters telling us how bad our lives suck but their products make it all better, politicians that fuck fuck (the second fuck is intentional; the first for their constituents, the second is for how they were blackmailed with a kid) over the country they are supposed to represent and damage international relations by warmongering and trafficking, and a deliberate dumbing down to create a stupid and complacent citizenry willing to be sheep, led from thought to thought.</p>

            The OP is misstated. We don't want Pedogate destroyed. Pedogate is the awareness of pedo-crimes. We want the crimes ended, not the awareness of the crimes ended.

            Yes, they're telling us we need the stuff, but we really don't.  Living without their stuff just makes life slightly less convenient, that's all.  We've all just bought into it, hook, line and sinker, and now can't let go.  I keep saying, if people stopped buying into their garbage it would make a huge difference and I mean all of it.  We need to stop consuming stuff that is unnecessary.

            I get her anger over this, but the reality is the child is stastically WAY more likely to be safe and in a good home than being trafficked. There are also adoption registries in every state. She can file to get on the registry. When her daughter turns 18 she can get on the registry as well if she chooses. if both parent and child are on the registry, then they are put in contact with each other. This is all a little over dramatic and it sounds like she would really benefit from some professional help to process through her problems and loss.

             That may  b e true, but she did include that table of quite disturbing statistics re: children in foster care---I realize that  foster care is not the same as adoption, however there are some parallels. My sister 30 or so years ago got pregnant and because the father was not interested in having the baby first offered an abortion. That was out of the question for her. So , she decided to place the baby for adoption when the time came. She did not like the adoption agency people (Catholic Charities) and in the end, she kept the baby after he spent a few days in foster care while she thought it over. She is lucky--has a beautiful son who has 2 beautiful kids of jhis own now
