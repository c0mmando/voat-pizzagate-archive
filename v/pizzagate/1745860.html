            The OP is misstated. We don't want Pedogate destroyed. Pedogate is the awareness of pedo-crimes. We want the crimes ended, not the awareness of the crimes ended.

            Yes, they're telling us we need the stuff, but we really don't.  Living without their stuff just makes life slightly less convenient, that's all.  We've all just bought into it, hook, line and sinker, and now can't let go.  I keep saying, if people stopped buying into their garbage it would make a huge difference and I mean all of it.  We need to stop consuming stuff that is unnecessary.

            I get her anger over this, but the reality is the child is stastically WAY more likely to be safe and in a good home than being trafficked. There are also adoption registries in every state. She can file to get on the registry. When her daughter turns 18 she can get on the registry as well if she chooses. if both parent and child are on the registry, then they are put in contact with each other. This is all a little over dramatic and it sounds like she would really benefit from some professional help to process through her problems and loss.

             That may  b e true, but she did include that table of quite disturbing statistics re: children in foster care---I realize that  foster care is not the same as adoption, however there are some parallels. My sister 30 or so years ago got pregnant and because the father was not interested in having the baby first offered an abortion. That was out of the question for her. So , she decided to place the baby for adoption when the time came. She did not like the adoption agency people (Catholic Charities) and in the end, she kept the baby after he spent a few days in foster care while she thought it over. She is lucky--has a beautiful son who has 2 beautiful kids of jhis own now
