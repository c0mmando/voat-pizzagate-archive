<p>And why am I introducing Satanism? What’s the basis? As mentioned before, Shiloh’s mom is a FUCKING ILLUMINATI SATANIC WHORE. It’s not me saying it, it’s WHOREANGELINA ADMITTING IT: </p>

<p>So she has to explain to people about S&amp;M and being held down? I wonder how you do that to a THREE-YEAR-OLD CHILD?!!! </p>
<p>But let’s get some context … a timeline going so we can make sure when this happened. Some photos and links to dates. First photos: </p>

<p>So it didn\'t happen in 2009. The article stated it was when she was three when the tooth trauma happened and Life &amp; Style also stated three when the shocking change was noticed. Now Shiloh’s birthday is May 27, 2006 so that brings us to 2009. And three .... hmmmmm .... if memory serves me right, that’s when Madeleine McCann went missing, no? Her birthday was May 12th, 2003.</p>

<p>&quot;At the time she was murdered, JonBenet hadn\'t lost any of her baby teeth, but one of her front teeth was loose, and she was looking forward to using her tooth fairy pillow.&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>Is it just me, or is she missing a front tooth on the bottom row? Why are the Rs trying to tell us that she\'d never lost a tooth and hadn\'t been able to use her tooth fairy pillow for a visit from the Tooth Fairy...when this photo clearly shows she has lost a lower front tooth...?  …

<p>We can also see from Editorial image: 59651610 dated February 18, 2010, we can confirm she’s had a haircut. Note the cropped bangs that she didn’t used to have, but this happened in France hence the covering of her head. </p>

<h1>SHE’S SUCKING HER THUMB AND CLINGING TO HER BLANKET!!!! SHE’S REGRESSED!!!</h1>
<p>Goo ahead look through March. She’s clutching a blanket and sucking her thumb in almost every shot!!!! That child was exposed to something absolutely TRAUMATIC!!!! And “EXPERTS” are saying this is normal? You show me a child that’s regressed, I’ll show you a kid that’s been abused! So WTF happened in Paris, Whoreangelina? What did you do to your child, you POS? </p>
<p>Whatever it was, in the following month of April 2010, she’s officially a BOY!!! </p>

<p>And take a look at July 2010. Remember the narrative is that being a boy is what she craved and that she loves her bros. The reality? She’s completely separated from the rest of the family, and she looks out of it to boot! There’s no interaction, none. Why is Whoreangelina keeping her to the left like she’s drawn a line between her and the rest of her family? </p>

<p>She’s brandishing the sword of it’s going to protect her, but the goddamned media is talking like this is FASHION?!!!! No, it’s a deeply troubled child! How do I know? Because of all of the above and because in November 2010, Shiloh, the little girl that played with dolls, does this! </p>

<h1>Can You Believe That Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Cut The Heads Off Of Her Sister Zahara\'s Dolls?</h1>
<p>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s little girl is definitely a wild child. The Jolie-Pitt family’s nanny reveals that she scalped her sister’s dolls, didn’t cry when she lost a tooth in a fight, and she is fascinated with death!
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have never shied away from the fact that their 4-year-old daughter, Shiloh, is a tomboy at heart — she even prefers to be called John. In the new Star magazine, a Jolie-Pitt nanny and family insiders tell all about the combat boot-loving kid. “She loves to roughhouse and mud wrestle,” a nanny tells the magazine. “She thinks she’s one of her brothers,” agrees Angelina, 35. The little girl didn’t even cry when she lost a tooth during a tussle with her brothers last year!
Unfortunately, Shiloh’s big sister, Zahara, 5, has been on the receiving end of the little girl’s playful pranks. “Shi was playing cowboys and Indians one day and cut the heads off of a bunch of Zahara’s dolls!” says the insider. “When one of the nannies found her, she said it was an unprotected village, so she had to scalp them.” Wonder if she picked that up from dad Brad, who happily collected scalps in the 2009 Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds? Of course, when Brad, 46, found out about the incident, he made Shi apologize to her sister. How would you have handled the situation, HollyMoms? …
Shiloh definitely wants to be one of the boys. She likes to wear their hand-me-downs — including boxer shorts, says a source close to the family. And she loves weapons, especially swords — just like Maddox. 
That all sounds like normal sibling behavior to me, but I do think it is a little strange that Shiloh is fascinated by dead animals. We recently reported that Shiloh asked her mom if she could keep a dead bird as a pet, but Shiloh doesn’t just want one dead pet — according to Star, she wants a zoo filled with dead animals! Gross! “She also told her nannies she wants to see a dead person up close,” explains a source. “Brad said absolutely not, but Angelina is all for Shiloh’s morbid curiosity.” I don’t really think it’s such a good idea for Angelina to encourage her little girl to see deed people. Shiloh clearly does take after her mom in many ways — she’s been spotted out and about wearing temporary tattoos. I wonder when Angie will let her get a real one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WTF? Normal sibling behavior? That girl has pent up rage. And what do they mean she was copying her father’s movie role? They let a FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL watch that movie? And why are they interchangeably using cut the heads off the dolls for scalping the dolls? They’re two different things! And she wants a dead pet? Seriously, WHY DIDN’T ANYONE GET THIS GIRL HELP! </p>
<p>We have just witnessed the complete dismantling of a child. In my opinion, they stripped her soul, subjected her to abuse perhaps through seeing an animal killed and through violence, did a number on her mind, and spit her out in the image they wanted! And no one interceded in the process? You mean, a kid is all right to experiment on? </p>
<p>And notice they now blame the missing tooth on her brothers. That was easy enough to figure out except she wouldn’t have been traumatized and taken to sucking her thumb and carrying a security blanket, now would she! And if she were traumatized, it would NOT be a good time to cut off her hair and stick her in ridiculous clothing! </p>
<p>If anyone thinks this couldn’t happen, I point out a book for you. It’s called THE ONLY GIRL IN THE WORLD by Maude Juliet. Her father was a FREEMASON who groomed an adopted child to be his husband. When the girl gave birth to Maude, he then proceeded to try to turn her into a SUPER-HUMAN who would protect him when the apocalypse hit! </p>

           Note Editorial number: 96980524. Picture is dated February 23, 2010.  If you can zoom in, zoom. You can see, #HER FRONT TOOTH IS MISSING!
          </p>
          <p>
           We can also see from Editorial image: 59651610 dated February 18, 2010, we can confirm she’s had a haircut. Note the cropped bangs that she didn’t used to have, but this happened in France hence the covering of her head.
          </p>
          <p>
           If we look up the editorial pics form March, there’s the bad haircut reveal:

           Goo ahead look through March. She’s clutching a blanket and sucking her thumb in almost every shot!!!! That child was exposed to something absolutely TRAUMATIC!!!! And “EXPERTS” are saying this is normal? You show me a child that’s regressed, I’ll show you a kid that’s been abused! So WTF happened in Paris, Whoreangelina? What did you do to your child, you POS?

           Whatever it was, in the following month of April 2010, she’s officially a BOY!!!

           And take a look at July 2010. Remember the narrative is that being a boy is what she craved and that she loves her bros. The reality? She’s completely separated from the rest of the family, and she looks out of it to boot! There’s no interaction, none. Why is Whoreangelina keeping her to the left like she’s drawn a line between her and the rest of her family?

            Can You Believe That Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Cut The Heads Off Of Her Sister Zahara's Dolls?
           </h1>
           <p>
            Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s little girl is definitely a wild child. The Jolie-Pitt family’s nanny reveals that she scalped her sister’s dolls, didn’t cry when she lost a tooth in a fight, and she is fascinated with death!
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have never shied away from the fact that their 4-year-old daughter, Shiloh, is a tomboy at heart — she even prefers to be called John. In the new Star magazine, a Jolie-Pitt nanny and family insiders tell all about the combat boot-loving kid. “She loves to roughhouse and mud wrestle,” a nanny tells the magazine. “She thinks she’s one of her brothers,” agrees Angelina, 35. The little girl didn’t even cry when she lost a tooth during a tussle with her brothers last year!
Unfortunately, Shiloh’s big sister, Zahara, 5, has been on the receiving end of the little girl’s playful pranks. “Shi was playing cowboys and Indians one day and cut the heads off of a bunch of Zahara’s dolls!” says the insider. “When one of the nannies found her, she said it was an unprotected village, so she had to scalp them.” Wonder if she picked that up from dad Brad, who happily collected scalps in the 2009 Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds? Of course, when Brad, 46, found out about the incident, he made Shi apologize to her sister. How would you have handled the situation, HollyMoms? …
Shiloh definitely wants to be one of the boys. She likes to wear their hand-me-downs — including boxer shorts, says a source close to the family. And she loves weapons, especially swords — just like Maddox. 
That all sounds like normal sibling behavior to me, but I do think it is a little strange that Shiloh is fascinated by dead animals. We recently reported that Shiloh asked her mom if she could keep a dead bird as a pet, but Shiloh doesn’t just want one dead pet — according to Star, she wants a zoo filled with dead animals! Gross! “She also told her nannies she wants to see a dead person up close,” explains a source. “Brad said absolutely not, but Angelina is all for Shiloh’s morbid curiosity.” I don’t really think it’s such a good idea for Angelina to encourage her little girl to see deed people. Shiloh clearly does take after her mom in many ways — she’s been spotted out and about wearing temporary tattoos. I wonder when Angie will let her get a real one?
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           WTF? Normal sibling behavior? That girl has pent up rage. And what do they mean she was copying her father’s movie role? They let a FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL watch that movie? And why are they interchangeably using cut the heads off the dolls for scalping the dolls? They’re two different things! And she wants a dead pet? Seriously, WHY DIDN’T ANYONE GET THIS GIRL HELP!
          </p>
          <p>
           We have just witnessed the complete dismantling of a child. In my opinion, they stripped her soul, subjected her to abuse perhaps through seeing an animal killed and through violence, did a number on her mind, and spit her out in the image they wanted! And no one interceded in the process? You mean, a kid is all right to experiment on?
          </p>
          <p>
           And notice they now blame the missing tooth on her brothers. That was easy enough to figure out except she wouldn’t have been traumatized and taken to sucking her thumb and carrying a security blanket, now would she! And if she were traumatized, it would NOT be a good time to cut off her hair and stick her in ridiculous clothing!
          </p>
          <p>
           If anyone thinks this couldn’t happen, I point out a book for you. It’s called THE ONLY GIRL IN THE WORLD by Maude Juliet. Her father was a FREEMASON who groomed an adopted child to be his husband. When the girl gave birth to Maude, he then proceeded to try to turn her into a SUPER-HUMAN who would protect him when the apocalypse hit!

            as for her name John....
           </p>
           <p>
            Two years earlier, Pitt, 52, talked about it during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. At the time he made the statement, she was 2. “[Shiloh] only wants to be called John. John or Peter. So it’s a Peter Pan thing,” he said. “So we’ve got to call her John. ‘Shi, do you want...’ - ‘John. I’m John.’ And then I’ll say, ‘John, would you like some orange juice?’ And she goes, ‘No!’ So, you know, it’s just that kind of stuff that’s cute to parents and it’s probably really obnoxious to other people.”

             If she's carrying a blanket and sucking her thumb at six when she's supposed to be this big brash personality, there's a discrepancy in the narrative being told and even more evidence that the assertions made are true.

               It's comforting and a sign of insecurity hence the need for comfort. But pls don't take this out of context. By that I mean, you have to keep in mind EVERYTHING even that a three-year-old wants a dead bird as a pet and to kiss a dead person?

             The know exactly what they're doing with that programming, but first they have to break down the shield that keeps us healthy which is the mind. They do that through abuse and subjecting the child to outright terror. In this case, I strongly suspect that in addition to the tooth extraction that a live animal was sacrificed. It could possibly have been a bird. Hence her requesting to have a dead bird as a pet. In her mind, she's reconciling the death that either she caused or was done in front of her. By keeping it as a pet, her immature mind was saying that the bird wasn't really dead. She was keeping it alive. And kissing a dead person? She might have had to do that. There is a ritual of getting into a coffin. Coffins house dead people.

             This little girl went though hell and nobody stopped it. Mothers are supposed to protect their children, not subject them to torture so they can be an alcoholic, sluttish, skeletal star.

              thanks! i've been here since the pizzagate story broke &amp; i just like to temper the hysteria with a little perspective. we need that. this subject matter will drive you insane, it almost did me, i get so depressed about what they are doing to innocent children. but i think we should just give this kid a break, maybe she reincarnated into an unfamiliar body and realized it at an early age. things aren't always the way they seem. i've been on this planet many, many times! and that fact does not preclude the idea of Jesus or God, both of which i firmly believe in. (know)

                 Why do you keep making stuff up? Once again, when did I ever say I don't believe this stuff happens? My issue is with the poster, not pizzagate. And no, her points are not well founded. She adds waaayyy too much speculation and makes huge leaps to conclusions. But beyond that she has a history of throwing temper tantrums and blocking anyone who dares to disagree with her even if it's done in a  respectful way. I'm not the only one who has seen this and takes issue with her.

            Remember when Angelina said that Shiloh had "Montenegro style" and everyone was like WTF does that mean?    I found an article about it and the photo of Shiloh has a bizarre crop.  Why crop a photo to highlight the torso and crotch of a little kid? Weird

           <p>
            And yeah I always thought that Shiloh's "boy" outfits looked way too contrived with the ties and the bowler hats.  I don't know any little boys who would choose to wear stuff like that casually.

             That is creepy! The fold in the crotch of her pants looks like a bulge. Totally inappropriate.

            <p>
             Agree about the clothing. The other kids don't wear contrived outfits only Shiloh. If she really wanted to look like her brothers, she'd throw on a t-shirt, jeans and go! I don't see any of them with stupid ties around their necks.

             It's what I felt when I came across this shit. Inside was like KABOOM! I can't stand people torturing/abusing vulnerable souls and that's what this was. It bothers me so much that nobody stopped it. Nobody!

             The three lived in an isolated mansion in northern France, where her father made her undergo endless horrifying endurance tests. Maude had to hold an electric fence without flinching. Her parents locked her in a cellar overnight and ordered her to sit still on a stool in the dark, contemplating death, while rats scurried around her feet.

            I think it’s paramount we get a handle on this most especially where reactions are concerned. We can’t allow ourselves to be gaslighted. That’s what these Cannibal Elites / Gender Nazis will try to do. Tell us our being shocked is NOT NORMAL. It is!!!

               “Raised by her father (Eric Bana) in the Finnish wilderness, teenage Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) has trained all her life to be the perfect assassin. Her father sends her on a mission, and she stealthily makes her way across Europe while evading agents sent after her by a ruthless operative named Marissa (Cate Blanchett), who once worked with Hanna's father. As she draws closer to her target, Hanna faces startling revelations about her existence and begins to question her humanity.”
Really fvcked up and sad that kids are subjected to this.

                It is a tragedy. You wonder why the parents checked their humanity at the door. They're incredibly miserable people to foist their unhappiness on their children. Oh, and I didn't include this link because of the constraints, but Whoreangelina actually hated Shiloh when she was born because she hadn't been traumatzed and was happy. Here. This is how fucked up that bitch is:

                 Wow I never saw that article before and that quote is horrendous. It’s so obvious that even she is programmed herself as the media keeps playing upon that whole privileged white stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One thing I’ll never understand is the the whole concept the Illuminati Freemasonry Kabbalah Satanic indoctrination has is that u must go through hell to become enlightened. I think they’re masking it to brainwash members into believing the torture and mind control hell is good because u will reach true enlightenment in the end but it does no greater good whatsoever!! It is just a control mechanism for them to use one as a puppet to carry out their orders.

                  Exactly. Very well stated.

                 <p>
                  Pretty much everyone is searching for enlightenment so the tactic has worked for centuries. The thing is the "creatures" that lead these groups and dole out the torture are so NOT enlightened, but I don't think the hypocrisy is seen. They only see the positions of power these people have attained and t doesn't go much further than that.

                      I don't understand how a piece of human scum rises to the level of receiving accolades and honors. it's a twisted joke, but that's what Satanism is. The upheaval and twisting of all our values. Intelligence, diligence, compassion, and the ability to do good are what our society is based on, but Satanism extols the opposite of that.

                       The whole movie / music industry is trash. They steal intellectual property of real people without compensation, and then choose from their cast of characters to act or perform the piece. I have seen it happen over and over.

                      <p>
                       They cannot operate if they do not separate themselves from all that is good. They literally worship satan, and perform acts that are blasphemy in God's eyes.

                       Have you put on Disney channel lately? I watched 15 minutes of it the other day and it was disgusting. Sexualization of little girls, dialogue with sexual innuendo spoken by kids, etc etc. Sick.

                       The media (TV, movies, music) is promoting a satanic way of life disguised as hedonism, enlightenment. Who else are they going to use to promote this stuff, other than fellow satanists? Like I said in another thread, the good people are weeded out. If you object to rape, violence, murder, child abuse, etc, your objection will be noted and you will not make it to the top. Top actors, musicians are made to participate in evil (and illegal) acts for blackmail purposes. They (the cult) will not let someone rise to superstar status that they (the cult) can't control through blackmail. It's that simple. And if you don't want to go along with it, move over, they have thousands of others who will do anything to climb that ladder.

                        Absolutely true. It's what a few notable singers/actors have tried to say. And a great way to get control is get the person on drugs. Once you're on drugs, you're not thinking normally, and you become uber vulnerable. I keep saying it being healthy, both mentally and physically, is a shield against this shit. You can't really be healthy, and crawl around shagging anything that moves in these free-for-all sexual rituals. When Whoreangelina is talking about the S&amp;M, it turns my stomach and she's extolling it? You're damn right, we don't understand, Whoreangelina!  Nope, not for all the money in the world.
