<p>There are counter claims, however, that the show itself contains many inaccuracies and fabrications.

<p>&quot;The Search for Satan -- Fourteen Years Later&quot;  describes in detail how many of the claims made on the show were shown to be false, including in a court of law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AUTHOR NOTE: In my initial review of PBS Frontline’s “The Search for Satan” for Treating Abuse Today I reported some of the problems I had discovered in this documentary: (1) In several clips, producer Bikel flashed a quick shot of a document and narrowed the camera focus to one statement. Using the pause button, I was able to read the rest of the document. There I learned that Mary Shanley was not, as the producers claimed, “having a normal life and doing normal things” before her hospitalization in Houston. (2) The film contained a surprising number of recreated scenes which were not labeled as such. (3) A supposedly direct quote from FBI agent Ken Lanning had been edited. (4) A call to the State of Illinois revealed that Shanley had not been “listed with the State of Illinois as a child abuser,” nor had her teaching certificate been listed as “restrictive.” (5) I did some research and found the producers failed to mention that Shanley had been hospitalized at four different hospitals and received a diagnosis of “mixed personalities.”</p>
<p>I titled my review “Smoke and Mirrors,” and it appeared in the Jan/Feb 1996 issue of Treating Abuse Today.</p>
<p>Two years later, the women featured in the film, Shanley and Pat Burgus, had both settled their lawsuits against their therapists. Shanley’s case settled with a gag order in place. Malpractice carrier AIG and two others had settled Burgus’s case for $10.6 million .The medical license of Burgus’s psychiatrist was suspended for two years. Five of Shanley’s mental health care providers were indicted on federal fraud and conspiracy charges.</p>
<p>I flew down to Houston in September of 1998 to cover the trial in federal court, and was in the courtroom when Shanley was on the witness stand. During cross-examination, defense attorney Rusty Hardin discredited virtually all of the claims Shanley had made in “Search.” Shanley acknowledged she recalled memories of cult abuse long before she met the defendants, and could not name any false memories that Peterson had supposedly implanted. The government rested its case after five months. All charges against the five defendants were then dismissed.</p>

            Unbelievable! Goddammit Frontline was fake news'ing it over 2 decades ago. That's realization for all that the nwo/satanic cabals have had their tentacles in taxpayer funded and government run PBS FULLY in 95 at least...
           </p>
           <p>
            Great article in response to the episode! It was basically even less true than a fictional novel because PBS was feeding us the opposite of truth. Sad
           </p>
           <p>
            Did find it both amusing and telling about the producer shedding criticism by demanding people answer to the facts she's uncovered in the documentary! If that ain't a perfectly played maneuver from Hillary mentor (who dedicated this book to lucifer) "rules for radicals " then I don't know what is!

            Well, these poor women were taken advantage of by their doctors.  They wanted to bilk the insurance companies because they had 1M in coverage.  It is really sad that they ruined Mary/s life, for while taking the money, they also brainwashed her husband and child.  She has no contact with them now because they believe she may kill them.  The other woman, her sons will probably have problems in their teen years due to what they had to endure.  Mary is suing the doctors.  They should have their licenses taken away forever.  They poisoned the minds of people watching this program into believing the SRA does not exist, when it does.  Dr. Hammond is the one that was on to the real story of SRA, being Mind Control by the Intelligence Agencies.  MK Ultra, Project Monarch.  Propaganda Brainwashing of the Public.

             That show wasn't recent, but from 1995, and if you look at the link I posted from S.M.A.R.T., it says that a lot of things claimed by the women, as well as other things claimed in the show, weren't true. For one thing, it's claimed in the show that Mary didn't have memories of being abused in a cult until her therapists suggested that she'd been abused in a cult, when it reportedly came out in court, when Mary testified under oath, that she did have memories of being abused in a cult before ever meeting her therapists.

               Well, that's what PBS/Frontline claimed. They made it sound like the diagnosis of multiple personalities/dissociative identity disorder and claims of Satanic ritual abuse were just made up for a profit motive. It was their way of dismissing the whole possibility of SRA as ridiculous.
              </p>

            I doesn't matter if a person is religious or an Atheist the point is these sick fucks believe this satanic stuff and do these disgusting sick twisted and evil rituals, maybe they don't believe it and just do it to get their kicks, but what they're doing for kicks is still abuse, the point is just because you don't believe in religion doesn't mean people don't do stuff like this.

             Agreed. It could be like role playing games, or adults acting as "furries." And victims are less likely to be believed.
