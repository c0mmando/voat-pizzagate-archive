<p>This is where it gets interesting. If you do a search on Joseph T Scheve, it shows that he was the Business Manager of New Hope Educational Institute, located on 7009 Varnum Street.

<p>Guess who runs the Women\'s Federation for World Peace? It is run by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hak_Ja_Han">Hak Ja Han</a>, the current leader of the &quot;Moonie&quot; cult of the <em>Unification Church</em>. She became the leader after her husband, Sun Myung Moon, the founder of the cult, died in 2012.</p>
<p>So what\'s the Unification Church all about? Let\'s hear what Steven Hassan, a former victim of the cult has to say about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>STEVE HASSAN: Little did I know, within a few weeks I would be told to drop out of school, donate my bank account, look at Moon as my true parent, and believe my parents were Satan. I didn\'t even believe in Satan until I met the group. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/moonie-cult-leader">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/moonie-cult-leader</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Unification Church is speculated by some to be directly related to the recent cult-leader puppet scandal regarding South Korea\'s president: <a href="http://archive.is/qqFpg">http://archive.is/qqFpg</a> <a href="http://archive.is/7uVFr">http://archive.is/7uVFr</a></p>
<p>The next door neighbor to the Unification Church happens to be the Scottish Rite Church of Freemasonry, if that adds to the shadiness.</p>

<p>It appears that Joseph Scheve and Nellie Hubbard owned several properties.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, a blogger was discussing about the &quot;Borf Building&quot; that was being built in 1644 North Capitol Street, NW. One of the commenters discovered that the owners were Joseph T. Scheve and Nellie Hubbard. Let\'s have a look at what it looks like today.</p>

<p>Oh, isn\'t that a fancy entrance! An entrance with a...<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Peace_sign.svg/220px-Peace_sign.svg.png"> peace symbol</a>? No, a peace symbol doesn\'t have 5 pointers. This symbol closely resembles an <a href="http://www.oocities.org/ring549/redbaphomet.jpg">inverted pentacle</a>, one of the main symbols for Satanism and/or Freemasonry. </p>
<p>Conveniently, the Unification Church and the Freemasons Church, Scottish Rite, are next door neighbors located in the center of DC.</p>

<p>Hmm...  Nellie owns a fancy place called the &quot;Blooming Gardens&quot;. Her other house, located right near New Hope Academy, appears to have more than 15 residents, comprised mostly of &quot;Scheves&quot; and &quot;Hubbards&quot;. There\'s a big discrepancy in the cleanliness of the two properties, which strikes as odd.</p>
<p>Several properties surrounding the New Hope Academy have excessive amounts of residents listed, which raised speculations from the anonymous tipper. Could the children be held captive in this area? Here are some other examples: <a href="http://archive.is/0xNjT">http://archive.is/0xNjT</a></p>

           Hmm...  Nellie owns a fancy place called the "Blooming Gardens". Her other house, located right near New Hope Academy, appears to have more than 15 residents, comprised mostly of "Scheves" and "Hubbards". There's a big discrepancy in the cleanliness of the two properties, which strikes as odd.
          </p>
          <p>
           Several properties surrounding the New Hope Academy have excessive amounts of residents listed, which raised speculations from the anonymous tipper. Could the children be held captive in this area? Here are some other examples:

           The academy also has a branch operation in Haiti, and promotes a scholarship program called the Gambia Project, which is stated to be in partnership with Women’s Federation for World Peace, which it notes, "greatly helps with facilitating this program".

            Could he be referring to the Jehovas Witness "Watch Tower"?  Could be a front for sex trafficking like Catholicism.

            "A years-long investigation into allegations of child sex abuse in the Jehovah's Witness organization has also uncovered a culture of secrecy at its Watchtower headquarters in Brooklyn.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last summer, Donald Trump's son-in-law, developer Jared Kushner, bought the property. The Jehovah's Witnesses, meanwhile, have been building a massive compound upstate in Warwick, New York, where they plan to relocate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trey Bundy, a reporter for Reveal, from the Center for Investigative Reporting, has been investigating the Watchtower for two years. Watchtower leaders refused to talk to him, but he was able to talk to a former insider about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It's the nerve-center of a multi-billion dollar corporation that has interests in publishing, in real-estate....it's the head of a religion with eight million members, but it's this very secretive place," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bundy says the Jehovah's Witnesses also have a database that potentially contains the names of thousands of child sex abusers."

            I actually have a personal story concering the Moonies! When I was a little girl, about 4 years old at the time, my family went out to San Fran to see my grandmother, who was half Chinese and Native American,  and she had to work extra hours in her business so she took my brother, 5 at the time, and me, to this Temple who had an afterhours daycare. Well, it went pretty well at first, playing out in the back and all of that and then these men and women in purple robes came out and scooped all of us, said it was time to eat. Well we ate some rice and chicken nuggets, and then they cleared everything out on this mat and gave us boxes of pocky, which are dipped wafers in different flavors. I personally like the chocolate and strawberry dipped sticks, but anyways, these guys started throat singing in Korean, neither me or my brother understood because we only spoke Cantonese, English and Hebrew because of my very mixed family, and then they started rocking back and forth like a bunch of cracked out hippies while sticking the pocky sticks up in the air. I remember even as a little kid thinking what is this crap? It was all very very strange.

            If you look at the new house academy preschool pictures there is a little boy throwing up the goat symbol with his hand. I took a screen shot, but I don't know how to put it in this comment.

            This ties in with Captain 20s children on the following post: [

            ]
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like the Moonie cult-building process was borrowed by Alefantis gang where they lure children away from their parents and tell them how bad they are. Maybe that has something to do with all the missing children in VA.

            They were able to stop it en force in Belgium with mass gatherings and in South Korea they removed their president with millions taking to the street... I hold out some hope that they all go to jail, but it's looking more and more likely that we have a French Revolution.

              i'm not sure, i wish we knew which mod was legit so we could give them a heads up at least. I think for the most part we're good. i've seen before when someone posts about an instagram account then suddenly it's private and that shit gives me the creeps how fast they catch on.

            I thought it was really bizarre that the moonie cult is next to the 33rd degree Supreme Council of Scottish Rites Freemasonry.... this isn't just your average shrine... this is a 33 degree sanctioned temple which is a SPECIAL designation.... I also found it strange when you go to the boys town website that the avatar images of boys being carried by what looks like a 33rd degree Shriner freemason as you can see his fez hat and his tassel flowing down:

             http://www.boystown.org/about/Pages/default.aspx
            </a>
            (Look at the avatar image in the middle of the "Boys Town" at the top left)
           </p>
           <p>
            There is some strange connection between Boys Town, Moonie Cult, and this 33rd Degree Freemason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pictures of Shriner Freemasons (which are 33rd Degree Freemasons) for comparison:

              Yes. That goes without saying and that's part of the ruse. They are "so generous and benevolent" that it makes them look so good to the masses on the outside. What is more troubling is the crescent moon and star worn on their fez hats which is satanic (others will disagree and just call it occultic but they have little understanding on this matter) along with an arabic sword and an arabic writing on the fez cap.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason they wear the red fez hat is to pay homage to the slaughter of 50,000 Christians in Morocco in 890 AD. The Arabs rose up and slaughtered the christians in a single day taking the country over and at the time their fez caps were white, then they dipped them in their blood, making them turn red.... what in the world are 33rd degree masons who for the most part all look like white anglo saxon americans from a seemingly christian heritage paying SO much homage to arabs and this specific event? Pretty fucking weird.

                 Also, the Kabbalists and Freemasons are intertwined to this elite Pedo cult somehow but I'm still trying to find smoking guns.... at any rate it's good to know that the Jewish Talmud (not all Jews follow this) actually allows for the raping of children as long as one does it violently and sadistically:

                 Thanks for that. Rather surprising if true, I always thought freemasonry had its origins in the crusades. Which did make this Arabian shrine rather incogruous.

                  They do have their founding in the Templars... but it's more diverse than you think. There are Scottish Rite, English Rite, and French Freemasons... When Freemasonry came to the US the 33 degree system hadn't been created yet. The 33 degree system was instituted by Albert Pike (he's the man responsible from turning Freemasonry from a relatively benign secret society to something WAYYYY more evil).... The Americans (Scottish Rite) Freemasons then created a Shriner order which is the 33rd degree (honorary) sometime in the 1800s.

            Has anyone noticed that CASTELLUM actually means "Watchtower", or a fortification used for signaling?  So many layers of meaning like an onion (tor).

            Yeah - it get's disheartening sometimes watching how these sick fucks seem to get away with it time after time.  However, the more awareness that is brought to the subject the better.

            I have been speaking with a group that deals with missing children in Europe.  Their figures show that 250,000 kids go missing every year from the European zone.  Not as bad as the US and the 800,000 figure you might say.  However, when you realise that 140,000 and 100,000 go missing from the UK and Germany respectively, one must draw some conclusions that there is a much more compelling link to the elites from those nations (the Brit royals are German in essence and the US subsequently grew from these roots too) than the other 26 countries that make up Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you are right in saying that there are pedos all over the world but I believe that the systematic trafficking and exploitation of children is much more centralised than that.  This is not the Hydra monster - if we cut off the main head this would help save a huge percentage of innocent kids from a fate worse than death.
           </p>
           <p>
            As an aside I've been thinking that maybe the French Revolution wasn't just about fiscal equality, but more to do with the sick and perverted acts of the court elites with children that the general public were so disgusted when they found out (Marquis de Sade) they pitch-forked the fuckers onto the guillotines.  Not saying this could also be an option, but...

            That yet again we find an article tying CIA, paedophile and human trafficking, and people associated with PizzaGate.  This is a direct connection and deserves greater investigation.

            We should start a new thread collecting info on human trafficking and paedophilia connected to the Moonies.  I am in work and can't do much but i think this is too coincidental (like all the other coincidences) to write off...

            I was just looking into 1644 North Capitol St the other day. I found the building odd. You can see from this image the way it is constructed is almost to hide the actual building. The building is a facade, literally and figuratively speaking,

              It wasn't me that said that originally, it was someone else on the thread - and of course I know those were the driving directions!! The implication was that the old tunnels could be along that street, I thought?

            Guys I'm on mobile but I think I noticed something important.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the photos off the New Hope Academy, one of the rooms like like the room that was the location of the video National Adoption Day found on Jabbaroos Instagram.  I am away from my desk and can't get on my machine to pull up the pics and video for reference but I'm hoping someone else here can.
           </p>

            Edit
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a link to the photos I'm thinking of.  First image after Preschool Wing.

              I was just looking at those actually... I notice they are smaller sized windows at New Hope than in those Adoption Day pics.  Do you know where to find the archive for the video?  It's been removed everywhere ;/ but will give us a better look at the room.

The same names keep popping up and they are linked with the same activities over and over and over again until the pattern becomes so clear and undeniable, the circumstantial evidence becomes so overwhelming and the picture emerges that is so frightening that it is hard to believe that it is true. The picture that has emerged is that indeed the major institutions of the United States of America,

             During the execution of the warrant at 3918/20 W St., I was able to observe and access the entire building. I saw large quantities of children's clothing and toys. The clothing consisting of diapers and clothes in the toddler to pre-school range. No children were found on the premises. There were several subjects on the premises. Only one was deemed to be connected with the Finders. The rest were renting living space from this individual. He was identified as Stuart Miles SILVERSTONE, DOB/061941, U.S. Passport No. (deleted). SILVERSTONE was located in a room equipped with several computers, printers, and numerous documents.
             <strong>
              Cursory examination of the documents revealed detailed instructions for obtaining children for unspecified purposes.
             </strong>
             The instructions included the impregnation of female members of the community known as the Finders, purchasing children, trading, and kidnapping.
             <strong>
              There were telex messages using MCI account numbers between a computer terminal believed to be located in the same room, and others located across the country and in foreign locations. One such telex specifically ordered the purchase of two children in Hong Kong to be be arranged through a contact in the Chinese Embassy there
             </strong>
             . Another telex expressed interest in "bank secrecy" situations. Other documents identified interests in high-tech transfers to the United Kingdom, numerous properties under the control of the Finders, a keen interest in terrorism, explosives, and the evasion of law enforcement. Also found in the "computer room" was a detailed summary of the events surrounding the arrest and taking into custody of the two adults and six children in Tallahassee the previous night.
             <strong>
              There were also a set of instructions which appeared to be broadcast via a computer network which advised the participants to move "the children" and keep them moving through different jurisdictions, and instructions on how to avoid police attention.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              One of the residents was identified as a Chinese National. Due to the telex discovered referencing the Chinese Embassy in Hong Kong,
             </strong>
             he was fully identified for future reference: WANG/Gengxin, DOB/092747, POB/Tianjin, People's Republic of China Passport No. (deleted), entered the U.S. on January 22, 1987, admitted until December 31, 1987.
             <strong>
              He is in the U.S. as a graduate student in the Anatomy Department of Georgetown University. His Visa was issued on November 10, 1986, in London, England, number 00143.

             I dont know how to find it so forgive my not doing so but that TV segment that JA did with that Kimberly chick about CPP he stated that his pizza oven got to 1100 degrees...not quite the temp you would need for creamation but pretty close if you perhaps used an accelerant of some sort?

              One thing that just occurred to me is that they probably eat the children after they're dead. In that case they would only have to incinerate bones. I don't know the temperature needed for that but I imagine it's less of a hassle to dispense of bones than a whole body. God they gross me out.

             Quick thought, logjam, that hadn't occurred to me before. Do you think when they say "pizza oven" in the context of a residence, that they actually mean a place to burn children when they are done with them? I don't know why, after being part of this investigation if somewhat tangentially, I never realized that as a possibility.

              I gathered that the reporter making a point of saying that  Moon had 6 pizza ovens was eye opening. Also making of mentioning that they never smelled pizza coming from the residence when walking by was peculiar too.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, I don't know
              <em>
               what
              </em>
              to think - but it was pretty odd considering the subject of pizza gate. Also making mention of teachers saying that kids "disappeared overnight" was odd too. The article says they were sent "back home' - but there were nothing indicating that was substantiated. It was like everyone was just saying as they were told.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not syaing they were burning up children - but wtf would there be 6 pizza ovens in a residence, when Comet - a business only has one by the looks of it?
             </p>
             <p>
              I wouldn't be surprised if those children were sold to Alefantis now that I see how things re unfolding.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was an epidemic of children missing at that time. the article is very telling.

               I don't know who to reply to, so I just picked you. When I watched "Shoah", about the Holocaust, they said everything burned, bodies burn easily, except heel bones. Those they have to pulverize. But children, perhaps not. I feel sick, now.

                It's all very hard to believe. What you say is very much a possibility. So is the fact that they could want infant blood. Very hard to believe though.

                 A friend of mine died of cancer at 43. It was a reoccurrence. She felt so low for so long, so they gave her a full transfusion one day. She felt great. She wanted to do things. But it didn't last long. 
That's why I think they've been doing transfusions with young blood a long time. Your blood is purple when you're young. The iron. And if you don't have cancer, it lasts longer, I'm sure.

            I found this interesting:Educational organizations
Cheongshim Graduate School of Theology[18]
CheongShim International Academy
International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences
International Educational Foundation.[19]
New World Encyclopedia — an Internet encyclopedia that, in part, selects and rewrites certain Wikipedia articles through a focus on Unification values.[20] It "aims to organize and present human knowledge in ways consistent with our natural purposes"[21] and "to promote knowledge that leads to happiness, well-being, and world peace."[22]
Paragon House, book publishing.[23]
The Professors World Peace Academy was founded in 1973 by Sun Myung Moon,[24] who declared the group's intent to "contribute to the solutions of urgent problems facing our modern civilization and to help resolve the cultural divide between East and West". PWPA now has chapters in over one hundred countries.[25]
Sun Hwa Arts School
Sun Moon University[26]
Sun MyungFederation
itute[27]
High School of the Pacific in Kealakekua, Hawaii[28]
The Unification Theological Seminary in Barrytown, New York was founded in 1975. Its purpose is to train members from around the world as leaders and theologians in the church.[29]
Blessed Teens Academy—Greeley, Colorado [30]
New Hope Academy—Landover Hills, Maryland, USA. "Although New Hope Academy was founded in 1990 by members of the Unification faith, it is not a sectarian school. No doctrines are taught; in fact, no classes in religion are offered.However morning services are mandatory,during services discussions about religious doctrines, hymns, and group prayers all take place. We believe it is the job of parents—with the support of their church, temple, or mosque—to impart their personal faith to their child." [31][32]

            Wow... this is insane. The connections, the property records, the pure volume of circumstantial evidence that is contained in this. Most of which is solidified and verified without much room for interpretation.
           </p>
           <p>
            These individuals should be forced to address some of the findings... I don't know how. I have little faith that law enforcement will do anything (FBIAnon had mentioned that to proceed with charges would up-end the global power structure and ours eyes would fall out if we knew the full extent). I have even less faith that the media will do their job and dig.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if an investigation moved ahead, I'm confident CNN would be focused on Donald Trump's hair and how bad Russia is.

             One comment about the
             <strong>
              Moonie connection
             </strong>
             is that one of the accounts linked to
             <strong>
              JimmetComet's instagram
             </strong>
             was, IIRC, mrsoliar.  That account had a pic of
             <strong>
              Choi Soon Sil
             </strong>
             on it, the woman leading the cult that caused the recent impeachment of the South Korean President.  I posted about this on voat maybe a week ago but it appears to have been deleted...  This means Alefantis is doubly connected to Korean cultism.

               Not necessarily always true. You'd be surprised the things people turn up here that may have not been on the radar. Not the big picture per se, but a lot of these bizarre connections they may not have info on bc, quite frankly it's not needed for prosecution, but don't ever doubt there is stuff added here that could be used to bolster the circumstantial evidence/connections. 
And the FBI doesn't prosecute. They just recommend prosecution which is why they have to wait for an honest DOJ who will actually do their DAMN JOB!

               Explains why I couldn't find some articles that I'd earlier referenced about the FBI Agent that was paranoid about a police officer in Michigan, at the Planet Fitness. Here's my search, you can see they once did run these, with those headlines explaining why the FBI guy shot.

               Here's a couple pages I clicked that had gotten rid of articles, I was so pissed off I didn't go checking them all, but the articles pointing to a paranoid agent have been pulled. People were undoubtedly asking why the hell an agent would be afraid of an officer at all.

               There are some good guys in the FBI. Watch George Webb's videos. He is getting help from active and inactive FBI. They are probably waiting for Trump to take office.

              I would hope so! Cops, FBI, CIA, AG, Comey, everyone... I have no clue what jurisdictional requirements are in place. I'm assuming a cop from WA state (where I'm from) can't just hop on a plane and start knocking on doors in DC.

               Don't you guys have something in your constitution that permits citizens to take action and assemble some kind of law-making body or court if your government turns out to be evil sociopathic thieving murdering child raping satanist cannibals? Or even if they just turned out to be something more run-of-the-mill-evil, like Hitler and the Nazis, Mussolini and the Fascists, or Stalin and the Communists or something? I thought one of the main arguments in favour of no gun control is that you need arms in case your government goes nuts so you can defend yourselves? Well, your government is 100% nuts, doo lally, human-centipede levels of insane. Can't you get something done legally?

                Yes... sure, but, not without concrete evidence or support from law enforcement/intelligence agencies to gather said evidence. We can't just stage a coup based on forum posts and independent research of circumstantial evidence. No matter how much is gathered.

                Yes this is true.... but we need things to hit critical mass before we took up such actions... if citizens in other countries like South Korea and Belgium were to figure out this is going on in their countries too and were to rise up... it would help our case. Safety in numbers.... this has the potential of boiling over into a French Revolution style of uprising which we should try to avoid if possible.

             Exactly. That's how we know it's not really a museum. The address was found to be owned by JA, and on investigating the address it was found to be listed as Pegasus museum on google maps. That's the only reference to it as a museum online.

             It's a building James Alefantis owns. The papers say it's a "museum". It's right by the park we keep talking about. That is where we think the kill room is located.

             It's a front.  Not a "museum".  That's a distinguished name to identify the place for those in the know.  JA had it labelled on google locations until about Dec 17, when he removed it, presumably because of track-covering.  It's some kind of transfer station, it appears to me.

              If it's a front then it should at least be masquerading as an actual museum for something though. What is it supposed to be?

            I had forgotten about the Moonies til I watched a documentary the other day titled "Deprogrammed". Great find redberries! And my daughter has been dabbling in the universalist Church so... Interesting stuff.

            Problem: Sun Myung Moon, the founder of the Moonies, also founded the Washington Times. The Washington Times is the paper responsible for breaking the Franklin Scandal with their 1989 story about a homosexual pedophile prostitute ring in DC. Why would a paper connected to such things allow such an article to be printed and saved for posterity?

             a number of reasons.  I think the fact that they broke the story is just another confirmation of suspicions. perhaps preempt an escaped victim leaking it thus controlling the narrative,  punishment or warning for a conspirator getting out of line, a show of control or power.
            </p>
            <p>
             and what was the end result of the Franklin case?  IIRC only people that went to jail were a couple victims... and the rest withdrew their complaints to avoid jail. seems very telling

             I think back then the media was less controlled by the interests of their funders/owners than they are now. Far more investigative reporting and exposure of state crime was done back then as far as I can tell. I think the process of completely infiltrating the media and ensuring that only clueless/brainwashed/in-on-it and too-lazy-to-do-any-proper-reporting journalists are employed has happened over the past 30 years or so.

             Not sure if these properties have been submitted. I found them on a website. They had found Pegasus about a month ago. Have not confirmed these addresses to be owned by JA yet. Just wanted to put out there what I have found. I will provide link if anyone wants it. It is dated 12-17-16.:  turns out that James Alefantes, the pizza shop guy, owns way more property than his BF surfer buddy Brock. First off, there’s the Pegasus museum under development by Castellum Alefantes LLC on 11th Street NW in D.C. The land is apparently still owned by a Russian emigre named Boris Tochilin, who has since moved to Dumfries, Virginia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then, there’s the big rowhouse in the Embassy Row area on California Street in Kalorama, formerly shared with ex-partner David Brock.
            </p>
            <p>
             Next in McLean, Virginia, the hometown of the CIA and George Bush Center for Intelligence, Alefantes owns four buildings: 6513 Brawner, 117 Randolph Road, 49 Chain Bridge Road, and another on 7703 Dearborn.
            </p>
            <p>
             At Harrisonburg, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley, a town with a lot of schools and a heavy concentration of sex offenders, near the West Virginia state line, there are two addresses: 1352 Bradley Drive and 148 W. Wolfe Street.
            </p>
            <p>
             Washington D.C. in the Northwest quadrant, four properties: 1536 Swann, 1404 P ST, 3334 N ST, 455 Massachusetts Avenue, and 2022 Columbia Road (near Dupont Circle).
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, in New York’s Upper East Side: 145 E 48th ST #29F.

            That's some nice work. If you get a chance can you check out my post? The person I found ended up being a Facebook friend of Alefantis. I don't think I made my title flashy enough though.

             I added some randomness to your post too. I suck at formatting - I've mainly only commented a few times, but I added anything that seemed to have any connection to the area around the Pilgrimage Church and some businesses around there that may or may not be of interest.

             It's not that your title isn't flashy, it's not very descriptive of what people are looking at and how it ties into the investigation. (Not that it doesn't, it's just that people have a tough time investing a bunch of energy just to figure out if a post is worth reading or not, and then they have to spend more to actually follow the leads.)
