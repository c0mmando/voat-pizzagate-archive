            Here's a reply that I found scrolling down the thread:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Obviously I don't believe in some red, horned creature named Satan. But if you view "Satan" as a metaphor, it's a force that would thrive in industries like entertainment, politics, law, etc.. I live in DC and I see it everyday."

            Here's context, left earlier by the same submitter, for the post OP mentions:
           </p>
           <p>
            The satanic side of the entertainment industry
           </p>
           <p>
            "Little known fact, but the entertainment industry and politics are literally controlled by high ranking satanists. Yes, I said satanists - Lucifer worshiping, child sacrificing, black magick practicioning, blood drinking satanists. On the surface and in the mainstream, their agenda manifests itself in the casting couch, abuse of child stars and the excesses that come with fame - drugs, prostitution, criminality, etc,
All (100%) of the high profile celebrities, past and present) are caught in this web. From Mary Pickford, Fatty Arbuckle, Paul Robeson down to Bob Hope and now the Kardashians. They've been sucked into this underground. You cannot maintain fame without stepping into the ring of fire. But as we all know, the devil is a liar. So ultimately, he wants his tribute, and if you're not willing to hold up your end of the bargain, there will literally be hell to pay. Just ask Britney, Kurt, DMX, Marilyn Monroe, The Kennedy brothers, Dana Plato, Dave Chapelle, Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna &amp; Mr. Cosby."

            I love DataLounge too. And OH BUT BUT...there indeed WAS a TERRIFIC PizzaG thread that was getting juicier and juicier until it was suddenly and mysteriously DELETED.
I just tried even doing a search for DL threads/conversations talking about the fact that the original PizzaGate thread had been deleted and even THEY weren't  coming up in Google...
DL=Gay Queens....PizzaGate=Gay Queens....hmmmm
