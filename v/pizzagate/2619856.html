            Roseanne Barr is part of the show. She cannot be Trusted to any degree, including the degrees of her Freemasonry ties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is also a Freemason. Do you believe there are 'Good Luciferians and Bad Luciferians'?

            Welcome to the real show. You are all the audience being told when to applaud and when to laugh. Are you not entertained?

             Equating Rosanne with Trump.   Hilarious.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, you're such a genius, tell us how the show ends.  Because it looks like Trump is upending hundreds of years of work by the Freemasons.  He is leading an awakening not controlling an old, tried and true narrative. Why not just sell the great economy to the masses, if you're the MSM? Why tear down the FBI and the CIA if this is all just a LARP? Why invite Brennan and Clapper in on the joke, along with Killary and Obama?  Trump is on the same side as all these traitors?  Yeah... I think you're full of shit.

              Trump and Roseanne are both Zionists pledging allegiance to Israel First.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump and Roseanne both have Freemason connections with Trump admitting that he is a Mason.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump has not said or done anything to reveal or expose the Freemasons and other secret societies, quite the opposite.
             </p>
             <p>
              What awakening? Do you mean more divide and conquer? What great economy? Do you mean the giant bubble, two class system, and oligopolies in every major industry and the corrupt public private "partnerships"?
             </p>
             <p>
              When did Trump tear down the F_I and C_A? Remember who he has appointed along the way? Trust Wray? Trust Sessions?
             </p>
             <p>
              When did Hillary and Obama get locked up? When did her emails get published?

               40,000 sealed indictments.  RICO  /  Gee, I wonder why holding jury trials would not work on this case. Could it be the Courts are full of pedophiles and traitors?

                Name calling is used by those who cannot back it up. With a name like Ian we can guess what a "tough" guy you must be.
               </p>
               <p>
                You think this has only been going on for 50 years? You must not know much about secret societies, religions, and corporations. You also must not know much about international law and jurisdiction. You must not know about the color of law or diplomatic immunity. Did RICO work on the mafia? What about the Vatican? Why haven't Google or Facebook faced RICO charges yet? What happened with the mortgage crisis? Who controls the food supply? Why did Trump accept so much money from the Rothschilds and marry his only real daughter to the Kushners? How has Trump acted toward Israel so far in his presidency?
               </p>
               <p>
                The only worthwhile timeline is immediate. Anything less is useless. Time is not on our side, and Trump is busy making deals with luciferians, child rapists and murderers.
               </p>
               <p>
                You think Freemason Trump is draining the swamp? He has only helped to cover it up. Look at all of his appointments. Read his spineless tweets. Watch him praise known criminals and murderers. 5d chess?
               </p>
               <p>
                You think Hillary and Obama are going to face military tribunals? When do you think that will happen exactly? You think they will be rounded up in the dark of night, or surrender peacefully? Do the Bushes get a free pass as they celebrate George and Barbara's lives while more children are sacrificed? How many murdered children and families are acceptable while we wait for the swamp draining to begin?
               </p>
               <p>
                The courts are corrupt and worthless, and the military is no better. You know their history, right? Do you know who Michael Aquino is?
               </p>
               <p>
                The only answer is a Global Revolution. Name calling doesn't work in a real fight or war. Neither do sealed indictments, and there are a lot more than 40,000 people involved.
               </p>
               <p>
                Trump makes it at least 40.001.
               </p>
               <p>
                Let's make a bet - we will give you a year for the tribunals to start, or do you need longer? If there are no tribunals by then, will you agree to a public bareknuckle fight so we can all see what how tough a guy named Ian who calls people with the real truth names really is?
               </p>

                  Trump is a Zionist putting Israel First. He is not draining any swamp. He is a globalist who is friends with child rapists and murderers. Look who he just appointed to the Supreme Court. He has only appointed more swamp creatures. He is making deals with Luciferians to cover up extreme corruption and tyranny so the people don't figure it out before they implement 5G surveillance and control. Trump is bought and sold by his masters including but not limited to the Rothschilds.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Yet despite all the obvious, you support Trump and believe he is draining the swamp. Then you have the nerve to call others all kinds of names including Jews?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Jesus is the only way. Truth is how the world will rid of Evil once they figure out what is really at stake. Trump is not a savior.

              SiriusXM went on a DMCA spree, taking down entire Howard Stern archives.  I don't twitter either.  I tried asking her several times through Youtube comments.  She never replies, but she did give my comment a little flair heart icon thing.
