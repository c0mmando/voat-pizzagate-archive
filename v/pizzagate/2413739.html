<p>Found a couple of squirrelly things tonight and this is one of them. The first question is, WTH has this movie been? And was it written by someone in the know? Are these monsters bragging again? Have no idea, but here\'s the intel on RECLAIM: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaim_(film)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaim_(film)</a></p>
<p>After a car accident that left her unable to have children, Shannon (Rachelle Lefevre) and her husband, Steven (Ryan Phillippe), decide to adopt a Haitian girl, Nina, orphaned after the 2010 earthquake, through the IRA (International Rescue Adoption), an organization run by Gabrielle Reigert (Jacki Weaver) and based in Puerto Rico. ...</p>
<p>Benjamin then suggests that the IRA is a confidence schemer which offers orphans to unsuspecting couples in exchange for a hefty sum of money, only to take them away just a few days afterward. That night, Steven and Shannon are kidnapped by Benjamin and his aides, who reveal themselves to be child traffickers working for Reigert. Holding Nina, they force the couple to send their entire savings, which is largely compensation for the car accident that left them unable to conceive. ...</p>
<p>The film ends with a text showing the viewers that 1.2 million children are being trafficked each year with a quote: &quot;They are invisible and they are everywhere.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Screenplay was written by Luke Davies. He won GQ\'s Creative Force of the Year, but why wouldn\'t he? Colin Kaepernick was GQ\'s Citizen of the Year!!!! <em>barf</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, if Kaepernick is that much of a big-mouthed citizen, then why the hell isn\'t he talking and rescuing these trafficked kids that are so visible? But back to Davies. </p>
<p>Davis was the author that wrote CANDY. The 2006 film starred ... <em>drum roll</em> Heath Ledger. The film was about two heroin addicts so a heroin addict played a heroin addict. The other thing is that the film was autobiographical and not fiction, something Davies ex-wife objected to. Seems she had a breakdown when she learned .... *another drum roll please * ... that her sister had been adopted out. REALLY? </p>

<p>Re: Ledger. Here\'s about a story about a video secretly made at Hollywood hotel Chateau Marmont:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/18/john-cusack-raven-poe-interview">https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/18/john-cusack-raven-poe-interview</a></p>
<p>&quot;He was really into heroin.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you go down that road, then it gets really scary because all of sudden you shoot up, you take heroin, then you do a line of cocaine and then you take sleeping pills.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at River Phoenix - he died exactly the same way.&quot;</p>
<p>The revelations came after top-rating US entertainment programs Entertainment Tonight and The Insider last night announced that they would drop plans to air a video of the actor snorting cocaine with a rolled-up bill at Hollywood hotel Chateau Marmont &quot;out of respect for Heath Ledger\'s family&quot;.
The video was taped without Ledger\'s knowledge following the SAG Awards in January 2006, where he had been nominated for best actor for his performance as a gay cowboy in Brokeback Mountain but lost to Capote star Philip Seymour Hoffman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could swear that Chateau Marmont was involved in another sordid story involving Lindsey Lohan. Wasn\'t it a hook-up with some famous female star? Or singer? Yeah, Lady MONSTER Vomitorium Gaga.</p>

<p>Girls just want to have fun! Lady Gaga shares pictures from THAT slumber party with Lindsay Lohan (and they both look a little bleary-eyed)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Davies film was LION which was written for Tom Hanks so Davies is on a liberal track to hell. </p>
<p>Anyway, I started getting into Coosuck\'s film history. I\'ll repeat a little something about how he and Reiner became besties when he first moved to PedoWood. Nope, nothing suspicious at all. </p>

<p>“People would look after you when I was a kid,” Cusack said. “There were good people in the business. When I came to L.A., Rob Reiner said: ‘Come stay at my house.’ He taught me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taught him what? Coosuck isn\'t saying. But he went on to star in Reiner\'s films: THE SURE THING and
STAND BY ME. but how did that happen? Did he mention sharing a bathroom? Nope! It was magic! </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/18/john-cusack-raven-poe-interview">https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/18/john-cusack-raven-poe-interview</a></p>
<p>&quot;I was 16 years old,&quot; he says of the 80s. &quot;I don\'t remember much. I got a couple of roles by being in the right place at the right time in that I was a teenage actor who had some chops and some training and there was a vogue for movies about kids. And then I parlayed that into a lead in a Rob Reiner movie [The Sure Thing] and suddenly I was doing leads.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait ... did someone say? STAND BY ME? </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I didn\'t realize Coosuck was in that movie, but like I said in the other post, he\'s been flying under our radar ... or at least mine. I feel it\'s important because these PedoWooders are one big happy family and Coosuck was sharing Reiner\'s digs ... and his best friend, The Nastiest Man in Hollywood, Jeremy Pivens was in .... <em>third call for a drum roll</em> ... LUCAS! </p>

<p>So you have Coosuck working with Rob Reiner and Corey Feldman on STAND BY ME ... and you have Coosuck\'s bff Jeremy Piven working with Corey Haim ... hmmmm .... Further we know Feldman is a fucking little handler who was always introducing Haim to the wrong people. It was in my previous post. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/304747/greg-harrison-corey-haim-feldman-pedophile/">https://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/304747/greg-harrison-corey-haim-feldman-pedophile/</a>
   Corey Haim’s friend accuses Corey Feldman of covering up for the real abuser</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Corey Feldman spoke out about an unnamed Hollywood pedophile that is still prominent in the industry who raped his then-best friend and frequent co-star Corey Haim at the age of 11. ...</p>
<p>Corey Haim’s mother, Judy Haim, subsequently threatened legal action against Feldman for discussing the molestation claims regarding her son. Lending his voice to the chorus of Feldman detractors is Greg Harrison, who claims to be friends with Judy Haim and one of Corey Haim’s closest friends throughout “the last twenty years of his life.” In a public Facebook post, Harrison wrote that:
   Feldman introduced Haim to his rapist and that Feldman and the abuser tried to cover it up.</p>
<p>Harrison named the actor-director who allegedly raped Haim and it’s definitely not an A-list recognizable Hollywood icon that Radar Online teased. “What I am about to say is not my opinion,” wrote Harrison, “it comes straight from the mouth of Corey Haim.” ...</p>
<p>Let me take you back on this famous timeline, when Corey Haim was around 15 years old when he first moved to LA, to act in a little movie that was to be called, The Lost Boys. It was Corey Feldman who introduced him to Actor – Director and Pedophile XXXXX XXXXX. It is also public record in many interviews that Feldman did and is no secret, that Feldman was jealous of Haim. Corey Feldman introduced this pedophile to Haim and a lot of other boys.</p>
<p>Now let me bring you back on the famous timeline to 1997 and a little film called, “Busted.” One day Corey Haim went to the set of “Busted” with his mother Judy Haim. When Judy and Corey Haim arrived on set, they saw both Corey Feldman and XXXXXX XXXXXXX. Corey Haim had not seen XXXXXX in years. Judy Haim witnessed her son enraged saying, “What the Hell is he doing here?”. Corey Haim slammed and pinned Feldman against a wall and said, “I’m out of here man!” Judy Haim was a witness to this fight and also heard Feldman say, “Oh come on man, I thought you might like this!” Corey Feldman had arranged all of this even though he knew about the abuse that Haim had endured from XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. Corey Haim and Judy left the set that day. The next day Corey Feldman told the media that he had to fire Corey Haim because of drugs. This is yet another example of the many lies and abusive manipulation of twisting the truth that Judy and I have come accustom to seeing and experiencing from Corey Feldman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s not really a stretch. Oh, and proof that Coonutsuck and Piven are friends -- or were: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/jeremy-piven-the-worst-reputation-in-hollywood/news-story/357caa8aad9238290c5d5e6025e314ba">http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/jeremy-piven-the-worst-reputation-in-hollywood/news-story/357caa8aad9238290c5d5e6025e314ba</a></p>
<p>Even so, that didn’t stop him extracting a reported $5.7 million AUD deal for his part in the 2015 Entourage movie. The arrangement kicked off a squabble between producer Mark Wahlberg and other cast members who were paid less.He has even managed to lose one of his closest friends since childhood, fellow actor John Cusack. Piven and Cusack, who attended a theatre school run by Jeremy’s parents, fell out when Piven landed the role in Entourage and finally matched his pal’s level of Hollywood fame.</p>

           Taught him what? Coosuck isn't saying. But he went on to star in Reiner's films: THE SURE THING and
STAND BY ME. but how did that happen? Did he mention sharing a bathroom? Nope! It was magic!

            "I was 16 years old," he says of the 80s. "I don't remember much. I got a couple of roles by being in the right place at the right time in that I was a teenage actor who had some chops and some training and there was a vogue for movies about kids. And then I parlayed that into a lead in a Rob Reiner movie [The Sure Thing] and suddenly I was doing leads."

           I didn't realize Coosuck was in that movie, but like I said in the other post, he's been flying under our radar ... or at least mine. I feel it's important because these PedoWooders are one big happy family and Coosuck was sharing Reiner's digs ... and his best friend, The Nastiest Man in Hollywood, Jeremy Pivens was in ....

           So you have Coosuck working with Rob Reiner and Corey Feldman on STAND BY ME ... and you have Coosuck's bff Jeremy Piven working with Corey Haim ... hmmmm .... Further we know Feldman is a fucking little handler who was always introducing Haim to the wrong people. It was in my previous post.

            Corey Haim’s friend accuses Corey Feldman of covering up for the real abuser
           </p>
           <p>
            Earlier this year, Corey Feldman spoke out about an unnamed Hollywood pedophile that is still prominent in the industry who raped his then-best friend and frequent co-star Corey Haim at the age of 11. ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Corey Haim’s mother, Judy Haim, subsequently threatened legal action against Feldman for discussing the molestation claims regarding her son. Lending his voice to the chorus of Feldman detractors is Greg Harrison, who claims to be friends with Judy Haim and one of Corey Haim’s closest friends throughout “the last twenty years of his life.” In a public Facebook post, Harrison wrote that:
   Feldman introduced Haim to his rapist and that Feldman and the abuser tried to cover it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Harrison named the actor-director who allegedly raped Haim and it’s definitely not an A-list recognizable Hollywood icon that Radar Online teased. “What I am about to say is not my opinion,” wrote Harrison, “it comes straight from the mouth of Corey Haim.” ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me take you back on this famous timeline, when Corey Haim was around 15 years old when he first moved to LA, to act in a little movie that was to be called, The Lost Boys. It was Corey Feldman who introduced him to Actor – Director and Pedophile XXXXX XXXXX. It is also public record in many interviews that Feldman did and is no secret, that Feldman was jealous of Haim. Corey Feldman introduced this pedophile to Haim and a lot of other boys.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now let me bring you back on the famous timeline to 1997 and a little film called, “Busted.” One day Corey Haim went to the set of “Busted” with his mother Judy Haim. When Judy and Corey Haim arrived on set, they saw both Corey Feldman and XXXXXX XXXXXXX. Corey Haim had not seen XXXXXX in years. Judy Haim witnessed her son enraged saying, “What the Hell is he doing here?”. Corey Haim slammed and pinned Feldman against a wall and said, “I’m out of here man!” Judy Haim was a witness to this fight and also heard Feldman say, “Oh come on man, I thought you might like this!” Corey Feldman had arranged all of this even though he knew about the abuse that Haim had endured from XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. Corey Haim and Judy left the set that day. The next day Corey Feldman told the media that he had to fire Corey Haim because of drugs. This is yet another example of the many lies and abusive manipulation of twisting the truth that Judy and I have come accustom to seeing and experiencing from Corey Feldman.

            Even so, that didn’t stop him extracting a reported $5.7 million AUD deal for his part in the 2015 Entourage movie. The arrangement kicked off a squabble between producer Mark Wahlberg and other cast members who were paid less.He has even managed to lose one of his closest friends since childhood, fellow actor John Cusack. Piven and Cusack, who attended a theatre school run by Jeremy’s parents, fell out when Piven landed the role in Entourage and finally matched his pal’s level of Hollywood fame.

             Did he? Oh, well, then I'm sure he's just soooooo busy filming that movie and telling all ... like how he sold out and handled the star he leeched onto and that was so jealous of. You can't do a search for Corey Haim without his handler's name coming up.

             Well, the fact it's boring is troubling. The reviews all say that the actors weren't turning in a performance. Why would that be? Did they not want people to see this? Or was it one of those films they were ordered to star in. Another Voat member pointed out that actors (like Robin Williams), starred in so many bad films because he was blackmailed into doing it. Same thing here maybe?

              It may have only been interesting if I didn't know the truth and and that it was propaganda. I don't believe the narrative of the movie, which implies people just wanted to adopt a child so badly they would get black child from Haiti...and everything that happened after seemed like making excuses for what really happens.

            Relevancy: Cusack starred in RECLAIM, a movie whose plot is a template for what pizzagate alleges is going on. This post ties this in and reveals Cusack's close relationship with Rob Reiner, another member of the lib Moloch army. Cusack is the linchpin between Reiner, STAND BY ME, Stephen King, Jeremy Piven, Corey Feldman, and prized trophy Corey Haim.

            “People would look after you when I was a kid,” Cusack said. “There were good people in the business. When I came to L.A., Rob Reiner said: ‘Come stay at my house.’ He taught me.   Cusack is moving up on my list.  RR is already way up there.

             And Reiner had alread PICKED Haim for his film. Then Haim got the lead in Lucas. Who knows? He might have only wanted him to stay at his house? And there was Haim drinking beer on the set at only 14. All the better to screw up a kid's head and judgement.

                I am about to be sick.  Another violent disgusting horrific story about a child.  The worst injustice done to Jesus.  He loved little children and wanted us to protect them.  They are the slayers of children and there is nothing worse.

                 Well, it's my theory of another child being destroyed in the manner of Shiloh. Did you know that David Geffen was carrying on an affair with her mother when Chastity was only three or four? Makes you wonder ... I'm convinced the phenomenon of transgenderism comes after a traumatic sexual event in a child's life. But here's the first part. It was too big to fit in one post.

            , for your final act this evening, do you think you could sum this amazing web of slime up in a single sentence, a TL;DR, and stick it at the very top of the post?

            You don't HAVE to, but you've loaded the bases here like a boss, and a home run one-sentence summary would turn this into a grand slam. :-)  What the Pedowood scum call a "
