            No need to apologize. My comment was really off-post as well. I just wanted to get what I had out there without starting a new post because I've been sick and the original poster - 9217 - has done a lot of research. If your comment was not in ettiquette, mine certainly wasn't either :)   I find sometimes new posts get lost in the mix if they don't get 'voted' up. I didn't have enough together to put a cohesive original post so I threw mine in the comments. The very last post I made on Twitter before I got suspended was the post about the UN Secretary General and I had only tweeted a few times that day so I wasn't sure if that struck a nerve or if it was just an anomaly with Twitter.

            I think this is certainly worth delving into more. My Svalbard comment isn't pizzagate related, but as I'm following the Vault 7 stuff on Twitter, I know there are several things that are tied in together. That Svalbard vault looks to possibly have had weapons or something sent from Syria which was then picked up when the vault was opened in October. It was in October that the UN Sec General was going around meeting a lot of heads of states around the country. Then as I was looking up stuff about him, he seemed to tie in with quite a number of things...which led me to UNICEF and all that other stuff.  He may be good as gold...or maybe not. He has had his hands in a lot of things over the years.

            coloboma - Any defect in the iris that allows light to enter the eye
           </p>
           <p>
            To quote from another post
           </p>
           <p>
            Addendum 1: someone else has pointed out that Amanda Kleinman, an insider performer at Alefantis's Comet Pizza, made a creepy video in which pictures of the same eye deformity are used multiple times in rapid succession. So at the very least, it's safe to say these people find some significance in the eye deformity, or rather the underlying genetic condition that sometimes causes the eye deformity. Here is a screen capture of a frozen frame:

            The cult as well as a number of elite families, have a particular interest in those who possess the Coloboma. source:

           </p>
           <p>
            Jacob Rothschild, George Soros, Madeleine McCann, Kate Windsor and Amanda Kleinman share the coloboma marking in their eyes.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been speculated that the Podesta brothers were involved in the kidnapping of Madeleine McCann. source:

            It is speculated that Neanderthal man had "cat eyes", source:

            Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&amp;R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the former
First Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.

            While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton's
thoughts on a trade issue ("My husband is not the secretary of state, I am," she retorted), the emotional heart of her
           </p>
           <p>
            tour was also her most dangerous stop —in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape
victims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com , Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -

            In 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst —and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.

            The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a
provincial capital in the eastern Congo.

            I got suspended for the past 24 hours and no idea why. I hadn't posted very much. All I did was post on the Vault7 official page.  I'm convinced that they are all linked - the trafficking, the vault stuff that Wikileaks is alluding to.

            .  I was just responding to my own posts on that page, putting links together. It didn't get many impressions or anything but next thing I know, my acct was suspended.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not going to make an entire post about it. I've been really sick and just now able to log in here to see what's going on.
           </p>

            In a nutshell, take a look at the UN Secretary General

             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon

           </p>
           <p>
            From Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             They have three adult children: two daughters and a son.[27] His elder daughter, Seon-yong, was born in 1972 and now works for the Korea Foundation in Seoul. Her spouse is a native of India.[133][134] His son Woo-hyun was born in 1974 in India.[133] He received an MBA from Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles, and works for an investment firm in New York.[135] His younger daughter, Hyun-hee (born 1976), is a field officer for UNICEF in Nairobi.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Article doesn't state that Hyun-hee's husband is Siddarth Chatterjee
            <a href="http://www.siddharth-chatterjee.org/">
             http://www.siddharth-chatterjee.org/

           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I'm still not feeling well enough to get too detailed about it and I don't have all the pieces together, but based on what Wikileaks has been referencing for weeks I see some connections with a lot of stuff going on, past and present, that all tie in together.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a nutshell - I'm pretty sure that the Syria seed bank was sending out more than "seeds" in all their deposits to Svalbard  - no idea what - and when it was opened in 2015 for the first withdrawal ever, whatever was sent from Syria was removed.  The spreadsheets on their own page show that the numbers don't add up.  There are some shady folks involved in that Svalbard project. Amy Goldman Fowler who's over the Crop Trust and a big Clinton supporter. Also shows up in Wikileaks, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            So there's the "vault" part of Vault7.  The 7 part....I think that's World Trade Center 7. The new one. That's where I think the trafficking comes in.

             </p>
             <p>
              "Gulftainer’s (a UAE company) exclusive arrangement with Port Canaveral was negotiated in secret under the code name ‘Project Pelican.’...The 35-year lease grants Gulftainer exclusive rights to operate an intermodal container terminal inside Port Canaveral, near sensitive Department of Defense and NASA installations....Recently-installed Port Canaveral CEO John Walsh concealed the Pelican Project and the identity of Gulftainer from the public until June 24, 2014, by which time Gulftainer officials from the UAE had already arrived in Florida for a signing ceremony.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The connections between the wealthy UAE family that owns Gulftainer and former President Bill Clinton and his associate Jack Lew appear to have remained undetected last summer, despite the availability of information from open-source documents and websites. Treasury Secretary Lew eventually rubber-stamped the controversial Gulftainer deal with no national security oversight or review."

              Absolutely. And you know what they say, when someone keeps complaining someone is stealing their stuff, you know exactly what they are up to. Only Titus can steal everyone's work. Be careful Honeybee, you can take him.

              You are rediculous. Alex Jones has always been cointelpro. He was exposed having Stratfor employees on his staff. He won't let you talk about Mossad and if you sugeest Israel is involved with anything he shuts you down and calle you an anti-semite. During y2k, he brodacst live that the Russians were attacking and 10's of thousands had been killed and people were running for the hills. He is performing a character and overacts. He says he is 42 yo. I really do not think so. Jones also discredits the daddy of all truthers Bill Cooper, who warned us 9/11 was going to happen and it would be blamed on Bin Laden, who was a CIA asset. He told the public this months before it happend and was killed a couple months after 9/11 at his own house by cops. Jones called him a drunk and a loser. Jones is a gatekeeper and a low life. You endorsing Jones either means you are new, or you are disinfo.

               I've questioned that authenticity of Alex Jones. He's so loud and so "conspiracy" related he's automatically dismissed. Which works well to make us all look like tin foil hat conspirators, right?  Wikileaks shows an Alex Jones working for them. Supposedly there are 2 Alex Jones in Austin...very well could be. But it's worth questioning, particularly with the controversy surrounding him. He just seems "off" to me.

              I personally think it's bad form when prominent pizzagate researchers undermine each other over rivalry or personality issues. It demoralizes the whole community. From what I've seen this week, Titus hasn't been silent about his disdain for David. Everyone needs to grow up, and if we don't like someone's methods or style, we should appreciate their basic contributions and just move forward. United we stand, divided we fall.

               Oh I see. I have only listened to either of them a handful of times. I think culling info from multiple sources is the way to go and that no one person is the arbiter of truth on this. With that in mind I take what's useful to know and move on. No need to stop and rip into anyone. If I don't like them or think they're co-intel I don't have to listen. :)

               People would have to b naive to think that they would not try to hijack pizzagate and put a face or faces out there to be "leaders" of the movement and lead them away.

               Not if prominent pizzagate researchers feel that another is being false and misleading. Then they should speak up. It does not work the way you say it does. People join a cause to sidetrack it from the course it was on. When this is suspected, people should bring it up and state their case. Seaman is promoting himself and his personal drama and does no research. Frost is a researcher and calling out Seaman does not make him look bad. If you have something on Frost however, let us know. I have no idols and and no patience for disinfo ops infiltrating a movement.

                I basically agree -- however in spite of his self-focus (which is so terribly counterproductive) it was Seaman who got my attention in the beginning because of his tenacious calling out of John Podesta. That has remained his focus, and I never saw how that undermined the investigation.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't know either Seaman or Frost, and have nothing against either of them. Frost is a researcher and Seaman is a reporter -- big difference. Everyone has a role to play, and I appreciate what both have done. Maybe I'm naive, but citizen journalists should just stop trashing each other and focus on the REAL enemies! The ones who are destroying children!

              They are really tilting their hand in all of this. I hope I'm not the only one who keeps a tally of journalists and other prominent figures who have been denying PG. We will not simply forgive and forget this one!

            I was just locked out on a brand new twitter account.  1 tweet sent and not related to pizzagate.  Prior account is locked due to Brian Podesta/John Podesta question on whether they are related.  Is Voat next?
