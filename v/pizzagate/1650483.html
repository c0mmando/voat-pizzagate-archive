While many incoming investigations/arrests will appear to be financial crimes on the surface (as quantokitty and others have suggested), I think it will eventually become apparent that they are in fact trafficking-related crimes connected to pizzagate. I believe this because I spend some time every now and then browsing legislative activity on <a href="https://www.congress.gov/search">Congress\' website</a> and just last week I came across <strong>H.R.889</strong>, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/889/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22trafficking%22%5D%7D&amp;r=7">Human Trafficking Fraud Enforcement Act of 2017</a>, A BILL...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To provide for the establishment of an office within the Internal Revenue Service to focus on violations of the internal revenue laws by persons who are under investigation for conduct relating to the promotion of commercial sex acts and trafficking in persons crimes, and to increase the criminal monetary penalty limitations for the underpayment or overpayment of tax due to fraud.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/889?r=4">More specifically</a>, the bill directs the proposed IRS office to cooperate with the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Department of Justice and the Innocence Lost National Initiative of the FBI</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...to investigate and prosecute violations of tax laws by persons that appear to be violating specified federal laws prohibiting forced labor, trafficking of individuals, and transportation of minors or aliens for immoral purposes or state or territorial laws prohibiting the promotion of prostitution or of any commercial sex act.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bill is sponsored by Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX-2) and Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY-12) and more info on their thoughts of using the IRS to target suspected traffickers can be found <a href="http://poe.house.gov/2017/2/maloney-and-poe-renew-legislation-empowering-irs-to-punish-human-traffickers">here</a>. Overall, it begs an important question: if lawmakers aren\'t anticipating an increase in financial fraud investigations related to human-trafficking, then why is the establishment of such an office at the IRS necessary? </p>

            is that pedophiles serve short sentences then go back to work supported by our tax dollars. Busting perps for crimes like tax evasion, fraud, etc. keeps them in the slammer longer and collapses entire operations.

             Not much light to shed. I did see the new regs. it's an improvement, but it's still not going far enough. We need to really acknowledge that these people do not get better. No one should be walking the streets even owning video of  an infant being raped.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to push for Typhoid Mary legislation for pedophiles. It's going to be tough, but if we swoop in after pedogate busts wide open ready with memes and information about "they don't get better", and we keep at it, we can probably overcome the pedos pushing back or the SJWs who have the misguided idea that they get better. They don't. Death Penalty and or Typhoid Mary. That's it. No mercy. This sounds harsh, but they do not ever get better. This will save our society in countless ways. If there were a survey done of prison inmates I'd bet that 80-90% of them are victims of abuse, which probably explains why pedos die in prison. We'd save a fortune dealing with the number one cause of "people gone bad" and generational/repeatition of abuse. We also need to insist that gay couples who wish to adopt submit to psychological testing and demonstrate they are not attracted to children (there's tests for this) prior to being able to adopt or inseminate in order to have a child. That's just common sense. Of course not all gay men are abusers. Those who are, were likely abused and even their sexual orientation may be tied to abuse. I firmly believe in born gay, but I also believe that sexual orientation can be influenced/adopted by people due to serious childhood abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we want to do away with this, we have to actually punish these people. That's all.
            </p>
            <p>
             One other thing it's kind of odd to find things I've posted about months ago being "revealed" in the DHS insider interview.

            The only way they were able to get Al Capone was through tax evasion.  It's probably gunna happen the same way with these gangster politicians.  nobody's snitching cause that's the fast track to getting spirit cooked.

            We need this higher, we need to make sure these bills don't get swept under the rug later by some other politician.

             One of the best post I have come across! Come to think of it, Dennis Hasterd was arrested for financial fraud - pedophilia came up later during the trial. The sure way of nailing monsters like JP &amp; JA is through financial fraud. Can a pizza parlor explain ties to Washington, his lavish lifestyle, where is the money comming from?

            Great post. Only thing that scares me is all govt agencies seem to be compromised when it comes to Pizzagate. Sure, its great the IRS will be involved...problem is we KNOW 100% the IRS has been used as a tool by the Obama admin for 8 yrs. Now we're supposed to expect them to be the good guys.

             I agree 100%. If H.R. 889 does become law, I'm not sure how effective it will be with John Koskinen still at the helm. His term is through 2018, in the event he can make it that long without impeachment proceedings (again)

             A lot of them are still left over from the Bush and Clinton years as well.  They are all in this together.  I am hoping some new blood was put in there by the new administration.

              The main reason I'm optimistic about the Apprentice boss being POTUS is that he likes saying "You're fired" and a lot of Government employees need to hear it.

               While I am all in for saving money and giving some their due day, you have to wonder who is minding the store in the IRS.  We know it is unfair what WE are paying and some higher up on the ladder are paying, when the Rich should be audited, who is watching.  I think people are always worried that the little guy gets audited but we should also worry when we have a question  who will answer the phone.  No, our govt. sometimes doesn't work, because there is no one there and our govt. is not broke, the money is just going to the wrong place and people, it is not being returned to us.  After all it is OUR money.  We should be reaping the benefits, not the banks and corporations and the DOD and their contractors.  I'll get off off my soap box now.  Just Sayin'.  I sure hope we all get our wish on Draining the Swamp, it looked like it yesterday, let's hope it keeps up.

              I have a friend who works closely with the IRS in D.C. And he tells me a lot have quit and it feels like a ghost town at the IRS. The rest will probably soon be fired that is the conjecture.
