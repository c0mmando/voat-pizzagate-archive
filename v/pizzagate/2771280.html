Apologies for the way it is written, I am no writer but I am a long time lurker, long time &quot;understander&quot; of all of this.</p>
<p>I have no links and nothing I can prove physically so please take it all with a grain of salt if you must but I will offer you my truth and I think it goes some way to explain the background of </p>
<p>these activities, how wrong\'uns do business.</p>
<p>I used to love my grandad, I used to love the stories, love the history and the tea and toast we would get when we were round there. We were both close and distant but deep down </p>
<p>I sensed preferential treatment, that or it was simply a foregone conclusion as none of my cousins were ever there? Perhaps it was the atmosphere, my grandparents were not </p>
<p>close. Separate rooms for the day and separate beds for night, I just thought it was something older people did as they had simply outgrown the being together every waking </p>
<p>moment thing. </p>
<p>Fast forward to his funeral and my Aunts and Uncles were laughing and joking, cracking smiles left right and centre. I couldn\'t understand and this made me resent everyone there </p>
<p>showing zero respect. As the proceedings finished, my father approaches the crowd made up of his brother and sister in-laws, as if to offer condolences and simply says, &quot;well guys, </p>
<p>look on the bright side - at least it wasn\'t my father.&quot;   My jaw dropped, I couldn\'t believe the words that came out of his mouth.  My shock was only amplified by the roaring of </p>
<p>laughter from everyone after he said it.</p>
<p>What the double fuck is going on here? Is this how we celebrate life or is there something I have missed as a grandchild???</p>
<p>I was still told, NOTHING.</p>
<p>All until I woke up in my flat years later and my Sister was sitting at the end of my bed crying. Turns out my Uncle had abused my Sister when she was 3 years old. Turns out that </p>
<p>uncle was really adopted as a child, gotten from who knows where.
Turns out that same uncle had raped my other cousins. Turns out my grandfather had raped all of his 5+1 kids, turns out the 7th child, what I thought was my uncle was really my </p>
<p>cousin.   His mother being my Aunty.</p>
<p>Confused?  Welcome.</p>
<p>I have been having orgasms since as young as I remember, 5, before five, I can\'t pin point exactly but tell me how a 4-5 year old knows to fool around sexually with his older sister. </p>
<p>Yes an incestuous sexual relationship, 4 or 5 years old. How would we have know how to do all this I wonder?    My mother found us one day and made us feel so bad but looking </p>
<p>back, that was a face harbouring semi guilt. She must have known exactly how we would have known.</p>
<p>Funny because SHE was the one that knew about my grandfather\'s behaviour and yet we were still left there, allowed him to collect us from school. All of that and why?  Because </p>
<p>she was off having an affair.  
</p>
<p>My grandfather used to drive for Sir Mcalpine, the guy that built the trocadero, london.  He drove a Royles Royce out of his council house in Tulse hill.  A man with 5 kids living in a </p>
<p>shitr hole council house decides to suddenly adopt another child? BS. He was affiliated.</p>
<p>We would attend parties in london. Childrens parties, given presents and things.  I have fragmented memories of being places with my grandad and visiting other men, chocolate in </p>
<p>hand.  I remember the day we picked up two school girls, supposedly the daughters of Mcalpine and they weren\'t very nice to me, the day my grandad asked if I could, &quot;roll my </p>
<p>tongue.&quot; I had no idea what this meant but I remember he showed me and he began flapping his tongue in a sexual manner.  This is stuff I didn\'t understand at the time.</p>
<p>But yeah, I am a complete fuck up as a result. Paedophiles are like a cancer.</p>
<p>When I heard of Pizzagate, I simply understand how all this goes on.   The rings, pregnancies, then kids needing sudden adoption, the secrecy and the power involved. The </p>
<p>inbreeding.</p>
<p>He also drove for Victor Mature (famous hollywood  and PInewood Studios guy.)  Mum recalls tales of him arriving at the house only for my Nan to not want him to come in - </p>
<p>something my mum explains away as she was embarrassed of the house - a small council place in Tulse hill.   <br />
So to entice them out, Victor would throw teddy bears up at the balcony, pleading. Pleading a 12 year old girl to come out for the day?
My Mum doesn\'t see this for what it is. I mean her abuse story only came out after she was caught having the affair, I remember it plain as day. She was begging my father for </p>
<p>forgiveness.  He used to beat her black and blue. Put her in hospital with broken ribs, no different from the treatment from her father really. They say women go for guys that are a </p>
<p>representation of what was given to them by their father.  
</p>
<p>Fucking dirty despicable nonce cunts.</p>
<p>So I have the DNA of a paedo and a wife beater in me, marvellous.   I trust no one, I have no friends and I feel as though my brain is partitioned to such a degree that I can lose the </p>
<p>plot very fast and become rather aggressive.   My life is pretty much over but this truth has to see the light before I pop my clogs. Let it serve as a warning to others about the </p>
<p>disgraceful goings on of the elite world and their serf, prospect, pauper families that serve them from the fringes. </p>
<p>Everything I have just told you is the truth, I swear on everything holy, I will die tomorrow if I have deceived..  Look up Mcalpine, look up Scallwag Magazine. Look up thatcher, </p>
<p>Mcalpine, Saville connection.  Wouild you effin believe that my mum is now with a new partner, margeret thatcher\'s old personal driver. Remember how Saville knew Thatcher? </p>
<p>The coincidences are endless. It is a path given to me, so I pursue it. Pizzagate was just a flash in the pan compared to what is going on I feel. Highly organised and the worst part is </p>
<p>we pay for it with tax, ignorance and a big dose of apathy.  There are millions of people with similar situations to me, just many don\'t wish to talk about it and it becomes taboo so the next child can be set upon.</p>
<p>My grandfather lived with 7 children, 5 of which were born to his wife, 1 to his daughter and one was adopted that abused all the cousins.   Can I be normal? Of course not and I </p>
<p>admire the ones that move forward in a positive manner but make no mistake, I am a real life fuck up.</p>
<p>I appreciate you giving this a read. Sometimes you have to shake the tree to see what falls.</p>

            Not sure how this all works but thanks for all the wonderful comments.
Gonna get back to lurking now, I have stuck my head far enough above the parapet that I don't feel comfortable anymore.
I am coming off drugs and am all over the shop and I think I have said far too much.
Peace and love guys, don't stop what you're doing, please.
Ciao

            I appreciate your testimony. I hope for a growing wave of such bravery and exposures. The more that victims/survivors speak out and up and find their voices the less trauma will be endured by youngers in the future. The msm will need to either do the news on this or die.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please give yourself the space to grow through and out of your past. You deserve …. living!! It is not in your dna, I believe. If it was you would not have written this.

            I drove past Hyde Park Corner only yesterday and saw the ‘Sir’ Tobert McAlpine flag flying over the new huge hotel redevelopment going on on the west side and immediately got angry that the bastard’s name and company still goes on and is still
making fortunes even after he’s gone, and that same bastard sued and won for defamation when accusations of his paedophilia hit the papers.  I pray for your mind and your soul, friend and I pray that others like you can find the strength to speak out.  The whole cabal wants locking away in an A cat prison with the real prisoners - no section 43. They’ll do what they have to and teach them what fear and pain is really about.

             Sued for defamation and then donated the money, to who you may ask? Look into it as I believe it was a children's charity. The sanctimonious bastard.
I would have to say no to the prison idea because we would have to pay for them.

             With people like this I think the only solution is an island with limited resources. They all get sent there and there is cctv on the island that televises to the rest of the world of normal people.  We only pay for the coast guard to keep them on the island.  Then they can learn what survival is and barbarism feels like.
But that would make me as bad as them, watching with popcorn as they fight for resources.   Reverse hunger games. God I sound sick

              You’re right of course, and we can all fantasise about what date these sick bastards deserve.  It doesn’t make us any the less for wishing the worst upon them and some like you have more entitlement than most.  I just get so frustrated that except for one to one red pulling we don’t yet have a way to bring all of the evil to light.  Your survival strategies are good ones, try your best to stay with it.  I wish you all the very best in your way forward and, aside from the shills and trolls, you’ll find much love and support here.

               I appreciate you saying that pal I really do. Things will change in our lifetime, I can feel that deep down. Perhaps after a load of chaos, the power will change hands and the world can restore itself. I believe we are living in paradise but we mess it up.  Have a good sunday buddy

            That's all really horrible.  I hope you are in counselling and getting some help.  I hope you have some friends. Just because you have a pedphile and a wife beater in the family, that doesn't make you like them.  I try to understand why children are treated this way. Some say we 'choose' before we come here the life we will have.  I don't know.  And sometimes life is so shit that you have to sit in the wound.  I hope you get some healing.

             No I am not but perhaps I should be. I have thought about that a lot but want to try to sort myself out on my own. I do not have any friends but that is no sad story, trusting people is not particularly easy. I did once have a load of friends but since hitting my mid twenties and getting pretty heavily involved in drugs and the rave scene, everything started to unravel. I realise that we were just people that had a common goal at the time, not sure that is a friend anyway?
 No, this is no sad story because I think you are right in  saying we choose the life we have, I have brought a lot of unhappiness on myself and am trying to change that but I know   at times if there was a gun sitting in front of me I would shoot myself in the face without hesitation but I couldn't do that to my Lovely wife.
Literally the best thing that happened to me and because of her know that angels do in fact exist!

              I'm glad you have a life partner who is there for you!  That's more than some people have. You are lucky.  You know, sometimes the most damaged people are the most compassionate, empathic and kind because they are able to put themselves in the victims' shoes and feel their pain.   Don't be too hard on yourself for the drugs &amp; the raving--it's a form of self-medication.  But ultimately it doesn't help you.  If you're not suffering too much from ptsd, dissociative disorder and anxiety, learning to meditate can really help.  When you're on high alert all the time, your amygdala is fired up, releasing all those hormones like cortisol into your body.  It's a terrible feeling. Meditation will calm down the amygdala and gets your pre-frontal cortex working, which is the rational part of the brain.  I suffer from complex-ptsd and meditation has really helped me.

               Yes I think the universe seeks to balance everything, there is always good with the bad and I think you are particularly correct when you say the most damaged can be the most compassionate.  When I am in a good place that is me but I can be such a prick it is untrue when not in the best frame of minds.  I don't know if it ptsd or bipolar for me but I am not keen on doctors, dentists or anything like that. I actually haven't been in about 15 years now.
Is your ptsd linked to all this stuff piscina? And I have Italian blood btw, pool is cool with me!

             Yes I can believe that but at what point do we stop being a link in the chain and start behaving properly. I guess some don't have a choice as they feel like they are swimming against the tide.
This is my help buddy, I was considering hypnosis to make some sense of these fractured thoughts I have but it may open up a can of worms I can't contain.
I just know I was very aware about sex at a very young age. 
What is strange is I was never promiscuous in my teens, I have only really had one proper partner (officially) and that is my wife.  We have been together for nearly 20 years and I am only 36.  Every cloud has a silver lining A :)

             Listen incest is undeniably one of the worst things that can happen to you but you can overcome it. I sought help ever since I was 11 and then as an adult I really got into alternative medicine and therapies. I didn't even remember the incest happening I just had a host of psychological and medical issues and it soon became aware that all of my partners were abusive. You just have want it from the bottom of your heart and fight for it. It seemed pointless to me for many years as new things emerged over and  over but at 30 I saw I was better than the people who did nothing and just saught comfort in one form of escapism or another. When I look at a survivor in their 50s who get bad PTST upon mentioning a dead persons name I don't feel sorry for them.
            </p>

             They had 30+ years to heal and those fuckers are long dead. I know what it is like to disown your whole family and struggle through life as an orphan.
            </p>
            <p>
             But fucked up as I was I was essentially free to make my own choices as an adult and these choices then formed my life.

             If you had ordinary run of the mill therapy I am not surprised it dd not help.  My friend an SRA survivor has told me that only special therapists trained in SRA will know how to help you.  This can  be expensive.  She is 69 years old and has fought against her rapist many times and is My Inspiration.  She is a Steel Magnolia of the Strongest Kind.  She also has an illness.  She has good and bad days but gets her story out there.  They have told her the more she gets her story out the more protected she is. That is up to you, trying to blank it out will only hurt you in the future.  This is all advise from her.  God Bless You.

               There is no reason to thank me, but I appreciate it.  There is reason that we should all take care with people that have had horrid rough experiences.  Only certain people can listen, read and handle this kind of information.  I cried many times when I first started with these stories, and still do.  But I can only continue because what are we to do?  Someone has to get your story and those of others out there.   The more you are in contact with others that have experienced the same the more it will help you.  Some days will be good and some bad.  But the truth is what sets us free.

             I am yet to find an answer to that one, until yesterday I used to smoke around an oz a week... Today I quit and so here I am talking about my past.
I am not sure if this is cathartic or will leave me with a sense of regret.
Exercise used to be my thing until I got lazy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Although I am left with a profound sense of hate and my family has been pretty much torn apart, continuing to express myself in any way and drawing a much needed line in the sand is like therapy.   I can't change the past but I certainly can screw my future thinking about these things. Or something to that effect.
There is a lot of guilt when you have suffered abuse, like you have somehow brought it on yourself but that is nonsense and wickedness talking, evil continuing.,
            </p>
            <p>
             Eat well, talk lots and exercise. You literally decide how YOU want your future to be. We cannot move on as victims, we need to take control of ourselves and with that, take all the credit when we succeed. Forgive the monsters as they are already living in hell but do not rally to excuse them either.
I hope you get it worked out and move on towards peace. I will be damned if I let them ruin my life. 
I am ruining for myself at present but that will change. Watch this space

              All the best, and thanks for this, but have you considered an insurance package? Not sure you have enough names or whatever. That is the most common thing that, in this modern day and age, people still overlook. At least here, you are most likely archived.

               Good to see you again buddy. ;) 
Everyone in question is dead. I can imagine only the estate would have a problem with what I say but i can't provide any proof. So I don't think I am much danger to them.
I have been searching and searching photos online to see if I can find my Grandad in the background with Mcalpine but this would have been the mid eighties. Perhaps I should try and find some old albums. I know my Grandad had loads of 8mm but chirst knows what would be on all that.

              Thank you. Your statement about not being to change the past but being able to screw the future certainly makes me think. I need to work on being present in the future.

               Literally draw a line. Partition that stuff off and set aside days to think about these things but not weeks, and on a clear head, free of drugs and drink.
There literally is only now pal, I am thinking about you.

                I read your story last night and I know how it is to not have all the pieces all too well . Coming to voat helped me understand a lot about my past and how evil people work . What ultimately gives me hope for the future are Gods promises found in the Bible . Rev 21:4  And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more,neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” ... this is how it will be after Armageddon! Knowing this life is not all there is , is the only reason I’m still alive .. my point is not to push religious stuff , I just wanted to share what truly helped me . I am thinking of you and others who have commented here when I pray 💜

                 That is very kind of you and appreciate it a lot!   I really am not alone here, so many people with the same experience that it is both comforting and disturbing at the same time. That said, this is cathartic talking with like minded people. Thinking of you too pal, I hope everyone's future is looking bright

                Funny you should say that because I can’t put myself to sleep. I constantly drink or take something to put me to sleep. I feel like this is maybe a divine intervention so to speak. I need someone to give advice or encouraging thoughts. Thank you.

                   If think to exercise your body might help. But take it slowly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   An excellent starting point would be to do stretching exercises. You can do this at home any time, you don't need to go to a gym or even leave the house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Look for 'stretching video' on google.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   From a 5 minute routine (good starter) to longer videos you'll find a good selection which you might want to do a couple of times per week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But be gentle and patient with yourself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Stretching will make your body to experience tension, and then the release of tension.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   After doing this for some time it will effect the way you hold yourself in daily life, also, you will be flooded with endorphine when doing the stretching routines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Another good ways to exercise a bit is swimming.

             Thanks for the link. Have you seen the interview where he speaks about getting accused? It is one of the worst performances I have ever seen.
I would go to his parties and the fact that my grandad was who he was gives credence to the "allegations" being most correct.

              Yes, indeed. In a way, it cracked me up when people pointed out that Edward Heath must be innocent, because he had security details with him at all times, and never drove a car. (Which, btw., later turned out to be untrue - he had a driving license, and drove a car, although only occasionally it seems.) This is so incredibly naive.

               Edward Heath was a murderer wasn't he? Used to sail young boys out to sea, never to be seen again. Sadly people suffer cognitive dissonance. It helps with their incessant washing of hands....

               See his body language and how he "gulps," when the "accuser" is mentioned.

              <p>
               Tell me, how does someone see a picture of a person and say, "yep, that is the guy," then retract the statement when you find out their name??? As if it is the wrong person because the name doesn't match.  I would say a photo ID is everything.   However when you are powerful you may find yourself sending people with petrol bombs to fix little problems. To think that these people go to childrens homes to get away with it, preying on the already vulnerable. It makes me so angry it is untrue.

              <p>
               Mr Messham, his accuser looked rather under duress when he made the retraction. He looked terrified. Quite an about turn dont you think? 
I can't find the link to that one though, I will keep trying

                Yes, I think there has been a background story to the retraction.

                And regarding Edward Heath, remember that the report they made about him when looking into the allegations against him was never published. But

                 Yes, how many police forces lost the government paedophile names again? I lost count.
Makes you wonder the true purpose of "Crimewatch," "Childline" and all the others.
Are they simply a filter to be sure they bury important names?

                 As I find it rather hard to believe that all of a sudden hundreds of victims come forward after Saville dies?
 No, Jill Dando knew what was happening and that is why they killed her

             That statement is EPIC.  He is talking about SRA and I  believe there is a Flood Gate of SRA waiting to be exposed.

              I am new here today and am just finding my feet with regard to comment replies. Which statement buddy? Can you clarify? I fully believe SRA is going on today, has been going on and will continue as long as the power structure stays the same, look at Hamstead and mr dearman the monster

               I am connected to and communicate with an SRA Survivor/Victim and so I know there is so much of this going on.  She has her story on Voat here in a post I did on her.  But I do not think you should read it for it may trigger you.  There are horrible things she reveals.  They are all true her abuser was a priest that is named in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury decision.  So yes, I believe your story.  Godspeed and God Bless.  You may want to change your mind on leaving here. That is up to you. Some find it helps them some find some of the verbal abuse too much.

                  I just read it and it sounds completely unbearable. There truly are some dark people on this earth. I foolishly used to think that everyone was good but some were simply misguided but the more I live the more I realise that some people are literally on the other side. They don't tick like the rest of us and are so dead inside that the only kicks they can get is inflicting torture on others, that dead.

                 <p>
                  How is she now? I am so sorry to hear her story. The fact that she lives on and has the bravery to talk makes me think rather highly of her. Many would crumble at 1% of what she saw. Speechless

                   She is 69 years old and has an illness as well.  Lupus.  But she manages to keep going and fights her rapist every step and chance she gets.  She has strength that I can't even imagine.  She also knows that there are things that she does not know yet.  Things that will come to her without warning.  But somehow she has handled them all.  She has had professional SRA therapy which has helped her immensely.  The Catholic Church agreed to pay for some of it, but now it has been withdrawn.  Shame on them.  They also defended her rapist priest in an article.  Thomas J. Benestad.   I don't know how she does it.

                 : I now looked at posts that a user submitted who some time ago deleted their account.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The post is still there, but all comments the user made on their own thread and elsewhere are gone. It would really be a pity if the comments you made here would be gone. Therefore I would like to ask you to please consider just giving up the account, and not return to it, but let it stay, and not delete it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That's up to you of course. We will respect your decision, whatever it may be.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I looked at your user page - there isn't any personal info about you. And your screenname here is kind of generic. I don't think this will endanger your opsec, but this will be, as I said, entirely up to you to decide.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thank you for speaking up, much appreciated.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you would like to come back to the board some time, you might just want to create a new alt, so it won't be connected to your old screenname.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With best wishes!

                  Opsec? I have none, like I say, I was a pretty active poster on the site liveleak and anyone should really be able to find who I am.
Either way I wont delete if my comments are lost. I really appreciate the advice!

                  I believe the headline and content of the article will be replaced with [Account deleted by user]. Voat takes privacy seriously. If you want it to remain up, I would either leave your account intact and just abandon it, or archive it at archive.is and have someone repost it on your behalf. The comments do not go away (other than those of the user who deleted their account), but there is no way to find the post by search or username, once the content and headline are wiped, even if the archive link is in the comments.

                   Thanks for chiming in, Vin. As I already told OP, his comments would definitely deleted, so that it would be a pity if the account would be deleted. I recommended to just abandon it, and never return to it.

             Personally I think the research is completely spot on, exemplary in fact. I have never seen such a devoted group of people.
However..... 
Nothing will change all of this as long as the status quo in politics maintains its standing. They can control how the mainstream thinks.
I don't know what will change people's minds sadly, I really thought pizzagate would do it, the emails, the mountain of evidence, it can only point to one thing and yet the mainstream still doesn't touch it.
This will all end when the big reset finally comes and people see the evil for what it is. Till then it will be whispers this and rumours that.

             With regard to the UK, since the Saville outing we have seen more and more talk of institutionalised paedophillia and talk of traficking but they are all very controlled explosions.

              I admit that sometimes I am desperate how bad the situation in the UK actually is, even worse than in the US I think.

             <p>
              So I guess continuing our research, redpilling people, and supporting survivors is the way to go. After all, this has been going on for centuries, so we can't expect changes within 2 years, since Pizzagate started, can we?

               Yes I fear you may be right. The UK do roll out a lot of templates, thanks to the lovely tavistock institute.

               Please don't stop what it is you are doing, all we can do is keep the subject off of the taboo shelf, as that is where the perpetrators want it to stay. They want the shame and guilt to stay with the victims, in effect giving them carte blanche to continue.

            I will flair the post 'NSFW', due to some of the content (your relation to your sister), and I will have to flair the post 'Unverified' - we do this with all first hand survivor stories, please
            <em>
             don't

            take this as a sign that I don't believe your story.

                 It is like everything is inside out! How on earth can we not bring into question the whole power structure on earth, when the evil ones are knighted and the good guys are forgotten.   A complete overhaul of the way we think is perhaps needed but authority is taught at a very young age.

                  I feel this is currently about to change, since more and more people realize that regarded as being 'honorable'
                  <em>
                   does not
                  </em>
                  , in fact, relate to honorable behaviour (see Cardinals, Bishops, and priests who have raped children, and other members of the clergy who did the cover-up.)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I guess three or four years from now, when more US states will have completed Grand Jury investigations, looking into sexual abuse by member of the clergy, this will
                  <em>
                   really
                  </em>
                  have a great impact on people's conception of 'honorouble elites'.

                   I can only hope so but they have a thousand more irons in the fire. My only fear is that the exposure we are creating is pushing their BS further underground.
Look at how Kings used to do business,   heads on spikes on railing if you chose to talk smack against the King. Now today, this apparently doesn't go on anymore,
replace heads on sticks with the illusion of freedom and coercion by the media, power is in the same hands.

                  Exactly.  I totally agree.  That is why we continue to pull up these stories and articles and keep researching and posting here.  To wake the Sleeping Sheep.  The best thing you can do is to change your life and not let these habits continue that we all were part of because that's how we were trained.  Yes, we all need a complete overhaul of our thinking.

              We are white men, we were not built (by evolution or God) to be alone. It's about the nature of our people. Hitler uses that to reach political conclusions, you can skip that.

                 Ah, I hadn't bothered to look you up.  I'm very sorry about that, retardation is no joke and what he did to your mother is unspeakable.  Grappling with that having been the seed of your creation must be extremely difficult.  My condolences

              Ignore that ignorant troll. He is talking about your account being new and his is only seven days old. He is probably a pedo enabler. Sorry you had such a wicked family. At least you realize it so that maybe you won't repeat the family habits. Best of luck to you buddy.

                Voat can be a rough place to post. You have to have thick skin. You didn't do anything to that troll. I would bet odds that QumDumpster is a child molester. Don't let it get you down.

                   I don't know if you are a child molester or not but you probably are. At the very least you a low life that is wasting good oxygen molecules another person could be breathing. You came to a forum like this to ridicule someone who may be putting their life in jeopardy by telling their story. I checked your comment history and you are scum of the earth.

               By knowing the mistake it still makes it impossible to read does it?
It is important info in my opinion and you rubbish it for lack of concentration? Is there not something bigger at stake here?
