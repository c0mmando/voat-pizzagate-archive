<p>I\'m only highlighting some of the facts found above to SPOTLIGHT this for everyone to dig deeper!  The arrests, the accusations of sexual conduct by high profile Holly-Weird \'actors\', the sudden deaths, for example, Charles Manson today are all sending a message of power to this MKULTRA CIA cartel that has infiltrated since after WW2 #ProjectPaperClip and all the Nazi scientists that came over here.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun</a> was just 1 of 1000\'s!</p>

               You can wiki "the wonderland murders," below is crime scene footage, I would say yeah, it's pretty uncomfortable to watch, graphic, but if you think of the victims as somewhat unreal it helps. It's mainly just a lot of blood.This was in Laurel Canyon and the four people were bludgeoned to death w/ hammers. Don't watch it if you have a weak stomach. I've seen it many times.

                I am somewhat weak stomached and weak kneed. Maybe I will just look up a write up on it.  Laurel Canyon.  I remember reading a report by Abel Danger.   Just about everyone was screwed up and with the CIA,  and their fathers either Generals or Majors in the Armed Forces.  Very well planned and orchestrated but when reading it I thought it was a mess.  Maybe things were thought out before but when things went wrong, they were changed in midstream, for they were in control and could manage almost anything.

                 The same things were said about the Tate murders. The crime occurred in the next canyon over if I remember right and most people who lived there were somehow connected to a secret military base in the area, the CIA, or the entertainment industry (allegedly controlled by CIA as per the rumors). Sharon Tate's father was pretty high up in the navy....

                  The whole area was controlled.  I now believe nothing there happened by accident.  That is why Manson was under lock and key.  There was a reason they wanted to keep him away from everyone else.  Sometimes those people go off and cause a problem.  Better to lock them up.  I also think there is much more to be learned about Polanski.

                 Yes the whole Laurel Canyon thing I have looked into just a little. I know something went on, just how deep I don't know. But I do believe the whole hippie psychedelic thing was somewhat orchestrated, including the music. The old movie Mulholland Drive was set in Laurel Canyon. It's a beautiful place. I love Southern California but it's gotten really screwed up. I met Roy Rogers there, and Dale, crazy story, I'll tell you sometime.

                   Short version. Went out to Victorville in California, a few miles from Apple Valley, where Roy and Dale lived, this was late '70s. Visiting some cousins. They bragged about Roy living close to them. I said no way. So we challenged them (we were young punks).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We three banged on Roy's door at about 11 PM at night (this was just a few years after Manson murders and not too far from the Splahn Ranch). Really stupid of us. There was a stagecoach and big wagon wheel and cactus out front. No security whatsoever that we could see, but long driveway (you can google his house, it was in disrepair for a while).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Dale talked thru the door, and went and got Roy. (She said what do we want, we said we want to see Roy Rogers.) Roy flung the door wide open, he was standing there in his pajamas or long underwear, can't remember which, with a shotgun in his hand. We talked for a minute, then he realized we were just kids. Tho we couldn't have cared less, he assumed we were young fans and he relaxed. "Go visit the museum in the morning boys."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In the morning we arrive at the museum and Dale was contacted on the phone by the receptionist (don't remember exactly how it was arranged). Dale said tell the boys Roy had a gun cause he's a deputy sheriff in the town. She felt bad (he should have shot us lol). Dale said let the boys in free. So we saw Trigger who was stuffed (and now in storage somewhere in Branson MO) and the dog and that was about it haha. Crazy times.

                    Yeah, Pat Brady and his Jeep Nelly Bell  and Bullet the German Shepherd.  My husband remembered the really old movies he was in.  He is out now but I can't wait to tell him story.  I had a Dale and Roy Lunch Box.  They were metal in those days with a little thermos inside.  Worth a lot of money now.  Gosh those were the days and a much simpler time.  You know, all the gadgets we have nowadays and nobody has time.  People  have have tons of apps to manage their time, because they are all in a hurry.  Go Figure.  Thanks for a Trip Down Memory Lane.

             Q brought this up last night:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             How must people be made aware of an alternate reality? 
What are crumbs (think H-wood/DC)
Define ‘lead-in’ (think play)?
What has been occurring recently? 
The stage must be set.
Crumbs are easy to swallow.

             What is a honeypot? 
Define blackmail. 
How could this be applied?
Fantasy land.
WHO HAS ALL OF THE INFORMATION?
No Such Agency.
The hunter becomes the hunted.
Operations underway.
Operators active.

              lol, i had to go get some, but then the fuckwits at the local Woolworths(Safeway) decided that today(out of the last, I dunno, 8+ years), that I looked under 25, despite that I'm 26 and have seen enough shit in this lifetime to last a couple thousand years xD
             </p>

              Long story short, had to go for a longer walk to get my cancer sticks :P

"Representative Michael F. Doyle and Representative John Conyers Jr., questioned the prosecution's tactics in the aftermath of the first trial and instituted Congressional hearings on the matter.[27] "

             Here is something from Reddit but still not the info from Cleveland before he moved to PA.
I know a lot of the politicians in the next county over. Too close for comfort.
One more thing my neighbors kid went to Sanduskys club. My son freaked out when that neighbor kid did bad things to his dog. The politicians in the next town knew this.
This was in 1994-1995

            I feel like David Geffen needs to be looked at very closely.  He’s very involved with MOCA but not sure of his role during the 2011 gala w/the infamous spirit cooker

            I also believe Geffen at one time had connections with Linkin Park (Chester Bennington) and SoundGarden (Chris Cornell). Geffen was also BBF with Andy Wharol. Both, according to “rumors” were attracted to very young men..aka, underaged teen boys
           </p>
           <p>
            Not about Geffen, but other Hollyweird types.  Some very questionable pics

            They've all been kidnapped by aliens.

           <p>
            It should be noted, that virtually all of the lurid reports being palmed off on the public as examples of "alien misbehavior" are actually secret psychological warfare operations by human rogue military-intelligence units to help further the SATANIC ORDER. It's MK ULTRA on mass scale and the WORLD needs to know the TRUTH.

              Bro come on... You completely ignore the important part, &amp; instead you chuck BUZZ words and pick at a very weak slander campaign.
             </p>
             <p>
              Boylan worked as a social worker and psychologist and was previously a president of the Sacramento Valley Psychological Association.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was also been chairman of the Calaveras County Board of Education and a board member of the Marin Municipal Water District,
             </p>
             <p>
              But in 1995, the California Board of Psychology
              <strong>
               revoked his license
              </strong>
              , saying he had "abused his role as a therapist when he imposed his personal views, of the existence of extraterrestrials into the dreams and memories of two patients."
             </p>
             <p>
              But Boylan realised he was a victim of alien abduction himself, he broke the programming and spoke out against it and so I'm I.

                I'm not arguing Boylan didn't do some bad things, of course he did. The sad thing is, he was still taught a lie and it cost him is childhood, that's what bothers me.

             I don't know if I believe pizzgate but even before the whole rape thing and fleeing America this Polanski was said to be depraved, Orgies, Sex Tapes and refused to sleep with her once she got pregnant and wanted her to get an abortion, he was cheating having an affair with Michelle Phillips of The Mamas &amp; The Papas ...also see Mackenzie's Incest infanticide abortion ...John Phillips of Mamas and Papas Slept With Daughter Mackenzie...Sharon Tate stepped was a child start or child model,  April 27, 1943, when she was chosen as Miss Tiny Tot at six months old in her hometown of Dallas, Texas...a weird sick world

                       Well I may be way off the mark with Rick, we'll see if anyone can confirm or deny my suspicions. If he can be accounted for in the timeframe I'm asking about, then my suspicions may be void.

               Indeed. I screwed that up didn't I? Supposedly they were against his will. He lost his mind after that. Someone said they're the equivalent of electrical lobotomies. But Hemingway was also a heavy drinker. He tried to walk into an airplane propeller.  I saw Hemingway today at McDonald's, I told him he looked just like an aged Hemingway and he said I get that all the time.

                I can't imagine anyone getting shock treatment willingly but maybe. Anyway, reminds me of Rosemary Kennedy with the lobotomy talk. I wonder what she did to cause hers. All these families are so fucked up in one way or another.

                 Wow I forgot all about that. Yeah, they are indeed messed up. Probably a lot of psych drugs involved. My grandmother willingly got shock treatment as a last ditch thing, then committed suicide (well supposedly she was willing). Lewis Meriwether of Lewis and Clark killed himself too, cause he ran out of morphine. What a world.

                  my grandfather was given shock treatments too. He died before I was born. but the alleged reason was to shush him from disclosing FDR's provocation of Pearl Harbor.

                      Actually, this will make you lol. I knew a guy whose dad was CIA/OSS and when he got old and was placed in a nursing home the family had to hire an attendant to make sure he didn't spill secrets.

                       That's funny. OSS goes way back. Well ... I know E. Howard Hunt's (Watergate CIA guy) son on facebook, St. John Hunt, he's in a rock band of all things. Hunt gave a death bed confession to his son so I guess they didn't attend him very well. Gosh I hope I don't get dementia, from being on Voat.

               I think Hemingway was at the Mayo Clinic. My grandmother endured shock therapy too and ended up killing herself. You younger folk have the energy and mindset and the "wokeness" to change the world, I hope you do it. I was raised on three channels of TV and believed everything they told me.

             Yeah I remember when he was in the hospital last time. I think the there is more to the story when it comes to Manson and his followers. That goes deep. I've read a couple of books about it. There are a lot of connections with celebrities. Manson also grew up having a horrible childhood. I wouldn't doubt if he was mind controlled.

                Yes he was connected to the Beach Bous. The story goes that he targeted the Tate/Polanski home because The Beach Boys manager Terry Melcher lived there just before them.

                Yeah he lived w/ one of them or next door, I think he cut a song w/ them. The dot-connecting w/ Manson is mind-blowing and I have never taken the time to put it all together. Maybe one day.
               </p>
               <p>
                Doris Day owned the house, Terry Melcher her son approached Manson for a record deal (Beach Boys involved somewhere in there), all those notable people killed, it goes on and on, Beatles lyrics written in blood on the walls before the White Album was actually out, the guy who replaced Paul McCartney was down visiting Mamas and the Papas (freak pedo Papa John) who were enlisted by the CIA to pass out LSD at the Monterrey Pop Festival, sigh.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's funny that Mackenzie Phillips' book High on Arrival confirms McCartney hanging w/ them (her parents) at that time (intel was involved in Paul's replacement), they were staying in the old Johnny Weissmuller mansion, Mackenzie fell asleep at one point on Sir Paul's lap and then got in the elevator chandelier w/ him and they cranked it to the ceiling, so she said "I guess you could say I got high with, and slept with, Paul McCartney.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes I know all this stuff is hard to believe. I believe Manson was a patsy and I believe him here tho he was def nuts.

                 I remember all that about Melcher and Mom Doris.  Also, I have always believed there was something not right about the whole story.  Now that I know about MK Ultra I am convinced that they used him to get Sharon's baby.  Was that the price Polanski had to pay in order to be allowed to leave the country?  Or for other crimes we don't even know about?  I think the kept him away from others because they were afraid something would come out if he was coming out at any time.  This stuff is so screwed up and so is Hollywood.  Perfect Netflix Fodder.

                  Yeah, it's a mess. I think Manson was mind controlled like Sirhan Sirhan. Makes me sick the way the LA cop messed w/ this witness's head about what she overheard that night from a group of three people. There's a good book about it called The Girl in the Polka Dot Dress. The whole (six hours?) documentary is good that the interview was taken from, called Evidence of Revision.

                   I just got done saying to my husband that Sirhan was another product of MK U.  I will have to look that up after T-Bird Day.  I am in charge here.  Cooking Cleaning and All That Jazz.  I have an interesting pic to send from another post in p/whatever.

                  Yeah it's in The Winged Beatle and probably in Memoirs of Billy Shears, which I believe to be written by McCartney himself. It's just alluded to.

                  Helter Skelter is the name of a roller coaster ride in the UK, it's a song on the White Album. It might hold clues, it might not. But most of their songs were filled w/ clues. The book explains a lot. I got the condensed version. The full one is, wait for it, 666 pages long.

                  Sir Paul is evasive about his dabbling w/ the occult, but admits it often in the book. They used to do seances.

                    Movie about Mary, "An American Affair," based on the book by Jansen (sp?), the guy who knew Mary as a kid. She was mistress of JFK. There's documentaries too.

                      There's a wealth of info about his dalliances. He was as bad as Bill Clinton. It was kept under wraps. And LBJ, jealous of JFK ... "I've had more women by accident than he's had on purpose."

                       I'm no JFK expert, but no slouch at researching uncomfortable topics and I've produced a couple JFK assassination video reports. After seeing some interesting info suggesting he was gay I figured it was time to look into his personal relationships.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       First point from what I concluded...JFK could have had any woman he wanted. A highly popular man with the entire spectrum. In fact, I came across the most trim of young ladies admitting to their fantasies and what they wanted to do with the man. I got to thinking the Monroe stuff was so over the top, why in the hell would he have anything to do with that sloppy, washed up wasted human?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Now consider the power required to suppress the core details of his murder for all these decades. Couldn't that same power be used to smear the man's reputation? The same thing seems to have been done to Oswald. Garrison himself described him as a hero and got choked up when talking about him. But when he was on the Carson show, it was clear that Johnny actually prepared for the interview specifically to ridicule the conspiracy.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       If you're thinking that JFK assassination research has come close to solving the mystery, I wouldn't be so sure. I'm still baffled at how few know anything at all of the cancer research aspect of Oswald's background or Jack Ruby's explicit requests to be sleep induced and hypnotized after his arrest. I myself identified clear manipulation of the Zapruder film that few had considered. Lastly, did you know there were two related murders that day? Kennedy and officer Tibbet. Some sincere researchers still imagine Tibbet:s murder was not planned or maybe even Oswald was forced to kill him. But, before that fateful day Tibbet was known for one unique characteristic. He was the spitting image of JFK. It's unreasonable to suggest that's a coincidence. So I think few are on the right trail.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Of all the places to be sharing ideas and critiquing the news, it's here at Voat where we should constantly challenge our perceptions. Was JFK a scoundrel and a womanizer? I strongly doubt it. But many colleagues I respect greatly would say that he was. That is, until I gave them a good talking down to followed by a handshake and a laugh...and maybe even some call girls!

                        Kennedy was hardly gay, he was indeed a big womanizer, everybody knows that, even those who worship him. I'm facebook friends w/ a lot of people historically involved w/ the assassination including LHO's mistress. I talk w/ her occasionally and she does the yearly JFK conferences at Dealey Plaza. I've not researched the Monroe angle, but people I trust believe he and Bobby both had affairs w/ her. Supposedly the mob had her killed.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I'm also friends w/ John Barbour, who knew Garrison better than anybody. He just did a new documentary on Garrison. As far as solving the "mystery," watch the James Files (grassy knoll shooter) interview on youtube. I'm facebook friends w/ some of his relatives, including the daughter of Gary Marlow, friend of Files who killed officer Tippet. I'm friends w/ Chauncey Holt's daughter (one of the three tramps) Karyn Holt.

                       <p>
                        CIA (intermediary was David Atlee Phillips) contracted w/ mafia for the hit (Sam Giancana and Johnny Roselli). This is how they (CIA) handled wet-works at the time. Goes back to Cuba and attempts on Castro's life. Yes, Oswald via Judyth his mistress was involved in cancer studies as a means to kill Castro. Also David Ferrie was working w/ them. Yes, Zapruder film was altered, see Douglas Horne's work and interviews w/ original CIA head of film works in DC.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Oswald shot no one that day, nor any day. Officer Tippet just happened to stop the wrong two people, there were two. See Aquilla Clemons clip by Mark Lane. Tho Kennedy's body was indeed switched from the coffin to a body bag aboard Air Force One, the "JFK replaced by Tippet's body" has been proven false.

                 And I did know about Mackenzie stuff, not all, but a lot.  Explains why she did so many drugs...to numb her mind.  Crazy stuff! Might need to research more on Manson’s younger days unless it scrapped like Obamas

                  Manson's mother was a prostitute and would have sex with johns in the next room. He always wanted her love. It's sad if you read about his childhood years.

                  "Strawberry fields, nothing is real." So wrote Lennon. Yeah she was molested, by Mick Jagger even, while her dad stepped out to get some tuna! Her dad beat on the door, he was more jealous than mad. When she broached the subject her dad would say, "You mean when we made love?" How sick is that. Poor girl. She was adorable in American Graffiti, I guess her dad had no problem lending her to Lucas for a little while. Sheesh.

                   Yeah that's right it was the surfer one, Dennis (who mysteriously drowned) ... I saw him back in the late '70s in Houston, he was so drunk he got off the drums and, to the chagrin of everyone, took over the mike and was slurring some garbage ... but I always felt sorry for him, and of course Brian was a nutcase, they prob'ly fed him drugs too, McCartney knew Brian Wilson and he and Linda went to visit him and Paul (Faul) played Brian a song and he cried. The song was She's Leaving Home, about the girl Donna (Lady Madonna) who was killed w/ Paul.
