            Fourth FBI Director name is William S. Sessions (not Jeff--- easy mistake to make.)
           </p>
           <p>
            President Clinton fired his FBI Director over the phone on July 19, 1993.
Mr. Sessions had to leave.....Like right away.

            The dead body of Vincent Foster was found in Fort Marcy Park on July 20,  1993.

            The problem with this is that it is the Mother lode - the Rosetta stone.  This offers conclusive proof that every Federal law enforcement and intelligence gathering agency in the Western world is engaged in drug running, weapons running, human trafficking, pedophilia, child pornography, rape, murder, money laundering, treason, and a host of other unsavory behaviors. This sends to federal prison every well known political, intelligence agency, and federal law enforcement character from Bush/Cheney through Obama/Hillary, with Clapper/Brennon/Comey  and most of their immediate lackeys and stooges.  And it does the same thing to most of the allied countries of the western world.
            <br/>
            The question is, who do you get to go after them?  It's too big.  And you can't pull on one strand of that spider web without the whole thing coming up.  That is the exact reason the FBI has done nothing, and anybody/everybody it has been sent to wants to pretend that they didn't see it.  How does anybody deal with something like this?

              We  keep pushing hard until we get a crack in the dam and some water starts to trickle through.  I honestly do think Trump has the guts to go after all of these sleezy characters if he ever sees a way to break through.  The problem ATM is that he is surrounded with snakes within and without his immediate circle.  But their is no magic wand to wave and put the world's most powerful individuals away in one stroke. I'm sure there are people in government who don't have this dirt on their hands, but they are probably not in the high echelons of power. I think the potential exists for him to maneuver enough people into the right positions where they can provide effective help.  And it is critical that we keep the pressure on.  The proof is there.  I believe Trump has the guts to use it.  And if things ever crack open and he has the right people in the right places, this can all break wide open.  But i think it will require patience.  People have to be in this for the long haul. I don't see it all happening overnight.

            I seem to be happy President Trump kept him.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am hoping Comey will keep showing...
And showing...And showing...
And showing his true colors....
           </p>
           <p>
            God please EXPOSE  Comey for what he is.

            It looks like what Sibel Edmonds keeps saying is true.  Judges don't get appointed unless they have dirt on them.  That about half of congress is (house and senate) are compromised.
           </p>

            released on November 11, Sibel says from 3:45:
           </p>
           <p>
            One of my FBI whistleblowers, and this was a decorated agent who never became a public whistleblower, but he went to court cases with the FBI internally because he DOJ IG, that is the Inspector General's office, etc.
One of the things this guy exposed, and I went to the media and I had this guy on the record with them but they never published, was: he was working between 1993 and 1997 in this division in the FBI, where one of his tasks was running background check on federal judge candidates, and this is during the Clinton administration, because those federal judges have to be cleared by the FBI. They look at their background: are they pedophiles, are they rapist, you know, do they have some financial nefarious activities etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            And he said, during these four years, when this decorated FBI agent, and this was 10 years, or 7, 8 years before he blew the whistle, he was running background checks on these federal judges, the way they were selecting the ones to appoint were the ones who had the highest number of skeletons. Meaning, the government, the Clinton administration (this is the head of the FBI, this is the OJ), they did not want to appoint any federal judges to the bench, and go through the confirmation process, if the judges, or the candidates, didn't have enough skeletons, meaning they have to be rapists, pedophiles, despicable characters, and that information is collected during the background check, and then they are used against these judges, so the judges rule per government's instruction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very simple, same thing, one of my main whistleblowing facts that I exposed, and this was between 2002 and 2006, and if people were to go and visit by state secrets gallery, there were going to see all these individuals, whether they were from the executive branch or congressional people, they were involved in the case I was exposing. And I talked about the fact that they were all blackmailed. Blackmailed by whom? They were blackmailed by the deep state.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you sort of saying they formed a cold, I have to say what they do, *the deep state, they want to make sure that only blackmailable, maybe I made up a word here, only blackmailable candidates get to hold offices, whether executive offices, or they are in Congress, you know whether they are in courts, federal judges, if you're clean, if you're squeaky clean, and if you start running for a major seat position, the chances are you are not going to get there because you will be disqualified. They don't want you there. They can not put pressure on you by a blackmail. So that's the answer to the questions: no we're not gonna join this crowd and talk about there is a cold, it is not about cold, this is how this corrupt system has been operating."

            She has intimate knowledge of congresswoman Jan Shakorsky being blackmailed by foreign governments and selling secrets to Israel, as well as her pedophile husband Robert Creamer, a powerful Dem lobbyist.
           </p>
           <p>
            She also lists powerful former Bush administration officials like Richard Perle, Douglas Feith, Eric Edelman, Marc Grossman etc. as being blackmailed by foreign governments and/or deep state operatives.

             I remember her saying that. I also read that Judge Scalia, the one who died, was a Satanic pedophile and he would of course protect them. They could blackmail each other. What a way to live out your time on earth.

            I find it interesting, that all the AJ/infowars bashers that came out of their holes after AJ apologized to Alefantis, attacking him instead of attacking Alefantis, are not interested in that topic.

            Employees of the CIA/FBI/NSA should be ashamed.  Not speaking out makes you complicit, imho.  Is your paycheck more important than saving the lives of innocent children?  Grow a spine and do the right thing.  You have children too.

            Larry Klayman and Dennis Montgomery filed a defamation lawsuit against a well respected national security author after that author called Montgomery a con man.  They lost their suit.
           </p>
           <p>
            They filed a nuisance defamation suit against the ACLU after the ACLU told the court that Montgomery was a con man.  Case was closed when they missed the court's deadline to file a scheduling report.
           </p>
           <p>
            Larry Klayman would sue his own mother.  Wait, he actually did sue his own mother for $50,000 in 1998.

            Why would anyone get fired at this point?
           </p>
           <p>
            If Vault 7 is true, the entire intelligence and federal law enforcement apparatus has had foreknowledge of any and all crimes for some time.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the CIA had the ability to GLOBALLY monitor anyone with Windows, iPhones, Skype, Onstar, or smart appliances/electronics
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only human trafficking/pedophilia, and terror attacks, but ALL criminal planning and communications using voice, text, email, and IM, or those discussed in ear shot of a smart device or voice enabled car communication system... Don't think for one second that their AI isn't robust enough to identify these elements.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus everyone is compromised, which is why there are put in the positions they are in- to be happy puppets, lest they risk being exposed for some crime or socially unacceptable behavior, whether they willfully participated or not.

              God used Alex Jones and Infowars (love love David Knight)
to get me out of my extremely ignorant sleeping state!

             <p>
              Ever since Alex had that banner....

             <p>
              "Hillary For Prison"

              flying over DNC convention I
can't turn against Alex.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now if he starts saying Hillary is innocent of all crimes.....
Well that is another matter.

               Correct.
Just look which topics Alex has made the world aware of and it becomes clear, he was not acting on behalf of TPTB or the global elite.
I also noticed, that those attacking him now so viciously, do only claim he was disinfo, but bring up not a single argument, where he was wrong among his many hugely important topics!
Today I watched his apology to Alefantis a third time, with and without sound, and I must say, he retracts nothing about pedogate, not even pizzagate. If you read carefully, he just retracts what he said about Alefantis.
That's pretty remakable, compared to a "disinfo" agent... ;-)

              Please don't consider that their are 7billion people on this planet and Trump is the last chance, that is beyond sad and depressing.  They are running scared with PizzaGate because it's the first thing uniting it's sheeple.  There is power in numbers, not putting it all in one person.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you have kids, teach them the real deal, raise them to join the police, FBI and all govt agencies.  Teach them to be smart and do the same thing the TPTB have been doing.  Good will triumph evil when it puts its power to good use.  God is not in the sky, its in your heart, it leads you, it doesn't do it for you.
             </p>
             <p>
              You gather your food, buy your own house, earn your own money, realize that God is leading you, not doing it for you.  Too many people put too much faith in action less prayer.

            Doesn't Comey have tenure until like 2027 or something?  So, an incoming POTUS cannot just "fire" him...there must be a special process for such outrageous corruption to be prsecuted, removed and delt with!

             I remember that being proven before the election - McCabe taking money from clintons for his wife to run and McCabe being the lead investigator.  Yet the left still didn't care.  Brazile gave all the questions, left still plugging their ears.  Left says trump and Russia, but no proof, but they're still saying it.  Proof they spied on trump transition team, but they STILL don't care.

             What has happened to people?  All politics aside, this is very very disturbing that people can't see through this

            Dennis Montgomery is either a con artist or a victim of slander.  He was accused of selling fake software to the government many years ago.  Then he worked for sheriff Joe.  Now he hangs with Larry Klayman.   I don't know what to make of him.

             I am beginning to think that Montgomery might be a con artist, but Klayman is not.   Here's my theory:   The white hats in the Intel arena wanted to give Trump the evidence, but it was impossible to do legally.   So they give it to Montgomery and tell him to go to Klayman with the story that he stole it from the NSA/CIA.   Klayman goes to a non-Obama judge that he trusts and gets an immunity deal to protect Montgomery from prosecution for stealing the data (and to make sure Montgomery doesn't have explain how he got it).    Now the data is given to Trump to nail Obama.

             It has been a very slow process, but the shake down has begun.. we all want these fuckers exposed asap.. but the so called good guys have to get solid proof and be 100% right the first time or many of the pedos/traffickers etc will skate.. there are many people who refuse letting this shit go, which will help the people who can do something... if the perp's can be exposed, they will be eventually then its all over for them! Anyone partaking in any of this shit especially organ harvesting deserves a gnarly public death!

             Spying on supreme court justices - and the MSM ignore it! The FBI ignores it!
That's as unbelieveably as #pizzagate.

             We are living in a world where the most outrageous crimes and violations of law are of no interest, even when it comes to the core interests of the state. That says a lot about TPTB.
It will take extremely capable and powerful men to wage this fight and win it.

              And as long as people are figuring out things aren't exactly as they are presented....or that there is mischief afoot....of utmost importance is the level to which our news is fabricated; aka completely false.  To quote CIA director James Casey "We will know our disinformation program is complete, when everything the American public believes is false".  I think he meant it :/  Kennedy tried to warn.

             I'm afraid that's where we are at. The left doesn't care.  They said bigger than watergate and impeach him on their ASSUMPTION Trump collided with Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, There's no evidence of that, but there's evidence of Obama admin spying on transition team and they did a rat's ass!  No comparison to watergate on that.  They are truly evil horrid people.  How half the nation can't see through their BS due to their hypocrisy just blows my mind.  I'll give the world order one thing : they truly delivered on the keep the people dumb and distracted rule in their playbook.  The people are dumb dumb dumb dumb

              Francesco Vincent "Frank" Serpico (born April 14, 1936) is a retired American New York City Police Department (NYPD) officer who holds both American and Italian citizenship. He is known for whistleblowing on police corruption in the late 1960s and early 1970s, an act that prompted Mayor John V. Lindsay to appoint the landmark Knapp Commission to investigate the NYPD.

              "In 1971 I was awarded the Medal of Honor, the NYPD’s highest award for bravery in action, but it wasn’t for taking on an army of corrupt cops. It was most likely due to the insistence of

             But time doesn't tell us much.  We don't know what's true and false anymore.  Who's being bribed by whom?  This is all too confusing.  The bottom line is though that kids are being abused and tortured and raped and no one is rescuing them nor stopping new ones from suffering the same fate.
