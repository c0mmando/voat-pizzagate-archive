            We already have documentaries about child trafficking (
            <strong>
             he's asking for 1/2 million dollars
            </strong>
            to make another one) - like the Franklin Case. Why would Congress stop that doc from being released on cable, but allow this former employee of Clinton to come along and expose them now? Is America more ready now to let this stuff be aired? NO. And the Franklin Case documentary, as well as many other great docs on this epidemic, are all out there - none have stopped child trafficking by the elite. Craig should get a real job.

             I want to say something here, if you don't mind. I don't agree with all the recent posts trying to portray Craig Sawyer as a disinfo agent (maybe I'm wrong, but I really hope not). I also personally think that documentaries are very powerful. This is how the media and Hollywood influences and brainwashes the masses. It's a known fact. For me personally, this is how I found out that Hillary was up to no good. It was not the Wikileaks Podesta dumps as much as it was 2 documentaries about Hillary: "Clinton Cash" and "Hillary's America". That's how I got red-pilled in the first place and that's why I am all for Sawyer making a docu, because I believe that they can reach a lot more people. If this guy can help PG this way, then why not? Peace.

              I hear you. The info I have is that he's not reporting on PG, not in the way Ryan is doing. He's reporting on historical pedogate stuff. So for 1/2 million of our money, I cna't say this is going to be a good investment if we want to help the children. Craig has made no assurances that for the money, he will even end up making a doc. He has not been willing to give much in the way of information, and has called people names who question him, including calling PizzagateHowie a pedo!
             </p>
             <p>
              A better investment might be with the Ryans - see what you think:

               My point was to warn the community against the unnecessary exposing of activists. We should only be focusing on the research, the investigation, connecting the dots and collecting evidence against those who abuse, rape and murder children.

              Not disinfo, but selective takedown. He may expose some pedos and take them down, but protect others. When he went after Howie on Twitter that was a big red flag.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think as long as Craig is raising awareness that is good. I agree with you there. But we shouldn't sit back and put our faith in him. It seems more like the elites are splitting because this pedophilia stuff is going to come out to the public inevitably. So they are trying to get out in front and keep the people happy by taking down some of this stuff, but the trafficking and abuse will continue in their communities.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know how these people operate, so we are going to keep an eye out.

               Sure, I agree with keeping an eye out on these people, but... I don't think that spamming threads about these people over this and over that is doing any good to our community. All it's really doing is divide us. Same thing with the anti-semite agenda. It's only dividing us. Let's stick to less controversial subjects such as research, evidence and the presentation of findings and facts. We have different opinions and views. Some people are more trusting than others, some others are smarter, more awake or have been through experiences that give them an advantage over others, so, we can't all agree on subjects like these. However there is much less divide when evidence is gathered and facts are presented. People don't disagree as much when threads about actual research are posted. Evidence and facts are not as controversial.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those who are really serious about the investigation and are serious about helping the children will see through this agenda and will push back. That's just my two cents.

             I just think the entire angle of a "documentary" is stupid. We all have cameras attached to phones nowadays. Record, YT it and create a series that say FIRST if you are serious. Any time someone has their hand out and hasn't shown proven results I'm turned off.

            He is correct, although it is unsure if he can be trusted. Everything connects to Racine, Wisconsin. Craig Sawyer - if you are not controlled, you need to help put the spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin. We have been busy digging and are about to break this wide open very soon. Who cares about fundraising for another go-nowhere documentary - we need to expose this now. We need you to get the military and police to back those of us who are about to expose this. Right now, the law enforcement in Racine is bought and paid for, and are currently working to cover up more cases of criminal corruption among local officials and their elite handlers.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is extremely serious. If you do not hear about Racine, Wisconsin regularly and again soon, investigate immediately. There have been a string of mysterious deaths, high level resignations, cover ups, retaliation, stalking, death threats and attempted murder on victims and witnesses to what is going on in Racine.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are about to connect all of the dots and expose the entire system. We need everyone's help to put the spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin. We just need protection from the elite behind this. They are literally trying to murder us to silence it. This is not a joke, a drill, or a disinfo campaign. This is it, and we are almost ready to expose it all. All we need is protection and a spotlight. The world needs to hear what is happening in Racine and how it is all connected. Help us help each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you ready for this nightmare to end? We are nearly ready. Prepare and align the troops for battle.

            Generic copy, asking for donations, selling merch? C'mon. You need to organize, inform and provide some heavy hitting news that is 1st party generated. Otherwise, it won't build any steam.

             We will never get any groundswell if the masses are ignorant. Our law enforcement sure isn't stepping up to the plate.

              Great quote, jangles. I agree with you -- it's why we need to get organized about selecting key evidence, packaging it, and targeting key individuals who will want to be on the right side of history, such as Angelina Jolie, perhaps.
