            <p>
             Quite a while ago, I had to ban one or two users from
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
              v/pizzagatewhatever
             </a>
             for pretending to be becki. You can find them in the Removed submissions area and the ban list. I don't remember all the details. It might shed additional light. They also were making fake posts about her on Twitter, using edited excerpts of her video(s).
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a definite difference in tone between becky_p20 and the Voat users I banned and becki_percy_speaks. BP20 on Twitter is the only real account I was aware of for her. When this first started happening a year ago or whenever I banned them the first time, she seemed fairly new to most social media. In fact, as I recall, someone reached out to me on her behalf to get the shitposts on Voat cleaned up, because she didn't have an account and didn't know how to navigate Voat.

              I'll have a bit more of a snoop around voat at some point, there's plenty of little things worth making a note of in this situation. One way or another, it's becoming yet another source of division among the general population of researchers and purported victims/survivors. The question still remains as to who's telling the truth and who's embelishing the facts, though, I have some suspicions that I best not air explicitly in public.

             </p>
             <p>
              I will say this, though:
             </p>
             <p>
              Becki's story seemed a lot more grounded and credible in 2015 when shared via bex_p96; it seems to have taken on a particular new theme as of 2016. I'd encourage curious parties to compare the differences and ask themselves if others somehow influenced Becki to adopt new talking points - making note of Sarah's initials... it's worth thinking about, despite how unpopular the implications are.

            I don't know.  I mean believe whatever the hell you want, and from whomever you want.  But as someone who was harassed by Becki on Twitter into giving her the finer details of my CSA story, I don't want any part of what she's selling (including her candle business that she spammed me with links to the moment I followed her account when I signed up to twitter), and I certainly don't believe her attacks against
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Duffy1958">
             @Duffy1958

            were by a fraudulent account.
           </p>
           <p>
            Strange though how some victims are believed, and others are not. And when one person defends themselves, they're a "lame psyop".
