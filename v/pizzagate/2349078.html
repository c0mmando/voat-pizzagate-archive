<p><strong>Perhaps the most interesting new information though, is about a pedophile center masquerading as a Rehab Center with the help of the FLDS church.</strong></p>
<p>Here\'s a summary for the TL;DR people:</p>
<p>There is a cult-like offshoot of the Assemblies of God Pentecostal church called the Dream City Church in Phoenix, Arizona, which is also linked with the Dream Center for Recovery in Los Angeles..</p>
<p><a href="https://dreamcenter.org/">https://dreamcenter.org/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://dreamcenterforrecovery.com/">https://dreamcenterforrecovery.com/</a></p>
<p>Looks beautiful, doesn\'t it?</p>
<p>The DCfR began as a rehab center in Los Angeles, and has since expanded into more than a hundred locations across America and internationally.</p>
<p>Now, while we\'re on the subject of religious &quot;Dream&quot; organizations, let\'s toss in some info associated with David Geffen:</p>
<p>Dream City Records, that produces &quot;Christian Music&quot;, and</p>
<p>DreamWorks SKG (Spielberg, Katzenberg, Geffen) of which Geffen was a co-founder (he left Dreamworks in 2008.)</p>
<p>I\'ve had some experience dissecting financial frauds in the past, and one thing I\'ve noticed is that whenever people are doing shit they don\'t want the public or the cops to know about, they set up a maze of companies with misleading names, even numbers for names, and obscure ownership. The idea is to make it very hard to &quot;follow the money&quot; to the &quot;Man Behind the Curtain.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, this is where we start down the rabbit hole:</p>
<p>Suppose the Dream Centers were getting big &quot;donations&quot; from a shell company, that was in its turn getting its money from another shell company that was owned by a certain entertainment mogul, who always tries to stay out of the limelight. And suppose this mogul had initials DG?</p>
<p>Now let\'s also think about how this &quot;Dream&quot; church/rehab center organization (which is a non-profit charitable organization BTW, with all the tax avoidance possibilities that entails) decided to partner up with another religious organization that would provide cover for them if they wanted to set up a center where very wealthy clients could indulge in &quot;therapy&quot; with underage girls recruited in impoverished Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>There is a town in the far north of Arizona, right on the Utah border called Colorado City, AZ.</p>
<p>Colorado City is basically owned by the Fundamentalist Latter Say Saints (that\'s right, the renegade Pentecostal group decided to link up with the renegade Mormons who believe it\'s apostasy to reject the religion\'s founding belief in polygamy.)</p>
<p>Now suppose a particularly nasty FLDS leader called Warren Jeffs was jailed for various sexual assaults on women and children, and one of his &quot;wives&quot; won all his buildings in a legal judgement.</p>
<p>Then this former &quot;wife&quot; became enthused about the Dream Center rehabs and sold the church former Jeffs buildings on the outskirts of Colorado City:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.12news.com/article/news/warren-jeffs-65th-wife-transforms-compound-into-social-services-shelter/75-491035975">http://www.12news.com/article/news/warren-jeffs-65th-wife-transforms-compound-into-social-services-shelter/75-491035975</a></p>
<p>This particular center is called the Short Creek Dream Center, fyi.</p>
<p>One unique aspect of Colorado City (population about 4,000) is that is has modern, well-maintained two-runway airport capable of handling business jets, even though no commercial airlines fly there, and even though there is no public transportation to the place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tocc.us/airport/">http://www.tocc.us/airport/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/KAZC">https://www.airnav.com/airport/KAZC</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_City_Municipal_Airport">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_City_Municipal_Airport</a></p>
<p>Hmmm . . . so the church now has a property in a tiny town where the majority of the population supports pedophilia (in the form of marriage to underage children,) and where there\'s a modern, jet-capable airport with no federal or state authorities poking around (since there\'s no commercial air traffic, there is no TSA screening, for example, and law enforcement at the airport is the responsibility of the state sheriff who has his office in another town.)</p>
<p>Sounds like a great place to fly in very rich guys who want some &quot;treatment&quot; from underage girls.</p>
<p>Credit must go to Enty of CDAN who first brought this particular center to the attention of his readers here:</p>

<p>Here are some relevant quotes:</p>
<p>&quot;One thing upfront. The church I am referring to is not Scientology. This is a church that was founded just a couple of years ago in northern Arizona. Why this particular location? It is remote for sure, which helps. They learned in the past that it helps to be remote. They also learned in the past that it helps if they can attach themselves to another established church or religion. They got that in this northern Arizona town too. What they also got though are three things they treasure most of all. Number one was the built in security from the other very secretive religion in the area throughout the town, which was very open to the idea when they saw the very large check. Number two they had the ability to integrate hundreds of children into a community that seemingly has nothing but endless supplies of children. Finally, they were coming to a community where no one looks down on anyone who has sex with teens and tweens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The church is a non profit and their biggest donor is a shell company which is part of another shell company which is owned by the same A+ list mogul we have seen time and time again in all of these stories. This is where things get a little interesting. Because of the racial makeup in the community, and wanting to make sure everyone blends in, they had to get the tweens and teens from Europe. Specifically they found some orphanages in Eastern Europe. How did they get them all into the country? Well, every church needs religious workers. The church hired twenty &quot;pastors&quot; and got them in as special immigrant religious workers. Each of these &quot;pastors&quot; had between four and six children they brought in with them, and of course their wives, many of whom had their own children too. Of course, none of these pastors or wives really have any kids they brought, but almost overnight, what these people have created is a fully functioning, safe from prying eyes place where these kids are being abused.&quot;</p>

            Just at the end of last year, a
            <strong>
             whistleblower from Passages won a close to $2m payout for a wrongful termination
            </strong>
            ....she had spoken out about a suspicious death of an in-house patient and was fired soon after.

             I think that place is a Gold Mine of Evidence.  Those two are Guilty as can be.  I think I posted about that dead body found in there.  Can you imagine it not making the news?  Who was that dead person?  Yeah, I don't know how we can find out if JP was ever there.  He certainly would never register there for rehab.  His kind don't think there is anything wrong with them.  It certainly needs More Eyes.

            Good to see someone finally collated this material and was able to put it in digestible form.  Enty seems to have piled the deck up  with so much shit it's getting difficult to wade around in let alone breath. I'm having a hard time accepting the fact that Enty and the himmms are dragging their feet revealing these atrocities that have been happening for decades while one half of the CDAN crowd bitches about Enty getting too graphic and no fun anymore.  I've been caught in this realm of suspension along with disbelief that there is so much inaction and apathy here,  there and everywhere. Road blocks like ddos attacks,  bot armies and straight up dumbasses drag any serious discoveries back into loony land at every turn,  ignorance abounds. Somethings gotta break.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe that's what I'll do is show up at CDAN later and demand some closure.

            I find the use of the Dream City and Dreamworks names by Geffen interesting!
           </p>
           <p>
            That plus the fact that he's funding these Dream City Church guys through secret companies says to me that something's  going on between them. What's really weird is that the Pentecostals are supposed to be super Fundamentalist and against gays, but here they are taking money from one of the most famous gays in the country. Maybe that's one reason they're not an official part of the Assemblies of God anymore? LIke they say though: money talks!
           </p>
           <p>
            So Geffen is funding them, and they've got a system going to get rich guys into a pedophile center away from the eyes of LEOs. I guess that might explain why they're working together.

            This whole thing that Chester and Cornell didn't know what was happening and started to investigate is total bullshit and controlled opposition. Give me a break. They knew. They all knew. And they were most likely involved in the trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            They saw the disbelief in the murders and used the internet theory to cover their guilt. Wake up.

            And by the way, John Podesta went on a road trip out west in the weeks before Chester's death and tweeted his locations.
           </p>
           <p>
            He stopped tweeting after arriving Colorado on July 10th. (I can't see if made replies because I don't have a twitter account)
           </p>
           <p>
            Chester died July 21st.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta resumed tweeting July 27th.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect he had to ritually sacrifice his son, Chester, to save his own skin.

             I'm in total agreement.  Cornell had deep ties to Disney and their work is full of Satanic imagery.

             I would even guess that some famous deaths may even be faked and these people could have went underground.

             Around the time he died there were a myriad of posts here about it.  Very long posts.  I was going through a real long one like mad and in it someone posted a link with a Tweet from Chester to John Wishing him a Happy Birthday.  I did not know how to archive so when I went back to find it it was gone.  Someone else told me they saw it to, but again it disappeared.  My feeling is that when he dated his mother he raped that boy over and over and over thus possibly creating another mini John.  I believe Chester realized what happened and he and Chris wanted to turn things around.  Make something good out of evil.  They discovered what was going on in that little town and that the pastors were leaving the country and returning with refugees to stock the city.  They also knew who was behind it, David G.  Also they rape the girls make them pregnant to replenish the supply.  In the meantime they also create more pedophiles, imo.  So that is my story as I see it.  I completely agree with you.  Che$ter was John's son.

               I have read about his possibly realizing what happened to him because of his being horribly abused.  He was not raped once.  He was abused to the point of turning him into an abuser as well.  I believe he recognized what he had become.  We have no proof of all of this but it is a possibility.  It is a horrid thing to consider.

               He wouldn't have had to know the mother or have met the mother. In my thread on Marlon Brando, the connection to Michael Jackson springs up. Why? Well, it seems when Michael Jackson was contemplating having children, he took himself out of the process for being considered as a prospective dad. Instead, he asked a number of friends for sperm in which to impregnate the surrogate mom. These included Marlon Brando, Uri Geller, Mark Klein, Macaulay Culkin and Corey Feldman. It's a definite hint that others were doing the same so parentage in PedoWood and LaLaLand is dicey. Here's the link:

               There is a really odd connection with Shinoda and Bill Clinton in Haiti too that was discovered.  He is invested in a Co. in Haiti.  Very odd indeed. So they have a Haiti Connection.  This stuff can't get any more bazaar, imo.

               I remember that someone found she was a nurse At some point, I believe she had Chester, she had an affair with someone, we have never found the proof when she met him or that he was in Arizona where they lived, but I can't remember anyone denying the resemblance.  I can never forget the bond that Chester and Chris had.  I never listened to their music nor heard of them before, but after researching and hearing about them I was consumed with their connection. It was amazing. I believe there was a reason they became even more connected.  They discovered the secret that some powerful mogul was guilty of.  Here is what is in his Wiki:    Bennington's death occurred on what would have been Chris Cornell's 53rd birthday.[63] Cornell, who was a close friend of Bennington, had also committed suicide two months prior.[63] Bennington commented on Cornell's death on Instagram by stating, "I can't imagine a world without you in it."[63] Shinoda noted that Bennington was very emotional when the band performed "One More Light" in his honor on Jimmy Kimmel Live,[64] where he could not finish singing the song and started getting choked up during both the rehearsal and at the live performance setting.[65] The band was due to record a live performance of their single "Heavy" on the show, but decided instead to play "One More Light" after hearing the news about Cornell's death because the song is about the loss of a friend.[65] Bennington sang Leonard Cohen's song "Hallelujah" at Cornell's funeral.[63] He was also the godfather of Cornell's son Christopher.[63]  It also says this about his abuser:  Years later he revealed the abuser's identity to his father but chose not to continue the case after he realized the abuser was a victim himself.[11]  Now we will never know what that person was.

            Women were recruited from LDS church for Waco, by David Karesh. When the girls turned 12 David Karesh sexually abused all of them. My neighbors in the Appalachian mountains of NC  were recruited.Or rather my neighbor's ex wife and 3 adult children went. 2 women and one man. The man was killed in the fire. The govt. kept his body for 2 years unrefrigerated , and then returned it to the family. One of the women left when her daughter turned 12....but she still believed in him and the church.
