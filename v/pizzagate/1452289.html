<p>Seems innocent enough so I checked the phone number and address in the invitation. The phone number belongs to Elyse (the sender) and Aaric Eisenstein (one of the three recipients). According to other posts they are/were married. The address for the party, however, doesn\'t make any sense since there is no &quot;gymboree&quot; located at that address in Austin. </p>
<p>I did some more digging and there are currently no gymboree play gyms in this plaza (8015 shoal creek). It appears there was one in this plaza at one time, but in a different suite (suite 108 not 115) up until 2011 or so.
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/gymboree-play-and-music-austin-2">https://www.yelp.com/biz/gymboree-play-and-music-austin-2</a></p>
<p>Next I tried to find out what is in suite 115. I got a link to a title company 
<a href="http://www.finduslocal.com/title-insurance/texas/austin/stewart-title-company">http://www.finduslocal.com/title-insurance/texas/austin/stewart-title-company</a></p>
<p>This title company, however, no longer appears to be in this suite and has moved to suite 114, here\'s a list of current locations in Austin (with several different LLCs located in 114).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stewart.com/content/stewart/stewartcom/en/locate-an-issuing-office.html?dist=10&amp;address=&amp;city=&amp;state=&amp;zip=78757">https://www.stewart.com/content/stewart/stewartcom/en/locate-an-issuing-office.html?dist=10&amp;address=&amp;city=&amp;state=&amp;zip=78757</a>
(Note the phone number from 115 is still being used by ABC/Prosperity title)</p>
<p>I also found some recent permits for sign changes at this address, however they are for work in 115. It appears that the signs were changed from &quot;gracy title&quot; to &quot;stewart title&quot; in May and June this year.

<p>There are also permits for construction. The latest permits are from 2014 but there is a large gap between 2003 and 2014. You\'d think if there was a children\'s gym here at one point there would be construction. It also doesn\'t explain why this company was located at 115 as of a few months ago but now uses 114 (maybe they own both? The same contractor did work on both).

Here are permits for suite 114, also a large gap between 1998 and 2013.

<p>The address on the original invitation could just be a typo, however it was a pdf that someone took the time to make and not some quick email. Also, why were there only three recipients, why was the subject &quot;proof&quot;, and why was it forwarded? If Elyse is this kid\'s mother wouldn\'t she be the original one to send this out? I think this merits more looking into especially with that sketchy address. What was in suite 115 on 08/26/07 since it definitely wasn\'t a children\'s gym and is there anything going on with  these various title companies that use several different names at the same address?</p>

            Gymboree is a specific name and kids clothing brand. I am not aware of any of these stores having some sort of jungle gym for kids and their birthday parties.

             At the top of their main site they have a link to "gymboree play and music" where it looks like they have locations that teach lessons and do kids birthday parties.

            proof :  a copy (as of typeset text) made for examination or correction
           </p>
           <p>
            So I think that explains the subject line. As for the address:  It seems most likely to me that there was just a typo or mistake? If the Gymboree or whatevs was located in a plaza, either of the addresses would likely get you there, no?

             I agree that it could just be a harmless typo but it's weird that the address has little activity other than some recent random title companies at the suite next door. Weird addresses raise flags since a post on the old sub at reddit about this sketchy conceirge service between the hamptons and the USVI:
             <a href="http://vacationconciergeservice.com/">
              http://vacationconciergeservice.com/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             There's also a babysitting service with a link to a massage service (with the same picture of clinton from the vacation page)
             <a href="http://easthamptonbabysitters.com/index.html">
              http://easthamptonbabysitters.com/index.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             All with this Kevin Reynolds guy who's retired NYPD and a world class massage therapist? The same phone number is used for all of these various linked businesses: travel, babysitting, catering, etc. and the address used for the massage/babysitting place is some random intersection in a woodsy residential area. There are just so many red flags there.
