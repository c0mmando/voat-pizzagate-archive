Let\'s begin...</p>
<h1>What\'s in the dumps?</h1>
<p>A whole bunch of information mined from the websites hosted on the Darknet by Freedom Hosting II. According to Anonymous, when they analysed the data they found at least 50% of it to be child-porn. All CP has been deleted from the dump but bare in mind that much of the data that remains is NSFW. </p>

<p>As you can see, we\'ve also got password and username information relating to the CP websites. Fortunately for us most of the pedophiles on this list seem to be low on the IQ scale and <em>have used the same login details for other websites</em>. This means they may use the same username for another website e.g. for Facebook they may have the same email or username as the CP site</p>
<p>Our <strong>primary</strong> goal should be to find the corresponding accounts and screenshot + archive so we have evidence of their links to the Darknet. By doing this we can keep a record for our purposes and we can also send the information to the FBI. My logic is that if enough of us flood the FBI inbox with this information, they will be more prone to taking action.  
</p>
<p>Our <strong>secondary</strong> goal should be to find links to Pizzagate from these accounts. Some of the users are on Facebook or Tumblr which almost certainly means they will participate in pedophile related groups or discussions. Infiltrate those groups, archive/screenshot and detail the information here. </p>
<p>Bear in mind that it\'s been a few days since the hacking now. The pedophiles may have changed their details thus evading our search. But we should still keep digging because there is MUCH MORE data left to wade through.</p>

            I do data analysis and am (sometimes) technically inclined. I do not really know much about security and what my limits are. Is there a resource for getting into this more nitty, gritty research? Thanks!

            Any updates on possible upcoming hacks?  I think exposure through hacks and leaks  might be the best weapon.  If those talented in those areas could get into the computers of corrupt government (at all levels including law enforcement) and submit to wikileaks.

            Notice the weird photoshopped little girl holding a chicken, that he is wearing a Christmas and mouse or bear-eared hat in a few photos, and that he says he literally works as a shady criminal enterprise doing human trafficking in Tennessee.

            I mean this could just be someone with a really dark sense of humor, but seems like it might be more than that and is using social media to signal his preferences.

            I don't know if you can help out.  Last week when this dump for the hack was released I contacted the mom of missing teen since 2010.  After seeing some of the horrible images from searches on these people I knew that all these women couldn't be willing (obviously) and that if I had a missing teen (now adult) I would be scouring this info for my daughter.  She referred me to her PI.  I sent links over to the PI, but since then you all have done a great job of going through this info.  I was wondering if you had any direct links to trafficking sites or pics related to trafficking or anything that you think would be beneficial to her.  This video is has the story of the missing girl and the PI. Thanks if you can help in any way.

            I've never done anything like this before...but I've wanted to. Is there anything that I need to keep in mind specifically if I try to help out with this, other?  And by "try", that means I'll give it a good effort but I'd probably be fumbling around while everyone else figures it out...

            Turns out there's a port in szczecin, and there's a gzregorz kowalski who works for their navy stationed there. Maybe it's a case of mistaken identity, couldn't find a picture. Warrants would clear this up real quick.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe one of you can help identify him in these pictures from the navy ports gallery

               I find it hard to believe that someone who is concerned about a dog abandoned with maggots and a tumour and a person who is for animal rights is likely to be involved in pedogate - unless as a pedohunter.  But he needs to be talked to by the authorities.

            I think there should be some people dedicated to making Pizzagate their primary goal with this - there's a lot of stuff here, and it would be amazing to catch loads of pedophiles, but bringing down the elite ring is so important and we don't know yet for sure whether action is being taken against them.

             Besides the Instagram picture of the little girl taped up on the wall which is, I believe, an attempt by this Muslim subject to mock Jesus Christ's crucifixion, nothing seems out of the ordinary. He seems to be the kind of man that would keep his pedophile tendencies private.

            I know nothing about what you all are doing with this dump. I have followed and lurked and believed since I read the handkerchief email. I have observed the censorship from reddit, youtube, facebook and twitter. I was red-pilled many years ago and have never seen more deception and bias in the MSM as I witness today. You, all, are the unsung heroes. When this breaks, our history is rewritten and our countries future is saved. If I knew how to upvoat, this thread and those who investigate for our children, would get a million from me! Thank you!
