<p>So the location of IGE was in Marbella, Spain. Marc, David, and Chad went there and created IGE. Interpol tracked them down and arrested them in their villa in 2002. Much of IGE has been scrubbed and removed but they are behind many prominent MMORPG\'s, Including one I personally loved for many years called The Secret World and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Many of these MMORPG\'s have millions upon millions of players. In them many you can have private messages and private photo sharing. Virtual Currency, David Brock\'s specialty, especially comes into use. They transport money through video games.</p>
<p>&quot;Like all the other in-game currency traders, the vast majority of IGE\'s revenue comes from buying/selling World of Warcraft gold. Its website traffic, and allegedly its revenues, have been declining since 2006 due to the increased competition from the in-game currency traders based in China and the constant bombardment of anti-real-money trading measures by Blizzard Entertainment, the publisher of World of Warcraft.&quot;</p>
