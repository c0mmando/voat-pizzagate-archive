<p>As citizen journalists dug into the many levels of what\'s now termed pizzagate, disturbing pedophile-related images, art work and powerful associations were revealed on a pizza restaurant owner\'s instagram account and archived before it was switched to private. That visual data exploded online as a culture of outrage and cybermobs put Comet Ping Pong in the cross hairs of a potential child trafficking pedophile network. For many, the evidence online was enough to research deeper, despite the chorus call and implementation of filtering so called fake news, but what will it take for an official investigation to commence?</p>
<p>Join Geoff Brady host of In Other News (Mondays 11PM on WBAI) and returning guest Nick Bryant, author of The Franklin Scandal : A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse and Betrayal for a two-hour live interview on stage at the Brooklyn Commons. This production will be broadcast live on air January 2, 2017 from 4-6 PM. We\'ll also take your questions in the second hour of the interview. The massive resources being used to censor, debunk and lie about the information that could lead to evidence of a child-trafficking and abuse network in Washington DC is very telling. Lets examine the potential evidence and take your questions with Nick Bryant who will expound on the background of pedophile networks and related cover ups going up to the highest levels drawn from his 14 years of research.&quot;</p>
