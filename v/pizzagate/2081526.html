<p>Is Mohammed Akram Awan a relative of Imran, possibly father? A popular background check site says that an Imran Awan living in a D.C. suburb is indeed related to a Mohammed Akram Awan who also has a D.C. suburb address AND a Jamal Awan (can\'t post the link bc doxxing), if these are all the right people.</p>
<p>The below site has info suggesting that Akram Awan was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Where is he now?</p>

              Started reading the comments after the George Webb  vid linked in the prior thread on the Linkin Park "suicides."  Suggests association between Awan and a Naval Base shooting. Remember the attack? Note:  authors' names attributed to comments deleted. Hope the info helps investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The shooting rampage that began around 8:20 a.m. at the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters building also left 14 people wounded.
The naval sea command was the focus of the mass shooting in 2013? What does this department control?﻿
The shooting by the lone gunman walking into the building in DC? Were the dead ever identified?﻿
Not sure. Was just concentrating on naval yard. Interesting connection to Awan. If he onioned the router not sure (that)we can prove (it). However, lot of dead people, 14 of them, maybe connected to either identifying the Treason or Part of It. I think they identified it.﻿
Are you joking?﻿
NavSea is the command﻿.I completely missed this HUGE bit of info﻿
             </p>
             <p>
              DSamIam go back to previous vieo. I think it was Brian that put up great links to articles.﻿
. . . connection between Naval Yard and Awans. A working theory. This to me is serious stuff. We had the reported hacking of USS Cole, and now 2 ships collide? Was intel going back and forth from Awan Server to Naval Yard? You established a connection in Congress pretty much 100%,  While this is not directly related to your investigation it'd be a consequence of compromised intel.﻿
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe Imran's router was connected to a secure Navy IP.  I will continue to try to prove this.  Does Annapolis Consulting Group have a Blackberry Enterprise Server?﻿"

            I provided information on the earlier post regarding this connection to the Awan father. George Webb was provided this information will not confirm how but it was in his hands as of last night. He has been live in DC since yesterday at the courthouse regarding the Imran Awan indictement. He was on cammera this morning speaking directly about this information and how the CIA is directly linked including who is involved. He also filing legal documents to intervene in the Imran Awan case on behalf of the American people today so it will not be swept under the carpet.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was discovered yesterday that not only is Debbie Wasserman Shultz brother Steve Wasserman the US district attorney on this case, the assigned assistant US attorney Machando is married to the youngest sibling Jo Ann Wasserman.

            Do you think they would recuse themselves? Hell no they haven't. Stunning. Call AG Sessions if you want action. The case goes before Obama appointee Federal judge in ten days.

               Hopefully he sees this updated post too.. people at first went wild with the notion this was his father but I only presented that as a possibility... I want any family or friend connection between the two to come out, I don't want some FAKE NEWS HE IS NOT HIS DAD crap coming out and blowing credibility.

            LOL @ the final comment of the 3rd screenshot from the handle "Awan_borthers" ... "Plausible"
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this is big. George Webb was notified... thus far, Akram only shows up on Trello based on some other connections in the "Awan Family" bucket, but it doesn't look like any connections have been made from ISI to Mossad to CIA based on these old articles.
           </p>
           <p>
            We'll see if he does anything with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know, I know, George Webb is a mossad psyop, bla bla bla, but - until any of you naysayers start going door to door in DC and NYC, putting your life on the line, funding a crowdsourced investigation and posting 6-12 videos a day detailing your findings. Please, shut the fuck up.

             I think he's only a Mossad psyop because they got to him when he started getting too close. This man is one of the best researchers out there. That's what research is, presenting ALL the facts and letting your readers draw their own conclusions.

              He stated that he WAS working w/ Mossad... apparently well before any of the leaks or even his videos began hitting.
             </p>
             <p>
              He's referenced it numerous times. If he was attempting to be a covert disinfo agent, I'm assuming he wouldn't have offered this information up and repeatedly/freely discuss it.

            Though many people have dismissed him those of us still assisting that never gave up sent this information to G.w. As soon as it was found. He is on the ground in DC and Va now because of Imran Awan arrest. This involves Top Government officials dating back at least 20 years. Excellent work
