<p>Let\'s look at this 3/28/17 article from the Baltimore News covering the latest advancements in the case: <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-rockville-rape-lawyer-20170328-story.html">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-rockville-rape-lawyer-20170328-story.html</a></p>
<p>Now let\'s look at the factual elements on how this story plats in the the satanic elite/deep state narrative:</p>
<p>Perpetrators: 2 Undocumented Immigrants with priors.
Victim: Underage Girl
Scene of crime: High School Bathroom
Location of Crime: Rockville High School, Rockville,Maryland
School Mascot: Ram</p>
<p>Now let\'s look at some MSM news story examples that have been trending and being pushed on us with related themes leading up to this event:</p>
<p>1) ICE Arrests: <a href="https://www.google.es/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/02/13/politics/ice-raids-enforcement-arrest-numbers/index.html">https://www.google.es/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/02/13/politics/ice-raids-enforcement-arrest-numbers/index.html</a>

<p>Now, let\'s look at the Rockville High School Mascot, shall we?: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bandlogos.ussba.trigonroad.com/7079EE4E-1517-8A12-D95E5D4EA2F8D563.jpg">https://s3.amazonaws.com/bandlogos.ussba.trigonroad.com/7079EE4E-1517-8A12-D95E5D4EA2F8D563.jpg</a></p>
<p>Well, look at that! It\'s a ram! Look familiar guys? Look like any other iconic symbology we are familiar with in the satanic rape rituals of a certain group? <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png/220px-SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png/220px-SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png</a></p>

<p>Yup. You guessed it. Our good ol\' buddy baphomet.</p>
<p>So why is this all significant and what does it all mean?</p>
<p>Well, the MSM only chooses stories that perpetuate the deep state narrative, right? And we have to ask ourselves why is this particular child rape story getting so much MSM coverage yet the D.C. Girls got next to nothing? Because it\'s feeding the unconscious public mind something important for the deep state: </p>
<p>My guess is the way this story is rolling out this perpetrator will not get charged and stay in the country. Mark my words. His lawyers will acquit him under the grounds that this victim was not a victim and say it was consensual. He will not get any punishment and it will further convolute the lines between of consent and rape and further pave the road for future child sex rapists to get off, cementing the narrative that sex with a minor is not statutory rape if it\'s consentual, laying the groundwork for congress to pass a law that states just that.</p>
<p>And the significance of this all happening at a school in a state that opposed Trump with ignoring his orders for a illegal immigrant ban where the school mascot is a RAM? It\'s a big fuck you and the satanic elites putting a big fucking stamp on it, declaring that this is them shaping our history.</p>

             False flag doesn't mean it was fake or never happened. It can mean that it's an opportunity for the elites to send a message. Like the London attack. It happened. But it had elite coding written all over it.

              So the message is the message is the false flag? I've never heard of calling that a false flag, but then again, I don't know everything. I wouldn't agree that even if a message were sent that it would fall under this heading. The girl was raped and these scumbags are responsible. Thanks for the explanation.

             Yep, case is over, he's gone and surely they won't find him.  Yet this girl's life has been ruined.  This is the state of our government, disgusting corruption at every level.  I am starting to believe the only people that go to jail are the ones that get in the way of govt criminals.

             Case hasn't gone to trial yet. I'm just making a prediction based on the case their lawyers and MSM is making.

              If the guy fled, how can u have a trial? I'm not sure he fled, but that's what was being said. But if he is found and does go to trial, I'm sure you're right. Hell, Drew Barrymore's new Netflix show is trying to normalize cannibalism. This world is going down the toilet fast.

                Ok good! I guess it's another one with rape charges that fled. I guess my question is, why the hell these judges allow an ILLEGAL (um, that's against the law, strike 1) can post bond anyway, especially being a rapist (strike 2). I guess the laws of the USA are nothing anymore

            I accept this theory in its entirety.  I had a similar thought about this case.  My thought about it is this...if these guys get off, I think that'll be the final call to action.  That'll be enough, most of the right and a lot of the trump train
            <em>
             at least have heard
            </em>
            of pizzagate or pedogate.  At least, I'd put money on that.  Or any cases related, or that they've been really chipping away at trafficking, you get what I mean.  I think that'll be just about enough for about half of America, if they get off and stick around.
