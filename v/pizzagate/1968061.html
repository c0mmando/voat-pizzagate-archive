             wasn't Nat Enq an actual anthrax victim way back in 2001? And Trump is friends with the publisher there? Very Interesting.

            Yeah, because all of the recent claims from the left haven't been total fucking bullshit... redacted, based on hearsay, perjured testimony or downright lies. Let's definitely trust this article from the douche husband and wife propaganda team.

            AreWeSure I think it may be time for a full scale intervention. You've been hitting the Deep State marketing smoke for so long I don't even recognize you anymore. .....Who are you? ....Do you even know?

            Just Kidding! :-D

           <p>
            Yesterday you posted about a guy that died that heard from someone during the election that they'd heard General Flynn had asked about Russian Hacking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today the Deep State is taking on the National Enquirer.
           </p>
           <p>
            O_O
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is the best they got against Trump then the Deep State is officially desperate.
           </p>
           <p>
            And yes there's a Deep State intervention coming sooner rather than later. Deal with it.

            when he was in Congress, and I know Mika, who today said that she knows how to fight back because she grew up in a tough environment ,  is the daughter of elite insider political activist zbigniew Brzezinski, I wonder what else there is that might be connected to pizzagate?

             Upvoat and Yep.  You are so very right.  I stopped watching those two a few years ago.  It became all about their clothes and her 5 inch heels.  Here is a discussion on reddit about what you just brought up.  I have known about it for a few years,  butI had totally forgotten it. There are a few links within the discussion. Thanks for bringing it up.

              "The autopsy of Lori Klausutis makes no reference to a time of death. That raises new questions about an investigation that started when the 28-year-old woman's body was found in the office of then U.S. Representative Joe Scarborough in summer 2001. Accidental death was the official finding in the Klausutis case, with a cardiac arrhythmia causing her to fall and hit her head on a desk. But the recent discovery of human remains at a storage unit in Pensacola, Florida, casts doubt on that ruling. That's because the storage unit was rented by Dr. Michael Berkland, the man who conducted the Klausutis autopsy 11 years earlier.
Berkland now faces a felony charge of improper storage of hazardous waste, and the grisly nature of the discovery calls his competence--and perhaps his sanity--into question."

               I am in complete agreement with your assessment of Joe Scarborough.  I read on here before, that Mika admitted in her own book that she was a victim of MK Ultra.  Now I do not have proof of that, (if anyone does, please submit) so I will admit this is only speculation, but now that her father is gone, could Joe possibly be taking over as her handler?  Wild guess, but almost anything is possible .

                 Sometimes and I think usually the handler is older, but I think in this case she is older.  Once they marry he will really have a hold on her.

             IMHO this would not rise to that level as outlined by the framers (Ford's famous quote notwithstanding).

             "The same year Yale Law School professor Charles L. Black published a highly influential book, Impeachment: A Handbook. Black agreed that
             <strong>
              <strong>
               impeachment is a grave step that should be taken most cautiously. Impeaching a president overturns an election. Black’s research led him to the conclusion that a president should be impeached only for “serious assaults on the integrity of the processes of government,” or for “such crimes as would so stain a president as to make his continuance in office dangerous to public order.”

               Yes, they can run with it.  But remember that no matter what there will be a defense.  And, if I am correct it will be much easier to shoot this down with a rigorous defense.  :)

            Let's see the evidence (texts).  THEN we can call it "fake news" or not.

            Trump's "mentor" was Jewish attorney, mafia goon, and CIA "CHILD SEX RING TRAFFICKING KINGPIN" Roy Cohn.
