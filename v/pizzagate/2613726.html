This behavior continues to this day and is extremely organized. Any story that discusses the allegations of Michael Jackson immediately gets inundated with not only hateful comments but threats of stalking and physical violence. Some of this behavior is orchestrated by a group of obsessed fans while some I believe is bought and paid for by the handlers of the late pop star. One victim has been in hiding for over 20 years, another had his Facebook and personal information hacked just to be intimidated and harassed. Another was tracked down at his high school and later at the church he was going to get married in. One victim was so scared that he spent years worrying he would be tracked down and physically harmed even before he came forward. This fear came from what he was told as a child and the relentless  threats he saw for  any who came forward with allegations. He is now a grown man and suffers from PTSD. Another victim was laughed at in court and one reporter stated a child being fondled over his jeans is hardly traumatizing. That accuser by the way was given a 1.5 million dollar payout but he testified at the criminal trial anyways. Another accusers gets harassed on a daily basis and also receives constant death threats. </p>
<p>The video that will be released at a later date will cover this phenomenon and the support page I run for the victims of Michael Jackson and many other high profile cases has over five years of this behavior documented. Whatever you feel about the guilt or innocence of Michael Jackson in no way justifies this behavior. No man or woman claiming rape should ever be harassed for years on end to just go away. This project will show in great detail how and why victims of child abuse are character assassinated just for coming forward. </p>
<p>What many seem to forget is that these accusers were one of  the first to ever accuse a celebrity of that stature. In many ways they paved the way for people to begin to see how power, wealth, influence and fame can be used to rape children. But even though they paved the way many detractors  still buy the old tired excuses of they are only doing it for attention and money. The child in the 2005 trial to this day is called a money hungry grifter and neither he nor his family has ever taken a penny to tell their story or cash in. To this day that child who is now a married man is asked to sell his story for large sums of money (six figures) he refuses because he knows he will be accused again as a grifter and he wants to show in his own way that he is not that person.
So as soon as this project is complete I will post it but trust me when I say that the individuals who used these vile tactics for years on end do not want this video to be seen is an understatement. I believe the Michael Jackson story is the Rosetta Stone when it come to the topic of Elite Child Exploitation. It shows in a very magnified way how predators not only groom the child but also groom society to dismiss and excuse away disturbing behavior. In conclusion I will leave you this, the simplest definition of Cognitive Dissonance,,,,, The inability to accept that two diametrically opposing behaviors can reside in one person, example Philanthropic Predator.</p>',

           <p>
            Dancer Wade Robson has claimed the revelations of FBI files claiming Michael Jackson silenced child molestation victims proves he previously told the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/04/05/lawyers-say-michael-jackson-paid-millions-in-hush-money-to-victims.html">
             http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/04/05/lawyers-say-michael-jackson-paid-millions-in-hush-money-to-victims.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawyers claim that Jackson forked out nearly $200 million to as many as 20 victims. Safechuck first met the pop star in 1987 when he was 8 years old. He will testify that Jackson repeatedly molested him a year later during a tour and signed off on a check for more than $1 million to Safechuck’s father.
           </p>

            <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/04/06/claim-michael-jackson-paid-at-least-200m-to-silence-20-child-molestation-victims/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Two of Michael Jackson’s alleged victims hope to prove the “King of Pop” was a serial child molester who paid out more than $200 million in hush money to silence at least 20 victims.

            I have often wondered if MJ himself, AND the abuse victims were all part some larger MKUltra-type nefariousness.

            It’s SO dichotomous... the attempt to reconcile the good and the bad in this story. Too many pieces don’t fit and a ton of things just don’t make sense.

             You may be on to something there.  He was def a strange bird.  Extremely taken over by something.  His father sold all those kids off but Michael was completely controlled I believe.  Disney, Sony and Joe AND Katherine were all responsible.  We know who the moguls were.  We know their names.

              I’m very conflicted when it comes to this guy.
             </p>
             <p>
              -I believe the victims.
             </p>
             <p>
              -I have been inspired and moved by Michael’s talent and goodness.
             </p>
             <p>
              -He was a weird dude with serious medical issues and probably also psychological issues.
             </p>
             <p>
              -he was enslaved by the music industry cartels at an early age.
             </p>
             <p>
              -He had a weird creepy kids playland home.
             </p>
             <p>
              -He studied the Bible and donated TONS of time and $$ to children’s hospitals.
             </p>
             <p>
              -There are tons of rumors and credible stories about him  and his family.
             </p>
             <p>
              -He was an incredible performer and musical genius.
             </p>
             <p>
              It’s almost like I’m thinking about 2 different people. That screams MKUltra. Now that I’m thinking about it: I wonder if anyone close to him and his family had CIA/military connections.

               Yeah, Isn't it McGowan (or who)  that did that piece about all the wanna be stars in Laurel Canyon?  I can't take it anymore.  It just makes me so angry when people defend him.  Stupid people can't believe or admit they were duped into Fandom and spending their time and money on a star that could be a pedo.   LET GO ALREADY.

                I hope ALL of the victim’s in Michael Jackson’s case (including MJ) get justice, in whatever form that needs to be. I have to admit it’s too big for me to judge and just give it to God, like so many other things.

                I have similar problems with milk, vaccines and fluoride toothpaste. Too much credible info on both sides saying their ‘good!’ or ‘bad’. I just try to find a middle ground where my choice has the least possible error and hope for the best...

                 I am with you.  I have so much going on in my life that I can't drive my self nuts with worrying about the side effects of certain things.  Yes I try the middle ground on most.  I do stay completely away from vaccines though.  I am totally convinced they are causing and creating havoc and diseases for all of us.

             First of all I covered this topic and many other cases for over five years. Put a great deal of time, money and effort into trying to expose what elite child exploitation is and why it occurs. I don't think individuals  claiming Child Rape getting attacked is frivolous. Your comment however is exactly what I am talking about a Typical "KIA"  (know it all) deciding what is or isn't important.

            Michael was slandered for condemning the money grabbing Jews.  Not even a fan, shill, troll, etc.   It only takes a little research to see this.

             The real shills will use the antisemitic garbage to try to take away credibility. Seen on the tactics, I don't care what race, religion, political following, irrelevant. I care about the victims how they are treated and how to educate the public on the topic of predatory behavior and victim disclosure.

               Yeah there are plenty of amazingly talented musicians that are total freaking pervy predators. Thats the blurred line that people have a hard time distinguishing between. They confuse the talent with a moral compass and good playing/singing with good deeds.
