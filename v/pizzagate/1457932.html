            Numbchuck - first you are deleting a perfectly VALID thread of mine, investigating the possibility of a connection that may not be obvious to those who are not trained investigators. Second you make that rule 2 comment again on my thread. If you don't understand the connection, read it again please and ask if it is still not clear. I think a discussion may lead to statements that are not relevant. Who are you anyway?

            I don't know. I had seen the pictures of the paintings before. And then my first thought when I saw the picture of Tony Podesta with a bunch a dudes wearing red shoes was: Dorothy and her red shoes in Wizard of Oz. 
Then, while looking through her artwork, I found a painting of a woman or girl hanging on cloths hangers, holding a naked baby. The woman is wearing a Mikey Mouse t-shirt. The painting is called "Passion" and kind of reminds me of you know, mother Mary holding Jesus after he died on the cross. But the t-shirt is again reminding me of Dorothy and the whole Disney thing and then I think of MK Ultra and all that. So I try not to think too much about it because it freaks me out.

             Hmm, seen this piece of "art" you r referring to. Disturbing, sick.

            <p>
             Don't know much about OZ. Only that some attribute MKUltra to it. Could be, but probably not in this context. Something to keep in mind tho. If we can eliminate this lead, good. Less clutter then. Till then, let's keep it in mind.
