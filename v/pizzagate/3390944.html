            Yes, by a complicit judge who talled rape allegations against Prince Andrew 'irrelevant and impertinent'. (How dare you accuse His Royal Highness!!)

            "Prince Andrew is 'appalled' by sex abuse claims surrounding his ex-friend Jeffrey Epstein ." Note the Daily Mail refers to Jeffrey as an ex-friend, not a late friend.  Bill Clinton mentioned Epstein's "terrible" crimes and Nancy Pelosi called them "horrific." Prince Andy's defenders are using the Whoopi Goldberg's defense of Polanski, "It wasn't rape rape" and saying the age of consent in England is 16, or that the girls were prostitutes because they accepted $100s and returned multiple times, as if that has anything to do with raping underaged girls. There has to be much more to Epstein's and his friends' evil deeds than just underaged teen girls, for the desperate efforts of his former friends to distance themselves (and likely have him murdered). If the Authorities don't seal all the remaining evidence for 50-100 years (like the Kennedy stuff) we'll learn of orphan trading, organ stealing, torture, ritual sacrifices and cannibalism.
