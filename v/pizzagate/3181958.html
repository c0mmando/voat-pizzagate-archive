<p>TRIGGER WARNING: This article contains graphic language about assault and violence. </p>
<p>A new report from Korean tv station MBC\'s investigative news program Straight, has claimed that several Gangnam nightclubs have operated human trafficking rings that involve the sexual assault of minors and drugged women, as well as torture that has been filmed. </p>
<p>The clubs named in the report including Club Arena and Burning Sun, the two nightclubs with which Seungri is associated as a shareholder and promoter. </p>
<p>In the new report, Straight has claimed that the clubs actively recruited minors, giving them plastic surgery then placing them in the club\'s prostitution ring, where VIPs could choose from them. Some VVIPs would commit their assaults in an offsite location that were set up for particularly violent rape involving torture. </p>
<p>According to the report, the clubs operated an \'incineration team\' whose job it was to chemically clean these locations, namely of drugs and blood. The news team said they have seen footage of these rapes.</p>
<p>It\'s believed that police were bribed with money and sex to turn a blind eye to the operation, and that Gangnam police would often show up to the door of a club when a report was made, but not enter nor speak to anyone other than the club managers.</p>
<p>You can read a detailed summary of the video report, as translated in the thread below.</p>

<li>Two of the hottest clubs in Gangnam were &quot;Arena&quot; and &quot;Burning Sun.&quot; The newest report about these two clubs came out on &quot;Straight&quot;, MBC\'s investigative news program.  (link: <a href="http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/read?newsId=02092646622459072&amp;mediaCodeNo=257">http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/read?newsId=02092646622459072&amp;mediaCodeNo=257</a>) edaily.co.kr/news/read?news… The following is a summary of what aired on that program.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120733269333614593">tweet</a></li>
<li>We previously knew Arena and Burning Sun operated a rape station. The &quot;VIPs&quot; could pick any woman in the club, and the club\'s managers (called &quot;MDs&quot;) would drug the woman and bring her to be raped. Obviously that was horrifying enough, but Straight revealed something worse.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120734332673564673">tweet</a></li>
<li>The clubs actively recruited minors, who were usually runaways. The MDs would tell the young girls they could be celebrities, bankroll their plastic surgery, then put them thru the club\'s prostitution circuit. Some of these girls were not even teenagers.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120736277220024320">tweet</a></li>
<li>The news program showed a pastor who faked his credential to work at a club to look for the runaways. He saw young girls who could leave the prostitution circuit only after severe physical and mental damage. Some had PTSD. One had to surgically remove her damaged womb and ovaries  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120737733029388290">tweet</a></li>
<li>For the &quot;VVIPs&quot;, the club had an offsite location outside of the club. The offsite location was for particularly violent kinds of rape.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120738391900008449">tweet</a></li>
<li>The clubs operated an &quot;incineration team&quot; whose job was to chemically clean the offsite location. Their main job was to clean up the drugs and blood. Women would be tied up and made to bleed. The news team discovered film of these rapes.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120739938058887169">tweet</a></li>
<li>They even had a doctor on hand to cauterize and administer blood transfusion on the woman who was cut. Everyone was drugged up to high heavens.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120740912156565510">tweet</a></li>
<li>Naturally, covering up all this was a massive operation. The main clientele included former president Lee Myung-bak\'s son and scions of chaebols. Bribes in the form of money and sex were given to the local police and tax authorities.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120742198792937472">tweet</a></li>
<li>The Gangnam police had an informal policy of not going into the club if anyone called the police in relation to the club. They would simply show up to the door, listen to the club\'s MDs, and move on.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120742506784800768">tweet</a></li>
<li>The entire Burning Sun stuff became revealed because a good samaritan club-goer saw the MD dragging an unconscious woman somewhere. The club-goer called the police, who showed up on the scene and beat up the guy who called the police.  <a href="https://twitter.com/AskAKorean/status/1120743386758242305">tweet</a></li>

<p>Burning Sun was originally exposed earlier this year because a male patron saw an unconscious woman being dragged somewhere and reported it, but when the police arrived, they assaulted him rather than investigating.</p>
<p>Since the <em>Straight</em> report was aired in Korea, Burning Sun has become the top trending topic on Twitter there, with three hashtags dominating the conversation.</p>
<p>Seungri worked to distance himself from Burning Sun and Club Arena after the first accusations were made, but it has been revealed over the past months that he was an executive director of the club, a shareholder and invested 225 million won originally. Seungri has denied any knowledge of the inner workings of the nightclub.</p>

<p>Here\'s the Google translate of the MBC <em>Straight</em> report:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="md-burning-sun-vvip-incineration-team-exposed-straight">&quot;Burning Sun VVIP Incineration Team Exposed \'Straight\'</h1>
<p>After the MBC \'Straight\' broadcast on the crime scene of \'VVIP\' in the famous club in Gangnam, Seoul, including \'Burning Sun\' and \'Arena\' . </p>
<p>First, the presence of VVIP was known by Kim who claimed to have been beaten in Burning Sun. On November 24, last year, Kim claimed that he was assaulted by the club VVIP and his mother-in-law, while trying to protect the woman who was molested in the club. However, Kim was arrested as a criminal in the police investigation, The corruption was revealed. </p>
<p>Kim, who cheered on the VVIP traced \'Straight\', added &quot;hash tag&quot; snufffilm &quot;and&quot; GHB &quot;on the post-broadcast instagram on the 23rd, saying,&quot; The most shocking thing is the imitation crime, . </p>
<p>A snuff film is a picture of actual violence, murder, and rape. GHB is a drug gamma hydroxybutyric acid, commonly referred to as \'waterpox\'.</p>
<p>Straight\' on the day revealed that Club VVIP had a separate space for the party of the frenzy, and the professional organization was operated to hide the crime scene. </p>
<p>According to reports, the club\'s VVIPs are located in the closest clubs to the top-class rooms. There was also testimony in the secret space that there were narcotics, prostitution, sexual assault, illegal shooting as well as sadistic sexual crimes. </p>
<p>But there is no sign of the crime. After the frenzied party was over, the professional organization that received the instructions from the club side, the so-called officetel \'incineration\' team, was in operation.</p>
<p>Officetel incineration team officials explain to the &quot;straight&quot; by text message (on the club side). It is often referred to as an incinerator, and the needles are often seen in the gas range. Mirafana was also a lot off, &quot;he said,&quot; spraying something like a blood smear and learn these things. It also teaches you how to clean up almost like a crime lab. &quot; </p>
<p>It is said that police will investigate and investigate the facts about VVIP management of some clubs that were organized crime level.</p>

            Regarding the off-site location for especially violent rapes and torture -
           </p>
           <p>
            this NYT article (written in 2004) mentions that children were put in a special 'damage group', were they were not only raped, but severely abused in other ways too (in the Us).
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Andrea told me that she and the other children she was held with were frequently beaten to keep them off-balance and obedient. Sometimes they were videotaped while being forced to have sex with adults or one another.
            </p>
            <p>
             Her cell of sex traffickers offered three age ranges of sex partners--toddler to age 4, 5 to 12 and teens--as well as what she called a “damage group.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “In the damage group, they can hit you or do anything they want to,” she explained. “Though sex always hurts when you are little, so it’s always violent, everything was much more painful once you were placed in the damage group.”

            Remember that we've researched the import of baby parts by satanists to Europe and the US - these were from south Korea iirc.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have a tradition of using - trigger warning - burned fetuses in black magic rituals, called 'golden boys'.
           </p>

            I did a post about a French satanist gallery owner, and someone posted lots of info in the comment section.

             I looked into that briefly while making this post and it was reported years ago but presented as "new", and the original sources all seemed to be pretty much fake news type sites.

                 I was wrong about the original sources being fake news. It was mainstream sources reporting it. The fake news stuff I saw was people on Twitter tweeting old stories as if it just happened, when it was actually from 2012.

            The name of the former president's son is Lee Si Hyung. ---
           </p>
           <p>
            Lee Si Hyung is suspected to have received various business favors from auto party company DAS, allegedly owned by his father former South Korean president Lee Myung Bak.
           </p>
           <p>
            The son of former South Korean president Lee Myung Bak was questioned by prosecutors today over suspected embezzlement and breach of trust in connection with an auto parts company that has long been alleged to be secretly owned by his father.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it has called in Lee Si Hyung for an interrogation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the first time the junior Lee has been brought in for questioning since his father was arrested on March 23 over a string of corruption charges that include bribery, abuse of power and embezzlement. Prosecutors previously questioned Si Hyung in late February, Yonhap reports.
           </p>
           <p>
            The charges against the former president, who ruled from 2008-early 2013, center on DAS, of which Lee Myung Bak is suspected of being the real owner even though, on paper, it belongs to his brother. Prosecutors believe Lee used the firm as a channel to stash away slush funds and commit other irregularities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The younger Lee is accused of receiving various business favors from DAS. Prosecutors said they have obtained evidence that shows DAS' unlawful financial support for two firms run by him.
           </p>
           <p>
            DAS is suspected of extending loans to one of Lee's companies that had recorded a negative net worth. Prosecutors also suspect Lee took out loans at low interest rates from two other firms that had ties to DAS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prosecutors believe the younger Lee was able to raise the funds because DAS is actually controlled by his father. Two officials who arranged the loans for Lee have been arrested.
           </p>
           <p>
            The former president has denied the charges. Lee Si Hyung also denies any wrongdoing.

            </p>
            <p>
             Shortly before his arrest, Lee posted a handwritten statement on Facebook denying the charges. Lee's arrest occurred roughly a year after the arrest of former president Park Geun-Hye, who was arrested on charges stemming from the 2016 South Korean political scandal. Lee was convicted on October 5, 2018 and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
            </p>
            <p>
             Multiple news outlets have remarked upon the apparently close friendship between Lee and U.S. President Barack Obama.

              I edited and corrected my comment. It wasn't the former president, but his son who visited the nightclub (and seems to have participated in rape and torture).

             <p>
              On a side note, remember that the children of three former Mexican presidents have been members of NXIVM - one his even rumoured to be the new NXIVM leader.

               In the submission I just made about the new (unverified) NSA Child Crime Twitter account, he says that WalMart is part of the trafficking route into the US through Mexico. He also linked NXIVM to the Wikileaks emails that started pizzagate.

                I have long suspected Walmart as many others have as well.  Their close ties to Hillary/Clintons have been posted about on here many times. What in the world will it take to flush them out or to make the world aware of what they are behind?  Cheap prices seem to be more important to shoppers than opening their minds to what cos. are tied up in the NXIVM trafficking trade. The Clintons and Bushes are SOOOOOO deeply involved in this. Hyung may also be involved, just like the sons of former Mexico presidents.  We know this is global.

             That was my thought, as well. I replied to the tweet and let them know we'd archived the thread here, in case Twitter nukes it. And I included the urls to each individual tweet, so Derram would archive them individually, as well.

             I was kind of amazed that their media reported on this. Ours would have tried to cover it up.

            a while before trump made things calm down, SKs president was kicked out for being controlled by a cult, and this same cult was doing some fucked-up in the street with bloody tampons, pressure cooker bombs, and some other crazy shit
           </p>
           <p>
            i assume that cult got pushed out by a lot now, and that that same cult might have been an arm of the elites in that region

             Yes, and we have a lot of connecting Voat posts on here. It's a shame that posts like this simply re-publish the article and not link connecting voat posts that are relevant.  As we have been told - we have more information here than we know- so why don't more people make use of it?

             Yes...and there was the incident with the ferry that sank that got the president booted -- Koreans thought it was a deliberate human sacrifice.
