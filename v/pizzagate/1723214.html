<p>A lot of you already know that I think that these protests are a bad idea for multiple reasons. I not only believe that they are potentially dangerous, but I think that they will have a negative affect on the investigation/subject. I believe that the media will Hijack the narrative, much like they have already done, further pushing people that are not &quot;awake&quot; away from anything even resembling PG and child trafficking. I think it will also discredit any claims being made with law enforcement, as who wants to be the person branded as the &quot;conspiracy nut&quot; in his law enforcement precinct?</p>
<p>With that being said, please watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/ED1qpa_IPUc">Youtube Video</a>. He goes on a 10 minute long rant talking about how he was raised to be the antichrist and put a curse on several people, including Johnny Depp. He also claims that the second coming of Christ or some otherworldly event will take place within two weeks, because he can &quot;feel it.&quot;</p>
<p>This man is one of the <a href="http://davidshurter.com/?p=7498">advertised speakers,</a> and a [member of the &quot;steering committee&quot;](https://youtu.be/FmoUwySslaA  at the second march on the 25th. Take a look at his &quot;official&quot; website as well: <a href="http://davidshurter.com">David Shurter</a></p>
<p>Now that you have taken a look, what do you think? I do not know if this man is telling the truth or not. With that being said, ask yourselves, is this the face we want to put on PG? Is this someone we want representing a very serious subject matter? Can you imagine how the media is going to report on this guy? His website is basically nothing more than ranting and raving. He has tons of content on Youtube that will be a goldmine for the MSM. There tons and tons of people saying that this guy is nuts online, even people that used to work with him to get his story out. Be honest, how will this look to the uninformed public? How will this look to everyday average citizens all over the world? I am sure David is a nice person and means no harm, but I do not think this bodes well for us being taken seriously.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I am not advocating these protest can be seen here. I believe the media is going to have a HAYDAY reporting on this guy. He will be an extremely easy mark to brand as the leader of the &quot;Pizzagate Conspiracy Extremists&quot;, or however the media decides to brand us.</p>',

            I think you are right. Something like this needs to be much better planned. It would be nice if we could get people that the majority of us could support and who have recognizable names to attend or speak. I was thinking of people like Mike Flynn Jr. or James Woods, who have already expressed an interest in PizzaGate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know much about this site, but I joined because it seems like a reasonable site about a terrible subject and the members have done a lot of great research. Maybe VOAT could think of having a thread dedicated to forming some sort of group within Voat, where we could express our ideas on how to bring awareness to the problem. It doesn't have to be a march. Perhaps advertisement, etc.

            Preach. Negative mindsets operate under the pretense of fear. Fear that the truth might still be surpressed. Fear that the satanists perverted spirituality somehow has a chance to overpower God. These people have al the resources of false power the material world could possibly provide, but the don't have what matters in life. March if you want. Take precautions of you want. Posts like these are still helpful. If I go I'll be more aware of potential dangers and what to look out for.

           <p>
            But guess what... These guys are scared shitless that a decent sized group might actually form. Gonna have fake pizzagaters rappelling down from CIA helicopters once they go into panic mode lmao

             If you look at the sticky now and sort comments for "new" you will see how many of us have tried to pushback on what I am calling The Sticky of Sorrows. Truly a black cloud over this place.

            How disappointing that VOAT has been taken over by satanic moderators, bent on convincing people that God is NOT in control, that victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse like David Shurter aren't going to be a little impassioned and disturbed (of COURSE they are) and for people NOT to exercise their democratic rights to peaceful speaking out against CORRUPTION.
May the Protest be blessed by God and may it create much fear within the satanic community.
See you all at 11am Lafayette Park, March 25th, Washington DC.

            People will most certainly do what they feel is right.  However, I agree with the sentiments of the post that this forum should stay out of it..we do research here and whatever else individuals want to do is up to them.

            it's only sowing discord and singling out individuals with no basis other than essentially, "they're not perfect/up to someone's ideal standard" is bad form.  this kind of post plays right into the hands of those who would like to divide the people.

            Pretty easily.  They will ignore it.  We might as well do our work here and try to spread awareness for all the marchers to as many media outlets and channels of information as we can to help out the cause.

            This post is not "staged." As you can see, my post is not deterring anyone from attending. People are too arrogant to look at opposing views, or even admit that they might be wrong. It is human nature. Why am I posting this? Because I care about the good decent people that are being led into this dangerous situation when it is not going to help anything or anyone. I also care about the real investigation, and the real children and adults that are being destroyed by pyschopaths. There are almost unlimited reasons why this is a bad idea, and nearly no reasons why this is a good idea. Even if these events go PERFECTLY, it will have literally zero effect on PG. The media will not cover it at all, or if they do, they will twist the narrative. We all know how they portray PG. The alternative media people covering it is playing to the choir, which is basically us, the people that are aware of what is happening. So honestly, it is a  lose/lose situation. I know everyone wants to "do something", but this just is not that something.

             Agree. It's a set up.  British intelligence is working with the Americans and some of the shills on this forum are of that ilk.  I didn't know much about David Shurter before but after seeing this particular post recently I knew that he is cointelpro :

              I believe that the media will Hijack the narrative, much like they have already done, further pushing people that are not "awake" away from anything even resembling PG and child trafficking. I think it will also discredit any claims being made with law enforcement, as who wants to be the person branded as the "conspiracy nut" in his law enforcement precinct?

              I am certain of it, because I know how the media operates, and who they operate for. Don't you know how their tactics are employed? Go Google Pizzagate, and find me ONE article or report (other than Ben Swann), that discusses Pizzagate fairly from the mainstream media. Just bring me back ONE article. If you can do that, then maybe I am wrong and these events will have a chance of being reported fairly.

            at least, even if that's the case, we have entered the year that everything the opposition does ends up backfiring, and if this is at attempt to divide, it'll backfire, too.

            i'm really glad you posted this again, i'm sure we're all having the 'don't screw it up, people' thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            but non-silent protests for pizzagate will always create catch-22 traps.. no matter who is organizing or attending.. if it's not strictly silent it's not strictly safe.. if thousands show up then it's probably going to be news.. if a small group shows up the news will probably portray it as unimportant.. but they
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            happening, both of them, so there's either show up in droves to drown out the efforts of provocateurs.. or not show up at all and let those provocateurs over-run a smaller group of us.. basically just sacrifice a leg or an arm to the shills.. because they're going to do what they're going to do in whatever way works best for them, regardless of how many or few sincere people are there.
           </p>
           <p>
            the march on the 18th, even though it's launching across the street from cpp, seems to be nicely organized with a former child-sex trafficking survivor who has a lot of public speaking experience.  i think it's pretty kick-ass that they got a permit to meet and hang out across from comet ping pong.. let that showing go ahead and be a red flag to everyone in that small town who goes into comet to ask what's up with all the pedo protestors across from your shop... it doesn't matter people march there or not at this point.. if the PTB want a certain false event to happen, it'll happen regardless of where people meet.. if they want a false shooting at cpp, they'll do it no matter what else.
           </p>
           <p>
            not sure what other people are going to have friendly debate (?) about on the 25th tho (debate is always lose-lose) but i hope they can garner some more SRA survivors to speak.. it's not really all that uncommon for SRA survivors to have been programmed with an alter personality who functioned as an antichrist program (not "the" antichrist, but the programmed alter doesn't know that) and i don't see anything wrong with David being a speaker.. or any other survivor as long as they are giving inspirational testimonials with no other agenda..
           </p>
           <p>
            i hope they can get more abuse survivors.. those are the only folks that really should be speaking at these events unless someone who can take direct action shows up.. pizzagate has a voice made up of thousands of decent people of all backgrounds and definitely doesn't need a face other than the millions of missing exploited murdered and worse victimized innocent children.
           </p>
           <p>
            the fact that there is an open window for any investigation at all into pizzagate is in itself miraculous... these people, at the core, control the world, and have done so since one man controlling another was first done... we have to start spreading awareness at some point and that point has manifested itself.. we have to take it for what it's worth and make it work for the cause.
           </p>

             the pedo all-seeing eye scoping out some kids is an accurate depiction of what they do.. a depiction "they" would never use to convey what they do.. i think it makes sense.. people may not know what it means but eventually they'll look at the same eye featured on a dollar bill and start getting the picture..

              This should give people an idea of what we are up against and how in control TPTB have been over the centuries/millennium's and will do everything in their power to corrupt or highjack this movement/idea.

              If people protest Hitler and nazism I dont think its best to poster the nazi symbol everywhere if you are against it as it will just give the symbol more power.

                No I don't think it sounded like an insult.  It was just funny as I read through thinking wtf? about some of it and boom there you are with common sense question we all have - what is Heavy Metal dinner?  made me laugh.

            Consequently, we have removed the event flyer from the sidebar, and no longer endorse the demonstration on the 25th. A longer explanation on this is in the works, this is just a quick heads-up for the community. Thank you for pointing this out,

             David Shurter has had the courage to come forward to expose his abuse.  His testimony should be respected.  No one who has experienced what he has claimed is going to be "the perfect witness."  Far too many times the stories of survivors have been rejected as fantastical or unbelievable.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any exposure of pizzagate helps the red pilling of the public.  Even negative MSM coverage.  It raises awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
             A public conflict is more likely to get coverage than just another demonstration - too easily ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, there are forces that want the whole thing buried like the last times.  We can continue convincing ourselves - but we're already convinced.  It's the general public that has to be led to the truth.  Nothing appears to be happening with the authorities.  There is only so long you can live on hope.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any action is better than nothing and we should be supporting it.  All this shillshit is just another divide and rule move - to get us fighting with each other and amongst ourselves.

              Huh? Why am I being called out?  I am not saying don't do it.  I see reasonable comments on both sides, but I tend to fall on the don't do it.  Personally.  Not daring to advise others.  It may turn out quite well which is why I have not said anything one way or the other until last 24 hours.
I have to say, pretty incredible to be called out by BOTH sides in the same thread.  If a rational centrist is being called out by both sides, I really think something has to be amiss with both sides. (Don't worry, I gave the other side the business, too)

                  My takeaway from it is that he thinks that pizzagate is nothing but a psyop and has nothing to do with the Hampstead case.  In the UK there is a big push from cointelpro to drive the narrative that Hampstead is really only  about a dispute between a vindictive mother and her ex-partner.  There are clear links/avenues to the establishment and the shills try to mask this with many smoke and mirror strategies.  As Shurter is supposed to be a victim of some sort of satanic ring (I don't know much at all about him aprt from that) it really struck me that he was denying or not open to the idea or the evidence of links to establishment  circles.

              Probably main reason was because one of the mods saw that he was against their god emperor Donald Trump;

                 Start coordinating some actions -- we've done the words to death.  So you don't want to sully yourselves with the marches?  What do you want us to do?

                 I have a lot of misgivings about both marches, but David Shurter is not one of them.  I find him credible, wounded, working his way back.  IMO he is very brave and honest.  Maybe regular folk cannot understand him, he brings scary truths, but he is not, to me, disinfo.

                   Hey no need to get all stabby.  I did read his book and view some of his YouTubes.  As I recall he says he was told he was the Antichrist by his father.  This is a common tactic in mind control and Satanic families.  "You are special, you are the antichrist, etc." There may be additional facts.  I did not come at you so stand down.

                    I did not "come at you" either, merely pointing out the absurdity of your statement. I don't think the investigation should have a public face who claims himself to be the antichrist, or is mentally unstable. That's all they need to discredit the whole operation in the mainstream media, and make us all look like loonies. He may be a victim, and you and I may know that, but that doesn't subtract from the power of an MSM report edited carefully to emphasize him and hide the rational voices. He's perfect material for that.

                     "the absurdity of my statement".  Nice.  You just can't stop, can you? Victims are the reality of pizzagate.  It is dirty.  It is messy.  I like the guy for no reason I can figure, and I don't like somebody saying he is not good enough.  That's the bottom line to me.

             many SRA survivors have issues overcoming their hurtful pasts.. like that long, hard road out of hell.. but the ones who speak out, tend to have a command of the truth, and be able to impart the reality of that truth to others in a way that is impactful without causing recoil..

             it's sad so many people have had to live thru these things.. it's an outrage.. i saw that on the 25th they were allowing mic time to folks who want to say a few words.. hopefully most of those will be survivors.. their stories aren't told often enough and they, perhaps more than any of us who haven't lived thru it, understand pizzagate.
