<p>I found it curious that the money trail involved a Solstice fundraiser that COST $167,200, but only raised $12,400. Money laundering?</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/9R59NNj.jpg">https://i.imgtc.com/9R59NNj.jpg</a></p>
<p>Either way, Marina Abramovic was at the fundraiser:</p>

<p>Edible Schoolyards keeps coming up and, at some point, I felt like Maggie Nix was connected. The subreddit ban of TheGreatAwakening was the result of Maggie Nixon posts. I know this for a fact as two of my reddit accounts were banned for just cross posting the link. The claim was doxxing, but the truth is that Maggie, herself, posted publicly in order to raise money for a vacation to Southeast Asia (more money laundering) to deal with her mental health issues. But that may be a bit of a digression.</p>
<p>In March of 2017, James Comey received this email:</p>
<p><a href="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/ca5792b8e6531af76d5dfb36d03c8f1b619b9a3ba70cfc80a72bbff8e6134e0a.jpg">https://media.8ch.net/file_store/ca5792b8e6531af76d5dfb36d03c8f1b619b9a3ba70cfc80a72bbff8e6134e0a.jpg</a></p>
<p>A mystery woman asks Comey for a favor because a school has been connected to Comet Ping Pong because it held fundraisers AT Comet Ping Pong. He then forwards it to Rybicki, who informs Comey Andy Vale and Paul Abbate, Mueller appointees, are on the case. My question is if they were in charge of investigating it, or covering it up? The whole conversation is weird in that Comey was contacted on his personal email and refers to the sender as a &quot;serious woman.&quot; Comey walked the line in his reply to Congress about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don\'t remember. I don\'t remember investigations on those topics. I remember at one point receiving an email from someone, a private citizen, to my personal account, raising issues about the --- is it Ping Pong? Whatever the pizza place was that was involved in some conspiracy theories. I remember sending it to my staff saying, make sure this gets to the appropriate place, but I don\'t know whether there were investigations.</p>

<p>You may also remember Comey was already dinged in the OIG report for ignoring crimes against children:</p>
<p><a href="http://fbnewscycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-17-at-10.54.23-AM.png">http://fbnewscycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-17-at-10.54.23-AM.png</a></p>
<p>Comey is caught in the lie that he doesn\'t really know about any of this, particularly since he was given the names of the agents in charge. He even seems to know Paul on a first name basis. Keep in mind, while there has been a number of FBI employees, the news has left certain ones alone. Peter Kadzik, who warned Podesta about the email investigation, has faced no repercussions. Mentioning Arun Rao of the DoJ gets you banned in a lot of places, still. We are seeing, in real time, how a limited hang out works.</p>
<p>My instinct was that Alice Waters was the sender of the email. Maybe, maybe not. Here is Alice Waters with Marina Abramovic during a spirit cooking sessions:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/tyw8M7D.png">https://i.imgtc.com/tyw8M7D.png</a></p>
<p>Alice Waters is a Spirit Cooker.</p>

<p>So, which schools have had fundraisers at Comet Ping Pong? It turns out Horace Mann Elementary in DC is an Edible Schoolyard school AND has had fundraisers at Comet Ping Pong and Politics and Prose.</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1666636">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1666636</a></p>
<p>Whatever the case, in March, a few people started posting about Edible Schoolyards in earnest on places other than Voat that are a little more sequestered from shills. I would like to know if Horace Mann was mentioned anywhere in the time just before that in Pizzagate circles because, if not, it means Edible Schoolyard was the source of the irritation.</p>',

           Whatever the case, in March, a few people started posting about Edible Schoolyards in earnest on places other than Voat that are a little more sequestered from shills. I would like to know if Horace Mann was mentioned anywhere in the time just before that in Pizzagate circles because, if not, it means Edible Schoolyard was the source of the irritation.

             The legendary chef-owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, a longtime friend, was in town to work with me on a fundraiser for Martha’s Table and DC Central Kitchen, two organizations that feed the less fortunate in Washington, D.C., where I live. It seemed only natural to invite Alice and the other visiting chefs to my home for a Shabbat dinner—a meal I’ve prepared my whole adult life...."

            Who thought up that horrid name?  Double Meaning?  Edible and Schoolyard.  What's in a schoolyard but Children.  Oh yeah well they will say they are growing gardens in them .  To them Children are Edible and Delectable.  Disgusting.  Alice Waters has been linked with JA many times on here.  She is the guru of growing veggie gardens with Children.

             I have been working the last few weeks on gathering information to create a timeline of all times pedophile rings, and the like of being busted, with whisperings of high powered people being involved. I now have over two thousand words, but don't know how to get it on here in one piece. I would like for people to be able to use it, to get people to wake up and actually look at this information before they just discount it. Is there a way to attach a document? Here is a little of it, I skipped my letter part and gave a sample of the meat, so you could see what I was talking about, there is much more.

             Ah yes, I am aware of that story. Different Horace Mann school, the namesake being a famous education reformer, meaning lots of Horace Mann schools.

             What I am seeing is that the source of the irritation was probably not from Voat.

            You don't say?!  That is very interesting, because Voat was shut down in April for three days right after we exposed Maggie Nixon here, as well, and Q affirmed the shut down was pizzagate-related.

            I should also mention that...u/maurice found two schools. Horace Mann and Grace Episcopal Day School. I would imagine there are a couple more possibilities out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I started with this post, that talks about the Monarch Academy sharing the same building as the Capital Gazette shooting a couple of months after the email, suggesting that a cover up may have happened at the school under the guise of the shooting. It's a stretch, maybe, but there are definitely some curiosities, there.
