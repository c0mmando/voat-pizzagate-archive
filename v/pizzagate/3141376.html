<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden kicked off his appearance at a union event with a crack about the criticism of his touchy tendencies.</p>
<p>He came on stage and hugged IBEW President Lonnie Stephenson, BuzzFeed reports. “I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie,” he said.</p>
<p>This is Biden’s first public event since several women said he has touched them in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cameron Joseph (<a href="https://voat.co/u/cam_joseph">@cam_joseph</a>)</p>
<p><strong>@JoeBiden now inviting kids up onstage from the crowd. &quot;All those kids, you want to come up on the stage, you can come up, it’s okay.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting his arm around a young boy in footage aired on CNN, Biden also said, “By the way, he gave me permission to touch him.”</p>
<p>Joe Biden faced questions about complaints from women who say he touched them in a way that made them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I didn’t understand more,” he told reporters when asked about requests that he apologize, according to footage aired on CNN. “I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I’ve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman.”</p>
<p>Biden answered questions after appearing at a union event where he joked about the allegations, hugging the union president and noting that he had permission to hug him. The comment has already been criticized as tone deaf but Biden said he was sincere.</p>
<p>“I literally think it is incumbent upon me and I think everybody else to make sure that if you embrace someone, if you touch someone, it’s with their consent - regardless of your intentions, if you’re trying to bring solace, if you’re trying trying to welcome them,” Biden said.</p>
<p>He said he wasn’t surprised to see Donald Trump post a video mocking him about the allegations. “It doesn’t surprise me. He doesn’t have time to do his job. But look, everybody knows how Donald Trump is,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden said the criticism from some women will change the way he interacts with people on the campaign trail. “I think it’s going to have to change,” he said.</p>

            American and World Patriots will not be sorry when his sentence is carried out, either. Really hoping for a pay-per-view of his demise to help fund surviving victims' recovery. The rest of the funding can come from his family's ill gotten money from the suffering of others.

            a former Penn State football assistant coach charged with sexually abusing eight boys in a scandal that has rocked the university, said that there was no abuse and that any activities in a campus shower with a boy were just horseplay, not molestation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am innocent of those charges," the 67-year-old Sandusky said. "... I could say that I have done some of those things. I have horsed around with kids. I have showered after workouts. I have hugged them, and I have touched their legs without intent of sexual contact."

            Even the British
            <em>
             The Guardian
            </em>
            doesn't think that Joe Biden would be a good choice:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This week, at least five women have come forward to accuse Joe Biden of inappropriately touching them in public spaces. (The first was Lucy Flores in a heartfelt article in New York magazine.)
            </p>
            <p>
             In response, Biden put out a two-minute video that didn’t include an apology. Instead, his team put out a “bat signal” to Democratic elites and allies to come forward and defend him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Biden has a lot to apologize for beyond the way he’s treated women. He’s been wrong about almost every major issue over the past 40 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Iraq war – which Biden loudly supported as chairman of the foreign relations committee – cost over $4tn dollars
            </p>
            <p>
             [H]e represents the worst of the last 40 years of the Democratic party.

            How does Biden explain away his saying to a child that he is 'horny standing next to a 13-year-old'?  That is grooming and child abuse pure and simple.

            This creep thinks joking that he has permission before he touches anyone will make the accusers look ridiculous.  And judging from the kid's reaction, I don't think he did ask permission.
           </p>

            He's making it all a joke so he can continue feeding his addiction in public.

            Kids are not in a position to give permission to be touched by anyone, especially an adult and particularly an adult male stranger.  Not many kids are strong-willed enough to stand up to the intense social pressure Biden employs to paralyze his prey.

             They kind of did the same thing with Cyril Smith (UK Lib MP..pedophile, assoc. to Elm House mostly).

Under the bill, victims would be presumed injured, sparing them and their families the burden of proving specific damages in court. The bill also extends the statute of limitations to file a lawsuit from two to three years and permits the court to award attorney’s fees and costs to the victim."

             Don't be sad my brown little friend and wipe those tears away from your eyes. Never loose faith. Stranger things have happened then that Creppy Joe Biden visits your truly shithole country and you will finally get that hug you've always longed for... A long and awkward hug. I wish you Godspeed my brown little friend!
