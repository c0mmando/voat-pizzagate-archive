<p>****A former House Democrat tech staffer who fled the country to Pakistan while under criminal investigation has struck a deal with federal officials to return to the U.S. and appear at an arraignment, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Hina Alvi is the wife of Imran Awan, and both face charges of conspiracy and bank fraud. Both worked for Democrats for several years, and Awan worked directly for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., when she was chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
<p>A document filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia indicates that federal prosecutors have struck a deal with Alvi that would allow her to return to the U.S., but would also require her to surrender her passport and afterwards not book any international travel. The deal only surrounds how Alvi will turn herself in, and is structured so that she can avoid being arrested in front of her children when she returns to the U.S., &quot;during the last week of September 2017.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alvi, and Awan in particular, are the focus of investigations by the FBI and Capitol Police regarding irregularities for purchases of some computers and other equipment which was later discovered to be missing. The pair, and their associates, could have had access to sensitive government information over the years.</p>
<p>In July, the Daily Caller reported that the FBI seized smashed hard drives from Awan\'s home.</p>
<p>Despite the computer-related interests, Awan and Alvi are facing charges in which federal officials claim that they used false information to obtain home equity lines of credit, and intended to send the money overseas.&quot;</p>',

            Like I said a while ago.  They will get her to talk.  She doesn't want to go to jail.  And she sure doesn't want to get bumped off by the ISI. First to snitch lives.

             It looks like the prosecution requested to quash it... perhaps this was to re-insert the modified warrant because she apparently made special requests to not be arrested in front of her children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's an idea: Maybe DON'T have kids if you're planning to funnel money via illegal businesses and operate a spy ring out of the US Congress?

              I read that is the case. She probably already cut a deal. Maybe she will sing like Canary bc of the kiddos.

               They'll likely keep the questions focused only on the money/bank fraud, hit em' with a fine, call it a day. No matter how much evidence piles on before October.
