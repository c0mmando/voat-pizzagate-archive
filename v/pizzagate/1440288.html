You can look up a word/phrases that are correlated. You can also use time series data if you want.
Here is a quick faq on it: <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/correlate/faq">https://www.google.com/trends/correlate/faq</a>
It may or may not provide useful info because correlation does not equal causation.
Here\'s an example of how it can be used for time series. I went to <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ncic">https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ncic</a> and clicked on the missing persons for 2007 - 2015 (at the bottom of page). It has a monthly list with different categories. I used excel and put the different categories in the YYYY-MM-DD,Value .CSV format for each category. 
Here\'s a link to what it looks like <a href="http://sli.mg/a/ghujJK">http://sli.mg/a/ghujJK</a>
Again, correlation does not mean causation. The info may be useful, it might not be. There appears to be seasonality to missing people, so other seasonal things may be correlated but not related.
Test1 was for missing persons under 21 that doesn\'t meet other category criteria. Top 3 correlations was 1. wetland plants 2. permission slips 3. plant info. As you can see, wetland plants and plant info may not be related, but permission slips/field trips could be a likely related for when parents/teachers can\'t find a kid during field trips and file a report. 
Test2 was for missing persons, any age, who may be in danger. Most correlated thing there is &quot;ds-156&quot;. If you look that up it\'s for aliens seeking nonimmigrant visas. &quot;The application for an alien under 16 years of age or one physically incapable of completing an application may be completed and executed by the alien\'s parent or guardian, or if the alien has no parent or guardian, by any person having legal custody of, or a legitimate interest in, the alien.&quot; <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/22CFR/HTML/22CFR/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-500/0-0-0-1688.html">https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/22CFR/HTML/22CFR/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-500/0-0-0-1688.html</a>
This seems like it could be related. It seems the correlation peters off. Possibly a change to visa/immigration rules?
Test3 is for missing persons, any age, where it\'s likely kidnapping/abduction. Highest correlation is &quot;city tours&quot;. Not sure if related or if it\'s a seasonal thing.
Test4 is for missing persons, any age, who are physically/mentally disabled/senile. Highest correlation is 1. concrete expansion 2. window locks 3. cedar siding. This seems completely seasonal and unrelated. Disabled kidnappings seem pretty consistent overall.
Test 5 is for people over 21 that don\'t fit other categories and there is a concern for safety (I didn\'t do missing person\'s due to catastrophy because there\'s not a lot to go off of). Test 5 is highly correlated to &quot;Ana IFA.&quot; If you look that up, it seems to be online lab tests for blood. That could be related in some way.
Test 6 is combined total. It correlates to 1.wetland plants 2. itea 3. pungeons. It all seems plant related, so I\'m guessing it\'s coincidental/seasonal.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I hope you get the jist of it. Oh, you can also do things like shift the date up or down, in case you believe the relation is delayed or something. Example of test 6: <a href="http://sli.mg/phRqph">http://sli.mg/phRqph</a></p>
<p>So if you get data and want to try correlating it to searches, it\'s a pretty useful tool.</p>',
