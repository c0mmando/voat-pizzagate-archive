Pizzagate arose out of the idea of satanic child abuse and killing being rife and which was uncovered at a governmental level in South Korea where these pills were found. The Q posts have made us aware that North Korea is deserted and probably run by the CIA or a cabal of elites. Presumably the source of the Korean pills is therefore North Korea, and perhaps they have run out of children to mash up into pills. The fact that there is a market for \'youth elixirs\' such as the \'youth blood transfusion\' that was discussed previously highlights that the pizzagate idea is not fantasy. The cabal (Clinton-Obama-Bush-Merkels and associated government operatives) presumably need a continuous stream of children and making wars happen provides it. Clinton had Gaddafi killed and thereby prompted the mass migration to Europe which included 10,000 missing children.

            Why is there a disinformation flair here? It seems reasonable to me, and I actually hadn’t considered that North Korea could be a ghost town. First time I ever heard that was here. That has provoked a whole new angle of thought, that I wouldn’t have been able to consider if this had been removed. Thanks op. I wonder if there is any connection to what you have said here and the ousting of the president of South Korea awhile back...

            In another article, victuruslibertas connects this even with the SK President to arrests of Samsung executives with Illuminati involvements tri-lateral commission, etc. It seems like another rabbit hole. There could definitely be a rat line of pharmaceuticals and organ harvesting behind the scenes between China and the Koreas. Shadow governments and corporations don’t follow the flags and news points that normal citizens do. The chaos between the nations makes ripe conditions for dirty CIA-type business.

            This is why Planned Parenthood sells all their dead babies for pharmaceutical profits they make a fortune selling baby parts it's a huge business but if you expose them with undercover cameras videos then you will be arrested and prosecuted and sent to prison for "violating their privacy" that's what happened recently the reporters who exposed this baby parts selling business are now in prison for doing it. It's also why abortion will remain legal there is big money to be made from it.

            , why are you using Google maps as 'proof' NK is 'deserted'? Only a few places are even available by Streetview, which you'd expect, and several of those show people.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've strung a bunch of stuff together, along with this misrepresented Google link, and lumped it under a completely ambiguous headline. You are relying completely on innuendo and people's imaginations to fill in the blanks. I'm giving this a "Potential Disinfo" flair.

             ? This is nothing to do with street view. Have you actually looked around Pyongyang on Google Bing or Here all of which show the same but at different timepoints? Are you saying that the google map views of the Pegasus museum and such that got us going in the early days are also disinfo? How is this google map link misrepresented? What's the real problem here?

              That's what I'm asking you, MT. I followed the Google link you included in your post. I clicked several others on the map -- several showed people, the rest had no street view info to show whether it was "deserted" or not. The majority is unmapped. If you click in a lot of places in the world, or even very rural places or military bases in the US, you will see the same thing.

            Yes. It's about connections and the reality that people in the highest offices around the world are running it. People like podesta are just puppets. They have handlers and enablers. I wrote a book about them. How the Cabal is behind every major crime, all connections, names, patterns and tactics. "THE RING" is a total exposure. Go on ellacruz dot org and click on "THE RING". download it on Amazon, its free. Spread the word.

            Take this post to the top !!  Many pieces fall into place with this excellent submission. NK has never made sense and I grew suspicious when Bush tacked them onto the 'Axis of Evil'.  Three consecutive Presidents placated to NK and seemingly allowed them to build nukes and ICBM's. We were supposed to believe the peasants were eating dirt while these programs flourished with no assistance and no real economy. Look at that Google map shot. THE STREETS ARE DESERTED, but the buildings all look brand new!  Bullshit.  That looks like the Magic Kingdom on Christmas morning.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we're really close on finding out the truth about NK ( notice the early shilling on this submission ) and when we do, it will be the Ultimate Red Pill.

             It's very enlightening to wander around NK on google maps, while you still can. The other interesting thing to do is to repeat the process on Bing maps and Here maps. What you see is that huge structures have been 'created' (such as the water park in my link). Now, anybody who has ever seen any structure being built will know that in order to build a huge structure you need - people and trucks. They are not there, and there are not enough people to supply the proportion of builders required to build these huge structures if there are only ten people on the streets of a capital city. So wtf is going on?

           </p>
           <p>
            I found George Puello (Laura Silsby's lawyer's Twitter), and he has testified that Clinton is running the trafficking in Haiti months back and it seems to be his official account. PLEASE SHARE i will send this message to a couple more users, I am hoping that one of oyu can make a thread!!!

                You don't know shit about him clearly.  You have 73 submissions to politics and 7 opro Pizzagate.  You don't know shit about ANYTHING.

                He went around Latin America pretending to be Jewish to try to set up schools and things like that.  There's something else going on.

                "Everybody here" has the same opinion -- everybody out of here agrees Pizzagate is a hoax.

                  Quit dropping terms like a FAGGOT especially when you're bass-ackwards: it's you dildos who are limiting things.  Admit that you like the idea of a UN-of-occultists rather than Jews.  You don't WANT this to end because you'd have to face the fact that you don't have the balls to expel a group.  Because you're a little girl like half the posters literally are here.

                    You worthless spectators are the only reason shills can even get here.  If joining required a post mentioning Hillary to prove one's research chops it wouldn't happen.  But that would mean you couldn't come anywhere near it, so I doubt you'd support such a thing.

                      Look in the mirror and know you are looking at a worthless person who won't save anyone.  I've given dozens of concrete locations over the months -- care to check one out?  No?  Thought not, FAGGOT.

            In my opinion the most important piece of information is anyhow the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-15335899">
             http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-15335899
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And the EU keeps investigating...
           </p>
           <p>
            A very good exercise to think this through.
1. Who are involved in "supply chain" and coverup?
2. How can this be kept secret for decades?
3. Who are the "customers"?
4. How was trafficking organized?
5. Is this possible w/o a secret society having strict rules and penalties for breaking them?
6. How high and wide this society has to reach?
7. Why is it so difficult to find victims alive anywhere?
8. What are the odds for them being alive?
9. Can the case of this scale be spanish only or is the customer base international?
           </p>
           <p>
            And so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            300000, just think about it. In one western country only. And as this probably gradually ended after Franco, what happened next?
           </p>
           <p>
            This really is "too much to handle" but can we proceed w/o clearing this thoroughly?
