            'I believe Emanuela ended up a victim of this circle," Father Amorth, the honorary president of the International Association of Exorcists, told La Stampa newspaper. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'The debate over who kidnapped Emanuela and what became of her has raged in Italy for three decades. ', "Parties were organised, with a Vatican gendarme acting as the 'recruiter' of the girls.", "They found his remains inside the tomb in the Sant' Apollinare basilica in Rome and also, intriguingly, other bones in a crypt nearby.", "Father Gabriele Amorth, who was appointed by the late John Paul II as the Vatican's chief exorcist and claims to have performed thousands of exorcisms, said Emanuela Orlandi was later murdered and her body disposed of."
