<p>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 09, 2020</p>
<p>Four For Friday - Another One</p>
<p>In the past I have spoken about some very disturbing issues as it relates to the acts of this A list mostly movie actor. His actions have caused him to have to sell his soul even more and sell off assets to make sure his reputation doesn\'t take a hit and affect his income. One of the people who digs into his past the most is a person he used to have a relationship with. She almost went down because of his actions, so she is a crusader in bringing him to justice. </p>
<p>The latest thing she learned he was involved in also happened in a country outside the US. Most, if not all happen outside the US where he can throw out his money and fame and get away with things. Prior to them being a couple he was caught up in one of the biggest scandals in the history of the country when it comes to the abuse of kids, tweens and teens. It also involved filming them engaged in sex acts with each other and adults. In the very first police report, the name of the actor pops up. It also showed up in some investigation notes, three days into the case. The name never shows up again. It went poof. When the ex asked some questions, she was told the right people were arrested and convicted and that the actor\'s name being mentioned twice was the figment of the imagination of the accused. Yeah, they just randomly decided to use that name twice.</p>

<p>Some people in the comment section guessed actor Robert De Niro. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>About De Niro  <a href="https://archive.is/AwAgG:">https://archive.is/AwAgG:</a> Make believe Tough Guy Robert De Niro has been involved in a number of scandals and trysts involving under age girls/ sex slaves and prostitutes over the years. As a child, he was the son of a Gay father [1], which could help explain some of his sexual problems later in life. The first wiff of something rotten comes from an independent journalist named John Lichfield who discovered that an International prostitution agency routinely sent little girls to service the Hollywood elite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-sex-scandal-that-wouldnt-lie-down-1185127.html">see also article \'The Sex Scandal that wouldn\'t lie down</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Girls later freed from servitude stated that they were coerced, tricked and at times physically forced to work as sex slaves and prostitutes. Among the list of the agency clients was none other than pretty boy ... uh I mean \'tough guy\' Robert De Niro. It was never established beyond a shadow of a doubt that De Niro was involved with any of the kids turned prostitutes, it was however proven that he was a client of the agency that provided child sex labor, he admitted using their services. Well Goll---lee, when you buy food from a hot dog peddler it is assumed you are buying wieners, and when you buy sex from a juvenile sex service - whatcha think you\'re getting ... not a wiener , unless of course you\'re gay. No Rocket Science here, Colombo would\'ve had the case closed in half an episode. Unfortunately Colombo, like De Niros\' onscreen persona, are purely fictional characters. The real Robert DeNiro is a sniveling pervert who cowers without his bodyguards. De Niro was interrogated by French police but was never actually charged or convicted.</p>
<p>Lichfield uncovered court documents that mentioned high-profile clients of the prostitution service that supposedly included ruling class elite and stars in sports and entertainment on both sides of the Atlantic as well as wealthy Arab oil barons and French officials...</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p>Trivia: I learned that De Niro has 3 passports and one is marked \'special envoy\' to Antigua.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>De Niro’s third passport is from the Caribbean island nation of Antigua. Even more specifically, De Niro holds a Diplomatic Passport from Antigua with the title of ‘Special Envoy’. <a href="https://www.sovereignman.com/international-diversification-strategies/how-robert-de-niro-ended-up-with-three-passports-26712/">https://www.sovereignman.com/international-diversification-strategies/how-robert-de-niro-ended-up-with-three-passports-26712/</a></p>
<p>And because of his diplomatic credentials, De Niro is entitled to a great deal of special privileges and amenities that even movie stars don’t normally receive.</p>
<p>Based on the 1969 United Nations Convention of Special Missions, special envoys like Robert De Niro are eligible to receive tons of travel benefits.</p>
<p>Diplomats always skip the line at airports. And under Article 26 of the convention agreement, it’s illegal for foreign customs officials to search a special envoy’s bags.</p>
<p>Then there’s diplomatic immunity; a special envoy “immunity from the criminal jurisdiction” of the foreign country where he is carrying out his duties. And his residence/office are protected as if they were the soil of a sovereign nation....</p>

<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/AwAgG#selection-153.0-84.2">More</a> (About Robert De Niro) ...De Niro is a longtime friend of convicted pedophile rapist Roman Polanski as well as womanizer Harvey Weinstein. Court records clearly show that Polanski went to see De Niro after raping the child, possibly to gloat about his latest conquest. In 1977, Polanski was charged with five counts of unlawful sexual intercourse, he fled to France where he couldn\'t be extradited and it is believed that he may have hooked his butt-buddy Robert Deniro up with the kiddy sex ring.</p>
<p>DeNiro seems to have a number of perverted friends, while it\'s true that perverts are a dime a dozen in tinseltown, Bobby D seems to have procured more than a dimes worth. In addition to Weinstein, Polanski, and Clinton[s], another buddy of DeNiro\'s was a Pennsylvania man who asked DeNiro to be an alibi witness. Bruce Wishnefsky, was charged with 133 counts of sexual assault against underage girls, he is currently serving out his sentence in Pennsylvania. Attorneys for Wishnefsky contended the girls in question could not have been raped by his client in Pennsylvania because they were with De Niro at the time he filmed a &quot;Bronx Tale&quot;. Egan Kafka who worked on the set as an extra was also called as a witness, Kafka was also the subject of an investigation by police regarding child rape. Brian J. O\'Neill who taught De Niro to drive a bus for his role as his own father in a Bronx tale [as a bus driver] was found guilty of more than 230 counts of molesting 7 different children.</p>
<p>De Niro and the other actors were in the company of the victims during the 1992 filming of &quot;Bronx Tale&quot; according to Kurtz, Wishnefsky\'s lawyer.</p>
<p>Liz Crokin, is a women who some consider a rabid conspiracy theorist and others consider a muffled voice of &quot;One crying in the wilderness&quot;. Crokin has dedicated her career to exposing leading government, entertainment and business leaders involved in satanic pedophilia cults, she stated the following “I would say Robert DeNiro needs to be looked at very closely,” Crokin said. “I would say Alec Baldwin needs to be looked at very closely, I would say Stephen Colbert needs to be looked at very closely, I would say Michael Moore needs to be looked at very closely. You’ll find that these elite pedophiles, they’re very close friends and they all hang out and they’re all marked members of the same club and they’re all doing the same stuff.”</p>

            No kidding. We saw this coming. The hatred spewed by Di Niro these other actors was way beyond a normal response to anyone. This topic obviously hit a nerve in these guys. Someday, I hope they confess to the damage they have done to innocent children.

             Can’t stand him. Interesting thing to note is that those in the know say Amal was born A-Male and Georgie boy loves trannies. Elizabeta looks masculine look at her jaw line back then. The worrying part is the 13 year old and wouldn’t that be considered cp by publishing those pics. France is so fucked up.

             Perhaps it isn't De Niro but I think there's a stronger case for it being him than C100ney.  My reasoning is based on this statement in the blind:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In the past I have spoken about some very disturbing issues as it relates to the acts of this A list mostly movie actor. His actions have caused him to have to sell his soul even more and sell off assets to make sure his reputation doesn't take a hit and affect his income.

              Hiya K9! CDAN always uses ‘Permanent A List Movie Actor’ for RDN.
             </p>
             <p>
              C!00ns more to lose if his “reputation takes a hit.” C!00ns threw Eliz C@n@lis under bus in Buunga Buunga Scandal where she “almost went down.”

              </a>
              Mainstream Media heavily downplayed C!00ns actions/involvement.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don’t think anyone RDN has been in a relationship with has ‘almost gone down.’ He pays his exes and kids $$$ to keep their mouths shut and that’s all they care about. Sure he’s a shitfuck ped0 who scammed on J Foster and her underage buddies during taxi filming days. But I don’t think this blind is about him. Could be wrong.

             Affected island nations and territories included in the relief initiative include Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica. Barbuda suffered an estimated 95 percent structural damage in the wake of Hurricane Irma.

             ....Antigua and Barbuda high court of justice granted an interim injunction to prevent building work on the airport from continuing during a legal challenge against the territory’s government over the international airport development....The injunction was granted after the case was lodged outlining concerns about environmental damage that Mussington and Frank believe the project will cause. Internal documents used by their legal team revealed that the authorities had been warned about ecological as well as archaeological risks....The islanders complain that the work to bulldoze forests in preparation for the construction work got under way when residents were evacuated from the island during Hurricane Irma....There are formidable interests hoping to do business on the island if the challenge fails.

            Probably not DeNiro.  Look at the CDAN link with old refs to him, he is always referred to as Permanent A List and some times his Oscar is mentioned. Enty didn’t do that for this new post. Probably some other Hollywood asshole.

            He's doing a lot of cheap ass humiliating TV ads here in the UK. Looks like the devil has come back for his part of the deal - as he always does.
