<p>and an excerpt from Breitbart\'s other book; <strong>Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World</strong>
On the Anthony Weiner Scandal</p>
<p>&quot;The conference call was the first of many dramatic and emotionally excruciating moments that would occur over the next three to four weeks. The first order of business was to determine whether or not the tweet emanated from Congressman Weiner’s verified Twitter account. The Twitter feed seemed to be genuine–and it contained another clue: a shout-out to Seattle earlier that evening, where the apparent intended recipient of his photograph lived. Our second concern was whether or not the image, which was connected to a yfrog account (a photo hosting service), belonged to Weiner. But while the confirmation process was taking place, at about 8 p.m. Pacific time, we watched, in real time and in great awe, as the yfrog account’s photos–mostly innocuous snapshots of the congressman–were taken down. Simultaneously, the intended Twitter recipient of the image–the bulging member of Congress in grey boxer briefs–deleted not just her Twitter account but also her Facebook account.</p>
<p>“We’re watching the cover-up!” I exclaimed to the crew.</p>
<p>My father-in-law, Orson Bean, now a committed Christian, likes to reinforce his belief system with a smile on his face, stating, “There are no coincidences.” In the Friday night flurry to find out as much as we could about Weiner, the recipient of the tweet, archives of images, and records of other online communications, I had forgotten a most blatant missing puzzle piece. Nine days beforehand, we had received an e-mail tip from a gentleman in Texas who claimed to have compromising photographs and communications between a single mother in Texas and Congressman Weiner. We had followed up via Pollak, who was skeptical but did not dismiss the tip entirely. We were not particularly interested in Weiner’s private life, nor did we have any reason to believe the pictures would be real. In any event, the source spoke to Pollak once but never followed up with him. In truth, we probably would have forgotten about it had PatriotUSA76 not re-tweeted Weiner’s original tweet that Friday night......&quot;</p>

            we all forgot about anne heche she lost her dam mind after being married to ellen now that we know ellen is shilling for the deep state on her show which i hate by the way its an horrendous talk show that does nothing more than shill for hollywood celebrities and crooked politicians which puts her in the same category as the horrendous shill and associate of john podestas stephen colbert. annes breakdown after being with ellen makes me wonder if she wasnt exposed to mk ultra monarch programming while she was in the relationship why else would she have ended up wandering around lost and confused in somebodys backyard ?

            Trump also recently made a comment to the effect of "I hope we don't have to have a big event, a big thing, to have change." Just saw it today I think, and I'm looking for the article. That may not be a direct quote but its close.

            All the major revolutions, like the French and Russian "revolutions" were Arab Spring type events in which the countries were infiltrated and subverted from within. This includes the American Civil War. After the Freemasons incited the peasants to kill the Monarchs the killing kept going and many peasants were slaughtered. The actors behind the slaughter ended up in control.

            I have been pondering this article I will post here for hours since I found it today. Every since Q entered "The Storm" there has been rumors of Martial Law, revolutionary type happenings, Soros being abducted and taken to Camp David, people hoping perps are snatched and taken to Gitmo, etc....

            I have been continually voicing my concerns that these things are against our Constitution. Our Constitution has been being subverted since our country declared bankruptcy in about 1933 and has been operating under some sort of "emergency funding status."

            The perps behind the scenes would like to create a crisis that would enable them to change our Constitution in a way that would essentially destroy it. Lately the vibes out of D.C. have been making mentions that reference the Constitution. And now today this inflammatory rhetoric.

            I swear it won't surprise me if the theater we are watching from these Jesuit/Zionist/Marxist/Nazi assholes is all a front to make some changes to our Constitution that will appear to be in our best interest but of course will further screw us to the floor.

            They are also throwing around the word "treason." Are they getting ready to rewrite the Constitution or the legal definition of the word treason so that more of us in the future can more easily meet the criteria of having committed treason?
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I DO NOT like the sound of this because I trust none of the actors in D.C. Some of the bastards need to hang for treason, sure enough, but will they pick some of their co-criminals out of the crowd and charge them with treason?

              Top Democrats warn Trump: Don't fire Rod Rosenstein
             </strong>

             Top congressional Democrats told President Trump on Friday that using the new House Intelligence Committee memo as a pretext to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and therefore halt the Russia investigation
             <strong>
              would spark a “constitutional crisis.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California said in a letter they are “alarmed” at reports that Trump may use the memo “as a pretext” to fire Rosenstein “in an effort to corruptly influence or impede” special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             “We write to inform you that we would consider such an unwarranted act as an attempt to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. Firing Rod Rosenstein, DOJ Leadership or Bob Mueller
             <strong>
              could result in a constitutional crisis of a kind not seen since the Saturday Night Massacre,
             </strong>
             " they said.

              Where is this from? Yeah, I came across him being a supporter of Israel as well. I'd say its very well possible, that this whole new cycle of absurdity, was engineered to catapult us into some sort of next phase, by humiliating the Left, which before this decade was generally in the anti-official narrative bracket with a focus on Revolution and started alot of the Truth movements, they have now set up a pervasive zeitgeist of Nationalism. Now the contention people are holding is If you are not wholeheartedly PRO-America you seem idiotic. Its completely undermined the idea of rebellion against our corrupt masters.

               One of the first pizza joints on the trail of pizzagate was ESP pizza.  Which of course stands for Extra Sensory Perception.

               Aldous Huxley said we must break out of the culture which seeks to imprison us in a world of nationalism.  This is relative to the true nature of reality, we tend to as humans, associate ourselves with a physical space but when in reality, as Robert Anton Wilson said, the map is not the territory.
              </p>
              <p>
               Robert Anton Wilsdon also wrote of Chapel Perilous, which shares it's name with the film by James Alefantis.  He was convinced he was in communication with alien beings from Sirius.
              </p>
              <p>
               Have you noticed how much Stephen Paddock's jail robber father looks like Robert Anton Wilson?
              </p>
              <p>
               Have you noticed the Venetian masks in Besta Pizza as well as in The Las Vegas Court Room?  Representing the black nobility?
              </p>
              <p>
               James Alefantis' character is called Eve.  Originally the description of the film ended with reference to Secret Pizza, which later became secret soda.  There happens to be a grail looking cup on the wall of Besta with Soda written above it.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's also above the advertisement for a reading group.  Is this the reading group which Clinton secretly sent pizza's to after the alleged shooting within Comet?
              </p>
              <p>
               Is it the same Secret Reading Group mentioned in the wikileaks email by Tamara Luzzatto?  Who was photographed with Mr Potato Head, like Clinton, McCain, Obama and others?  Is that why there was a photo of Mr Potato Head broken, on a Comet Ping Pong related instagram account?
              </p>
              <p>
               Is that the reason when Trump roasted Clinton on "It takes a village" and Haiti...  Eric Paddock would later indicate, it did not take a village for Steve?  Why would he be making a direct reference to this?
              </p>
              <p>
               Then, is it why when Clinton speaks about Russia and their allies "whoever they turn out to be" is making a reference to MIT, which is where Podesta really transferred his shares for Unlimited Joules?
              </p>
              <p>
               MIT who also happen to use Cloudflare like Voat?
              </p>
              <p>
               Is that why on the Voat news real it states "Two Men One Site", has reference to the atomic bomb and the moon landings?  Both of which are fake.
