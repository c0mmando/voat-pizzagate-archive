<p>Fellow goats, it\'s time to do a careful review of everything posted by HighLevelInsider over the past 15 months. He\'s a well-read, university-educated dude with significant skills, definitely smarter than Alefantis. Lucky for us that\'s not saying much. This guy is just as arrogant as Jimmy Comet, if not more so. That means that given enough time he makes very similar mistakes.</p>
<p>Do you remember <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2038598">when Alefantis made a Freudian slip a few months ago</a>? He was trying to pose as a sympathetic supporter, but wrote &quot;my shop&quot; instead of &quot;his shop&quot;. We all had a good laugh at his expense.</p>
<p>This time the slip was a bit more subtle, but basically the same thing. HLI used a sockpuppet and was sloppy about it. I\'ll explain, but first I need to set the context.</p>
<p>HLI originally appeared on July 10, 2016, in a thread on /pol/. This was literally days after the Podesta emails dropped. That week, he did many hours of AMAs claiming that he belonged to a secret society, \'Three,\' that has existed for thousands of years. He made some really amazing claims, all of which you can access <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/?st=j92t19t4&amp;sh=1b350939">here</a>. Among other things, he said that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Obama\'s whole family was CIA, he was groomed to be President from childhood, his election in 2008 was planned &quot;for years,&quot; and he was one of several people who posed as Osama Bin Laden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We cannot stop the CIA/Bush/Clinton drug trade because it is vital to America\'s financial balance of payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The British Royal Family controls the Saudis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Snowden was a CIA asset used to punish the NSA in retaliation for the downfall of Petraeus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His faction is sitting on a cure for cancer, plus &quot;advanced medicine, advanced weaponry, advanced computers, advanced communication, and non-fossil fuel energy that is more dependable than wind and solar power&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His faction also knows how to build a space elevator that would lower the cost of moving payloads to orbit to $20/kg.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I\'m going to call the period from July 10 to election night, HLI v1.0. Even while spinning the most outrageous fantasies, his tone was very condescending. He came across as a godlike being who is always on the verge of ending the conversation because you\'re too stupid to be worth talking to. He declared early on: &quot;Thinking that Hillary is going down is by herself is fantastical nonsense. Thinking that she is going down with all the people she has dirt on is even more fantastical.&quot; He also declared that &quot;Trump is acceptable to the establishment,&quot; and that &quot;you can check off just about any name you know as compromised seriously&quot;. In summary, he explained, &quot;We let your politicians run drugs and have orgies with children because they have a functioning methodology of governance and you don’t.&quot;</p>
<p>After the election, until around March, /pol/ got HLI v2.0. The all-knowing, all-seeing attitude was still there -- he still promised the space elevator and the cure for cancer, and said there would be an economic crash &quot;next summer&quot;. He let us know that the Nazis used to have a secret base in Antarctica, but don\'t any more. He said that JFK had been part of the &quot;Three&quot; faction and that his assassination was &quot;ordered by the Queen&quot;. Interestingly, he said &quot;yes&quot; when asked if the Clintons were responsible for making JFK Jr.\'s plane crash. He predicted that we would have technology to make ourselves &quot;effectively immortal&quot; in 25-30 years. He said Plato had been a member of &quot;Three&quot;. No backing down from the fantasy there at all.</p>
<p>But he pivoted on Trump. He acknowledged the painfully obvious truth that Trump was not actually a tool of the establishment, and told anons they could maybe help Trump by &quot;moving the Overton window&quot;. At the same time, he sniffed in disdain and declared that Trump was incompetent, and completely out of his depth, implying that helping Trump would be a waste of time. He further announced that his faction (&quot;Three&quot;) would be fielding a candidate of their own in 2024. Yet he mentioned something in passing that subtly contradicted all of this. He claimed that Trump had won in such a tremendous landslide, that control of the electronic voting machines could not turn things around for Hillary. This particular lie turns out to be especially important.</p>
<p>This brings us to May 20th, when he came to Voat, and introduced us to HLI v3.0. Now he was far less condescending. Here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>, he didn\'t waste anyone\'s time with Nazi bases in Antarctica or Obama = Osama, since it would simply be deleted by the mods. The very first thing he did was to give us a solid lead -- to the Royal Order of Jesters, and to a specific address where we might find some evildoers. Then he headed over to <a href="https://voat.co/v/conspiracy">v/conspiracy</a> to hold an AMA, where he was asked about how the elite view themselves. He made this ironically frank answer: <strong>&quot;They sincerely believe they are much smarter than everyone else. In reality, they are just evil, and they\'re not very good, at all, at what they do.&quot;</strong> Mister, you got that right!</p>
<p>You see, though he explicitly claimed that it was, the lead to the ROJ was not actually his. It <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1588990">had been provided back in January</a> by <a href="https://voat.co/user/thisisnotagame">@thisisnotagame</a>. The lead to Adams Morgan was also not original to him. It too <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1430854">had been posted in November 2016</a> by <a href="https://voat.co/user/gumshoe_mob">@gumshoe_mob</a>.  
</p>
<p>Despite this, HLI v3.0 was very keen that we pay attention to &quot;his&quot; lead. He literally posted daily reminders about it, for example <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1881284">here </a>. In July, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2015969">he delivered a scolding lecture</a> on what a bunch of lazy failures we were, not willing to take risks to &quot;save the Republic&quot; after he had pointed the way. The lecture included profanity plus an all-caps title, a significant departure for the usually cool and superior HLI. </p>
<p>Apparently none of this was getting quite the result he wanted, so in September he resorted to a sockpuppet. He went on /pol/ as &quot;Senate Anon&quot; and re-sold more or less the same narrative he had been pushing on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>. Again, Trump had beaten Hillary by &quot;20 to 30 points&quot;. Again, the key to saving the Republic was to aggressively attack the blackmail rings that control 80 percent of all politicians. And again, when pressed for specifics, Senate Anon offered up the Jesters and the address in Adams Morgan.</p>
<p>And then, of course,<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2122894"> HLI v3.0 cited Senate Anon here on Voat</a>, as if now he had still more proof that he was right. Over the past month, he has barely shown up here at all. Now he spends all his time back on /pol/, playing as Senate Anon, <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/145583301/us-senate-anon-here">as you can see here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, don\'t misunderstand me: The ROJ and SOBIB are dirty. But they\'re not connected to Hillary or Alefantis, and he\'s not risking anything or doing any real work in pointing us to them. The goal was to establish himself here, to distract us, and to ensure we would find other things he says credible. I think if anyone were actually to go and surveill the building in Adams Morgan, all they would find would be hidden cameras, dirty cops, and disappointment. Don\'t do it. But <strong>take a very hard look at HLI/Senate Anon</strong>. Don\'t dismiss his schtick as random LARPing. <strong>Everything this guy says is for a purpose.</strong> (I will give some detailed examples later.)</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: This will be a daily series. Tomorrow I will review what we know about the Clinton media machine, and this guy\'s place in it.</strong></p>',

            Thank you for this.  I saw the original HLI thread go down on /pol/, and the ROJ one....I still consider myself an FBI Anon literalist, and anything that leads away from the Clinton Foundation makes me suspicious.

            Looking forward to more of your posts on this. When HighLevelInsider was on here telling everyone to go get a video camera and film people in their homes, I took him to be a (bad) copycat of the /pol/ version. In fact, the feeling I got was he was some loser kid living in his mother's basement. I loved it that everyone was basically ignoring him. And I'm especially glad you were paying closer attention.

            Very interesting. I recall he was on a mission to get us to camera up and go surveiling, then when that didn't work he did the Jesters dump. Hmmm. Thanks for all the work you're putting into this OP.

            I have a question re: The British Royal Family controls the Saudis.  How does the islamification of England benefit the Royal Family?  In my opinion, it's the other way around - the Saudis have found leverage against the Royals which keeps the Royals in check during the Saudi funded jihadi invasion of Europe.

             Excellent question! This particular lie, like all of HLI's lies, is driven by the need to divert people away from Hillary's actual agenda and deeds. In this case, the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons themselves have taken vast amounts of money from the Saudis and their Sunni allies. When she was Secretary of State, Hillary pushed a Sunni agenda (trying to overthrow Assad and put a Sunni pipeline through Syria, overthrowing Libya, and so on).
            </p>
            <p>
             Telling stories about how the Saudis are puppets and the real power is elsewhere is a way of hiding that the Saudis do have power and Hillary is their puppet. (Think about Huma Abedin here.) It's not a top priority, it's just something that HLI has on his checklist. He lies about countless things, but always with the same goal, to protect Hillary.

             Oh, this is barely the tip of the iceberg! I will explain as we go along, but it will take weeks to go through everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             For now, just believe me when I say, there's a really stressed-out meeting between HLI and David Brock coming up in the near future. He writes and performs the LARP, but Brock is the one who pays for everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know a lot of you have tried confronting HLI/Senate Anon, and that's great. Glad he didn't fool you. But I scare the crap out of him, and with good reason. And the best part is, I'm not any kind of insider. I'm not law enforcement or government or intelligence. I'm just a guy who is good with Internetz and wants his country back.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're impatient to understand more, you can go back and read my comments and submissions from the beginning. Lots of clues in there to why I scare this guy.

            I confronted him several times. His focus at Voat  was to get people to engage in illegal surveillance. My suspicion was that he hoped people would discuss and plan it here in the forum so that the plans would be known. Then when people actually went to do the surveillance they would run into a trap. Just a suspicion. Whatever his deal is there is something off about him.

            Thanks. I think he is a plant as well but Obama story is more complicated than CIA and HRC and goes back in origination to WW11. The Nazis did have a base in Antartica and pure evil exists there the difference is the alleged Americans took it over. I say alleged because all presidents since JFK are actually part of Operation Paperclip in some way....so they are Nazi's and they run this country. The only two who would not surrender was Nixon....look what happened to him, then Reagan who they shot....but he had to sign a deal with the devil and put GHWBush as Vice.

            There is a theory going around that the first HLI was legit and the ones afterward are all LARPs and disinfo. Were 2.0, 3.0, and the Voat AMAer able to verify their identities in any way?

             Nope. Nobody has ever offered hard proof for any version of HLI or Senate Anon. All we have are the claims they make about other people.

             Yes, but the part that got everyone interested originally is that the Jesters own property next to a former liquor store, Comet Liquor. Alefantis bought the sign when the store closed and used it for Comet Pizza. So it has this enticing ROJ+Alefantis connection, see? It's so well-known at this point that it's even in
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Ping_Pong">
              the Comet Pizza Wikipedia article
             </a>
             . But since it was first identified about a year ago, and since the connection was old to begin with, you can bet there's nothing there but a trap. Or just simply nothing.

            He also claims that he infiltrated his senator. He is nasty when you question him or warn others not to act illegaly, which is what he suggests (he told us to put cameras on our congresspeople homes!!) as though we would catch incriminating evidence but for what purpose, to get us arrested!!

              We'll look at that claim later, in detail. There's a much simpler back story for Obama, one that comes with living eyewitnesses, and genuine dead bodies. That's the story Hillary does not want discussed, which is why HLI talks about the CIA instead.

               Did you ever wonder who has the ability to execute Hillary's enemies without raising awareness from the MSM and law enforcement ?

                I believe you've got that right . There's a lot of dots to connect but I think we all know that the CIA has been tasked with providing propaganda to citizens
