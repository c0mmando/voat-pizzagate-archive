<p>In 2012, following allegations of child abuse, the Crown Prosecution Service formally admitted that Smith should have been charged with the sexual abuse of boys during his lifetime.

            It is known that MI5 ran a brothel in Church Street in Kensington throughout much of the 1950's and early 1960's for the use of visiting dignitaries, 
diplomats and intelligence officers. While for those too important to visit such an establishment certain discreet gentlemen were called upon to 
provide young female or male company directly to the VIP hotel bedroom.

            "At Buckingham Palace, the 16-year-old boy was approached by Sir Peter Hayman, the deputy director of MI6, who was a pedophile.
Hayman asked the boy to work for him in Canada, where he became ambassador.

In 1981, Havers infamously warned Geoffrey Dickens, a Conservative backbench MP, against naming Sir Peter Hayman, the UK’s former high commissioner to Canada, as linked to the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which lobbied to legalise sex with children. "

            Two retired police officers had come forward to say that they were banned from investigating Twiss in around 1978 or 1979. His father, the late Sir Frank Twiss, was Black Rod, the Queen’s envoy in the House of Lords, from 1970 to 1978, and a former admiral. Black Rod is responsible for security and ceremonies at the House of Lords.
The police were acting after Sir Cyril Smith, the late Liberal MP, was seen taking an under-age “rent boy” to Twiss’s London home.
When the officers found out whose home it was, they told their bosses that Twiss could be part of a wider racket that supplied under-age boys to VIPs.
But their enquiries were stopped, leaving the officers frustrated. “We assumed it was to protect VIPs,” one said. 
---&gt;
            <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5721973/Pervert-son-former-Black-Rod-quizzed-police-investigating-Westminster-child-sex-abuse-claims.html">

            </a>
            "They say Mr Twiss: Visited Dolphin Square, the private apartment block in Westminster where Establishment figures allegedly had wild parties."
"The MoS was told of the allegations about Twiss by two former vice squad officers. They investigated him after monitoring the ‘Meat Rack,’ a notorious haunt for rent boys in Piccadilly. They saw Smith pick up a youngster and followed him to an address in Cricklewood, North-West London.
When they found out that it was the home of Twiss, they investigated him and uncovered his links to the corridors of power. When they told their superiors, the investigation was abruptly scrapped."
One of them recalled: ‘We went to the police station in Belgravia, and found a file that said Twiss had been banned by his father from entering the Palace of Westminster. He also went to Dolphin Square late at night. We thought he could be procuring boys for bigger figures from pimps at the Meat Rack. Well-to-do people would not want to be seen somewhere like that. We also followed him to the Meat Rack. Our superiors called it off. We assumed it was to protect VIPs.’

             "During a police raid on a property in central London last month, detectives seized a list of names of high-profile alleged visitors to the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London — a gay-friendly establishment, and one where under-age rent boys and children from the Grafton Close home were reportedly brought to have sex with adult men.
The list includes a number of senior MPs, a high-ranking policeman, a leading tycoon, figures from the National Front and Sinn Fein, an official of the Royal Household, an MI5 officer, two pop stars and the traitorous Soviet spy Anthony Blunt.
Cyril Smith, the late Liberal MP for Rochdale, has already been named as a regular at the guest house, where he allegedly met teenage rent boys when the homosexual age of consent was 21. 
"After his conviction, it emerged that Righton was a founder member of the Paedophile Information Exchange — a contact group for men interested in sex with children. "
"Righton’s links to figures in the Thatcher government are still being assessed by detectives. "

             Elm Guest House.
1990 Elm Guest House boy brothel owner Carol Kasir gives a list of top people to whistleblower.
Apparently the idea to turn the guest house into a gay brothel came from a guest living there called Barry Haddon, with another man called Terry Dwyer.
Haddon was a pimp and pornographer for young boys.

             Soon after, Carole Kasir is found dead, age 47, in her flat.

             "(Cyril) began taking a keen interest in youth matters in Rochdale — sitting on committees in charge of the Rochdale Youth Theatre, the Rochdale Youth Orchestra, the Youth Employment Committee, as well as the governorship of 29 local schools.
As well as these duties, Smith also directed his energies into setting up a hostel for boys from deprived families in Rochdale, approaching poor parents and explaining that their child would be better off  in care.
Funded with council cash, as well as donations from prominent businessmen and the local Rotary club, Cambridge House opened in 1962. Crucially, Smith kept his  own set of keys for the hostel,  meaning that he could come and go as he pleased.

             "The late Sir Peter Hayman, who rose to become a senior spy, and Lord Henniker, who died in 2004 and also had a background in intelligence, 
were two peas in a pod, although how far they shared interests remains unclear.
What is known is that the Queen liked them both so much that she awarded each the CVO, an unusual honour in that it is granted by her personally
Henniker provided a sanctuary on his country estate at Thornham Magna in Suffolk to Peter Righton, who supplied boys to paedophile VIPs at 
Dolphin Square and elsewhere.

             </a>
             Peter Righton was a social worker and academic who in 1992 was fined £900 for possession of abusive images of children. He was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange ( member number 51).  He died in 2007 age 81 years. The Secret Life of a Paedophile documentary in 1994 described the life of Peter Righton and associates. He was a prolific author and in 1981 wrote a chapter in Perspectives on Paedophilia (Batsford press) alongside Morris Fraser and Charles Napier (PIE member number 116). This book promoted paedophilia.

             "Mrs Cairns found the vice-chairman of the school governors, Peter Righton, former Director of Education at the National Institute for Social Work, 
had for years openly advocated sex with boys in care.
"Righton and I had sat together on the body which regulated social work training. I researched everything he had published and I felt sick. 
I was devastated by the betrayal of trust, and social work's naivety.
"He got away with this, and influenced social workers to this day, because they feared seeming "homophobic" by challenging him."
It prompted Mrs Cairns to begin confiding secretly with Scotland Yard.
The impasse ended in 1991, when police discovered Rabet's Sussex children's centre was partly financed by convicted child pornographers 
and that he was part of a ring of wealthy, well-connected paedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police also discovered that Righton was a founder member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned for the age of consent to 
be reduced to four."
