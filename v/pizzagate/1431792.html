For this reason, I am harking back to [this post](https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1430910) into moving forward with our investigation. I have decided to begin with #2 on this list, regarding the connections between the Clinton Foundation, George Soros, and the Tavistock Institute.</p>
<p>The [Tavistock Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavistock_Institute) is a nonprofit organisation founded in 1946 when it separated from the [Tavistock Clinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavistock_and_Portman_NHS_Foundation_Trust) with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. The Institute specializes in psychoanalytics and applied psychology, particularly in group behaviour. Some relevant pieces of its research include [Conditions of Obedience to Authority](http://psyc604.stasson.org/Milgram2.pdf), [studies on our preference to co-operate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Morton_Deutsch/publication/232541331_An_Experimental_Study_of_the_Effects_of_Cooperation_and_Competition_Upon_Group_Process/links/548f378f0cf2d1800d862387.pdf?origin=publication_detail), [research on mass persuasion](https://archive.org/stream/SchrodersBankTAVISTOCKINSTITUTETheMcClaughrysBlog/Some%20Principles%20of%20Mass%20Persuasion%20-%20Selected%20Findings%20of%20Research%20on%20the%20Sale%20of%20United%20States%20War%20Bonds-Tavistock%20Institute-15_djvu.txt), [and creating united neighborhoods](http://hum.sagepub.com/content/21/3/241.full.pdf+html). They also have a large focus on child development, having assisted in writing [entire books on it](https://ia600307.us.archive.org/21/items/discussionsonchi01worl/discussionsonchi01worl_bw.pdf).</p>
<p>These ideas and findings were at the heart of Britain\'s Psychological Warfare program and with guidance from Dr. Kurt Lewin, we also used to establish the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner to our modern day Central Intelligence Agency. Lewin was also at the heart of WWII\'s Strategic Bombing Survey, designating worker housing for bomb strikes to eventually break morale. Dr. Alexander King can also be quoted as stating that it would be a "tragedy if the Tavistock Institute were dropped". Dr. King was also a founding member of NATO, a prominent member of the [Club of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_of_Rome), and allegedly involved with the theorized [Committee of 300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_300). The Tavistock Institute also currently runs over 30 research institutes throughout the US.</p>
<p>So far we openly know of the connection between George Soros and the Clinton Foundation through large donations and shared ideology, and we have identified links from the Tavistock Institute\'s research playing into large parts of federal organizations involved with domestic populations. However, Soros can also be more directly linked to the Tavistock Institue. Soros has closely worked with [Joe Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lewis_(British_businessman)), particularly in regards to [Black Wednesday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday) where they both made inordinate amounts of money from the pound crashing. Lewis also is the main investor of the Tavistock Group, which was founded out of the [first generation of Tavistock Institute\'s staff](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ylVVTHGgYCQC&pg=PT155&lpg=PT159&dq=Oxford+Handbook+of+Management+Theory+AND+Frances+Abraham&source=bl&ots=98V-AzumdN&sig=LiOProOT_MtshFeKk6pjIE8G2KY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m1CWUdDlEtCr0AXA-4HgDw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false). Tavistock also directly aids in serving Soros\' private ideology due to it\'s closeness in developing the [Anti Defamation League](http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1996/eirv23n18-19960426/eirv23n18-19960426_038-how_tavistock_helped_the_adl_mak.pdf).</p>
<p>In short, Tavistock is an organisation interested in mass psychological persuasion, particularly through crisis creation, to make large amounts of individuals rally behind a united cause and deteriorate morale, and psychological persuasion, particularly that involved in child development. This also wouldn\'t be the first incident Tavistock is involved in. Following the incident in [Hampstead, London](https://www.sott.net/article/292461-The-story-of-Alisa-and-Gabriel-Dearman-and-pedophilia-in-high-places) in which Mr. Dearman terrorized and sexually abused his wife, three young children James, Alisa, and Gabriel, and pet dog. Abuse to his children include physical torment, stalking, humiliating punishment, malnourishment, and horribly detailed descriptions of sexual abuse and child sacrifice both in their presence and involving them. Their full video testimonies can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XV65pujtU4). Once court proceedings began, the children were sent to a Tavistock clinic for regular counselling sessions. The children later withdrew their allegations and no convictions were placed. </p>
<p>I would like for this to be the main repository of information regarding this particular lead of FBIAnon. I encourage independent follow up research, and would appreciate to be updated on findings to update this post. I leave you with a quote from Aldous Huxley, a member of the Tavistock group. "There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution."</p>',

            There's a Tavistock connection to the "Papa Kills Babies" kids. But those bastards have their fingers in everything, south American power plants, many of which were built with high interest loans meant to enslave and subjugate those people.

            <em>
             Dr. John Coleman, former intelligence officer with Britain's MI6 and author of Conspirators Hierarchy, The Committee of 300, was one of the first writers to bring the world's attention to the existence of the pivotal role that Tavistock plays in shaping political, social, educational, and economic 'opinions', especially in the United States.
Tavistock ... was founded in London in 1920; the Tavistock Clinic opened in 1920. It always had secret ties to British Freemasonry. 
Its aims include social control, information control; and control of the hidden information environment. Practically, this means it has control mechanisms in academia, multimedia, intelligence, and medicine especially pharmaceuticals. 
 Tavistock is part of the global shadow government.
No group did more to propagandize the U.S. to participate in WWI and WWII at a time when the majority of the American people were opposed to it. British oligarchs used Tavistock to shape and control public opinion in order to manipulate the British public (and later the American public) into accepting the notion that war with Germany was necessary in order "to secure a lasting peace.". The plan to 'create' public opinion began in 1913 as a propaganda factory centered at Wellington House in London. Some people think that the Tavistock mind-controlled Hitler. The aim was to weaken Germany and Russia and make the USA the top power. Funding was initially provided by the Royal family, but was soon to include the Rothchilds (related to Lord Northcliffe by marriage) and the Rockefellers. Wellington House would grow into the Tavistock Institute...
We assume large corporations have economic objectives. But we don't expect them to have a secret social and occult agenda as well. For example, we don't expect them to engineer arrested development and family breakdown. We don't expect them to use pop culture to foster alienation and dysfunction. But evidence suggests Tavistock and its sister organizations do exactly that.

             Tavistock connection to artist Kim Noble

            :
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1995, Kim was finally diagnosed with [dissociative identity disorder,] DID, at the Tavistock clinic, and began therapy.

             This is interesting. Another prominent child abuse case treated at the Tavistock clinic. Your source seems suspicious, they make a lot of nonsense claims, so I'll try and find an alternative source, but this is intriguing. EDIT: Found alternate source, straight from her own website. Even
             <a href="http://www.kimnoble.com/">
              lists the specific doctors that treated her
             </a>
             . Valerie Sinason is one, and she is a prominent member in stating that satanic abuse is rampant in the UK. Whether this and Tavistock is causation or correlation can not be determined.

            I just looked a bit into this, and it's interesting at the least. The owner and creator of GLP, Jason Lucas, is a leading developer of spyware, and is currently working for the Department of Defense’s Joint Task Force. Notable is the fact you are required to agree to the site's terms before entering, waiving possible legal issues from data collection. The site itself mostly seems rather nutty and unserious, however any information is usable information. To test the validity of bannable statements, I created a post with the word Tavistock. I was promptly banned.
