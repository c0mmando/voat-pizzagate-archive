            are you and anyone else reading this serious about bringing the whole corrupt temple down on its head? Because where attention flows energy goes...

            Edinburgh or EDEN Borough is reported has being the occult capital of the world. Edinburgh is also the true location of the biblical Jerusalem. Why do you think the romans built a 30 mile wall around it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like the fact (Sw)eden or South West of EDEN is known to be the rape capital of europe commited by muslim gangs.
