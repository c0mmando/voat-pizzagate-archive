            I actually reached out to her yesterday but I didn't say it was about this. I'm going to bring it up and see if she wants to talk about it again, but it's a touchy subject obviously. And as for DID, I'm pretty sure yes

            Vivian Kubrick, Stanley's daughter, has talked to Alex Jones before on the topic.  She told him her father was murdered.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6edQC2edYmI">
             Here's a video of her talking with Alex Jones
            </a>
            but I don't think she mentions her father in here. By random chance, I asked her about all this stuff at Cucalorus Film Festival this past year because she came in for a Shining screening. She shook the question off (to be fair, not the right venue to ask the question anyway but seeing her in person was a total surprise so I took the chance). Also, she may have been brainwashed from remembering this stuff as she's a huge Scientologist. I don't know where their loyalties lie.
