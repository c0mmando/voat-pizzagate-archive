<p>The author co-constructor has invited those with personal  pedo  stories to  use his site and channel as a platform.  I\'m not sure if he has specific criteria,  (Child Protective Agency victim,  ritual victim, pedo-slave trafficking victim,   or all related types of situations.)<br />
I\'m not sure if he\'s accepting both written testimonies and  vids.  
</p>
<p>I\'m not sure if he\'ll section  testimonies off in categories as time goes by,  but there is a platform for brave people to use their voice in hope that together globally we can make a change because we sure as hell know the government and those in power positions aren\'t making a dent in it.

<p>It would be helpful if all people from all types of pedo victimization came forward as a way of banding together to stop all facets of this epidemic treatment of children. </p>
