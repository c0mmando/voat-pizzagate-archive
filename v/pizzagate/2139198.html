<p>Wikipedia on David Souter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>David Hackett Souter (/ˈsuːtər/; born September 17, 1939) is a retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He served from October 1990 until his retirement in June 2009.[3] Appointed by President George H. W. Bush to fill the seat vacated by William J. Brennan, Jr., Souter sat on both the Rehnquist and Roberts courts and came to vote reliably with the court\'s liberal members.[4][5]
He was the only Justice during his time on the Court with extensive prior court experience outside of a federal appeals court. He served as a prosecutor (1966–1968), in the New Hampshire Attorney General\'s office (1968–1976), as the Attorney General of New Hampshire (1976–1978), as an Associate Justice of the Superior Court of New Hampshire (1978–1983), as an Associate Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court (1983–1990) and briefly as a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (1990).[5]</p>
<p><strong>Once named by The Washington Post as one of Washington\'s 10 Most Eligible Bachelors,[7] Souter has never married,</strong>  though he was once engaged.[39]
According to Jeffrey Toobin\'s 2007 book The Nine, Souter has a decidedly low-tech lifestyle: He writes with a fountain pen, does not use e-mail, and has no cell phone or answering machine. While he was serving on the Supreme Court, he preferred to drive back to New Hampshire for the summer where he enjoyed mountain climbing.[7] <strong>Souter has also done his own home repairs</strong>[40] and is known for his daily lunch of an apple and yogurt.[41]
Souter has been described by former Supreme Court correspondent Linda Greenhouse as the following: &quot;but to focus on his eccentricities — his daily lunch of yogurt and an apple, core and all; the absence of a computer in his personal office — is to miss the essence of a man who in fact is perfectly suited to his job, just not to its trappings. His polite but persistent questioning of lawyers who appear before the court displays his meticulous preparation and his mastery of the case at hand and the cases relevant to it. <strong>Far from being out of touch with the modern world, he has simply refused to surrender to it control over aspects of his own life that give him deep contentment</strong>: hiking, sailing, time with old friends, reading history.&quot;[42]
In early August 2009, Souter moved from his family farm house in Weare to a Cape Cod-style single-floor home on two well-manicured acres in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, a town adjacent to the state capital of Concord. Souter told a disappointed Weare neighbor that the two-story family farmhouse was not structurally sound enough to support the thousands of books he owns, and that he wished to live on one level.[43]
Over the years, Souter has served on hospital boards and civic committees.[44][45] He is a former honorary co-chair of the We the People National Advisory Committee.[46  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Souter">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Souter</a></p>

<p>So why would Erick Erickson  make the tweet? He probably has inside information to more than what is on the net, but this is what I found.  Apparently, the story had very little coverage. Souter was in an incident in a park which involved young men and the details are sorely lacking as to why and what really happened.</p>

<p>Justice Souter assaulted during jog
Police sources: Attack appears to have been random
Saturday, May 1, 2004 Posted: 4:48 PM EDT (2048 GMT) </p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice David Souter suffered minor injuries in the attack, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter was assaulted by two men Friday night and taken to a hospital with minor injuries, a court spokeswoman said.
The incident occurred while he was jogging about 9 p.m. Friday, said Kathy Arberg, a court spokeswoman.
Law enforcement sources told CNN the incident occurred near the Potomac River waterfront in southwest Washington, not far from Souter\'s home. 
Arberg said that the motive was not robbery, but law enforcement sources said it appeared to be a random attack.
Arberg said Supreme Court police escorted the justice to Washington Hospital Center. He was examined and released about 1:30 a.m. Saturday.
He suffered &quot;minor injuries&quot; and is &quot;feeling fine,&quot; Arberg said.
<strong>She could not characterize the nature or motivation for the attack, and said only that young men were involved.</strong>
Souter is an avid jogger.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/05/01/souter.assaulted/index.html?_s=PM:LAW">http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/05/01/souter.assaulted/index.html?_s=PM:LAW</a></p>

            I would take Erickson with a grain of salt. He used to work at his own news org Red State... he hated Souter because he was appointed by a "conservative" yet he was the biggest liberal on the court besides Ginsburg. Now Erickson is working for CNN?!?!?! I would need a lot more proof that this judge is a pedophile than some statement by a hack like Erickson
