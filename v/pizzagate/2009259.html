Pizzagate: A Way Forward With Better Terminology And Research</p>
<p>Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. 
If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation. ALL posts must include at least one link. </p>

<p>PIZZAGATE: A WAY FORWARD WITH BETTER TERMINOLOGY AND RESEARCH</p>
<p>I think the Pizzagate community, while well meaning, is making a mistake by hanging on the flashy bells and whistles of Pizzagate such as Instagram accounts with crazy pictures, pointing out every business they find with swirls and triangles in their logos, jewelry and trinkets associated with these networks, etc...</p>
<p>These are tools used for recognition, not talking points for normies.</p>
<p>These things are often synonymous with institutional organ trafficking, institutional pedophilia, institutional crime organizations, institutionalized child pornography, institutional slavery such as trafficked human beings put to work in cane fields and other agricultural operations, mining operations, domestic slaves, etc...</p>
<p>Notice now I managed to point out these abuses without resorting to the things in the first paragraph. This is the terminology that reaches normies because it omits the salacious buzzwords and trappings. It is more normie friendly. It also implies profit motive because institutions are profit driven.</p>
<p>I also suggest reserachers stay away from terminology such as &quot;Satanic Ritual Abuse&quot;, and &quot;Ritual Abuse&quot;, and &quot;Conspiracy&quot; because it does not fit the normie perception of reality. Normies almost always need to know &quot;why&quot; a person would do terrible things to other humans and have that question answered before they will mentally proceed. If it does not fit their perception of reality they will mentally go no further.</p>
<p>I also suggest that people stop harping on Jews, Rothschilds, Satanism, and these nebulous monolithic entities that we know exists but does not exist for the normies. These concepts don\'t touch the heart of normies, hurting children does, and their trusted institutions hurting children for profit stands a better chance of enraging the normies.</p>
<p>A famous person coined this quote:</p>
<p>&quot;The individual is handicapped by coming face-to-face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. The American mind simply has not come to a realization of the evil which has been introduced into our midst. It rejects even the assumption that human creatures could espouse a philosophy which must ultimately destroy all that is good and decent.&quot; Herbert Hoover</p>
<p>In recent years there have been attempts to debunk this as being a legitimate Hoover quote and that someone else may have written it, or that it might have been written by one of his ghost writers. Debunkers also state that it was written about communism and not about conspiracies, which is fully ironic, considering that communism is one of the most insidious conspiracies in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>In my opinion it matters not. The quote, for the message it conveys, stands on its own merit in one sentence and explains the mechanism by which normies shrink from horrow so vast, so evil, so corrupt, so in their face, that they will deny it. They deny because if it be true then they will feel compelled to do something about because the people that are supposed to be doing something about this sort of things is actually doing these evil things. It brings a normie to a state of helplessness and so they deny that it exists.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems normies face is the fact that they themselves are not so evil and they cannot comprehend that a group consisting of a few million people exists right under their nose, pretends to be their &quot;public servents&quot;, and is actually serving them into the jaws of Moloch, which is another term I suggest reserchers not use with normies.</p>
<p>Normies do not understand occult jargon and will refuse it evertime it is offered. If researchers wish to be taken seriously they MUST present their information with factual detail in terminology such as I suggested above that denotes criminal activity tied to a profit motive that a normie can digest.</p>
<p>You have to remember that a lot of normies are still not willing to believe the CIA is the logistics corporation for the largest drug smuggling operation on the planet. I am not saying that it should be forbidden to discuss the occult with one another, share information, and discuss it in an effort to gain a better understanding of it.</p>
<p>I am saying that when preparing material to present, unless you are a shill with no soul who is busy burying poison pills into everything as fast as squirrels that bury nuts for the winter, some changes have to be made in the way researchers operate.</p>
<p>The &quot;Why&quot; question has to be answered for the normie. They might be willing to believe that a rare psychopathic sadistic fuck that enjoys torturing a child slowly for hours, days, weeks, months, or years exists but they will not buy that there is a large group of people that they have misidentified as their benevolent and wise caretakers that are doing the things we know about. Normies don\'t have a place in their acceptance space for untold numbers of children being held in cages and tortured to the point of having no pain response left because the victim became disassociated.</p>
<p>Normies need normal motives like money from organ trafficking, slave labor in cane fields, children kidnapped from warzones for organ harvesting, institutionalized child pornography, slave labor in the mining industry, and things of that nature. Surely I didn\'t cover them all here and the brigher minds among you will come up with endless ways to convey a better message.</p>
<p>What I have suggested will not be accomplished by the people who treat Pizzagate like a carnival atmosphere and are only in it for the lurid sightseeing and fascination of the occult themes, because it requires actual research which takes time and organization, but the brighter minds among you will hear the message and arise to the call. This is something your enemies hope you never do, disappoint them.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my two cents.</p>',

            they sure did. and it's true, those words aren't necessarily required to make our case here .. but i can't imagine how invalidating it is to SRA survivors that they cannot "call it what it is."

            my thoughts exactly. they were useful in opening our eyes, but they are not what we all need to hang onto now that our eyes are Open. i'm suspicious of anyone trying to drag us back to the mentality of the outset when we've evolved way way past that in our understanding.
           </p>
           <p>
            i'm also really disappointed that it's so harmful to refer to SRA as, well, SRA, because i know that not only is ritual abuse real, satanic-influenced ritual abuse is real. i know because my family came really close to being involved. but with the deepest misfortune the term has been polluted beyond any salvation by the early detractors in the 80's and 90's.

            I am not some Stock Tycoon, but I can understand Reason 2 and think it makes a lot of sense, but as you say anything is possible.  Knowing the media and those that wish to spread propaganda and false flags, I believe there is something in the works.  We have to be ready.  I have a feeling they are going to take advantage of the Smith Mundt Act.  Could be wrong but they are not ones to miss an opportunity. And the opportunity will not be in our favor.

            If we start making decisions for people about what they can handle and what they should be told, we will be doing EXACTLY what the "elite" are doing to us.  The key is to present just the facts and potential leads and cut out the hyperbole and wildly speculative tangents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trust people.  Yes, the unfamiliar will likely be very shocked, but if known truths are presented as well-researched evidence, many will be drawn to look deeper.  Those who need their news heavily filtered will likely never be willing to face facts anyway until they hear it on The View.

             Good point, but I like the idea of having separate factual presentations from fringe posts.  Mixing the factual with the (for norms) fringe material makes them dismiss the factual presentation.

            I think well intentioned people who want us to limit what we say to the easily believable, (not a bad idea) need to learn to edit their ideas so they can be grasped more quickly.  In a short attention span world like today, the only answer is better editing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately this SRA stuff was made unbelievable on purpose.  This makes the big lie (I'm totally innocent) easier to sell. We need to focus on the sizzle not the steak.  Is this activity illegal, is it a crime?
           </p>
           <p>
            Sticking with the facts of child rape, rather than probable satanic motivations, leads us forward in ways new folks can grasp.  That's very important. It's a matter of respect.  Meet people where they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            That the real motivation may be that....... the fresh blood of traumatized children is necessary on a regular schedule for these elites lives to continue, I don't know how to break it to them.  It's a tough sell.

            So what do we do? Easy. They went after our credibility so we'll go after theirs. And the way to do that is to explain to people the Smith-Mundth "Modernization" Act of 2012 permits the U.S. Government to lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody knows this. I only learned about it a couple of months ago. It floored me. Then I tried red pilling people with it and got even more floored. I was amazed how easy it was for people to accept the U.S. Government could do such a thing. It pissed people off when I told them. It's hard to convince someone the U.S. Government is trafficking children but it's trivial to convince them the Smith-Mundt "Modernization" Act of 2012 allows them to lie to us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Broadcasting the truth about Smith-Mundt 2012 can destroy the U.S. Government's credibility very quickly. I'm 100% convinced of that right now. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            1) There are no sordid sex crimes to explain and hence the natural reflex for any non-psychotic to puke their guts out. Nobody likes being nauseous.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) People already suspect the U.S. Government is up to no good but nobody can put their finger on it. Smith-Mundt 2012 changes that.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) There's no defense of Smith-Mundt 2012. Even

            can't defend "Public Diplomacy Broadcasting". Believe me he tried but failed after trying to argue it was limited to the State Department and only to counter foreign propaganda. It's not. I looked it up. All that's needed is for the State Department to say the propaganda will be broadcast internationally as well as domestically.

                 I am rejecting every ounce of your claim.   I am saying you have made an absolutely evidence free claim and I am asking you to point to a single example of a hoax video.   You have already walked away from a more ridiculous aspect of your claim and now I am asking for any evidence of what you claim.

                    And I explained you were correct about Smith-Mundt 2012 not allowing the payment of internet shills. Remember? I'm a rational human being and will freely admit when I'm wrong unlike you.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    After admitting my error I then explained YOUR error which was believing Smith-Mundt 2012 was limited to the State Department. While true the State Dept has to be involved in the "Public Diplomacy Broadcasting" it doesn't LIMIT participation to just them. Nor does it limit the message to only countering foreign propaganda. Domestic "Diplomacy Broadcasting" is allowed if related to an international State Department effort. For example a campaign against
                    <a href="https://www.cfr.org/report/strategy-reduce-gun-trafficking-and-violence-americas">
                     gun violence in the Americas
                    </a>
                    is enough to justify the State Department hiring crisis actors and staging a hoax shooting event and passing it off as real. If that hoax mass shooting was reported on internationally and helped convey an anti-gun violence message then that's enough to qualify it as "Domestic Propaganda" and therefor make it legal to intentionally lie to the American People. The point being the crisis actors, television crews, law enforcement and rescue personal don't have to work for the State Department in order for their participation to be used in "Public Diplomacy Broadcasting".

                   <p>
                    That seems wrong doesn't it AreWeSure? Our government shouldn't be able to lie to us like that right?

                     I don't remember this at all.   Though, sometimes I skip your replies.

                    <p>
                     Your example is ludicrous and completely false.  So it doesn't allow for internet shills, but you can pay for hoax shootings?  What are you talking about.  You paint yourself into ridiculous corners trying to hang on to fake theories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Why don't you actually read the text of bills and read genuine legal commentary about them.  Smith Mundt 2012 needs to read in conjunction with the all other Smith Mundt laws. You should try to do that without using non-nonsense sources.  Because your understanding of this bill is pitiful.

                    <p>
                     As for your hoax shooting event.  You think the State Department could pull that off? Without using magical thinking (I know this is a big ask, isn't it.) how does that happen?  How do you get an entire community in on a the hoax?

                      ".......hoax shootings? What are you talking about."
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The Smith-Mundt "Modernization" Act of 2012 allows the U.S. Government to broadcast domestic propaganda. And there's overwhelming evidence that many of the mass "shooting's" since 2012 have been hoaxes. The most damming evidence is the number of "mass shootings" miraculously skyrocketed immediately after Smith-Mundt 2012 was passed:
                      <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/feminist/files/2015/07/Mass-Shootings-Frequency.png">
                       https://thesocietypages.org/feminist/files/2015/07/Mass-Shootings-Frequency.png
                      </a>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Then there are the countless inconsistencies surrounding the more well known "mass shootings". For example Sandy Hook:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      1) On the day of the shooting the first police to arrive parked a quarter of a mile away, no ambulances drive up to the school itself and actually arrived AFTER a truck carrying Port-o-Potties dropped of 5 portable toilets:
                      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEfW9FvLyAg">
                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEfW9FvLyAg
                      </a>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      2) Sandy Hook Elementary school wasn't even an operating school at the time of the "mass shooting":
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      a) No activity of the web site:
                      <a href="https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/shes-on-wayback-machine.jpg">
                       https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/shes-on-wayback-machine.jpg
                      </a>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      b) No maintenance records and was in deplorable condition. One bathroom had toxic mold and dried up algae as if it had been entirely flooded to the depth of 1 foot:
                      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeRPtj-tEU">
                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXeRPtj-tEU
                      </a>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      3) The state of Connecticut and the FBI had no record of anyone dying there:
                      <a href="http://www.reformation.org/NobodyDiedAtSandyHook.pdf">
                       http://www.reformation.org/NobodyDiedAtSandyHook.pdf
                      </a>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There are hundreds of these inconsistencies and that's just one "mass shooting".
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But I've seen this movie before AreWeSure. You will dismiss all this evidence. You have never been wrong about anything in the past 9 months ever even just for a second. You are incapable of misinterpreting evidence and anyone who disagrees with you is "lying".

            Thank you for your well written plan to help further educate our Newcomers to the site. I think you bring up some really valid points. YES I think that so many SRA posts and videos really scares the B-Geezus out of people. The more we focus on the Corruption aspect of what they are doing, the better. Most people know and suspect that there is a lot of Corruption in our state and federal govt. So the stretch to believe is not that far. Gory stuff is not going to convince people, it will only scare them away, and they may not return. I also think the focusing on so many symbols gets a little tiring and I suggest that we post the FBI logos/symbols on here often, but not so much someone's necklace or toe ring. When someone posted Theresa May with a pedo pin I thought, Who will believe that but us? Money laundering and the Art in Embassies should be focused on and how it plays into their hiding their acts and how it can lead to a RICO case. This gives them hope as well. Again I thank you for your wonderful post and the time you spent. It Shows. Upvoat4U

             The focus should be on the weak link of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption which is Racine, Wisconsin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is Paul Ryan's district and the real key to exposing the true agenda of Total Global Enslavement. That is what Sustainability is based on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Art in Embassies began with SC Johnson and other corporate partners in Racine. Sustainability began in Racine. Community Policing began in Racine. Racine is a model for the real agenda, and the sooner the world understands this, the better chance we have to reverse the system. We cannot hope for slow justice. We need Immediate Global Enlightenment. Nothing will happen until the world see the real truth and rises up. Our time is running out with the advancement of AI. The root is Racine, Wisconsin.

            Start with where the elite pedophile scandals are proven to have ALREADY HAPPENED and WHY (blackmail): Saville, Hastert, Hollywood.

             I don't think that is what they are saying  pizzagate is.  They are saying that is how normies will be able to understand child trafficking.  People understand slavery and prostitution.   They would not believe a vast complex system of elite pedophilia/satatic sacrifice.  That is not what they accept as history.  The concept would be totally new to them and they would shut you out.
