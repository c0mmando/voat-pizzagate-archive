<p>After the bone fragments have been dug up on the property of the notorious Florida reform school—the apparent remains of “disappeared” young boys—they’ll be shipped to a lab in Texas.</p>
<p>That’s where Arthur Eisenberg and his team at the University of North Texas’s Center for Human Identification will perform DNA analysis. If they succeed, they’ll have played a pivotal role in closing one of the lurid sagas in the history of the Florida panhandle: <strong>the mystery of why so many young boys disappeared from the Arthur G. Dozier School.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Investigators believed around 98 boys died at the school between 1914 and 1973</strong> </p>
<p>Thirty or so of the bodies were sent back to the parents. 
Some were buried on the property <em>(some in shallow graves)</em>. </p>
<p>Others have no recorded burial information at all. Men who once attended the school have told stories of boys disappearing and dying at the hands of school employees.</p>
<p>“They didn’t even have the decency to mark the location. There is not one headstone where these children were buried. No plot log was ever kept for a graveyard for children.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The poorly kept state records cannot account for what happened to 22 children who died at the school. And no one knows who is buried where.</p>
<p>Florida first started looking into the allegations in 2008, after some of the White House Boys -- who had met on the Internet and shared similar stories -- called on then-Gov. Charlie Crist to investigate.</p>
<p>At Crist\'s request, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation and its final report in 2009 accounted for 31 boys buried in the cemetery. </p>
<p>The investigation failed to clear up the mystery over what happened to the dozens of other students who died at the school whose bodies have never been accounted for.</p>
<p>FDLE closed the case due to lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct. The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011.</p>
<p>Last year, a research team from the University of South Florida, on a humanitarian mission to help identify these bodies for surviving families, used ground-penetrating radar, and found that there are as many as <strong>19 more bodies buried in the surrounding area -- completely unmarked.
After clearing the area, the team determined that 49 graves exist.</strong> </p>

            It's a lot more than 24 unidentified grave sites.  They never searched the "Klan site" back in the woods - where they dumped bodies not worth a "proper" grave.

             55 grave sites found to date....24 more than they thought.  There needs to be a thorough investigation of the property (as difficult as that may be).  People need to wake up and stop making excuses for systemic, institutionalized brutality and sexual exploitation of children.  Which today, BTW, is becoming manifest by Globalist Trans Protocol, pushing for child mutilation in the name of "Child Sexuality Rights movement" (Yet another way to give pedos license to assault kids).

            "FDLE closed the case due to lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct. The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011." Yeah, 31 boys burried in the cemetary. Just can't prove the staff did it. Drop the investigation. Teens are dropping like flies right?. Fuck this country and it's governing, judicial and law apparatus. Traitors, murderers, liars. And fuck the pedo mods too.

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Last year, a research team from the University of South Florida, on a humanitarian mission to help identify these bodies for surviving families, used ground-penetrating radar, and found that there are as many as
              <strong>
               19 more bodies buried in the surrounding area -- completely unmarked. After clearing the area, the team determined that 49 graves exist.
              </strong>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Which we come to learn is actually 55 grave sites, 24 more than they thought before.
             </strong>
             It's thought that there may be another burial area on the property.
            </p>
            <p>
             They could no longer ignore the problem and no longer rely on coverage from fake CNN News to minimize the validity of the accusations.  So from 'no evidence' then, the result today is an official apology, finally listing the offences (that for so long were ignored).
            </p>
            <p>
             Does this mean anyone will definitively be called out to be complicit in the crimes?  Those who allowed this to go on for decades?  Or are they considering giving recompense to any of the families for pain and suffering, for imprisoning and torturing kids (some without a trial)?  No, but, they will deliberate on whether or not to put up a memorial.
