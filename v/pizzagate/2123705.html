<p>After the bone fragments have been dug up on the property of the notorious Florida reform school—the apparent remains of “disappeared” young boys—they’ll be shipped to a lab in Texas.</p>
<p>That’s where Arthur Eisenberg and his team at the University of North Texas’s Center for Human Identification will perform DNA analysis. If they succeed, they’ll have played a pivotal role in closing one of the lurid sagas in the history of the Florida panhandle: <strong>the mystery of why so many young boys disappeared from the Arthur G. Dozier School.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Investigators believed around 98 boys died at the school between 1914 and 1973</strong> </p>
<p>Thirty or so of the bodies were sent back to the parents. 
Some were buried on the property <em>(some in shallow graves)</em>. </p>
<p>Others have no recorded burial information at all. Men who once attended the school have told stories of boys disappearing and dying at the hands of school employees.</p>
<p>“They didn’t even have the decency to mark the location. There is not one headstone where these children were buried. No plot log was ever kept for a graveyard for children.&quot;</p>

<p>The poorly kept state records cannot account for what happened to 22 children who died at the school. And no one knows who is buried where.</p>
<p>Florida first started looking into the allegations in 2008, after some of the White House Boys -- who had met on the Internet and shared similar stories -- called on then-Gov. Charlie Crist to investigate.</p>
<p>At Crist\'s request, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation and its final report in 2009 accounted for 31 boys buried in the cemetery. </p>
<p>The investigation failed to clear up the mystery over what happened to the dozens of other students who died at the school whose bodies have never been accounted for.</p>
<p>FDLE closed the case due to lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct. The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011.</p>
<p>Last year, a research team from the University of South Florida, on a humanitarian mission to help identify these bodies for surviving families, used ground-penetrating radar, and found that there are as many as <strong>19 more bodies buried in the surrounding area -- completely unmarked.
After clearing the area, the team determined that 49 graves exist.</strong> </p>

This was torture – there was deliberate degrading and humiliating treatment, sexual abuse, physical beatings, lack of proper food or sanitation, deliberate sexual humiliation, sleep deprivation, and lack of medical care. With inhuman conditions of confinement likened to Korean prisoner of war camps and amidst thousands of law suits alleging severe child abuse, the Straight Inc was finally shut down after a US Congressional investigation.  ...

            It's a lot more than 24 unidentified grave sites.  They never searched the "Klan site" back in the woods - where they dumped bodies not worth a "proper" grave.

            Nor did the investigation ever delve with any seriousness into the horrific rapes.

             55 grave sites found to date....24 more than they thought.  There needs to be a thorough investigation of the property (as difficult as that may be).  People need to wake up and stop making excuses for systemic, institutionalized brutality and sexual exploitation of children.  Which today, BTW, is becoming manifest by Globalist Trans Protocol, pushing for child mutilation in the name of "Child Sexuality Rights movement" (Yet another way to give pedos license to assault kids).

             Edit: I didn't read about the rape dungeon...but had not read thoroughly victims testimony website.  Scoped out the news coverage for the submission.

            "FDLE closed the case due to lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct. The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011." Yeah, 31 boys burried in the cemetary. Just can't prove the staff did it. Drop the investigation. Teens are dropping like flies right?. Fuck this country and it's governing, judicial and law apparatus. Traitors, murderers, liars. And fuck the pedo mods too.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Last year, a research team from the University of South Florida, on a humanitarian mission to help identify these bodies for surviving families, used ground-penetrating radar, and found that there are as many as
              <strong>
               19 more bodies buried in the surrounding area -- completely unmarked. After clearing the area, the team determined that 49 graves exist.
              </strong>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Which we come to learn is actually 55 grave sites, 24 more than they thought before.
             </strong>
             It's thought that there may be another burial area on the property.
            </p>
            <p>
             They could no longer ignore the problem and no longer rely on coverage from fake CNN News to minimize the validity of the accusations.  So from 'no evidence' then, the result today is an official apology, finally listing the offences (that for so long were ignored).
            </p>
            <p>
             Does this mean anyone will definitively be called out to be complicit in the crimes?  Those who allowed this to go on for decades?  Or are they considering giving recompense to any of the families for pain and suffering, for imprisoning and torturing kids (some without a trial)?  No, but, they will deliberate on whether or not to put up a memorial.

              <strong>
               WHEREAS, more than 500 former students of the Dozier School 
for Boys have come forward alleging physical, mental, and sexual 
abuses from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and

             </p>
             <p>
              Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of Florida:
             </p>
             <p>
              That the Senate acknowledges that the treatment of the boys 
who were sent to the Dozier School for Boys was cruel and 
unjust, a violation of human decency toward the individuals who 
had been placed in the state’s care.
             </p>
             <p>
              BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Senate acknowledges that 
the operation of the Dozier School for Boys, including the 
physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children confined to 
the facilities, is a shameful part of the history of the State of Florida.
