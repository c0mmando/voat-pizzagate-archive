<blockquote>
<p>The bizarre part of this story is the same day Alfred disappears some 2500 feet higher a couple in a different area of the Park are hiking when they hear a sound, not quite a scream but a sound which forced their attention to look up towards it, where they witnessed a small boy walk out onto a ridge look out and then a few seconds later, turn around and walk back out of sight again. The witnesses were stunned, as this area where the boy had been seen was treacherous and extremely high in elevation, this area was a place called Devils Nest.</p>
<p>The next day the couple return home and upon reading the newspaper and seeing the picture of missing Alfred automatically recognise him as the small boy they had seen on the cliff top and call the park.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was found less than a day later. The odd thing, though, is that the kid was found 12 miles away from the place where he vanished, a trip that would have required him to surmount not only a variety of waterways and fences, but two mountain ranges as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David Gonzales | <a href="http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/10-mysterious-disappearances-in-national-parks9.htm">HowStuffWorks.com</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>David Gonzales asked his mother if he could have the car keys. There was a box of cookies in the car, and he wanted a treat. The car was only 50 yards away, and his mother watched him as he walked to the parking lot. She turned her back for a second, and when she looked around again, Gonzales was gone.</p>
<p>His mother reported that she heard no sound at all when her back was turned, though she did see a beige truck speeding out of the campground around the time that her son went missing. Since there were no signs of abduction, authorities did not pursue that lead.</p>

<p>David Paulides, a retired police detective, noticed a startling number of children going missing from national parks. Among these cases, he noticed odd similarities.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2093486-retired-police-detective-identifies-mysterious-patterns-across-thousands-of-missing-persons-cases/?expvar=004&amp;utm_expid=.5zxdwnfjSHaLe_IPrO6c5w.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">EpochTimes.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They are clustered in certain areas, particularly around bodies of water and in national parks. If the people are found alive, they often have memory loss. If they are found dead, the cause of death is hard to determine. The people are sometimes found in an area it seems they could not have reached by foot, or they are found in a location that has already been thoroughly searched.</p>
<p>Paulides gave the example of a little boy whose body was found lying on a fallen tree trunk. This tree was lying across the trail searchers had taken for days before the body appeared there.</p>
<p>People are often missing clothes and shoes. Search and rescue dogs are strangely unable to pick up the scent, Paulides said. Some canine handlers have told Paulides their search dogs act strangely, walking a little ways, circling, then sitting down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another odd thing to note is the seemingly random appearance of Army Green Berets in some cases. From <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/12/27/the-footprints-of-evil/">VeteransToday.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCarter also remarked in his interview with Paulides about how strange the arrival on the scene of the Green Berets was. They were supposedly training in the area, but no one could confirm where, and no one in the Park Service admitted to knowing anything about their deployment in the search. They just showed up in choppers about a week into it, carrying their own equipment and their own communication systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paulides filed many FOIA requests for various cases and, of course, didn\'t get much in the way of help. Yosemite National Park Service gave a <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/12/27/the-footprints-of-evil/">particularly startling reply</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working in concert with four other retired law enforcement personnel, Paulides filed an FOIA request with the park service asking for a list of people that have gone missing in Yosemite. The park service replied that they kept no such lists. As ex law enforcement officers; Paulides and company immediately grasped the breathtaking level of negligence required for the park service not to keep such lists and the unlikelihood of such incompetence existing in a federal agency of the NPS’s stature.</p>
<p>They filed their FOIA again, rewording it in case it was a question of semantics. The chilling response of the NPS western regional director was a blanket denial of such a list existing at either the park level or the national level. Paulides quotes her as saying “we rely on the institutional memory of our employees to help us on missing people and to understand the magnitude of it at different parks.”</p>
<p>Paulides then sent her a letter stating that he was a published author that had requested an exemption. He was entitled by law to a list utilizing the resources she had just quoted. The park service responded that his books were not carried in enough libraries to get an author’s exemption and they would have to go into the archives and formulate a list and that would cost him thirty-four thousand dollars. That would be for a list of missing people in Yosemite. For the entire park system, Paulides was told he would have to pay 1.4 million dollars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Paulides started <a href="http://www.canammissing.com/page/page/8396197.htm">CanAmMissing.com</a>, which has a lot of interesting information regarding these disappearances, for anyone wanting more information.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paulides noticed that certain national parks were hotspots for missing children; he referred to them as clusters. I found a map of the clusters here: <a href="http://thenightsky.org/images/phenomenon/parks/parks.jpg">Map</a></p>
<p>When I saw that map, I was immediately reminded of a map of the underground US military tunnels that I had come across before. Here it is: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7LrxEph.png">Map</a></p>
<p>They\'re almost exactly the same!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One person reports having heard children crying out for help while visiting Droop Mountain Battlefield Park in West Virginia <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DrVLGFx.png">here</a>. Droop Mountain has tunnels and an underground bunker, as discussed <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1633384">here</a> and <a href="http://www.greenbrier.com/Activities/The-Bunker/Hidden-in-Plain-Sight-Goldenseal-Magazine-2010.aspx">here</a>. Possible confirmation that tunnels and underground bases are being use to transport and potentially store children for various reasons? Trafficking, Bohemian Grove-like rituals, and experimentation come to mind for me.</p>',

            <p>
             Last season I watched a tv show called, Mysteries at the National Park, detailing  Glacier Mt Park/Waterton Park mysteries.
             <br/>
             This was before pizzagate broke.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time I was really sceptical about the entire show, but just now thought of the segment  about  a woman who  found an abandoned train railway and train compartment with shackles in it.    If my memory is right, and it may not be,  I thought the segment said she saw speakers, but I might be wrong on that detail.
             <br/>
             I didn't think about it in connection with this until now.
             <br/>
             Maybe there are connections?

            Those aren't underground military tunnels in your pic. Those are the maps connecting the blue voting for trafficking routes as suggested by Anon5 on 4chan. If you're going to claim something, at least use something reasonable (the military has a tunnel linking south Texas to El Paso through Mexico????). This has got to be a LARP post.

             ^^^ those are other maps said to be of the US military tunnels. Regardless of which one you want to use, the locations still line up. And, yes, they all point to a tunnel that goes from South Texas into Mexico. Sorry to disappoint you.

            This story made the rounds on April 3rd and made me very suspicious.  The title of this particular article from the New York Times is, "Trump Donates First-Quarter Salary to National Park Service."

            ]
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, I believe the stories of woman and children being hunted down, and I can see these parks being used for that purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if I can imagine someone like 6 foot 8 Comey being part of the "furry" club of sickos, then it is easy to see how there are stories of a "Bigfoot."   It could easily be someone in a costume chasing down a victim..

            This was an interesting watch. He does seem to believe himself it to be Bigfoot. But interesting to get more figures and details of how quickly it happens.

            and it led me to, AMERICOLD (with frozen looking children on the front page):

            Ya i remember when i used to listen to paracast and this guy would come on his name is David Paulidus, he talked about missing people in the woods and in odd occurrences. People assume it was bigfoot and such according to the stories yet i couldn't help but realize the paranormal field has been infiltrated by Rockefeller money as in the co host Chris O'Brien talks of accepting money from David for his research. I donno maybe im going out of the loop but i keep tabs of decievers and satinists and would not be surprized the people pushing the ufo agenda etc are using it as a cover up to the elites in high trafficking using high advanced chemicals which would make the search dogs not want to chase. Reaserch David Paulidus and see what you come up with. He is on coast to coast and paracast and don eckers dark matters radio. I donno about him personally but i feel something darker in all of this.

             Wouldn't be too hard to dress someone up in a fur suit occasionally to freak out tourists who drift too close to the base entrances, and fuel the supernatural abduction theories.

            the dogs are either picking up the scent of the searchers and rangers who actually are involved with the disappearances or they sit where the tunnel entrance is. Or maybe even where they are hanging in a tree. If someone goes missing and the rangers are dragging their feet, start asking them questions that are personal and put pressure on them personally and chances are the missing person will show up. them searching for themselves and fooling everyone and getting away with the kiddnapping is their "magick"

            Here's the map with both locations for missing and the tunnels. Especially several turn points in these tunnels are matching. I have no idea if the tunnels have been built by these lines and when drawn into the map.

              I don't know which map is original or have there been lines added/removed and when. It seems to me the lines match with the map in the post except for shorter Hawaii line and missing Alaska lines

            Droop mountain has been implicated before. There is a movie where actor Robin Williams plays a "crazy" Doctor that is based on a true story about a doctor involved near Droop Mountain. Robin died suddenly a few years ago in an alleged "suicide"
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes Patch Adams! He was part of a childcare research hospital of some sort that was linked to the Droop Mountain tunnels and underground base.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I am going to paste a link of a web discussion between Ole Damegaurd (longtime JFK assasination reasearchet &amp; other government lies) &amp; with Webre. You might recognize that last name he was best buddies with James Alefantis and is seen in multiple pictures with him. His name is Septimbre Webre and he was the director of the Washington DC ballet until he suddenly resigned when the pizzagate investigations heated up. He is in tight circle with HRC, Alefantis, Podesta's, &amp; even Rahm Emanuel (former whitehouse Chief of staff to Batak Obama now the mayor of Chicago but is famous for being a ballerina... I am not joking.
This Webre states he does not talk to Septimbre and says he has escaped the matrix of evil in his family. Below is the link:

             Family guy predicted Robin Williams death down to the t. Not sure which episode. Theres a lady on youtube who does a wonderful job breaking down all the predictive programming in that show. Its almost as bad as the simpsons.

             Hey.  I remember those posts on Droop Mt. also I remember just reading something on her a few days ago about Robin William's suicide and that it was suspect and that there were some fishy things about his wife some Satanic involvement and it eluded to some questionable details regarding his death.  I never felt right about the cause of death and also David Carradine's either.
