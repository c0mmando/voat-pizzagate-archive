            Yes you should seek out some help but in the meantime I would not discuss this with people that are extremely adverse to it. There are some people we may never  reach. You also must not let this take over all your waking hrs. and sleeptime.   We are all going to work together on this. You are not alone. Get out and volunteer at a soup kitchen. Help at a food pantry. There are wonderful people still.  You can come here anytime you need a hug.

            It sounds like you could benefit from some licensed, reputable, professional, family counseling. Perhaps you could look for such resources available in your area, and ask your mom to be involved.
