<p>Health Impact News first reported on the charges brought against David Frodsham and his wife who were state-approved foster parents last year (2017) with the story of the young child Devani, who was seized from her family just days before her second birthday and placed into the Frodshams’ state-approved foster home where she was allegedly raped repeatedly and trafficked as part of an organized pornographic pedophile ring. ... </p>
<p>After David Frodsham was arrested due to a federal investigation, Devani was placed into another state-approved foster home where 80% of her body was burned by scalding water, forcing the amputation of her toes.</p>
<p>Local news in Arizona covered this story, but Health Impact News reached out to the biological mother of Devani and told her side of the story, revealing that Devani never should have been taken out of her home in the first place, where she was loved by her mother, who repeatedly tried to report the abuse she was seeing in her daughter, with no results.</p>
<p>Now, another foster child who was adopted by the Frodshams and put into their pornographic pedophile ring has turned 18 and come forward to reveal details of years of horrible torture and sexual trafficking while suing the state of Arizona for damages of $15 million. ... </p>
<p>The State and its employees ignored actual notice of the abuse of John Doe and numerous warning signs that the Frodsham home was dangerous.</p>
<p>The State did not remove John Doe until ICE, a federal agency within the Department of Homeland Security, arrested David Frodsham for operating a pornographic pedophile ring based in the home. ICE identified John Doe as a victim of Frodsham’s pedophilia.</p>
<p>John Doe suffered sexual, physical and emotional abuse for over 12 years in this home, despite numerous red flags of abuse and neglect. This abuse was no secret to CPS/DCS and well documented yet no investigations were undertaken.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that Arizona is the scummy state that said an ALLEGED human trafficking site that VOP found was a homeless site. Ed Buck also has ties to that state\'s politics in that he ran a recall campaign. Ed Buck is the dem donor that paid young men to take drugs while he filmed them. A young man named Gemmel Moore was found dead in his apartment, but no charges were filed. </p>

            The story in Medical Kidnap

           <p>
            A woman who was approved by the State of Arizona to adopt a child out of the foster care system is on trial for child abuse. Samantha Osteraas faces 2 counts of child abuse for scalding a little girl entrusted to her care, causing 3rd degree burns to almost 80% of her body, causing all 10 of her toes to be amputated, and nearly costing the child’s life.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the trial, which is expected to end this week, 7-year-old Devani took the stand and told a jury that Osteraas held her down in the bathtub with a pink towel, according to the Arizona Daily Star.
           </p>
           <p>
            She is only 7 years old, but the beautiful child known to family advocates as “the little girl in the blue dress” has been through more abuse than most of us can imagine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's hope this story makes it all over the internet and goes viral. Spread it.  What is going on in Az is going on in all states. Shameful.

             It is unthinkable that someone would do that. And to have that person be someone approved by the state to be suitable makes it worse.

             All I can think of is Nancy Schaefer and what she wanted to say. I pray that everything she found will be found out and exposed to the light of day. My fervent hope is that the public knows and believes all the horrors these children have gone through and demand everyone involved be prosecuted. And if we run out of room, we can send them down to Mexico and Honduras. Guarding these prisoners will give everybody jobs.

              I too hope things come out for the sake of Our Children and the parents that love them.  Nancy Schaeffer tried so hard to warn people but they were snuffed out.  Medical Kidnap has a piece in their sidebar about her.  This is a horrid story and I hope it will not be in vain and wake up people as to what is happening under their noses.  I think people will be shocked if they only take the time to pay attention.  I certainly hope your wish comes true.

               Yes, but The Mob has been conditioned to trust only a certain network of media outlets. They consider anything not CCN or WaPo or the NY Times untrustworthy and fake. It's what makes making inroads in changing their perspective so difficult. They haven't even read the WikiLeads email drop! Now wouldn't you think someone would read their leaders OWN WORDS before making a decision? I know I would. It's why I'm posting in #pizzagate. These emails weren't meant to be seen by anyone outside this diabolical circle of the cabal elites, but Assange screwed up that plan and, man, is he paying!
              </p>
              <p>
               Oh, and that Satanic connection? Remember I told you about that Satanist on FB causing trouble? Well, there was another one today! Someone started this entire RUMOR (because that's all it is), about Halloween and how rich people don't want poor kids in their neighborhood. I go to the profile of the idiot fueling this PROPAGANDA and sure enough, he's a Satanist. Has a Satanist pic as his header. This one:
              </p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Please note that it has COMBINED THE SATANISTS WITH THE LGBT! Yup, Satanists and gays working together to DESTROY America and instill debauchery and chaos!
              </p>
              <p>
               I probably should post about it. It'll be taken down by the wonderful mods because the Satanists working with the LGBT obvious has NOTHING to do with pizzagate (rolls eyes), but it might be worth making people aware that that part of our conspiracy theory is confirmed.

                I would try it.  I think it should be allowed because it is a new combo of the Satanic/LGBTQ push to normalize Our Children.  They want this recognized and pushed.  It is a plan to get the gay community to accept the Satanist community as accepting theirs  It is So Twisted.  But that's how they work.  This is part of the Normalization Push.  It's up to you to try it.  We need to make people aware that this is a thing.  The Normalization thing is being used right now with Transgenderism.  They are on the march and we can't let them win this war.

                  God ahead.  Because I will back it up right afterwards with another Push by the RCC to Normalize Children through their New Teachings.  This is really bad.  Letting Children read books authorized by Lambda Legal.  I am waiting or should I do mine first.

             It really has. I'm remembering all the isolated cases I heard about through the years. Oh, and Russian adoption scandal that caused Putin to end Russian adoptions. Yeah, this didn't happen  overnight.

             Is there something really much bigger that could be coming out that he wanted to avoid.  I find it very odd that he just happens to die right before this huge story.   I hope this story is not the end of it.  I am hoping for the other shoe to drop.  I also read somewhere that NoName had a liking for little Philippino Boys.  All those Islands he hit while on those navy ships..........

               Believe me, this keeps going through my mind.  He did lie in state so many people passed by him.  But they are so good at this.  The things I have read about in the last 2 years, well I put nothing past THEM.  The family did seem pretty real mourning their husband and father.  Idk, its just that darn timing.
