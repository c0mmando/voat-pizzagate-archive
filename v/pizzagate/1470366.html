            Don't feel lonely...I've got a fully developed sheep of my own too.  Makes my head spin when she asks, 'well then why isn't it on the news'? And then, 'when is it going to be on the news'?  Seriously does your head in. Poor Mum is a victim of brainwashing by the media.

            My willingness to believe law enforcement should be investigating (and I am sure some are)  is impacted by my knowledge of the worldwide Catholic Church scandals; Clinton Foundation, assessment of the MSM; self-confidence to fairly assess information and other factors. Still, a few years ago, I probably would have fallen hook, line and sinker for a MSM article shedding light on the "completely fake and insane conspiracy theory" targeting the good folks at pizza shop who have been singled out for no explicable reason.  i think it noble of you to try to share something important to you with your mother.  If you can wake her, it will be a great gift.

            You, and all of us, need to learn how to properly engage people.  You can't talk at them and present a bunch of evidence all at once.  You have to ask questions and draw them in.  Take notes from Wikileaks, notice how they released a little bit of information every day for over a month?  That's how you have to introduce information to people.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, you could say, hey, look at this email.  What do you think handkerchief means in that context?

           <p>
            You also need to make them believe that you are open to changing your mind about things.  It is also good in practice to do that in reality, too.  If they believe that you're unwilling to change her mind, they're not gonna see a point in talking to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask them for help understanding something.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all of the articles about how pizza gate is fake news, you need to present one of the mainstream media's articles to them, and openly question why they don't address the body of the evidence that you've been exposed to.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on but I'll make one final and most important point:  when you talk to someone who is denying pizza gate, ask them what evidence they have actually looked at.  Because if they have not looked at any of the evidence, it's not possible to have an informed conversation about it anyway.  Once they admit that they have not looked at any of the evidence, then you can ask, "okay, what do you think about this email? what do you think about these Instagram pictures?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't expose them to all the evidence at once.  Just bit by bit.

            You just got to know your stuff.  Slowly ask her question on if she knows all known pedophiles in our govt and pedophilia scandals that were exposed all over the world.  Bring up Jeff Epstein known for being convicted of soliciting sex from an underage girl and quietly paid settlements to scores of alleged victims who said he serially molested them.  Talk about how bill Clinton has been to his sex island around 20 times.  Bring up the Laura Silsby's case and how the Clinton's went out of there way to help get convicted child kidnappers off the hook. Tell her it was just discovered there were emails discussing this case.  We found out this from Wikileaks.  Mention this lady now works for amber alerts.   Go through a bunch of the emails and ask what the hell does this mean, explain what Cheese Pizza is a known code for on the dark web and the FBI pedophilia symbols that 2 or 3 companies connected to the clintons/podesta had these symbols and recently changed them. Show her all the IG pictures. Show her Madeline McCain connection and sketches.  There is sooooo much more but I will leave it at that.  After all the explaining ask her how are you going to tell me this isn't worth at least investigating.  If any of us in were in that situation you would be begging for someone out there to save your life.  There are too many red flags to just sweep this under the rug. The end.

            Use Andrew Breitbart's tweet about Podesta + show em Podesta's Art+ and then that lovely Instagram of Alefantis w/ taped down children and the naked dude with pizza on his privates and the the child w/ money in the mouth. For kickers use Heavy Breathings video at Comet Ping pong talking about the owner diddling a little boy in the basement. Let em' know CPP is used a hotbed for fundraising for Hillary Clinton and the connection of Podesta to Clinton.

            Let em' know about Larua Silsby, Ghisalaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein and how this pedo/trafficker trio is connected to Hillary's State Dept and Foundation.

            Ask her to explain what a "Haitian Special with extra cheese" is.......I've been trying to answer that question for the past week. No one knows. But it was posted as a comment to an Instagram post about a party at CPP. Haiti is relevant because Laura Silsby was arrested in Haiti for child trafficking and even her "lawyer" was wanted in El Salvador for the same crime. He was even jailed in VERMONT for "immigrant smuggling" which is Upper Middle Class White Limousine Liberal code for "human trafficking"......;-)

            I'm in the same boat with my brother. He refuses to give anything i send him a serious read or watch, and he in turn insults me for believing in something so ridiculous. I feel for you man it's very frustrating. Just keep in mind there's no way pizzagate won't find its way to the general public eventually at the rate it's trending and for the amount of evidence we are continuing to find.

            Nah, that girl who responded is right, I am not open minded, I am a piece of shit for having this shit pushed onto me and being forced to talk about it, then to have people suddenly get mad and yell and say things like " why are you acting this way, I don't wanna talk about this, etc" and make you out to be the bad guy, etc. I am terrified of my life, but I realize I am a piece of shit, I will not be back, sorry to bother you voat.

            Your mom might just have some really strong defense mechanisms.  I know every night before I go to bed, I log off and read something happy and convince myself all over again that it's just a ridiculous conspiracy theory, because otherwise I'd never get any sleep.   Anger can be a fear reaction.  It's possible she's trying desperately not to see, and you keep trying to force her eyes open.

            I'm sorry, but grow up and learn some interpersonal communication skills. Not everyone is going to have the mental capacity or focus on something like this. Not everyone is going to 'wake up.' You need to stop pressuring your mom. I don't even understand why this is a topic of discussion with her. Are you a teenager who lives with her and you feel the need to be right?
           </p>
           <p>
            My mom absolutely does not have the mental capacity to understand something like this. If I even slightly bring up anything controversial, she will glaze over. I drop it because it's not worth hurting myself (let alone our barely existent relationship) by getting frustrated. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, who doesn't read too much into conspiracies, will at least have a discussion with me about what's going on and at least feign interest. This is because he's intelligent and has an open mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep the discussions with people who matter and stop hurting yourself with people who will never understand.

She starts talking to me about it first, she engages me into these conversations, I will tell her I don't want to and she won't stop, and then I bring up my stuff and I am the devil, and she turns it on me, I always just agreed and ignored everything else.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no one who matters to me in my life. I am 25, i am a virgin and am likely to die a virgin, the only person who really matters to me in my life at this point is my mother.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems like everything I do in life just hurts me, it's okay. It's nice that you have a boyfriend. I don't usually ever talk about this stuff, other people (mainly my mother) brings it up then makes me out to have started it, pretends like I am being aggressive, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             I usually talk about science (biology, chemistry, geology, (I love these 3), etc), supplements (working out supplements), working out, and tv shows I like to watch: HIMYM, Simpsons, etc.

              Hello, i am a mom, and my son also lived with me until he was 28. Let me just say this.... you are in a toxic situation and the anger is coming from you both. You need to get your own place. I highly recommend that you move out and get your own life and let her live hers. Living with your parents is not healthy now that you are older. After my son moved out, we both now have a much better relationship. He now has a girl, is getting married, bought a house, got a job he loved... etc. No kid should stay home for any reason after the age of 20 because you are YOUNG and need to find your own way and likes and loves and happiness. NOW as far as Pizzagate, that is a tough one. I believe it, and as an older person, i also don't like the MSM. They have been propagandists for decades. She may never open her eyes, but you have. Take pride in that and in the fact that you can think for yourself! That is good. Also, forget being suicidal. i was too at your age because everything, even living on your own seems really hard but its NOT, its rewarding and its more fun than you can imagine. Yes there are ups and downs but that is how you learn in life to deal. Get out, Create a life for yourself. your mom will be fine and so will you!

              Take what she says with a grain of salt.  You can't let anyone's words, whether from some girl on the Internet or your mother, rattle you.  In my opinion, she was being condescending, but in the real world people are jerks.  You have to be able to deal with that.

             <p>
              Get in the habit of having self-respect.  Don't call yourself a piece of shit, and don't cower when people challenge you.  Allow yourself to be wrong.  Anyway, here's what I heard from that girl's post:

              I'm sorry you feel so down on yourself. I had a lot of self-esteem issues like that last year after quite a few events in my life snowballed. If your mother is calling you the devil, that may have something to do with it.
             </p>
             <p>
              This isn't a therapy session so I won't go too deep into things here, but I would strongly recommend if you live with her to attempt to leave that environment ASAP. It's toxic for the both of you and it will make your issues worse. (I'm saying this as someone who has had to leave toxic environments for my own mental health.) Based on your post, your mother has issues with boundaries and may have narcissistic traits.
             </p>
             <p>
              P.S. If you are suicidal, please don't. If you are able to look at things like pizzagate with an open mind and you have a love for science, you are very valuable to this world.

            If it makes you feel any better my whole family is against me on this issue. It is too mind-blowing for them to believe. It is a massive cognitive dissonance that they refuse to give into. That is why conspiracy theories are easily dismissed as crazy.

            Tried to show her the JFK video of him talking about the shadow government, she refused to believe it was real, she also refuses to watch the youtube video. The thing that gets me is the way she acts, it's almost robotic, she can talk freely, say what she wants in any manor, but if I even talk about it, I am a bad guy (She raises her voice and starts yelling and I will try to ask her "Why are you yelling?" and she will act almost psycho.) This is a consistent trend, and she also tries to push my buttons, but the things she is saying are very....deliberate, like it's not from her brain, almost like someone trying to instigate me, I believe people who are fully controlled are also used as ... honey pots, nodes of sometype, used as vessels for electronic harassment, it almost seems like someone with information on this, or understanding on how to deliberately push buttons is using these people to try to push there narrative.

            Because it is an inconvenience to come to the realization that the news system that you chose to trust to keep you informed has an agenda and it is not to perform real journalism, but to push whatever narrative that the person above them is pushing down.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the first wall, and the easiest to break down, the next would be coming to the realization that people who have made it to power positions, that you may have supported, may have been involved in crimes of humanity of the highest order. At a minimum, it sure seems like many people can be tried as traitors to the state and at most they can be tried for crimes against humanity in trafficking and murder.

            Average person wants to live in their own bubble and have convenient news to tell them what to think, which is also the most convenient thing to follow, so they don't rock the boat. You are asking them to change their world view paradigm to something that is potentially terrifying and alienating.

            Our parents grew up trusting MSM.
That's the biggest issue.
We grew up with options of where to get our news.
Many inherently trust THE MSM

             Yes and IME older folks are more ingrained in their ways.. Longer they have been doing something, and the older they are, the harder it is to change.

              Heh, depends on the person, I suppose. Most older folks have been around the block, and become conservative at some point or another due to their life experience. Conservatives just don't trust the government. I bet you that if you went to some old vets lodge and interrupted their drinking long enough to show them some of the evidence, they'd all be conspiring to blow up shit in an hour.

               While I am not that old, I would have to agree with you. Many people not just old people like your parents. Just are afraid to have their safe reality destroyed. I am sure if I spoke with your mom I could change her mind.
