            Hi Immelda,
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for your post.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to ask you to edit it and re-submit.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Clooney, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey shown in the photo, please include the names in the headline. Also, please explain in the headline
            <em>
             why
            </em>
            it is interesting that they are donating to the Florida victims, and how this is connected to Pizzgate.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the body of the post, please provide links that show that these three are 'allegedly involved in child abuse and trafficking'. It would suffice to include one link per person.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might want to go to searchvoat.co and look for older threads on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            (just type the name and pizzagate).
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, we need one link that shows how the Clinton Foundation is involved - we have discussed this here very often, but some newbies might need to update on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please link to at least one previous thread (as mentioned by you), that discussed why it is possible that the shooter could have been a MK Ultra victim, and why the incident might have been a 'false flag' operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please see Rules 1, 2, and 3 in sidebar and re-post. Thank you.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will delete it, instead of giving it a 24 hours 'Edit Warning', since headlines can't be edited.
