<ul>
<li>
Since I posted about the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) last week regarding research showing they are full of shit, I have been looking into the FMSF extensively for the first time in over 10 years.  Although some here may know or believe this, I have found <em>extremely strong ties between the C I A and the FMSF, which I will do a separate post on, if anyone is interested.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>National Center for Reason and Justice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>During this research, I have found a couple of other organizations that bear striking similarities to the False Memory Syndrome Foundation.  One is the National Center for Reason and Justice:  NCRJ.org</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I searched Voat and found very few references to NCRJ here on the PG Forum.  For starters, check out this editorial letter the National Center for Reason and Justice sent to the NY Times after NY Times published an article about the trauma of childhood abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://ncrj.org/the-ncrj-responds-to-new-york-times-article-the-price-of-a-stolen-childhood/">http://ncrj.org/the-ncrj-responds-to-new-york-times-article-the-price-of-a-stolen-childhood/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is beyond suspicious.  They are going out of their way to say that childhood sexual abuse does not really affect survivors negatively, and they talk about dissociation like it is a MYTH. They put the word in quotes!  This is incorrect, ignorant, unscientific; I could go on and on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCRJ has at least one connection, and I\'m sure many more, to FMSF, and that is Elizabeth Loftus, the psychologist who is always used to deny repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse survivors based on her incredibly shoddy and old research study which claims false memories are real.  There are extensive problems with Loftus and the views she purports.  The NCRJ\'s website also link\'s to the FMSF\'s website as seen here: <a href="https://ncrj.org/links/">https://ncrj.org/links/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I actually came across the NCRJ looking into a case similar to Larry Nassar\'s and Jerry Sandusky\'s that has received far less attention, which I can also focus on in a future post.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>National Child Abuse Defense and Resource Center</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I also came across another organization called the National Child Abuse Defense and Resource Center.   Innocent sounding name, huh?  Their website:
<a href="http://www.falseallegation.org/">http://www.falseallegation.org/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They focus on helping those who have supposedly been falsely accused of child abuse.  There is MUCH more digging to be done on that site, including a list of judges and attorneys who work with the organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I want to point out that I don\'t think false allegations NEVER happen, but I think they are very rare.  According to all the research I have seen, false allegations of both childhood sexual abuse and all allegations of rape are found to be false in about 1 to 4% of cases.  1 to 4 %.  I think false allegations are horrible, but the truth is, the number of those happening pale in comparison to the actual numbers of children being sexually abused.  Think about it.  1 to 4 % are found to be false, supposedly.  That is THE ONES THAT ARE REPORTED!  We also know that most if not nearly all childhood sexual abuse NEVER goes reported.  
</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can see from the letter that the NCRJ sent to the NY Times that there is a sinister agenda going on here.  To put it mildly, they are discrediting actual science and psychological research, stating that dissociation and repression are not real.   THAT IS A LIE.  Excuse the caps, I\'m getting worked up here due to my anger at this injustice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is an article from the Recovered Memory Project that speaks out against the NCRJ\'s letter to the NY Times, called &quot;NCRJ Reveals Itself&quot;:
<a href="https://blogs.brown.edu/recoveredmemory/2013/02/09/ncrj-reveals-itself/">https://blogs.brown.edu/recoveredmemory/2013/02/09/ncrj-reveals-itself/</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**The Leadership Council on Child Abuse and Interpersonal Violence **</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And now, an organization that seems to the doing the opposite of those above.  I haven\'t looked into it extensively, but it appears that The Leadership Council on Child Abuse and Interpersonal Violence seems to be sending the opposite message of NCRJ and FMSF.  In other words, it appears they are on OUR side.  Link:  <a href="http://www.leadershipcouncil.org/index.html">http://www.leadershipcouncil.org/index.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The website links to research showing that false allegations of childhood sexual abuse are RARE.  They also speak out against Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist who lies about her own profession\'s knowledge and research, saying repressed memories and Dissociation are not real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They also have an article titled &quot;Failing Child Sexual Abuse Victims &amp; Protecting Their Predators: Family Courts are as Guilty as Michigan State, US Olympic Officials, and Penn State,&quot; which can be found here: <a href="http://www.leadershipcouncil.org/docs/PR2018.pdf">http://www.leadershipcouncil.org/docs/PR2018.pdf</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that was my best attempt to compile and summarize what I have been looking into the past few days.  Interested in any comments/feedback anyone may have.  KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT, fellow voaters.</p>',

            Yep. Only rapists try to make up something like false memory syndrome. The effects of trauma do include things that resemble psychosis at times but it is not the victim's fault.

            Wow! I can't believe you're doing this. I've been working on this EXACT same thing for 2 months. Working on a book in fact. I've been desperately trying to find someone to collaborate with because there is just SO MUCH out there. My research started with a "where are they now" search on the McMartin children. Found an article where one of the former students apologized to Debbie Nathan, an NCRJ member. Further researched showed their FMSF connection, which shows connections to CIA, etc, etc. (

            False memory syndrome is unbelievably stupid. I doubt SIDS is real as well. Let me see, young children die for  no reason. Ah, it is Sudden infant death syndrome. Case closed. Facepalm. Just like they couldn't explain why people were being nuked, burnt to ash but the house was unaffected by fire. They called it, Spontaneous Human combution. More like, testing direct energy weapons in people they wanted to murder. "Sometimes people burst in flames from inside out", "No reason, it is a syndrome".

             Leo intervened in the Norfolk 4 Case.  All had confessed but after he doubted they were guilty they all recanted.  Gov. Kaine ended up pardoning them after having a conversation with John Grisham.  Hmm.  John Grisham made a controversial remark about sex abuse.  God the weird things I just found out.

            Freyd and his wife Pamela founded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in 1992,[3] after Freyd was accused of sexual abuse by his daughter Jennifer.[3][4] Freyd denies the accusations.[5] According to a statement made by William Freyd, his brother and Jennifer Freyd's uncle, Freyd and his wife Pamela grew up in the same household as step-siblings.[6]

            Freyd's brother added that, in his view, "The False Memory Syndrome Foundation is designed to deny a reality that Peter and Pam have spent most of their lives trying to escape," and that he was certain abuse happened to his niece.[7]    HMM.  His daughter Jennifer.

              About the same I would guess. With her husband being so deeply involved as well.  I think these people are just talking to talk.  They are surely defending their actions but I think it all started with this idea of defending their leader and his being accused by his daughter.  Fakery.  I noticed while looking into them that the last name is very similar to Freud/Freyd.  Hmm.

                Yes and What a father to have.  Drop out and a wack job.  If he abused her, he for sure has been doing it afterwards as well.  All those magic and clown shows.  Wonder if there is anything on the net about him with children.

             not quite, but interesting comparison.  FMSF claims many kids who say they've been abused are having "false memories", that it never happened... even tho the kid remembers, and there may be witnesses and evidence.

            Nice work. Would love to see what you came up with re: ties between FMSF and our favorite alpha club. I won't be suprised if Tav is tock comes up too.

            Have you read James Randi's Wiki?
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi
            </a>
            I have not even read but a few lines and I have already decided that he is a Certified QUACK!  He is a HS Drop Out, for one.  AND Read This:    Randi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours. As "The Amazing Randi" he appeared regularly on the New York-based children's television series Wonderama from 1959 to 1967.[26] He also auditioned for a revival of the 1950s children's show The Magic Clown in 1970, which showed briefly in Detroit and in Kenya, but was never picked up.[27] In the February 2, 1974, issue of the British conjuring magazine Abracadabra, Randi, defining the community of magicians, stated: "I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours." In the December 2003 issue of The Linking Ring, the monthly publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, it is stated: "Perhaps Randi's ethics are what make him Amazing" and "The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk, he walks the walk."[28]
           </p>
           <p>
            During Alice Cooper's 1973–1974 Billion Dollar Babies tour, Randi performed on stage both as a mad dentist and as Alice's executioner.[29] He also built several of the stage props, including the guillotine.[30] Shortly after that, in a 1976 performance for the Canadian TV special World of Wizards, Randi escaped from a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over Niagara Falls.[31]

           <p>
            <strong>
             Wonderama
            </strong>
            A show he appeared on who's slogan was "Kids Are People Too"

             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderama
            </a>
            Scroll way down and see the list of famous stars that appeared on the show all those years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Randi is gay and married     With a past like this he may (I said may) just be a member of NAMBLA

             Hi Carmencita - James Rani was accused and/or arrested for trying to get a teen to have sex with him. There is audio online somewhere. I forgot the story, but its shady. Someone he was involved with I think was convicted of teen sex, but I could be wrong. Forgot the story - it can be found online. It was in some MSM news , this happened in the 80's-90s.

              He is not only a KOOK..............He is a Pedophile.  This man must be exposed for what he is.  I am not a bit surprised.  All the info points to possible child sex abuse. Thank You.

            I actually came across the NCRJ looking into a case similar to Larry Nassar's and Jerry Sandusky's that has received far less attention, which I can also focus on in a future post.          If you look at the bottom of that letter you linked and click on the tiny printing in red at the bottom left hand corner up pop quite a few articles you may be interested in reading.  One of them is about a book that claims Sandusky could possibly be
            <strong>
             innocent
            </strong>
            .  Do we even want to entertain such a vile thought?  I think not.

            The False Memory people have some association with MKULTRA researchers &amp; some crossover to SRA survivor "Satanic Panic" denials, also some of their members pro-pedophilia.

             right on.  the NCRJ also has ties to the satanic panic movement and pro-pedophilia individuals/organizations.
thanks for sharing.
