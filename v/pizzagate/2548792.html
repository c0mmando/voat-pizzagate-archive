<p>Hi, Again Pizzagaters! I left off here, with the Great Beast’s confessions about being in New York City and tying this in with Greenwich Village. So below is the same link to the confession were he [1] says a little more about Greenwich Village, and [2] gets into the part of emissaries from Detroit and where he’s headed because that’s where ‘’Long Island’’ and ‘’the cannibal’ comes in.

<p>This proves he stayed at Montauk, Long Island. What does this have to do with Eyes Wide Shut? Well, because Tom Cruise was in Greenwich Village when he found out about a party that he needed a costume and mask for. It was an orgy and the mansion was located in … if you said ‘’Long Island’’, you are a winner! So am I saying where Crowley stayed is this party palace? No, the orgy party palace will be named in a bit. What I am saying is that the person that lent Crowley a tent was a self-admitted cannibal and yet another whack job. It was no accident they got together. Birds of a feather … I found the exact spot Crowley stayed from the following link. The author of the article appears besotted by the Crowley and it’s another normalization of the evils committed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any case, Crowley decided to spend some time, which he called a “magickal retirement,” in the local wilderness meditating and working on his translation and commentary for the Tao Te Ching. He had come to America in 1914, and by 1918 was low on funds. So some Hudson Valley friends — including the almost-as-notorious globetrotting journalist William Seabrook of Rhinebeck, best-remembered for giving the Western world the term “zombie” in his account of a sojourn in Haiti learning vodun practices — staked Crowley to a tent, a canoe and some cash for provisions. To their alarm, he spent the money on gallons of red paint, brushes and climbing rope, which he used to paint Thelemic slogans all over the rocky outcrops of Esopus Island.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zombie? I immediately sensed there had to be more to the story than was written so I looked up Mr. William ‘’journalist’’ Seabrook. And this is what I found: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4wbgvw/cannibals-zombies-and-hexes-on-hitler-the-life-and-times-of-william-seabrook">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4wbgvw/cannibals-zombies-and-hexes-on-hitler-the-life-and-times-of-william-seabrook</a></p>
<h1>Cannibals, Zombies, and Hexes on Hitler: The Life and Times of William Seabrook</h1>
<h1>The weirdo travel writer is making a comeback after decades out of print.</h1>
<p>Upset that the Guéré chief had kept him from partaking in ritual cannibalism and had instead served him gorilla meat, William Seabrook turned to a friend with hospital privileges in order to satisfy his intimate desire to taste human flesh. After procuring the thigh of some recent victim of a nondescript accident, Seabrook threw a dinner party just so others could observe him eating. In Jungle Ways, which purports to be Seabrook\'s true account of his travels among the various tribes of the Ivory Coast and what was then called the French Sudan, Seabrook devotes an entire section to the specifics of cooked human:
The raw meat, in appearance, was firm, slightly coarse-textured rather than smooth. In raw texture, both to the eye and to the touch, it resembled good beef. In color, however, it was slightly less red than beef. But it was redish. It was not pinkish or grayish like mutton or pork.
According to Seabrook, human flesh tastes like &quot;good, fully-developed veal,&quot; and in fact, &quot;no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal.&quot; Although only a small part of Jungle Ways, Seabrook\'s plunge into one of the world\'s greatest taboos came to define him and his career, which by that point was already strange enough. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, there you go! A nice description for us non-human-flesh eaters! Of course, he sounds like an absolutely delightful chap, but there’s something else just as interesting about him: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the war, Seabrook made a serious attempt at penning big &quot;L&quot; literature and moved in the same circles as other Greenwich Village bohemians. One such bohemian was the puppeteer Tony Sarg, who introduced Seabrook to &quot;Deborah Luris,&quot; the woman who would unlock Seabrook\'s hidden lust for bondage and sadism. But for the most part, he was rejected by the highbrow art set for being a mere reporter with a taste for niche stories about sex crimes and the supernatural. In one instance recounted in Emily Matchar\'s excellent The Zombie King, the novelist Theodore Dresier made a point of snubbing Seabrook at a party by referring to him as a &quot;yellow journalist.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there we have another Greenwich Village connection, also. But what about Somerton? The pleasure palace where the Long Island took place? I believe the palace was owned by Roy Raydin. He was mentioned in the first part of this thread. A Playboy model and actress alleged she was raped t one of his parties. It’s how the general public got introduced to his name. Here’s a bit about the incident: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/09/08/Theatrical-producer-Roy-Radin-who-was-accused-last-year/5736368769600/">https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/09/08/Theatrical-producer-Roy-Radin-who-was-accused-last-year/5736368769600/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. -- Theatrical producer Roy Radin, who was accused last year of raping actress-model Melonie Haller, is under investigation on another sex charge, it was learned Tuesday.
Sources in the Suffolk County district attorney\'s office and the county police department said a 25-year-old New York City woman signed a statement alleging that Radin forced her to commit sodomy.
The statement was given to Southhampton Village Police, who said the alleged incident occurred over the Labor Day weekend at Radin\'s 72-room mansion on Meadow Lane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we have a fluff piece by TheDailyBeast by someone who used to actively attend what he describes as ‘’BONDAGE PARTIES’’. Why TheDailyBeast would think a participant in debauchery could be objective about what happens defies logic: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-wildest-hamptons-bondage-party">https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-wildest-hamptons-bondage-party</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Pleasure &amp; Pain</h1>
<h1>The Wildest Hamptons Bondage Party</h1>
<h1>What was meant to be an exclusive, fun night of S&amp;M in 1980 turned into something much uglier and more notorious.</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Melonie Haller’s Lost Weekend,’ a piece I wrote for New York magazine in the summer of 1980, centered on a party in a Southampton beach house.
It had been on the weekend of April 11 and the goings-on had involved a dealer’s choice of drugs and the erotic games  … it was a dark story at the time but, God knows, some time after the piece was published it grew richer, stranger and much, much darker.
The host, Roy Radin, was in showbiz, His most consistent profit source was wheeling old-timey stars into benefits for local police unions, and he was clearly doing well out of it since Ocean Castle, his beach house, was posh even by Southampton standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the house has quite a history:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/Southampton/156631/Public-gets-a-peek-at-historic-Meadow-Lane-home">http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/Southampton/156631/Public-gets-a-peek-at-historic-Meadow-Lane-home</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But about Radin, here’s a blog that talks about what some allege he was really up to: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.lsb3.com/2013/03/the-ultimate-evil-revisited-by-starship.html">http://www.lsb3.com/2013/03/the-ultimate-evil-revisited-by-starship.html</a></p>
<p>Further, the three men convicted of the Lynbrook, Long Island murders were actually released from prison after DNA testing found them ‘innocent\', thus rendering the cases of the three Long Island girls as unsolved.</p>
<p>Another interesting note is that William Mentzer was convicted of the murder of Roy Radin-rumored to be the head of the Son of Sam Cult-in the Cotton Club murder of 1983. LASO detective Charles Guenther is associated with this case as well as the Tate-LaBianca cases. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Roy Radin was murdered. I had done some research on it a couple of years ago, and could swear he’d been decapitated, but all traces of that assertion have magically disappeared – as have Melonie Haller’s claims that she was being stalked, watched, and drugged after reporting the rape to the police. I will keep looking for a validating source, but until then, put it down to my conjecture if you will. As for Raydin, the only part of the severed head story that has survived is this mention of doll’s heads being severed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/theater/roy-radin-life-and-death-in-show-business-demimonde.html">https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/theater/roy-radin-life-and-death-in-show-business-demimonde.html</a></p>
<p>Shortly after Mr. Radin disappeared, Miss Jacobs also dropped from sight, but not before she put the Sherman Oaks house up for sale. Later, it was discovered that the safe in the house had been broken into and that a collection of porcelain dolls had been vandalized. Each one had had its head severed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here’s more about Radin’s murder: </p>
<p><a href="https://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=172805&amp;article_id=1489656&amp;view=articleBrowser&amp;ver=html5#">https://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=172805&amp;article_id=1489656&amp;view=articleBrowser&amp;ver=html5#</a>{%22issue_id%22:172805,%22view%22:%22articleBrowser%22,%22article_id%22:%221489656%22}</p>
<p>I’ll have to leave it here. Next stop: ever-evolving Process Church.</p>',

           Yes, the house has quite a history:

           But about Radin, here’s a blog that talks about what some allege he was really up to:

           <p>
            Further, the three men convicted of the Lynbrook, Long Island murders were actually released from prison after DNA testing found them ‘innocent', thus rendering the cases of the three Long Island girls as unsolved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another interesting note is that William Mentzer was convicted of the murder of Roy Radin-rumored to be the head of the Son of Sam Cult-in the Cotton Club murder of 1983. LASO detective Charles Guenther is associated with this case as well as the Tate-LaBianca cases.

           Yes, Roy Radin was murdered. I had done some research on it a couple of years ago, and could swear he’d been decapitated, but all traces of that assertion have magically disappeared – as have Melonie Haller’s claims that she was being stalked, watched, and drugged after reporting the rape to the police. I will keep looking for a validating source, but until then, put it down to my conjecture if you will. As for Raydin, the only part of the severed head story that has survived is this mention of doll’s heads being severed:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/theater/roy-radin-life-and-death-in-show-business-demimonde.html">
             https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/theater/roy-radin-life-and-death-in-show-business-demimonde.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortly after Mr. Radin disappeared, Miss Jacobs also dropped from sight, but not before she put the Sherman Oaks house up for sale. Later, it was discovered that the safe in the house had been broken into and that a collection of porcelain dolls had been vandalized. Each one had had its head severed.
           </p>

            I recall watching entries in Lolfieldandlove's Programmed To Kill series on YouTube regarding David 'Son of Sam' Berkowitz and the Satanic cult which he belonged to (I can't recall the exact parts).  It was alleged that Roy Radin belonged to the same coven as Berkowitz, that some of the Son of Sam murders were filmed for the viewing pleasure of the likes of Radin and that Radin was murdered by the cult for some transgression.

             Yes, this.

            <p>
             You are absolutely right. It's why Berkowitz couldn't have been working alone. Not only were the descriptions of the perpetrator all different, but there was someone allegedly filming the murders.

            It's funny how Crowley pops up in places years ahead of conspiracy legends that have yet to happen. The montauk project conspiracy is my fav conspiracy of all time cuz it's 100 mph bat shit crazy from the get go, so makes sense Crowley would be camping out there in a tent a cannibal, voodoo enthusiast lent him  60 years before the Gov and the Dracos allegedly (lol) were using traumatized telepathic kids to bend time via delta antennas at Camp Hero. (*just lol-ling at my use of "allegedly" since dracos and whatnot, not the idea of traumatized kids). Another classic of conspiracy folklore Crowley is apparently linked to years ahead of time is the original alien abduction story: Barney and Betty Hill. Check it out

             But there's no such thing as Crowley just happening to be there. I mean, this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              He had come to America in 1914, and by 1918 was low on funds. So some Hudson Valley friends — including the almost-as-notorious globetrotting journalist William Seabrook of Rhinebeck, best-remembered for giving the Western world the term “zombie” in his account of a sojourn in Haiti learning vodun practices — staked Crowley to a tent, a canoe and some cash for provisions.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Who were these friends? Did they all live in that area? Or was the meeting place in Greenwich Village?  Obviously, something was going on before his visit. This little group of crazies is put on the map by his visit ... then all hell breaks loose. It's sort of like saying The Process Church just happened to move into your neighborhood. They never ''happened'' to do anything. Everything was purposeful and planned, so if they're around the block? You'd better move! And take those kids with you.

              Yeah, if the Process Church moved into my neighborhood I wouldn't find comfort n the idea that it's just a coincidence crazy shit happens where ever they go. It's also an interesting coincidence the cult that  allegedly sacrificed german shepherds in Untermyer Park would go on to establish the Best Friends Animal Society which specializes in taking care of large, dangerous dogs like Mike Vicks pit bulls. I actually did a tour of their compound in Kanab a few years back. They put up a nice and friendly front, and they are really the one shelter and organization set up to deal with these types of animals, but they sure didn't like talking about their organizations colorful, for lack of better word, fucked-up might be better, history.

               This. This just reminded me of a piece of research I dug up and pray I saved because it was so strange and I'll never find it again. Concerned the Process Church and their keeping German Shepherds. It would fit since their insignia is that of the Nazis. Yes, Nazis are in the mix of things, but not surprising that Satanists would ultimately worship one another and the evil they carried out. I had a theory as to what Hitler was really doing, but never put it down in print before. It sort of makes sense logically -- even though, if true, it would be batshit crazy.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm gearing up to write about the Process Church. So many great articles about them. It's going to be a bear to hone it down and pick out the most pertinent parts.

                GL, they are indeed a trip. Lost many hours, days, years down that rabbit hole, a rabbit hole that will make you paranoid of every movement since their ideology is about playing both or all sides evil/good and/or other (hence the swastika symbolism) to reach some grand societal transformation, aka "going clear" like Scientology or the theosophist's or  great white brotherhood's or Nazi's or whomever's  new world order.

                 Yes. ''Obsession'' might be all these factions are proving. That people can fixate on something so long they think it's the end all answer when clearly it isn't. But it does wreak havoc which causes other pain. I liken it to someone getting involved with drugs. Drugs are an intermittent way of blotting things out -- the same as with sleep. And all they really do is mess you up to the point that others have to clean up your shit because you're too wasted to care because all you want are -- drugs.

            Greenwich Village in NYC reeks of symbolism from the art to certain buildings.  666 Greenwich is the most populated highrise in the area, a 1 minute walk to the Spotted Pig, which was revealed last year to have had a Rape Room upstairs.  A block from there in a Photography/ Design Shop who’s window currently displays White Horses galloping in a huge frame.  This is 2 doors down from a Public School.  The next st, Christopher St. is lined with lingerie shops, sex shops, gay bars, a theatre, and various restaurants.  Equinox Printing House is a couple of blocks south of there.  EQUINOX.  A company whose marketing speaks for itself.  That location neighbors Mainstream Radio and Production companies like Viacom, Hot 97, and GETTY IMAGES.

           <p>
            Didnt’t Weistein also have an apartment there?
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s a church on Carmine and Bleecker with windows coming from the basement.  Twice walking by on late nights i’ve heard kids crying or screaming from the lower levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doors on carmine st show that there is an obvious underground space in the area - but this is not unique to nyc.

             Yes, even though times have changed, that insular, hidden feature is still present in that section of town. It's almost like a black cloak is thrown over the neighborhood and keeps secrets hidden and away from prying eyes that don't belong and, therefore, aren't allowed to see. Then every once and a while, a sound like you describe drifts out giving a hint of what horrors await in the abyss. Those children's cries are both a beacon and a warning to stay away, but this time, we will not do as bidden.
            </p>
            <p>
             EQUINOX ... yes, wonder how they got that name. Another inside joke for those in the know. And if Weinstein didn't have an apartment there, you just know he was frequenting one of those shadowy establishments to do God knows what to God knows who. There is also the references in Eyes Wide Shut to a building with an arched window. If you look on the map I included for where Crowley resided, you'll notice an arched square called out by Google maps. Coincidence? I think not. Kubrick really was intimately involved in all the fraternal hijinks that go on and 1999 was the time to let us in on the joke.

             Hey, thanks for this!
            </p>
            <p>
             Watched a little, but will watch the entirety. Mind control techniques will be covered next. Found some extremely interesting things!
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks, again.
