            I've had a read. I'm a beauty therapist so feel the opposite of disgusted .. more intrueged haha. But looking from online results it seems a huge issue for many so it's beggers belief they are using it against them. And helpless children who would probably struggle to explain their feelings about it.

            Fuck. Okay. Lots of things here. God I just want to smash these people. Unfortunately I will probably never see any of them....anyway...  I'm sure marvel disney etc are in on it. They've either been hi-jacked or always were Mk ultra related.. I'm leaning towards the latter. Esepcially the new marvel stuff from 2000 and onward. When something is marketed so massively it is usually hijacked. Anyway here is my thoughts on the mind control and how it mixes in with pedo:
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's my theory: Growing up the adults around you are the heros... you invest your consciousness in real people...Tv mind control... you see the traits you have been mk ultra'd into seeing invested into fictional super heros etc.... The Assholes doing this to people are getting you to trust an image of a make believe character.. as if they are real. THINK ABOUT IT.... a kid blindly trusts these fucking tv characters as if they are a real entity. And the adults are so fucking dumb.. for example say a man in a spiderman costume is walking down the street.. the kids will be like oh its spiderman look! and instantly trust the stranger hiding behind one of these make belive mk ultra characters. And the dumb parents believe it all too. Oh god.... so fucked up.. They hide their intentions behind innocence and use these make belive characters through marvel and disney to manipulate and mind control your kids into trusting an image that now anyone can portray. " Oh that's just spiderman.." Or ". oh that's just elsa" Says the average dumbed down fucktard parent..... Yeah right... Then they use the characters to push whatever propaganda or agenda they want through cartoons.... so fucked up.

            I don't know much about this, but the bot thing is definitely going on with the comments etc. as proof. The video I clicked on is monetized so if these people have discovered a bot to create more views, don't they make money off of them (like lots of $$)?  another possibility is that maybe these videos are made to pedos that are looking for more?  Ed from the Outerlight shows that the content repeats a lot in each video--what if these are codes for people to use to unlock "kiddie porn" on the dark web? sooo weird, either way. Could be MK Ultra like programming for kids, but I think it is more pedophile and money related...

            I've been taking a look at reddit and /pol this morning. Apparently /pol getting shut down on any mention and reddit has some but still can't shut down reddit since they shut down the orig sub and we all moved here. There seems to be rising momentum though.

             The best subverse to bring this to would be The Donald. Full of people sympathetic to our cause (hate globalists, hate satanists, hate pedophiles, strong desire for justice).

             All other subverses can't be trusted except maybe conspiracy.

             See- this is a great example. The colors. The rhythmic/synchronized movements. And it's so f'ed up and follows the same outline as the others, but each manages to be even a little more disturbing.

            Has anyone started researching the comment sections of these videos? Perhaps the Elsa videos are a front for pedos to connect with each other and with children who they know are being .groomed mentally.

            This shows a baby being attacked by a big (fake spider) and then wrapped in plastic and drug off the bed! Then the mother is attacked the same way and is being drug down the hall crying out for her baby that was gone when she woke up.

             yes, whatever is being dealt with here is well funded even though the production level looks basic. And that they're using real kids. The sheer number of these - plus the theme consistency - hiding in plain sight.
            </p>
            <p>
             Okay and look at this one. THis baby keeps being dropped and kicked  - i just cant wrap my head around this. And the outdoor scenes are British. I think we might find leads in trying to figure out where this crap is being filmed in the UK.

              My gosh. That's sick. Those poor kids. It's hard for me to understand when these kids look so healthy and happy. She's well fed. She has cute clothes. So she's obviously cared for. But then, she's being used to make videos like this!
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder if these are mainly made for sick adults that get off watching it. Or, if parents are really that sick to allow their kids to watch things like this. With all these views, you'd think this kind of crap would have been all over the news. It's just so sad.

            This is a thought a friend had. Just tossing this out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a high chance that these are being churned out in a warehouse basement in India, China, NK, any number of island nations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Poor command of English. The literal Noah's Flood of material being posted. That however doesn't explain the live action ones using what sounds like American actors most of the time though.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the view counts. They use in-house bots to run the number up until it is self-sustaining. Is Google paying out for these? The amount of revenue generated must be enormous. Google has noticed these. Did google give them Play Buttons too? Lol.
           </p>
           <p>
            They use proprietary material openly hundreds of thousands of times. The owners of ATT, Peppa the Pig, Disney, et al, MUST be aware of this and either cannot or will not DMCA the channels. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Out of jurisdiction? Are those companies cooperative with the channel owners? Does Google find value (monetary? other?) in these channels and persuaded those companies to not make a claim?
           </p>
           <p>
            That I think is the weirdest part. Google knows. Disney and Marvel know. There is a MASSIVE amount of money involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I could see some Indian engineer plugging away at his quota getting bored and doing weird shit just to see what he can get away with. But that doesn't jive with the repetitive nature, the patterns, of the subject matter. Maybe a boss comes down and says "Be Edgier" once a week.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe CIA black budget funding. These vids are not illegal like guns or drugs, they can operate in foreign countries, and this would allow individual CIA asset networks to self-fund, with no ties back to the agency. Would also explain why there are no DMCAs and no questions from Google.
           </p>
           <p>
            If not CIA perhaps another, or several, other agencies, US based or not. But if not CIA, where are the American actors coming from?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that Marvel and Google need to be pressured to explain. Pressured hard.

              That's why I didn't say Disney should be pressured. It would be fruitless. However, other companies might be effective avenues of inquiry.

            Good theory. And thanks to "Smart" technology, particularly TVs, and the NSA's publicly available rootkit software, almost anyone can hack into people's homes and watch what they're doing. The fact that this was made known to people and relatively few objected, it truly broke my heart.

            Thank you. I just discovered Svali yesterday and plan to find more from him/her. Elisa E. is amazing for her courage and honesty about how she's still in recovery. The more I learn the more I see around me as part of all this and how it's been going on my entire lifetime and obviously before that. I keep waking up in new ways.

            To be honest a lot of the "normal" kids tv shows, cartoons, Disney etc are just as bad as these although not quite as obvious.
Anyone who puts their kids in front of "normal" daytime childrens programming (tv "programs" so apt) are exposing their children to this kind of stuff. And the same goes for all the Children's movies like Dispicable me and Inside out, and all the others.

            View counts could be explained if lets say, an agancy had a computer with monitor that played these videos on loop constantly. Are people being forced to watch those views over and over? Brainwashing?

            Why isn't Disney/Marvel suing over this? They don't hesitate to threaten others who infringe. According to TMZ, they're threatening to sue the producer of a Venezuelan knock-off involving Elsa and other characters:

            Is it ultimately Disney/Marvel who is targeting kids with these videos?  In league with the CIA?

             Disney has a long history of using and contributing to mind control over children. "Mr. Disney" himself was a pedo. Disney-- butterflies, predictive programming, MKULTRA, it goes on and on.

            Has YouTube made any kind of formal response on Elsagate yet? I mean what kind of reasonable explanation can be given for this, especially the high volume of views? We need to target national parents' associations and show them this stuff. Not exclusive to US either, these videos are being watched by unsuspecting children the world over

             Not that I've seen - and that's a great idea - crazy part is - if you start looking these things are being released daily - just search with a slight variation - and some in a days time will have 100k views. What would drive traffic to these vids with this volume? I mean a crack team of marketers would have a hard time driving this much traffic. Either there are way more pedos than originally thought - or I just don't get it. I just don't. The view numbers don't make sense.

             I can't watch this stuff. Sorry. But I have been looking at search results and channels for information. One recurring theme I saw over and over again was "good baby" or bad mommy or bad baby or some variation. Searching "bad mommy good baby game" pulls up a lot of videos that look really messed up.
            </p>

             Has any MSM reported on this story?!??? It's huge. I haven't paid attention to the tosh.0 stuff. Is it redpilling people?

            Ok now it hit the pedo indoctrination shit. If you youtube search "colorful club" it returns pedo normilization and bdsm themes of punishment, peeping toms - baby cutting the baby off a girls bikini with scissors etc etc etc- all in cartoons - dude - no sleep tonight.

            I'm going to repeat what I wrote on this earlier post:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1963711">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1963711

            because you point out many MKULTRA and other mind control program techniques, including the use of color, in those videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think these YouTube "cartoons" are not simply about pizzagate indoctrination-- which would be bad enough-- I think they are far darker, and represent many, many threats to our future survival as humans in human form. "Elsagate" may be the latest incarnation of a previous program developed and run by the CIA with a similar name-- ELISA, which was an offshoot of their MKULTRA program.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Robert Duncan's book "The Matrix Deciphered":
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ELISA was an artificial intelligence computer program that the Stanford Research Institute demonstrated back in the 70's. It acted like a psychologist and asked stupid questions and responded to answers, parsing, and understanding sentences. This field is called natural language processing... Fast forward 35 years and instead of parsing natural language phrases from keystrokes, ELISA recognizes phonetic brainwaves and parses them into words and sentences for artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing. Now the tortures and menticizations can scale to entire populations through this automation...
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Neuro-linguistic programming (different but related to natural language processing) was developed by the US Army and can be used to actually kill people. As explained by MKULTRA survivor Elisa E. in book 2 of "Our Life Beyond MKULTRA," the ELISA program (which unfortunately shares her name) is "psychic driving software, an automated computer form of a real human being speaking... (It's) a continuously repeated audio message on a looped tape to alter behavior. Invented through torture by CIA 'spychiatrist' Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron as part of MKULTRA."
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, she writes:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...the psychic driving for (total mind control) programming is no longer necessary in person. Remote processing suffices, once a person's brainwave frequencies can be sufficiently tracked by AI. There will always be high-level slaves designed by multi-agency organizations, but now the average citizen is also a potential victim.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And what better victims than young children whose minds are much more easily manipulated and formed like clay? After all, the malevolent forces prefer their victims to be as young as possible. These YouTube cartoons may be not only attempting to normalize pedophilia in the minds of young victims (and their apathetic parents), but also enslave the future generation for absolute control and further accelerate the human race's transition to transhumanism. And all done remotely thanks to the Internet, YouTube, and the willingness gratefulness of parents who allow this tech to babysit their children.

             We are viewing this all from the wrong perspective (much as we view Egypt as being intellectually and electronically superior to us so we can't figure it all out when in fact the opposite is true). These guys are psychopaths with a dark agenda that us innocent kind caring souls can't see. It seems that they point in the path of normalising child factories for these guys. A production like for fresh pineal glands. But I know how crazy that sounds.
            </p>
            <p>
             Food for thought .. these guys have suppressed information about energies, vibrations etc. All of their voodoo crap must have purpose. We need to move into a spiritual direction and the population must be at the numbers we are now .. hence them trying to cull us through wars.

              I'll bet the house they have operatives moving into the so called "awakening" communitybtons are people off. Similar to the ops ran in the 60s 70s to stop the hippie movement.  These controllers are so damn predictable and ritualistic I wish people would see before hand. Same shit different asshole. They hate creativity and chaos because they can't control shit. Hence the censoring of YouTube and Reddit.

              Yes, exactly. Violence isn't the solution because there are so many of them and we don't even know who they all are-- it's not just the elites-- it's also all the Joe Schmoes infected with darkness/demons/call it whatever you want. But when, and I say when, we raise our collective vibrational frequency high enough, the dark and evil ones cannot survive, much like fish out of water. And that's how we'll destroy them and make our own lives peaceful and loving. But to get to where we need to be, and we are running out of time, we need to be united, not divided. The dark forces have done a helluva job dividing the rest of us into "us" versus "them" and fighting amongst ourselves. This is rampant, even here on this sub.

               Yes exactly. More and more people are moving into meditation and yoga. I'm feeling positive we can still do this in time. The best they can do is keep telling us it's hopeless and we are the few through the MSM but again more and more are becoming aware of that too.

               Violence isn't the solution, but the DS has already shown their willingness to employ it.  This war will not be won without violence.  Unfortunately, the bulk of it will be the DS directed at citizens - cop shootings, false flags, immigrant terror, MS-13, child trafficking, etc. - all forms of violence levied upon us Americans.

                The Deep State are very willing to do so because it equals more money for them and a constant supply of organs.

                People need to wake up to the fact that ISIS is CIA created. The rest of all these middle eastern countries that are trying to hurt the west is because as they see it we keep bombing the shit out of their countries and killing their children to steal the oil and put in place banking systems. We would retaliate in the same way.

             Exactly, they've figured out how to MK kids without all the messy kidnap and torture. Plant the images in the minds as children the trigger at later dates with new "pop" culture themes. Also these digital screens have a frequency that lower the brain into hypnotic state.

                Don't get me wrong....when I was 16, if I had access to what kids do I now, I probably would never have left home.  There are a reason so many of them are single and still at home with Mommy and Daddy.

             Precisely said - and to add to that because I've seen a few of these now -they have rhythmic movements with color sequences in MANY of them. Many include the stupid syringe filled with different colors, but there are color patterns and synchronized movements.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each of them also include a canned kid cartoon sounding laugh track so that if the parent walked by and seeing it out of the corner of their eye they're just seeing bright colors and cartoon sounds and move along never knowing this shit is what's on. Some even look benign and don't get into the syringe stuff until several minutes in - as to veil it - just enough before unleashing it.

            Weirdest part of this is the view counts. How in the hell are this many people watching this many channels? Whats with the either nonsense or cryptic  comments? Makes an anon wonder if there's really that many people into this crap or if its some elaborate fake acct/view scheme or if theres some mk hypno effect going on with all the pattern repition.

             I have to think that many of them are replays. Think about how many times the average young child has watched their favorite DVD over and over. And over and...

             I think the view counts are being manipulated so they play in the recommended stream for when the parents walk away after putting on a sensible video.

             Yeah, couldn't agree more. I could see a million views, but a lot of these vids have 20/50/100/200+ MILLION views - I just don't understand. Tip of the iceberg.

              Easy.  Parents sit their kids in front of the computer to watch kids cartoons and after a while, the auto play next feature comes across some of these and plays them without the parents being around to monitor what the kids are watching.

            Okay, well shit - here is a PIZZA one and not a cartoon - had to figure it would come up soon enough and be scary af. A Grinch comes to the window of a girl eating an ice cream and reaches like he's going to snatch her....she turns and he ducks and then leaves and the Grinch comes in looking for her. And it's Christmas and instead of leaving out cookies for Santa they appear to have left a pizza which he eats before hunting for her again. Need eyes on this shit bro,

              Kids are watching these .. video after video after video .. while their parents are off doing god knows what.
             </p>
             <p>
              About 20 seconds of this my children have seen and haven't been allowed to watch YT since. I was doing housework and 20 seconds was enough to send chills down my spine and know something instantly was up.  All my family had videos forwarded to them and a clear instruction for them to ban my children watching YT at their houses also and an explanation of MKUltra. I don't care how crazy I seem to anyone .. my children (and others) are too important for that.

              I know bro - I hesitated, but we have to know what we're up against. Just came across another with these two kids being thrown from off camera what looked like a GIGANTIC like 3 foot edible gummy worm, baseball bat thick.  and they both ate off each side obviously looking like something - dude this is just so fucked up - we have to get in the middle of this and all sort this out.

            I feel like a lot of these themes are used to brainwash children into seeing this as acceptable behavior. Mk ultra programming shit. I also think certain videos that involve children may be previews of actual porn and you contact the channel maker to get the real version after seeing this promo.

             That's exactly what it is - normalization of unacceptable behaviors, reinforced by MKU color/flicker/subliminal programming.

             Wow this might be a brilliant insight.  Do a video of child sex abuse then do a different video all weird and shit but to give people an idea of what they can order.  Like eating shit.  Like sneaking in a house.  That kind of stuff.

            Spiders are often associated with black magic and satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Webs of deception, ensnaring the unsuspecting. Also, the use of crawlers is also to create intense terror in victims of SRA. Satanists get off on people's fear. Something about some gland in the brain which they allegedly like to consume.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some SRA rituals involve the illusion of giving birth to creepy crawlers like spiders and worms. Designed to inflict a sense of self loathing on the victim to prevent them from reaching out for help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah, I've had to obtain some level of understanding of the occult in order to better understand these sick bastards so as to oppose them.

             Crazy as it sounds, a human woman can give birth to a 4th dimensional demon. Several SRA survivors have talked about this. I think one of their goals is to normalize this process, so, teach 'em young. Absolutely evil in every way, shape, and form.

             Not only from eating the gland but also fear gives off a distinct vibration .. as does sadness. I think they feed off that also.

            Here's a video explaining how these videos evolved.

            lotsa of cursing.

           <p>
            Here's an even earlier one about how these guys who used to prank video started doing spideman and elsa.    I assume they got the idea from someone else though.

               Already resorting to the ad hoc and personal attack. Looks like your argument never had value to begin with, thus this lead is indeed a good one.
              </p>
              <p>
               You're not welcome here shill (not personal attack because you've been detected and identified as one). Go do something that actually contributes something of value to society. Hint: shilling isn't of actual value to society.

                crazy toy channels aimed at kids have apparently been a thing for years and the first Spiderman and Else video seems to be from 2014.

             Thanks and ya, absolutely. It just reminds me of the coffin makers in portland and all the spider imagery that they had and kids being covered in spiders and roaches and other bugs and seeing all the same shit here...in 'children's' youtube vids - with tons of vids and the majority in the millions of views, each.

              I think the spider/roaches/snake thing is about fear. Built in fear. We are born scared of these things and they learnt through MKUltra about the monarch butterfly .. everything that happened to our ancestors is inbuilt into our DNA.

             I have mentioned previous PINK FONG popped up around Pizzagate and Elsa videos. Sounds like PING PONG .. seem like innocent nursery rhymes but something just seems a miss with me and can't explain it.

             Yeah, there's a bunch of them all seemingly linked - a couple of dozen so far - they all interlink among themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             And this makes my stomach turn - many of the vids you see have a recurring crying child baby in the cartoon or stop animation - and they label many of the vids under "Bad Baby"  and there are million of these fucking vids all revolving around the same core themes - and many monetized...just my head is spinning tonight - I think in the same way that we had keywords of pizza and dominos and pasta and all that at the start - we have a number of themes and things we can hunt for now, and have eyes open to see.
