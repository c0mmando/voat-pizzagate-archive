           <p>
            Weeks ago, Spokane’s top Catholic official quietly suspended a credibly accused predator priest. But Bishop Blasé Cupich notified only his flock, not the public. He refused to disclose when the allegations surfaced. He urged other victims to call church officials, not secular authorities. And he made no mention of possible criminal prosecution or of the need for Catholics and citizens to share what they know about the priest with law enforcement. This is disturbing and reckless.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though Fr. Daniel Wetzler’s suspension took effect on Oct. 1, no word of it was circulated, apparently, until Oct. 16 when a notice was printed on page eight of the Spokane diocesan newspaper, the Inland Register. Nothing was said about helping police and prosecutors build a criminal case against Fr. Wetzler.
           </p>
           <p>
            As best we can tell, Cupich did not hold a news conference or issue a news release about the accusations. He didn’t say when the victim reported the abuse, which is an important fact. (Did it take months or years for Cupich to act?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Only yesterday did the public learn about the credible child sex accusations through a small article in the Spokesman-Review, a secular daily newspaper.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is wrong. Child sex accusations should be made publicly as broadly and quickly as possible. Otherwise, like child molesters are given more chances to intimidate victims, threaten witnesses, discredit whistleblowers, destroy evidence, fabricate alibis and even flee the country.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            There are 6.9 million people in Washington. Cupich’s diocese is the nation’s 134th in size, claiming to have 722,000 members. So Cupich deliberately chose to notify, on page eight of his newspaper, a very small percentage of those who should have been told of the credible allegations against Fr. Wetzler.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most abuse victims leave the church. So do many who saw or suspected predator priest’s crimes. Most police and prosecutors don’t read their local diocesan paper. Cupich is a smart man. He knows all this. He understands that a small acknowledgement in his diocesan paper will likely go unnoticed by those who need most to see it. So he’s acting like Catholic bishops have acted for decades in clergy sex cases: by doing the absolute bare minimum.
           </p>
           <p>
            And of course, many child molesting clerics sexually violate kids they know outside of their parishes – kids who live in the neighborhood, deliver the daily newspaper, mow the parish lawn or whatever. That’s another reason that all parents, not just Catholic parents who subscribe to their diocesan newspaper, deserve and need to know when a priest is so dangerous he’s being ousted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let us say now what Cupich should have said – widely and clearly – weeks or even months ago: If you saw, suspected or suffered clergy sex crimes by Fr. Wetzler, you have a moral and civic duty to call the independent, experienced professionals in law enforcement so that kids might be protected, Fr. Wetzler might be prosecuted and the church itself be more healthy and safe.  You may think that by keeping quiet, you’re helping your parish, diocese or faith. But you are doing just the reverse. So please, find the courage to break your silence, safeguard innocent kids, and prevent future crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the message that Cupich should be spreading far and wide and immediately.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we said about Cupich on Sept. 20 bears repeating now:
           </p>
           <p>
            At least 39 SPOKANE PRIESTS  have been publicly accused of child sexual abuse. That's a very high number for a relatively small diocese. Cupich should explain, in detail, what he has done that goes “above and beyond” the bare minimum of paying settlements and suspending predators.
           </p>
           <p>
            – He and his top aides in Spokane acknowledge that 27 OF THESE 39 CLERICS HAVE MOLESTED CHILDREN . He should explain that discrepancy.
           </p>
           <p>
            – He should tell parishioners and the public precisely what he has done to warn parents about and protect kids from Patrick G. O'Connell, the most prolific and notorious child molesting cleric in the Northwest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Continue reading for Cupich's past record.  It's not pretty.  He should be questioned about HIS cover ups.  Is this why he kept being kicked upstairs?

            True degeneracy always exposes itself in the actual words that come out of their mouths. It's the kind of thing that you have to reread to comprehend that a human being would actually say those words in that situation.  It leaves me speechless. There aren't enough vulgar words in the English Language to adequately express the disgust and revulsion that it brings on. All i can do is just look at the words with an icy stare, and wish i could be giving that icy stare eye to eye with the sicko that could allow those words to come out of his or her mouth.

            Not just covering it it up, the Pope does it - child trafficking, rapes, torture, adrenochrome blood harvesting, child sacrifice and eating children. Pedophile and pedovore. That is what the business of the Roman Catholic Church really is - it serves and worships satan while pretending to be Christian and worshipping/service the Lord Jesus Christ, the living God. Full truth coming out soon. This Pope, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip have already been found guilty by the International Courts - dig online to find it for yourself. Evil !!!!

            Hi guys!! I've been a lurker here for 3+yrs, since the break of PG. Some random person on Twitter sent me the link here when the whole thing broke. I've known about a lot of this fuckery since the 90's but started following heavily ironically about 1yr before PG broke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyhow, u all are amazing &amp; your work here is brave and admirable! I've never posted here mostly out of fear due to hearing rumors of having to use TOR to block myself so I'm not "found" &amp; never knew how to do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a lot of time on my hands, &amp; I know u dont know me, but I'm one hell of a researcher. If u all ever need any help or if someone could direct me where to be of help, I would be honored to do what I can. I'm not a LARP or a shill. Just someone who is passionate about this evil filth that has been exposed &amp; saving these children &amp; bringing these scum to justice!!
           </p>
           <p>
            The Pope is pure filth &amp; I pray God tips apart this system of satanic sodomy &amp; corruption &amp; brings them all to their knees. Off with their heads I say!
           </p>
           <p>
            God bless u all! 
Thanks for listening!!
🙏🏼😘

             Glad to have you here, Nina.  We need all the help we can get.  Besides digging up info for new posts, your help in expanding on research posted by others will be very useful.  The main thing is to document everything and archive whenever possible.

             Welcome aboard,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/NinaSparrow">

             . Just start digging on any topic that interests you. Voat does not dox, but we do have a lot of shitheads paid to be here by our enemies who try to fuck with users and lead people on wild goose chases. Just make sure you never accidentally dox yourself speaking with people here, and be wary of anyone who wants to get info out of you via direct messages.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you want to see all those posts that have been made on a key word, go to
             <a href="https://SearchVoat.co">
              https://SearchVoat.co
             </a>
             , click options, and fill in the fields to limit your search parameters to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             and whatever key word you're interested in. Click the little box for "search post body" as well, so it doesn't just search headlines. Titles are often inadequate here. That search will pull up everything, including mod-deleted threads. It does not crawl user Comments in threads, unfortunately.
            </p>
            <p>
             Google sometimes censors our search results, but you can sometimes find good stuff with it.
