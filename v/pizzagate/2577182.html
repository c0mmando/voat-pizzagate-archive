            I don't know, I really don't understand much of the tech stuff and don't have children here but it says in the article that there are all kinds of ways they provide for parents to block stuff for their kids.  So what is the problem?  Can't parents just block all this stuff?  Also I don't understand why any game maker is even allowed to insert this garbage into a Child's Game.  Somehow this should be unavailable or something should be done. I am the first to stand up for Free Speech but NOT at the cost of perverted sex for children.  Enough Already.

            i love how she blames the makers of the game. as a software developer the only reason i havent created some form of social media is specifically because i dont know how to manage all the pedophiles and porn. its not really that easy. sure its easy enough when a parent sees it and reports it. but even then you will get kids who discover they can use that to get  people banned from the game and you will get false reports. its HARD to prevent sick pedophile fucks from using your platform for their sick pedo shit. shit is disgusting, but i dont see how roblox is supposed to prevent sickos from using their stuff.

             It's easy to create a Regex - regular expression - to replace any suggestive words displayed with #### or whatever. There may be some false negatives but it keeps the pedos out so worth doing and not difficult. A site I helped make used this and banned users for 24 hours if they did type a banned word ie 'sex' a false positive is if a kid meant to type 'sux' and it was a typo and they got banned but regardless the word sex wouldn't appear if you use regex. Basic stuff for programmers!

              have you ever played that shitty penguine game? there are a lot of hangups that come with that kind of shit. and ive never wanted to make some ultra safe child level shit where it would be okay to just censor any and all bad words. im talking about making a social media site. you cant just ban bad words. that only works for things that explicitly cater to very young children. the inabaility to say damn or friggin is very discouraging to everyone above 5 years old. and if it was that easy for you to do it was probably done like shit and had constant false positives and was massively discouraging to users.

               Yeh club penguin? It was aimed at under 12s so it kinda worked, they censored everything but it was appropiate fro the age range (my kids played it at age 5) problem Roblox have is its aimed at 12+ so you will have tweens who want to experiment with the naughty words and then that attracts pedos! And yeh lol the project I helped on wasn't very good, the bans put users off and they could still get round words by replacing letters or using spaces if they wanted but mods were in place which was fine for a small scale project. I still think roblox shouldnt allow the characters to be in those positions though. Did you see what happened with Habbo Hotel? It became a Pedo haven...

                i did see some kind of possibly humping motion at one point which seems like it shouldnt exist. but if you give players the ability to crouch they will tea bag each other. thats just the way it goes lol.

              parents are the only true defense. software companies can try and try but pedos will find a new code, a new way to interact, always. only parents properly educating their kids can protect their kids in the digital age.
             </p>
             <p>
              not that i dont advocate the persuit of and execution of pedophiles anywhere they pop up. i do. kill those child fucking freaks. kill every single one.

            I don't envy parents who aren't significantly technology literate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless of what you think about kids on computers, the fact remains that their knowledge of how to use a computer is going to be a major part of their future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having grown up with unsupervised computer access during the wild west of the early 90s to mid 2000s, I know good and well the potentials for harm and benefit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't take a strict oversite role with my kids on the computer. I feel like doing so would make them naive and succeptable to things like this. I ease them into various things they are allowed to do depending on their maturity level, and keep an eye on what they are doing in a passive manner. When I find something questionable, or at this point mostly hear something questionable, we have a talk about what to do about it.

            These look like sexual positions which the game developers must have programmed into the game, or at least allowed for them to be possible. It would be quite easy to programme the game so that these positions couldn't be played out and to block any words related to sex etc. I called out PopJam (instgram for kids) about similar concerns a few years ago, as they claimed kids not upload images of themselves but they could. They replied to my email and blamed this on technology not being advanced enough to catch all images however their parental advice in their website was very misleading as it clearly stated kids could not upload images when they very clearly could.
