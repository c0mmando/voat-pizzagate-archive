<p>There was a gay pride festival in a town in Texas.  However they just called it a Pride Festival.  What caught my attention about this story is that it talks about how <strong>family friendly</strong> the festival is.  They emphasize they have a lot of events for kids.  Creepy! They played down the &quot;gay&quot; part and made it sound like  just another fun family thing to do to do on a Saturday afternoon.  And kids under 10 are free.  That almost sounds like they are encouraging people to bring their kids which is all the more creepy.   Here is a blurb from the event ad:  <a href="http://www.visitplano.com/event/north-texas-pride-festival/">http://www.visitplano.com/event/north-texas-pride-festival/</a></p>
<p>Check out the “Come as You Are” 7th Annual North Texas Pride Festival, hosted by the North Texas Pride Foundation. **The festival is family oriented **and will include <strong>many children’s activities</strong> during the from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Guests of all ages can enjoy music, live performances, giveaways, food and beverages, and more. The entertainment will continue until 9:00 pm with drink specials, music, and dancing.  Adult admission $10.  <strong>Kids under 10 are free.</strong>

<p>I noticed that one of their sponsors is a non-profit called Jonathan\'s Place: <a href="https://www.jpkids.org/">https://www.jpkids.org/</a>
It\'s a shelter for abused children and they provide foster care and foster to adopt services.  I don\'t know anything about this group but it did make me wonder if they were legit.  I mean seriously, why is a shelter sponsoring a celebration of adult deviancy?  Personally, I do not care what people do behind closed doors but when you start trying to normalize certain behavior to children under 10, it sounds like grooming to me.  And on top of that, the shelter for kids seems like they are aiding and abetting the grooming, that smells to high heaven.

            Thanks for checking out their FB page.  I didn't think to look there.  I think what was bugging me had more to do with the gay pride FB page and their ad for the event.  It sounded like this event was geared toward accommodating children which in my opinion is totally inappropriate. Let kids have their innocence.  Jonathan's Place financial support of this event sends mixed signals.

            I wonder if it's too late to give Texas back to Mexico.  The shit that state has been pulling since Nov. 22, 1963 makes me want to nuke it out of existence.
