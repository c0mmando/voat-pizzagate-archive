<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10052">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10052</a></p>
<p>And in the comments I notice this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/MichaelLeroygi2/status/814740893563355136">https://mobile.twitter.com/MichaelLeroygi2/status/814740893563355136</a></p>
<p>which draws attention to the remark about &quot;Come to Rima&quot; in the Podesta email that says </p>
<p>&quot;sending-pining-wishes-you-could-come to Rima, John P,and Laurie, and Chris&quot;</p>
<p>I\'ve never heard of Rima so I decided to look into it.  Turns out Rima is in Burkina Faso which is a landlocked nation in Western Africa.  Rima is roughly in the center of the country from what I can gather.  Burkina Faso looks to me like it could be a key destination as a crossroads for contraband and human trafficking for any destination in Europe or the Middle East.  I really don\'t know very much about Africa but I do know the US Military Socom has had an enormous presence in Africa (I think it\'s called AFRICOM ) and of course Nigeria which does not border Burkina Faso but is not that far a way is also the home of Boko Haram which is basically ISIS with darker skin and in a jungle instead of desert.  I also know that the domain of Boko Haram is the northern part of Nigeria and that typically these warlord child soldier armies aren\'t typically very confined by loosely regulated national borders.  
</p>
<p>Interesting side note to earlier investigations: 
one of the neighboring countries of Burkina Faso is Côte D\'Ivoire which I believe has an embassy that connects to that underground DC river that people suspected also connected to Comet Ping Pong.  I have no idea if that hunch ever led anybody to anything but maybe somebody else can elaborate on whether that was a dead end.</p>
<p>I initially just searched Rima to find anything interesting but there was nothing. Next I searched  for Rima Burkina Faso human trafficking and boom got a plethora of hits.</p>
<p>One link 
<a href="http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/BurkinaFaso.htm">http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/BurkinaFaso.htm</a></p>
<p>had some quotes from the CIA 2009 world fact book as well as the US State Department such as this gem:</p>
<p>&quot;Burkina Faso is a source, transit, and destination country for children and women trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Most victims are children, trafficked within the country from rural areas to urban centers such as Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, for domestic servitude, sexual exploitation, and forced labor in gold mines and stone quarries, and the agriculture sector. Burkinabè children are also trafficked for the same purposes to other West African countries, most notably to Côte d’Ivoire, where many are subjected to forced agricultural labor, including on cocoa farms.   - U.S. State Dept Trafficking in Persons Report, June, 2009   [full country report]&quot;</p>
<p>I have to say this sounds like an African mirror of Haiti in terms of the internal human trafficking and slavery. </p>
<p>Note something important, One of the end uses for this slave labor is Gold Mines.  The wheels started turning.  So I searched &quot;Giustra gold mining Burkina Faso&quot; and wouldn\'t you know it, Giustra and his partners including a Russian firm are ALL up in West Africa with gold mines including Two in Burkina Faso.  Apparently That whole area is like one of the greatest low cost new gold  mine opportunities in the world.  Here\'s a quote: </p>
<p>&quot;Nordgold also has a reputation as an efficient and smart operator. The Russia-based miner built its newest mine, the 200,000-oz/yr Bissa gold mine in Burkina Faso, in just 15 months, Giustra points out. The company is also familiar with the geological neighbourhood because it operates three mines in the West African Birimian Shield — two in Burkina Faso, one in Guinea.</p>
<p>Nordgold was founded in 2007 as a division of Russian steel giant Severstal and went public on the London Stock Exchange in January 2012. The company is among the world’s fastest-growing gold miners, a feat accomplished mostly through acquisitions.</p>
<p>“People have said to me ‘Watch out for the Russians,’ ” Giustra says, “but they’ve been great partners. We come to agreements on a handshake and they follow through.”</p>

<p>Ok Im feeling like there is something major in the way of connection here but I can\'t put my fingers on it. I\'m hoping my fellow researchers can tie some of this together. Im not sure how exactly this ties into Mrs Luzzato.  I guess we should figure out why the Pew Charitable Trust would have somebody like Luzzato in Rima and for what purpose and then who are Laurie and Chris?  Are they shady like Podesta?  I know there\'s no smoking gun and perhaps someone has already birddogged all this stuff but I haven\'t seen it before so I wanted to get it out to you all. </p>
<p>Gonna need some more eyes on this and people to help chase this stuff down I have to get some sleep I\'m havin s hard time staying awake.</p>',

            About gold mines....Hillary's brother,  Tony Rodham, was put on the board of VCS Mining in 2013. VCS is based in the US and operating in Haiti. 
"In December 2012, VCS won one of the first two gold-mining permits the Haitian government had issued in more than 50 years." The permits were put on hold shortly after being granted but the whole scenario here stinks. On the VCS website, it states they are "focused on locations throughout Haiti".  It looks like the permits went through, after all. And all those Hatian children make great workers......just guessing here.

            I read the email. The woman who wrote the email (Tamera LAZATTO) has the last name of the 3 kids she mentions, so I am guessing it is the kids' mom, or aunt. If you reread the 3 kids names, she has their last name there too . The Rima comment can easily be explained...
           </p>
           <p>
            Rima Sirota, John podesta, Laurie Ruminer and Chris Spanos
           </p>
           <p>
            The names are mentioned in the email, look thru it, you'll see all the names together along with a guy named David.
           </p>
           <p>
            She is hoping those 4 people could come to (most likely a misspelling of the word "too") Reread the Rima statement, you'll see it makes sense that it is a person, not a place.

             David sirota is a democratic political commentator/ journalist I may be mistaken but I believe he has ridiculed pizzagate as Fakenews on twitter. I can't find a connection between him and rima apart from the surname but will keep checking.

             Yea looks like I possibly jumped down the rabbit hole quickly so I edited the post.  It's still kind of odd that all those coincidences connected and also Avvo.com lists Rima as being with the DOJ office or Personal Accountability

               I would say that is sort of up in the air still.  How do we know that this wasn't a dual meaning? I mean, they talk in code about pizza is it a huge stretch to think they may use some duality in their communications?  It sure does seem odd that this very unique name happened to be the same name as a town in an obscure nation in Africa that happens to be a Free for all of trafficking as well as a place where shady AF Giustra and his compadres have 2 new gold mines.

               Seems to be a pattern.  God these people and their Multinational corporations and NGO's are like fucking Locusts.  They roll hot and heavy into any shithole with poor birth records and questionable government legitimacy or control and they proceed to act like the savior a while they suck the area dry of resources and human beings for God knows what purposes but surely including sexual slavery, mining or hard labor slavery, organ trafficking, and who knows what else.  Meanwhile they are in the photo op locations pretending like they are just doing so damn good with their foundations while shipping them watered down AIDS drugs and defective mosquito nets.

                The CHAI arrangement (Ira Magaziner) with the pharma co.s is that they supply cheap (watered down) AIDS drugs for poor nations on the condition that the prices are jacked up for the US Market. So basically not only are they fucking with people in these "shitholes" but they are fucking with U.S. citizens too.
