            The Municipal Government of Washington DC probably has too many connections to Brock , Podesta, and the powers that be. 
Above their police department are the courts and I'm guessing that they have a lot of people financing them that finance major political power.

            The only way this story wouldn't die is if a victim (that is still alive?) came forward TO a person who could listen to them / offer them protection.   If you look at how little is done in Hollywood / California that is Level 1 (where a respected female director of a hollywood pedophile film was demonized , blacklisted, and silenced ) .... DC is the Final Boss battle.
           </p>

            The real issue is that the media (present day) is almost dogmatically attached to the DNC - that it's like saying " I work for the Boston Globe. This story would potentially cause the Patriots to be disqualified from playing in the Super Bowl for 4 years.  I should run it!"

             Victims need to feel safe enough to come forward - there needs to be some kind of co-ordinated effort to reach out to victims, to have a group of people, perhaps some lawyers etc, willing to take victim testimony and make victims feel protected somehow.

              I hate to be bitter reality , but the Sandusky victims only came out because a lawyer was already preparing a lawsuit. 
Many of these victims (if they are alive) might lead broken lives well below the poverty level. If one endgame leads to money, then people will speak.
             </p>
             <p>
              But the scary part of any of these situations is whether they are speaking truthfully for justice + cash , or are they speaking falsely for the cash.

              But your best bet would be them finding someone ( ie organized crime that does these deals ) to spill in exchange for a deal.  FBI , CIA, DEA could fall under this umbrella. 
All of this is problematic because the people involved in the crimes aren't US citizens. 
I'm not a conservative or Trump supporter , but that alone helps the criminals from being tried properly at all.
