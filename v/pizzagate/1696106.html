<p>The fact is, Trump will not be much longer in the office if he does not act now. Arrests of low level criminals is only resulting in the opposing establishment making even bolder moves.

Their plan rests on people believing the message of the media and they will succeed unless Trump exposes the corruption at the highest level. Their biggest fear is losing of the public trust (the half of it left) and Trump can make this happen by making the evidence public.

            Trump has at most 3 weeks left to survive as President. If he does not go all-out and expose Pedogate and arrest Hillary and Podesta by April 1st then Trump will be removed from office by May 1st. Trump is losing the PR war every single day Trump looks like more of a crazy lunatic and very soon Republicans in Congress will start impeachment hearings just to get rid of Trump. They prefer President Mike Pence because with him they can blackmail him and control him to do the Neo-Con War maneuvers to get us into another war in Syria then in Iran. Trump has 30 days to live or die.

            Weiner had 650,000 not Clinton.  And guess what, the FBI looked at the Clinton emails on Weiner's laptop.   They were duplicates of emails they already had.  This is why Comey cleared her right before the election.

            </p>
            <p>
             AreWeSure Comey found no evidence on the Weiner laptop of Hillary emailing classified material and cleared her with respect to that investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             He didn't clear her with respect to the ongoing investigation of the Clinton Foundation.

              You know I'm not shilling.  The investigation of the CF foundation is dead.  They will keep it open, but there's no evidence to propel it forward.  The agents laughably believed that Breitbart nonsense theory about the CF and they have no evidence to support it.  The evidence they have is a guy not involved in the CF making allegations.   Things he wouldn't have first hand knowledge of.  They have zero.

               "there's no evidence to propel it forward".......Says the guy who won't watch "Clinton Cash".
              </p>
              <p>
               The investigation isn't dead, it's only just beginning. Why?
              </p>
              <p>
               Because the Clinton Foundation has never gone through A FINANCIAL AUDIT where all the entities and partnerships are traced back to real people and/or real corporations. In financial auditing that's called "Going To Ground" and it's the cornerstone of a financial audit.
              </p>
              <p>
               We don't even know who the 1100 donors are. Isn't that odd? You'd think people would want it known how altruistic they are. Without "going to ground" you can hide anything you want from a "charity audit" by hiding things inside something like a "Clinton Guistra Enterprise Patnership".
              </p>
              <p>
               You know this AreWeSure don't you? Enron was the most infamous example in the recent past where the CFO started a bunch of dubious partnerships in Nigeria where they hid all Enron's "dirty laundry".
              </p>
              <p>
               Please AreWeSure don't take me for a fool. Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease don't take me for a fool AreWeSure, it's disgusting that someone as smart as you would not know basic accounting tricks to hide shit in.

            Wow, you have a cooky college professor but then again I had some cooky college profs when I went to school 2006-2010... they are so insane that they have to concoct false realities in order to distort the truth in their mind so that they can continue on "reshaping society" as they see fit since they are the palatial grand sculptors of mankind as Frederic Bastiat said pejoratively of the cultural marxists in France at the time of the Revolution.

            I have no idea why you think trump is on our side.  The fact you automatically assume trump wants to expose this just makes you seem delusional.  Pizza gate is not partisan.  It goes across party lines.

            It's the art of war ... he's forcing their hand.
They are wigging out and will unveil themselves in the process.
Make your enemy come to you... not vice versa. 
Hard to have patience, but we must. I do however, think he needs to up the ante prior to Obama's planned DC demonstrations with reportedly an army of *thousands "protesting" in attempts to oust Trump.

            I agree, I am also of the opinion they are really pushing back and his time may be limited. That said, we don't know his world or why he is doing what &amp; when, but he is a grand chessmaster and we'll just have to trust him and wait to see how it all unfolds. This community is a driving force either way and we must forge on regardless...

            I think the deeper the Administration gets into it, the deeper the mess.  The last administration was only one more term from raping, pillaging, and ransacking this country; putting the pedo agenda front and foremost - in that it is OK to fuck kids; and cranking up their child harvesting infrastructure to a gigafactory level production.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about this point of view: NWO thought "we have an overpopulation problem.  Harvesting children for our sexual and religious pleasures and then recycling them into the Earth makes perfect sense!"

             Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol.  It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone.  Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down and sometimes into oblivion, and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post on the face of it is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.

             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles.  I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030

            .   If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <pre><code> - 1 Also reaching out to the mods 
 - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion 
 - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
</code></pre>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up.  At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all.  If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.

            He can't just release the emails unredacted. Some of that top secret information was probably top secret for a good reason. Think detailed information about missile defense systems and the like.

            Sorry, but we have to trust Trump here. He knows (most likely) much much more than we do. And I think the deep state is much much smaller than imagined. We are sweeping the lower levels and slowly encircling them. Trump is provoking them at times, a bit of Art of War going on I think.
           </p>
           <p>
            A part of me agree with your statement OP, but we don't have access to the intel that Trump does.
And where is Wikileaks?

            There has to be a plan in place before the entire world watches its leaders go down. Thankfully the Obama administration and the Clintons are out of office and ripe for arresting. Hopefully there are enough competent people in decision-making positions , here and abroad, ready to  manage the inevitable chaos that will accompany such a tectonic shift with integrity and transparency.

            I'm new, but was wondering if there is a thread about the six Russians that have died in January? One was supposable one who helped write the Trump dossier. It looks like to me the deep state might be trying to blame it on Trump.  I even saw a Trump list of murders. Also I've not seen much about the CIA attacked the NSA. There was a shootout at the beginning of January in Manhattan at the NSA secret center there. Add to that Hillary bribed six Republican Politicians. All of this and the RussianGate is going on just to keep Pedopgate from coming out.

            honestly, I think releasing the 650,000 unedited and all at once will start a civil war. 
Hillary is the link to exposing how the CIA has been driving the military industrial complex for profit, and it's all in the emails. It will reveal how we create wars to generate money off the suffering of others: harvesting the innocent to use as sex slaves, trafficking their organs, and keeping the world in a perpetual state of unrest by letting Dyncorp run wild. It will also reveal how deep pedophilia runs within Washington: attracting the ruthless to positions of power and keeping them under a system of control and silence. But if this is all true then I say fuck it, it's time to go to war. If our foundations of democracy have corroded to this point, it's time to do something about it.

              OMG, I had not heard about this sick, twisted piece of the Pizzagate Pie.  Got any more info on this?  I agree 100% with all y'all calling for a dump of everything ASAP.  We can handle it.  With Trump leading us, we can rip off the Band Aid and get thru this.  Let's go, President Trump!  CHOP-CHOP!

             I agree that it would be a major event, unprecedented, but I don't think it would end in a civil war. The crimes and corruption that the establishment has committed contradicts so strongly the universal values and moral codes that no good people would fight for their sake. By numbers, the establishment and their groups are in the vast minority in this country. I would argue that if they were exposed, the people would unite against them. They would stand no chance.

              I think that is wishful thinking. They control the liberal media, most celebrities, and Hollywood. I'm convinced that increasingly violent censorship and ostricization will sever the country into two sides: those who want justice, and those who think it is a Russian coup against their "innocent" leaders. They'll at least try, but I live in liberal college city and so far they've been incredibly adept at denying the public truth. It's becoming increasingly hard to speak out and even say the media is lying about something without fear of social retaliation. They can't respond to details, but will immediately make you the Nazi elephant in the room.

            Sadly, I think if all the emails were released and more of Hillary's secrets came out, the liberals would defend her and blame Trump, his administration and Russia. These liberals are acting crazy. I don't think anything will unify the people. Tons of corruption has already been revealed about her, her foundation and the DNC. Her liberal cult treats her like she's this wonderful strong powerful woman who wants to make our country better. If these people are still blind and stupid , they will be blind and stupid then too. It's pathetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, it still needs to be done. It's time for Trump to get so sick and tired of the attacks against him, that he gets so angry about how half of the country is trying to ruin his presidency, that he uses the power he now has and goes after all of those sons of bitches. Bring it on!

             Hillary liberals believe what they read in the MSM.  They refuse to countenance anything other than what the news media tells them.  imho, when the media starts telling the truth, even diehard liberals will turn from Hillary.

              Sadly, even then half the public would rationalize it as some sort of New Age cooking method... they really are that mindless and controlled by their puppet masters like little lap dogs they are (which is an insult to dogs).... Hillary Clinton has such a strong spell over her followers that she could execute and sacrifice 100 children on live TV in Times Square and she would be heralded around the world as a savior and saint for the defenseless.

             Tons of data on Clinton corruption is available, but you must search for it. The MSM covers for her in not spoon feeding the public - compared to the constant barrage of "Russia did it!" Pablum that they spoon feed us.

              Yes- and I provide it to people and then they mock the source or legitimacy Ie- wikileaks!! Have to ask them 
"If the media is compromised and colluding with the shadow gov't (which it clearly is and I've examples) how the hell do you think it is going to be reported?

            I agree, the public has long since been made aware of these emails, and it is time for a huge press conference to release at least some of the incriminating evidence, believe me, if it was the common Joe they would have hauled him in a long time ago, much like these small fish arrest that have been going on around the country.....if they have pictures/videos of high ranking persons in all walks of life, as well as emails revealing the horrors they are preforming on children, as well as where these children are being held it needs to see the light of day, every day that passes another horror occurs, and these sickos walk free.

           <p>
            Bullshit!  This guy is just peddling his "reports."  In fact, if memory serves (he's been around a long time), he was outed years ago as a disinfo agent.

             Wasn't it 650k e-mails, and part of them were the Clinton e-mails, which Huma Abedin was forwarding to Weiner? They have alot to answer to though, hopefully they'll talk in the hearing in a couple of days.

              Yes, 650k emails were found from the Anthony Weiner's laptop. Not all of them all Hillary's, although it almost certainly includes her private server emails that were deleted after the subpoena.

            Half the country still thinks 9-11 was done by a guy on the opposite side of the planet living in a cave. That's why conservative "white hats" don't want to pull on this thread... where does it stop? We are talking about a revolution that will end with former Presidents, Senators, Congressman, CIA directors and generals hanging from nooses... the complete discrediting of our system of government, our economic system, the media, the end of half our alliances, possibly the dollar crashing. It needs to happen, but government types tend to be risk averse and want stability over anything

              Despite some spot-on comments early on, most experienced JFK assassination researchers DO NOT trust Dr. Wecht.  (I used to practically worship the guy since he is a forensic path and also a J.D.).
             </p>
             <p>
              Just one example:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Cyril Wecht NEVER claims Oswald innocence. In fact, he usually expresses his
acceptance of Oswald being A shooter, but that there had to be someone
besides Oswald. Cyril Wecht defends Oswald about as much as Joseph Backes
does, which is to say: not at all. And that's why they put Wecht on tv. He
is put there as the "opposition" but he espouses most of the official
story, including the part about Oswald doing it. So, he is really helping
them because he is helping to paint the picture that the JFK debate
involves Lone Nut Oswald accusers having it out against
Oswald-did-it-with-help accusers. Yet, the fact is that most JFK
conspiracy theorists, today, believe that Oswald was innocent."

              If Sessions can prosecute everything through the Justice Dept., then everything might happen lawfully... but I fear that they are just be trying to put the Deep State into a choke hold and tell them to back off bend the knee and leave it at that; no real prosecutions, just the credible threat of them

            I totally agree. Full disclosure will erase the establishment not only in America but also in Europe. The EU will crumble and the countries who was "forced" in to a membership and the euro currency will be set back decades finically. But this needs to happened and people need to be held accountable. I think that the biggest concern for the people in charge is how to make this "transition" in a way that doesn't destroy the financial system (even though it is corrupt to the core). That's one of the reasons Trump is going all in on pumping up the markets. But I agree 100%, full disclosure is the only thing that will bring this global cabal down.

             Trump is weary of China. That could be why he's being delicate, as violence could invite an invasion. We'd be fine in civil war, but not if China becomes the liberal establishment's "savior." Then WW3 begins.

             The power vacuum left behind from 1/3 to half of Law Enforcement and Judicial Branch higher ups doing the perp walk would result in chaos and oppotunistic Dindu's wreaking havoc on good average citizens.

              Yes - but please help me see - how do we get out of this without blood and civil war? Those perps are not going to go without a fight. Imagine there is evidence or proof Obama was involved with FISA warrant.. Let that sink in and now .. think about how all of the Trump haters and all the Hillary supporters are going to react when Obama is put on trial...... How will there not be blood? I know if they try anything such as assassination of Trump or Sessions or an outright coup........ well again I see there being civil war &amp;/or blood

            The full force of the Justice Dept under Sessions needs to act now and those Weiner e-mails need to be released to the public ! Watch out for Schumer because he's one of the perps and was Weiner's mentor.

             First you need to kill the elephant rather than allow it to run around the antique shop while you chase it with some toenail clippers.

            I agree.  Trump needs to release some info and swat them like flies. While he does nothing, Pelosi and the democrats are rubbing their hands together forging ahead with their plans to down each of trump's cabinet members.

             maybe he has the army at his back who have said if there's a democratic coup, we will respond with a military one and reinstate Trump

             and so he feels he has the space to go after them in a methodical enough way so as not to jepoardise potential court cases

             I agree. I would even go so far as to let out all the evidence they have on these pedophiles, the elites, etc., that the FBI has, photos, videos, emails. Even if it destroyed a criminal investigation. The Pedos would be convicted in the court of public opinion and branded for life. That would be better than trying to prosecute them and failing because Trump is taken out. I could be wrong and probably am, but its so frustrating.

              Hannah, you are spot on--'they would be convicted in the court of public opinion'.   The whole friggin world would turn against the monsters once their actions were brought to light, and Trump would be seen as a hero.

              I tend to agree as well- it all ought to be released. There already is tons of pushback and disbelief about Wikileaks period regarding Podesta emails and DNC. Pedogate is too huge to truly wrap your mind around without a great deal of research and thinking and time to let it sink in. The Evil is not going to go willingly or without an epic battle. Prepared to keep moving forward no matter the cost to self or family?

             Agree with this..Trump is not stupid..if you think he is, boy look back in time...Trump is brilliant and a chess player.  NO WAY IN HELL did he impulsively tweet what he did re: Obama..this is planned and part of the roll up...be interesting to watch what happens today...but Flynn, Session's press conference, twitter, all somewhat planned..also fall in line with human trafficking, etc of late...while I do not have inside information, my "spidey" sense is tingling and this is about to go down big!

               hillary is so profoundly compromised and on the nose of the public, and the Dems have no-one else of any stature to work with

               So Obama is their only real hope of maintaining the network and the globalist agenda - and even then they did not expect to be in this position and obama's coup is being constructed on the fly

             He's very particular about how he breaks news to the public. He doesn't bury them in avalanches of data, but shitpost-length truth-bombs.

             I think he's allowing his opposition to hang themselves. As OP said, they're becoming more bold, which is when they'll make the most mistakes.

            <p>
             Also, he's essentially still mine-sweeping the post-Obama administration bloc.

              Is my conclusion as well. Will be fantastic to have all these interviews of denial to be played ....Granted it won't be any MSM news pushing them out there - it will be up to us
