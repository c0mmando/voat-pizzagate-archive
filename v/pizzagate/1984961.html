<p>I am sure that at least a few of you are aware of Sam Hyde. He\'s a stand-up comedian who has a YT comedy channel called &quot;Million Dollar Extreme.&quot; He recently had a show that was cancelled from Adult Swim called &quot;World Peace&quot; after only six episodes. The following video is most likely what got his show cancelled: </p>

<p>He also has a video talking about Jews that you guys may find funny:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9TDgHuwhL8">Sam Hyde on (((THEM)))</a></p>
<p>So, I just saw this, although its pretty old. Sam Hyde (the Username on this site matches his Twitter handle, so I\'m pretty sure its actually him) put up a $2000 bounty for anyone who would go underground into the DuPont Tunnels and find out 100% if they go underneath Comet Ping Pong, and if the restaurant would be accessible through the tunnels. I noticed that the bounty offer was met, but there is no evidence that the $2000 was exchanged, or that anyone actually explored the tunnels.</p>
<p>I was just wondering if anyone had heard of this, or if there was ever an update after the bounty had been raised?</p>',

            Wow it's almost like Sam Hyde is cointelpro. It's almost like Weev, Andrew Anglin, Azzmador, and everyone else is on both sides (Alt-lite/Alt-right) is a shill. It's almost the the entirety of the Alt-right has been co-opted. Srsly idk how anyone can still trust this edgier faction of the alt-right. The amount of red flags with this group is off the charts. Sam Hyde is an agent provocateur like the rest of them. The entire Sam Hyde terrorist meme was literally astroturfed artificially on 4chan for like 2 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the very inception of the Alt-right was a PSYOP tavistock engineered counterculture...

             You really believe that Sam fucking Hyde is somehow involved with the CIA? Don't you think that's reaching just a bit? If that was the case, why'd his show get cancelled after six episodes, and why does he talk about Jews, pedophilia, and Pizzagate in his stand up and his YT videos?

               I guess that would make sense. I mean if a person is hard to identify as a plant, they're the perfect plant. I have always kinda wondered how Sam Hyde "keeps getting away with it" when it comes to the Jew humor. Maybe he's Jewish himself.

             Oh I'm well aware of Sam Hyde and the whole "he can't keep getting away with it" / "mass shooter" meme on /pol/ and /b/. I'm not a total idiot on the subject. What I wanted to know what whether or not anyone had heard of this particular publicity stunt, and if anything came of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the way that I see it, no matter how "cointelpro" you are, I don't think these guys are going to be ordered to try and instigate people to actually go down into the DuPont Tunnels. That seems counter productive.

              Says the filthy kike with a hooked semitic nose and protruding mouth. Even if you wanna go forth with the character assassination it doesn't matter. The opiate epidemic was literally caused by Jews and I can prove it. This isn't the first time kikes have used opiates as soma to enslave goyim, look at David Sassoon and the opium wars.
