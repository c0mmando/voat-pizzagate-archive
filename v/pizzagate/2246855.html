<p>I believe this is what Q was alluding to in the information. 
So here\'s the thing. Stop what you are doing and ask your spouse this &quot;if I had told you 4 weeks ago that there was a pedophile ring run by the government out of DC would you have believed me?&quot; I bet they will say no. Now ask &quot;if I said this now would you believe me&quot; I wonder how many would say probably.</p>
<p>This, I believe, is the power of 4D chess. Trump and Sessions could not act before the following were in place
(1) MSM started to get on board with sexual misconduct allegations (Hollywood, DC)
(2) Indictments were sealed so that there was not a release of huge amounts of information at the wrong time
(3) Enough information was released about pedowood to make normal people (normies) understand that it was a short jump to DC, and then of course HRC and the government (the old one).</p>
<p>I guess it\'s just a theory and may well get deleted but I thought I would put it out there.

            I think its about Switching OFF the masses - when the SHTF they aren't going to come out in support because they won't want to be associated with them. Its a very clever tactic IMHO.

            I agree. And I was being overly cautious but now, no more. I OFFICIALLY DECLARE Q ANON AS REAL. AND THE STORM IS HERE!
I mean, it really is. The right kind of weird shit is happening.

            horseshit. by the time your feeding is done, a new generation of kids is already transitioned out the workplace. 2 years, 4 years—still no closure—employees gone, quit, moved onto things that take their attention—government used gamer gate and many other crimes to corral us into fear voting on both sides.
           </p>
           <p>
            they don't care about us, and I assure you, they can not protect us as a group or individually.
they take what they want, and that means your kids, too.

            i think one officer (or law people) was cool with me, the rest either tried to fuck me or did fuck me over, and succeeded in doing both.
believe me, every encounter with the law that I've ever had, was an attempt to compromise me or my family.

             The Demise Of Dissent: Why The Web Is Becoming Homogenized
            </strong>

           <hr/>
           <p>
            Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             In other words, we'll be left with officially generated and sanctioned fake news and "approved" dissent.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            We've all heard that the problem with the web is fake news, i.e. unsubstantiated or erroneous content that's designed to mislead or sow confusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem isn't just fake news--it's the homogenization of the web, that is, the elimination or marginalization of independent voices of skepticism and dissent.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are four drivers of this homogenization:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              The suppression of dissent under the guise of ridding the web of propaganda and fake news--in other words, dissent is labeled fake news as a cover for silencing critics and skeptics.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The sharp decline of advertising revenues flowing to web publishers, both major outlets and small independent publishers like Of Two Minds.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The majority of advert revenues now flow into the coffers of the quasi-monopolies Facebook and Google.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Publishers are increasingly dependent on these quasi-monopolies for readers and visibility: any publisher who runs afoul of Facebook and Google and is sent to Digital Siberia effectively vanishes.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            The reason why publishers' advert incomes are plummeting are four-fold:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Most of the advert revenues in the digital market are being skimmed by Facebook and Google, as the chart below illustrates.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Ad blockers have become ubiquitous.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Few people click on the display ads that are the standard in desktop web publishing; in other words, these ads simply don't work very well, and much of the revenue being generated is click-fraud, i.e. bots not real people clicking on adverts because they're interested in the product/service. As a result, advertisers are pulling away from these type of ads as they search for advert models that aren't so vulnerable to click-fraud.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The web is increasingly shifting to mobile, which has fewer advert spots due to the small size of the display. In addition, major third-party advert services such as Google Adsense place restrictions on the number and size of ads being displayed on publishers' sites.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            The systemic erosion of advert revenues for everyone other than FB and Google is evident everywhere: for example, BuzzFeed Set to Miss Revenue Target, Signaling Turbulence in Media Prospects for a 2018 initial public offering by the high-profile publisher now appear remote.
           </p>
           <p>
            Digital publisher BuzzFeed is on track to miss its revenue target this year by a significant amount, the latest sign that troubles in the online-ad business are making it tough for new-media upstarts to live up to lofty expectations.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a result of these two dynamics--the censorship of dissenting views under the excuse of limiting fake news, and the erosion of advert income--independent publishers are losing ground. While those posting on Facebook and other social media sites have little expectation of monetizing their content, many web publishers made enough income off adverts or affiliated income (from YouTube channels, for example) to justify the enormous time and effort they expended keeping their channel/site going.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            As advert income has dwindled, there are only two other revenue models available to publishers: a subscription service or Patreon, i.e. the direct financial support of users/readers/viewers. Major publishers are struggling to build a subscription base large enough to fund their operations, a task made more difficult by the expectation that all content is free or should be free.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Patreon has been a boon for thousands of independent writers, journalists, cartoonists, filmmakers and other creators of content. The Patreon model (as I understand it, and yes I have a Patreon campaign) is not based on content that's behind a paywall available to subscribers only, but on providing incentives in the form of content or other rewards to those who choose to contribute.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The Patreon model only works if enough users/readers/viewers step up to support content creators they value. I think the success of Patreon suggests that many people are willing to support the content creators they value. But like all voluntary revenue models, there's the free-rider issue: people who may have the income to pay a bit for content choose not to, and in essence free-ride on those few who do contribute/pay for content.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Some people have advanced the model of micropayments as the solution to the problem of compensating content creators fairly. While this model has some obvious benefits--pennies charged for access to content might add up to a living for content creators if their audience was large enough--it would still be a voluntary system, and thus it would have the same free-rider issue as every other voluntary payment-for-content idea.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Posting "free" content on social media ends up driving advert revenues to the social media and search monopolies, leaving nothing for the content creators. There is only so much serious content that can be created for free.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            If what we're left with is "free" content (i.e. the creator gets no income for creating and posting content), Facebook, Google and click-bait link farms of sensationalist headlines, we'll end up with a thoroughly homogenized web of "approved content" underwritten by lobbyists, the entertainment industry and elitist foundations/think tanks, and little in the way of real dissent or diversity of independent analysis.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            In other words, we'll be left with officially generated and sanctioned fake news and "approved" dissent: unemployment is at record lows, inflation is near zero, the "recovery" is alive and well, Russia is the enemy and any suggestion to the contrary is propaganda that must be eradicated as fake news, etc.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Simply put, the web is becoming Orwellian. There's plenty of approved "diversity of opinion," but dissent is being sidelined to the fringes as a risk to the perfection of managed content.

            You are correct. I've been thinking this for awhile now.   An odd coincidence (maybe) was in Stranger Things season 2. A couple main characters and a conspiracy theorist have evidence of an unimaginable truth. They have to come up with a plan to get it out to the masses. It's too big, too messed up though...ppl wouldn't be able to handle it. So, over a drink of vodka, the answer comes to them.....they need to water it down first...and that's exactly what's going on here. I think we'll continue to see politicians and celebs be linked to sexual harassment for the next few months...then it may be rapes a few months later....then kids...all the while the accused become higher profile. It may actually be happening. +++

             Sounds like a perfect plan to thwart a pedophile investigation. The public won't fall dead of a brain seizure if child trafficking allegations are broadcast. The media is not being fed, the media is creating fake distraction news, its what they do. The media is the CIA and they do as they please.

            I think I understand the symbolism behind Bush Sr. being shown as an old geezer ass grabber now. "Ok team if big pappa can take one for them you can too! Old geezer ass grabber narrative headed your way to distract from pizzagate. Won't be too bad but every now and then a few people have to take one for the team." They never do things like that without it being symbolic and they all got a good laugh out of it.

            Same with Al Franken. Now Al Franken filmed a skit for us of him pretending to grab a woman's boobs and D.C. is appalled!, appalled I say, and the mainstream news says this is terrible and the ethics committee will obviously be busy dealing with this atrocity for the next few months. (facepalm)

            Expect more of this shit. And they do this sort of thing to each other every campaign season anyway so this is hardly rare. If they have a score to settle with somebody it can even get more serious. Remember Bill Clinton got punished with Monica Lewinsky for pissing off somebody, and the somebody was rumored to be Henry Kissinger but I'm not sure who he pissed off.

            100% agree. The depth of depravity is so far removed from the general population's concept of reality that it is simply unbelievable. The "plausibility structure" has to be built and it gives me joy and relief every time a new story comes out because I can see the pattern in the noise that revelation is forthcoming, and the plausibility bridges are being built. I thank God that I have led a sheltered life, but that has made it harder for me and people like me to believe this stuff of nightmares.

            Nonsense. These releases of sexual impropriety of celebrities and politicians is an attempt to portray Trump as taking on the establishment when in reality he continues to cover up the Satanic DC/CIA pedo traficking cult. Grabbing womens buttocks, masterbating in public and general lude behavior with the occasional statutory rape situation has absolutly no relation whatsoever to PG, but it seems it is working on fooling many PG researchers that some kind of movement is happening. This is a bait and switch apeasement scandal. Look how excited many of you get to see this news every few days, yet none of it is close to the horendous crime and coverup of the Satanic secret society. The continued clebration in here as if children are being unshackled from walls and returned to their homes is brain numbing. On top of that, many of the stories sound contived. Yes, Louis C.K. Jumped onto a table in front of women and started masterbating. Why would he do this? Your reaction is "See, they are sick like we said and it is coming out!". No. What we have been covering is NOT coming out. There is no PG investigation. No hundrereds of PG sealed indictments. Those pushing this we are winning nonsense have been wrong the entire time and conitinue to be wrong. Failure to understand that the hidden society is in control and will never take itself down is a shortcoming most of you can't seem to shake. I predict you will be carrying on like this and ignoring the lack of arrest for a long long time.

            They have the first hand experience to know now.  This phenomenon had it's first widespread coverage in the 1980s and 1990s with the Church committee investigation which turned up MK ultra the the Cathy O'brien type victims and some very strange government activities.  It moved on to the McMartin day school trials involving SRA, the Presidio Military Base in California where Satanist Michael Aquino and his wife were caught red handed abusing children, and many other smaller regional scandals.  All had ample proof and testimony from the abused children.
            <br/>
            To counter and defuse these things the CIA had a couple of their psychiatric associates invent a new mental disorder called "false memory syndrome."  They were effectively able to steer the court cases to hung juries or acquittals and then refer to the whole phenomenon as "the satanic panic."  They then had their minions in the media attack and mock anyone who would even consider such an outrageous "conspiracy theory."  It worked to perfection.  That was all swept under the rug and anyone who believed the very credible victims or compelling proofs was a tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist.  It was an easy target.  And i have not seen a serious piece in the media since that time.  Occasionally there are short pieces here or there that are done of charlatans or attention seekers, or maybe someone paid to keep the absurdity appearance of the subject up to date.  If this is the prelude to the actual uncovering,  it is a wise approach.  The media will be otherwise nonsensical and mocking.  This way the ground work is laid first.  Very wise if this is the winding path to the horribly ugly truth.

            I totally agree that there is some form of operation underway to clean house. But you have to wonder who is driving it.
           </p>

            My take is that the system is being folded up from the inside, the People running it are at the very top of the pyramid, they are consciously sacrificing the lower echelons of the power structure so to enable there continuation of dominance. this has happened plenty of times before throughout history.  French Revolution had its routes in Free masonry
           </p>
           <p>
            These people understand they have been rumbled and are now being hunted, and like with a pack of hounds, the only way to end the hunt is with a kill and the taste of blood
They realise the only way to bring it to a close is to let everyone think justice has been served, put powerful people in jail (Hillary)  and let us all bask in victory.
This is when the new system will be unveiled, 
And when it comes, I would say we should fear this new system, because those at the top orchestrated its inception.

             You may be right. The all powerful media may slowly be losing its support structure.Other info out there points to an "alliance" of military that has not been sold out to the globalist/luciferian cabal who is protecting the white hats. David Whitcock claims hat JFK had nearly taken this power structure out before they killed him. Also claims that the long term plans have been in effect for over 50 years, that forensic evidence shows that the Titanic had explosives on it, (they were trying to kill John jacob Astor) . His claims stem from info he receives from people with higher level clearance than Trump.

             Valid theory, I'm inclined to agree with a lot of it...

             actually feel different this time, though. Maybe I'm wrong, but, I humbly doubt it.

            I totally agree with you. Would only add that doing it this way gives the MSM, Hollywood, political elites the chance to come out hard against it then- whamo- a day or two later it’s out there against them or their buddies. Forces them to live by their own rules - Alinsky style

            I'm thinking 4D chess. If category 2 as you put it, fails. I believe there is a way around the obstacles in category 1. That is to actually leak/show/air the blackmail-pedophile films with high-level politicians... Instant redpill.

              Oh it is my first choice after 14 years. Those I know that know all about this for many years just voted for an incumbent mare with a known pervert chief of staff. He was arrested years ago as a school teacher who tried to get minor students to perform a sex act on him. He was arrested years ago as a school teacher who tried to get minor students to perform a sex act on him he had his records sealed. I use this with all the others that come out I have educated this group of people for 14 years. The election was last Tuesday and they voted for him because the other guy was a Republican. The Democrat put out five Flyers that said Trump Trump trump and it worked. 
Municipal races shouldn't matter nor should they fear certain types of legislation.

              But it worked! This was the incubation race for the party to see if they could win in 2018 just saying Trump Trump trump! To think he scares Democrats more than pedophiles is truly sad. Just know I were electorates. It is sad.

              The dripping wasn't enough to embarrass them. That's why I want a full-out assault and 24 news for 3 days because it's such a big deal. Anything less people will be swayed to forget about it trust me! Whoever leaves quietly the cabal will replace with another one and we won't know it.

               I literally meant, my first choice isn't to jump to leaking such videos, not that I necessarily know what I'd go with instead, just saying. There's plenty of ways to address the situation, patience is key - especially given your concerns about more pretenders being slipped in - we must remain vigilant and patient and up-to-date, if we're to keep an eye out for userpers.

               My gut tells me some big moves have already been made, just gotta let things play for a bit, in my opinion.
