             Epstein scandal explodes in Israel as ties to former prime minister Ehud Barak are under scrutiny
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The way Barak does damage control should tell you something.
           </p>
           <p>
            He says he was on Epstein's island, but never saw any women or girls there (lmao).
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, even now he doesn't want to cut all ties to Epstein, but only is 'exploring' 'whether' he might do that.

           </h1>
           <p>
            You are accurate when you say that someone like Netanyahu who has overseen Mossad ops 'cannot' by definition be clean pedowise. No way.
           </p>
           <p>
            His wife just got convicted of corruption, and he himself is also being charged for corruption currently.

             It's at least possible that Barak thought Epstein was just another shady businessman, and Netanyahu is using him as a fall guy because he was briefly also PM.

              No way that Ehud Barak didn't know about Epstein's sex trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember, he was PM, he oversaw Mossad, and worked for Mossad before he became PM. Ghislaine Maxwell's father was also clearly Mossad.
             </p>
             <p>
              The whole sex trafficking ring is a joint CIA - Mossad operation imo.
             </p>
             <p>
              Netanyahu uses Barak's Epstein connection to smear him, because Barak is his rival in the upcoming elections.

               Dumb bitch have u ever heard of Silvio Berlusconi? Nobody gives a fuck about underage girls.  Zero people think it's "pedophilia" just cuz she's not 18.  Obviously no man has ever wanted to fuck you at any age so this concept confuses you.

               Right, but wasn't Netanyahu the one that was in power when Epstein's operation went global?

            Netanyahu is Israel's problem. It doesn't matter at this point who their PM is. The country will be gone by 2040, without any doubt.
