<blockquote>
<p>A Nxivm cult member who secretly pleaded guilty last week to charges of racketeering conspiracy admitted to keeping her own personal slave locked in a room for two years, newly unsealed court documents reveal.</p>
<p>“I knowingly and intentionally harbored Jane Doe 4, a woman whose identity is known to me, in a room in the home in the Northern District of New York,” said Lauren Salzman to Brooklyn federal court Judge Nicholas Garaufis last week.</p>
<p>Salzman told the judge she held the woman hostage between March 2010 and April 2012 “and threatened to deport Jane Doe 4 back to Mexico if she did not complete labor requested by myself and others,” court transcripts said.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old defendant also admitted during the proceeding to being a member of Nxivm’s secret inner organization, DOS, which prosecutors have accused of starving and branding women.</p>
<p>At least one DOS member was also coerced into having sex with cult leader Keith Raniere, according to the government.</p>

<p>Executives and top associates of the Albany-based NXIVM group – along with their family members – donated $29,900 to Clinton’s presidential campaign, according to federal records.</p>

             Some Senate Republicans have been getting rides on an aircraft tied to the controversial executive training organization in Halfmoon whose inner circle appears to be getting increasingly involved in politics.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Republican Senate Campaign Committee lists $34,763 in five "in-kind" donations -- air transportation -- and four monetary donations totaling $31,600
             </strong>
             over the last year-and-a-half from two women, who list the address of 1471 Route 9, Suite 202, Halfmoon.
            </p>
            <p>
             The women, Sara and Clare Bronfman, are sisters with deep ties to Nxivm Corp., according to former associates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rensselaer County Republican Party Chairman
             <strong>
              Jack Casey
             </strong>
             , a lawyer for the state Senate, a legal adviser to Nxivm and a student of its executive programs, would not take questions on Nxivm. He referred questions to Edward Lurie, executive director of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, and John McArdle, director of communications for the Senate Republicans, who did not return phone calls.
            </p>
            <p>
             The plane rides provided to Senate Republicans occurred on Feb. 2, Sept. 18, Oct. 19 and Oct. 24 of 2006 and on March 1 of this year, according to state records.
            </p>
            <p>
             A limited liability company called Viente-Siete/Charlie's Wings LLC at 1471 Route 9 Suite 202 in Halfmoon, the same address the Bronfmans used as their address as donors to the Senate campaign fund, made the in-kind donations.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Have we ever looked into Jack Casey's connection to NXIVM? Maybe we should.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Rick Ross, operator of The Cult Education Institute, which tracks controversial groups, said Nxivm likely is trying to curry favor with politicians. He said he believes Nxivm has "many characteristics commonly associated with groups called cults."
            </p>
            <p>
             Ross, presently [2007] in litigation with Nxivm, added, "I have heard that Sara and Clare Bronfman for some time have been making donations to political campaigns in the hope of ultimately ... garnering influence for their mentor, Keith Raniere and his organization, Nxivm."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            <strong>
             He said providing the Bronfman jet to Nxivm is not uncommon, but using it for politicians is a new development.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Blake Zeff, a spokesman for Clinton, said the Nxivm people apparently attended the fundraiser. He also said the Clinton campaign has not accepted jet rides from the LLC.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senate officials say the most likely user of the LLC's in-kind contribution of air transportation is
             <strong>
              Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, R-Brunswick.
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Bruno's use of state aircraft for meetings in Manhattan on days of Republican political fundraisers and of private jets arranged by a suspected lobbyist have come under scrutiny by state investigators this year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said Bruno did not violate the state's policy on state aircraft use. Investigators have not accused him of any wrongdoing in accepting the private rides, but the person who arranged them, businessman and Bruno friend Jared Abbruzzese, could face stiff fines if he violated a ban on expensive gifts.

             Bouchey, who has been associated with Nxivm for years, declined to discuss the donations made from the office she rented. She said other registered financial advisers have been allowed to use her office to do business. She added that she is not political and was unfamiliar with the LLC.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bouchey is one of the Nxivm associates who made a $2,300 donation to Clinton this year. She and Sara Bronfman also gave $250 each to the Saratoga County Democratic Party in 2005.

             As is the media silence about it. If this was Trump, or anyone else right of HRC this would be all over the news. If I mentioned this to someone they'd look at me like I was batshit crazy, of that I have no doubts.
