<p>Don\'t know who \'\'he\'\' is, but CBS responded 27 minutes ago.</p>

<p>CBS Responds to Pauley Perrette\'s Claim That She Left NCIS After \'Physical Assaults\'</p>
<p>In a statement obtained by PEOPLE on Tuesday, CBS Television Studios confirmed that the actress came forward with a “workplace concern” over a year ago and that it “took the matter seriously.”</p>
<p>“Pauley Perrette had a terrific run on NCIS and we are all going to miss her,” CBS Television Studios said in the statement.</p>
<p>“Over a year ago, Pauley came to us with a workplace concern,” the statement continued. “We took the matter seriously and worked with her to find a resolution.”</p>
<p>The statement concluded: “We are committed to a safe work environment on all our shows.”</p>

<p>So there you go! CBS is committed to a \'\'safe\' workplace and yet it allegedly happened multiple times!</p>',

            I would not put faith in her. She stalked and got violent with her ex husband. CDAN does not hold her in a positive light. I think she is batshit. I would not be surprised is she was the one on the wrong side of the fence.

             I hear what you're saying, but these predators look for someone that's odd or not well-perceived. It's why they have a hard time fighting back. And even if they're not crazy, the press makes them out to be. Like Randy Quaid, anything but crazy.

              Randy Quaid is crazy like a fox. I think he puts on the crazy for self preservation. I totally believe the powers that be in Hollywood would have killed him years ago if he did not play the crazy card. She claimed years ago she was going to leave the show because she was afraid of her ex. I think she has a hardback copy of Hillary Clinton's 101 Excuses.

               Well, like I said, predators look for things like that ... things that make you bad. So if she was talking about her ex, someone could have taken advantage of the situation. And true, enty could be right.

            Hi there MP. Unfortunately, this post does not currently satisfy Rule 1, since it show no links to elite abuse of kids, or the coverup of those who abuse kids. Perhaps a bit more digging will turn up a link. I'm giving you the 24 Hour flair.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, if you want to change Rule 1, please speak up in the current rules discussion sticky. Thanks!
