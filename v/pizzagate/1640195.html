            Coleman did great research and did it before the internet made it possible for combined research auch as on this site.
           </p>

            i posted this ion a similar thread
           </p>

            Now people know that this world has been under the control and organization of a few for a very very long time. They have started and owned both sides of every revolution and war. they control all governments including russsia and china. Read Anthony Suttonhe figured this all out a long time ago. Also a post on here showing Mao was created by yale skull and bones - part of the heirachy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand they get off on the power, the control, the sheer high of watching us dumb sheep doing their bidding, dying in their wars, slaving for their money. raping and traffiking kids is just one of many ways they maintain control through blackmail of middle management.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe all the above is enough of a reason for them to do it. Some say deeper reason goes back to isis, cult of egypt, worship of satan. I don't know how i feel about that. I recently had an experience that led me on a journey that blow my mind. I knew most religions were BS, but assumed some kernal of truth. What I discovered is that major religions were the product of over active imaginations probably fueled by hallucinogens. This I had heard before, but my research this time, led me to understand not only is this probably true, but that the early founders of the church along with the romans hid this knowledge and replaced it with the bibles etc asa way to top down control the masses. Why else would the roman empire get behind christianity and help it spread - great way to use God's army (priest) to maintain local control. The lie also is part of judaism, islam and in hindu they even talk about soma(hallucinogens)
           </p>
           <p>
            if god (heavan) nirvana, reincarnation are all BS and just devices to control the masses and TPTB have always known this - then doesn't it stand to reason saturn, etc is also BS and they would know that also? BTW if you look into the new age movement you will find George Wasson, Huxley and the usual suspects very much behind it. The - just love man - we are one - positive thinking etc etc all started by them pulling the strings behind the curtains. They are also behind the - we live in a simulation matrix BS. I think they throw multiple story lines out there so if new age story doesn't jive with you, how about we are trapped in a simulation? In other words they have bunch of stories to trap people in certain silos, so you're so busy naval gazing, or discussing the matrix, or keeping up with the ... you have little time to see what the wizards behind the curtains are doing.
