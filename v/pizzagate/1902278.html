<p>Hi all!  We have made some minor clarifications and amendments to the submission rules.   These changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language from the community-developed definition of Pizzagate has been included directly in the wording of Rule 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have also included <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1902166">a link with examples of posts that do or do not pass Rule 1</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule 2 now includes what was formerly a part of Rule 4 (all posts need at least one link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disabling of &quot;share a link&quot; posts (you can still post a link as a discussion post).  The reason for disabling this option is to encourage good descriptions (i.e. attention to Rule 3), which often are not possible with the character limit for titles.  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarification of Rule 3 to state that a good title must establish direct relevance to pizzagate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amendment of Rule 3 to require descriptions of unembedded links in posts.   (It is much easier for users to make sense of a post if you tell us the significance of your links.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule 4 has been made much more clear.  (It isn\'t really a rule, so much as it is directing where to post certain posts that don\'t pass Rule 1).  It also specifies that memes and sourced activism/publicity posts are now allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule 5 (no standalone memes) has been axed, and rule 6 (NSFW posts must be labeled) has taken its place.  Standalone memes are now allowed, so long as they support the investigation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know what you think about these changes!</p>

           <p>
            There has always been a "sourced" in front of "activism". You are implying nefarious bullshit on the part of mods instead of taking responsibility for your own tendency to jump to conclusions and read what your "Reddit cancer mod" bias puts in front of your eyes. I hope you don't manage people IRL; you suck at it.

            I have no problem with it at all and thought that's what we were doing. No interest whatsoever in "encouragement meta pieces" and haven't heard anyone else express a desire for such, either.

             Rule 4 has been made much more clear. (It isn't really a rule, so much as it is directing where to post certain posts that don't pass Rule 1). It also specifies that memes and sourced activism/publicity posts are now allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please link to where the community asked for this change. I am not saying I disagree. If there was a feedback thread I would vote FOR this. BUT I find it troublesome that you decided on your own as 2-3 people to make this decision for a sub of 14k+ with 1k active at any given time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Clarification and condensing is one think. Substantively altering and/or adding rules is another.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Rule 4 hasn't been changed -- merely clarified. The emphasis on the undefined term "meta" caused a lot of user frustration. It wasn't helpful. The new version says the same thing in a less abstract way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adding the reminder about memes and activism/publicity posts did not involve any rule changes. In

             this sticky

            , after mounting anger from many longtime users whose
            <em>
             unsourced
            </em>
            discussion posts about organizing protests and petitions were removed, we tried to show users how to make these types of posts in a way that satisfied the submission rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you can see from the comments in that thread, this rule clarification was welcomed. Again, it was a response to the overall concerns and frustrations expressed by a majority of those we had interacted with in Comments.

            I've been aware of this request for change for a small while and in modmail I agreed with the sentiment.
            <br/>
            I didn't approve or disapprove of the rule change itself, but I can agree with the reasoning.
           </p>
           <p>
            There apparently has been discussion offsite in a
            <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#voatpizzagatemain:matrix.org">
             matrix chat
            </a>
            , which I personally did not participate in (due to risk of identification).
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't really have an issue with the change itself as stands.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm thinking on how to encourage everything to be contained within the site/verse/meta discussion verse itself but unfortunately the voat tools are a bit wanting and I'm not sure of the specifics of how it would play out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something I've noticed is each wave of new members comes with a 'muh rules change' churn and we get a new kerfuffle about this very issue, but a fraction of a fraction of the community participate in any meaningful way on the discussion of rules.
            <br/>
            It usually devolves into 'modz are shills lolz' comments and nothing really gets done.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why I didn't really mind the mods taking on this one themselves, mostly to see how it all plays out in the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't want to encourage a passive community that simply rolls over and accepts mod decrees, but I also don't want endless rule change churn that removes energy for why the sub even exists.
            <br/>
            Constant pestering to change the rules is also a tactic to create mod exhaustion from those that would like this to quietly die off, and we have to be forever vigilant of the myriad ways forums are silenced.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the first step is to enforce all mod chatter to be in site, in channel - but I can't also force people to use a high friction system to work out how to run this nightmare.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think encouraging more use of the meta-verse's like
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            is a way to start, I'm interested in what the people who actually do the work of moderation think about this.

             I ask people to post their frustrated rule suggestions and proposals to

              v/pizzagatemods

             almost daily, every time I remove a post that should have been made there in the first place. Unfortunately, almost no one does, and posts there rarely get more than a couple of comments.

             If there were a way to automatically subscribe everyone who subscribes to

             There was no intention by mods to "issue decrees" based on "an insulated IRC group". The clarification of the submission rules was based on literally scores of individual conversations with multiple users over the past two months -- some in
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1815611">
              posts
             </a>
             in
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
              v/pizzagatemods
             </a>
             , most of them publicly in Comments in response to removals where we found ourselves repeatedly clarifying what the rules mean. You are welcome to review my comment history to see many of them.

            <h1>
             Removing the LINK button did not originate with mods
            </h1>
            <p>
             We have gotten an earful repeatedly from frustrated users -- literally multiple times daily -- whose Link posts were removed because they couldn't edit their post to satisfy the submission guidelines. The reaction is always the same. If we got $100 for every person who says "Well why the hell do you even HAVE the Link option, then?" we could fund Voat's server budget.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other users have pointed out "Share a Link" really isn't appropriate for research posts that fulfill all the other rules. Very, very few external sites publish material in a way that states a thesis, explains how it relates to the sexual abuse of kids by the global elite, and links sources for all major claims.

            <p>
             While it was my understanding this sticky was going to be up for a few days before changes were made to the Sidebar, per our standard practice, it is completely WRONG to characterize this as a mod-driven exercise. It is an attempt to simplify and clarify by incorporating user feedback.

            Thanks Mod Team, and for all your hard work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I like that the link post has been disabled and feel it'll help those who don't understand why their posts have been removed and become antsy. It's often unknown to the posters that pasting a link with no description means a deletion. This disheartened a lot of posters I feel, so this is an improvement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Descriptions with links is good practice anyway and I'm for that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The title rule I'm unsure about, as it could be open to interpretation whether something is pg related. However as I understand it, if posters write an argument in the description of how their post relates to PG it'll be allowed, is that correct, mods?
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks again

            Just my two cents: During all my investigations here, I've rarely run into a useful link post. There aere few exceptions, but even those would have been better with some connecting the dots in the post, so my support goes for "Discussions only". Also, it's just as easy, compared to "write a topic and a paste a link". You can do that in a discussion post too.

            <p>
             ps. I think I should add how I personally understand "elite"... For me, it doesn't include spiritual aspects (church/cult etc) and it's something having influence on at least city wide level (local boards deciding for constructions etc) up to global influence. I also see a strong financial aspect connected to it, but not limited to economics. In overall, my understanding varies depending on the perspective in question (there could be "elite" person or group in a company, having influence only for the employees of that company). Difficult...

             Haha, I'm all for this sentiment, but a bit of empathy for those who are not so fortunate will go a long way to encouraging participation from people who most likely don't have time outside work hours to kill time reading all this.

               is it's sometimes hard to communicate to people outside your domain of specialty.

              <p>
               I don't doubt for a second that drugs are involved, but is it what's actually happening, and ultimately is it more important than the trafficking of children?
               <br/>
               This sub is dedicated to the trafficking, use and abuse of children by those in power, considering drugs being highly likely involved it's probably a valuable avenue of investigation.

            It would be a bad idea to make exceptions. We will explain when deleting, though, pointing out the amended rules.

             We will continue deleting posts with pure clickbait titles whenever they violate rule 3. Other than that, we cannot do anything about "bad" titles because of the free speech agenda of Voat.

              The converse to the free speech issue of perpetual bad titles is those posting bad titles have to suffer the ridicule in the comments.

            Regarding new rules: Rules are OK, just a reminder to those posting to double check and triple check your headings because they cannot be edited. Your poor grammar or bad spelling will haunt your post forever.  Additionally, good descriptions entice more readers and  also make searches in the future easier.

             Also, think about searchability as you write your title -- get those vital key words, names, topics in there. :-)
