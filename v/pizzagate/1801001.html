            Ugh.  More DISGUSTING "art" depicting sexualized children.
           </p>
           <p>
            That first linked article was awesome in a more general sense, too.  It addresses the Assassin of Truth, political correctness -
           </p>
           <p>
            "Political correctness is nothing more than lying and injustice. The basic lie is that people are equal, and the injustice follows from the lie: false excuses for the guilty, false blame upon the innocent, penalizing those who did nothing to compensate those who suffered nothing, etc. But it does not stop with mere rent-seeking. For political correctness demands that whites accept predatory non-whites into their societies and then covers up the inevitable consequences: tension, hatred, and violence, in which whites are disproportionately the victims. When liberals lie, people die."
           </p>
           <p>
            This encapsulates the JEWISH Jew World Order's social agenda pretty well.

            Saatchi is Britain's leading publicist, lobbyist and art dealer (and husband of scrumptious Nigella Lawson). Tony Podesta is US's leading publicist, lobbyist and an art collector. Of course they know each other, see each other at least 2-3 times a year at the big international art fairs, and needless to say launder money together!

             Seems that both have an interest in "Art" depicting children, either sexualized (Saatchi), or dead, spanked and hung on hooks (Tony Podesta).  Both have ties to the Freud family, with known pedo Sir Clement Freud being on friendly enough terms to have Tony and John Podesta stay at his place in Portugal, in an area known by the police to be a pedophile haven.

            Looks like they are both in the lobbying business as well as collectors of dubious art collections. One of the search results for 'Tony Podesta and Charles Saatchi' was this:

            from WikiLeaks, ISRAEL/KUWAIT/KOSOVO/ALBANIA/SERBIA - Kosovo government hires US company to boost independence recognition 
email from
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aec0c1ccc1cad7eedddadccfdac8c1dc80cdc1c3" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
             [email protected]
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The email is in regards to and having info about the "US company 'Patton Boggs LLP' 
signed a contract with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MPJ] to lobby 
for Kosova [Kosovo] in Washington DC...
           </p>
           <p>
            "Immediately after the declaration of independence, the Government of 
Kosova and [Prime Minister] Thaci contracted the prominent Israeli 
company Saatchi and Saatchi, in an effort to present a new image of 
Kosova, a campaign that was harshly criticized in the public opinion due 
to large amounts of money given to this company. "
           </p>
           <p>
            It was the experience with Saatchi and Saatchi that made Donika 
Kadaj-Bujupi, member of Assembly committee on foreign affairs from the 
AAK [Alliance for the Future of Kosovo] - an opposition party - cast 
doubt on the eventual results of the Patton Boggs LLP.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Often these agreements are made for other, not state interests, and in 
most of the cases there is no transparency therefore suspicion is 
natural," she said mentioning the Israeli company.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Given the bad experience of the past and the evaporation of seven 
million Euros, we cannot trust, because we have no information, and 
nothing is transparent."
           </p>
           <p>
            and regarding The Podesta Group:
Podesta Group Does Not Sign Agreement With Serbia
           </p>
           <p>
            In the meantime, sources in the MPJ told the newspaper on Sunday that 
the other US company Podesta Group did not sign an agreement with 
Serbia, as reported in the Serbian media this year.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Tony Podesta, one of leading officials in this company, visited 
Prishtina two weeks ago, and no agreement has been signed with Serbia," 
the source said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "For the time being, Serbia has no consultancy in Washington."
           </p>
           <p>
            Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Selimi said that he was not aware of any 
agreement signed or not signed between the northern neighbour and the 
Podesta Group.
           </p>
           <p>
            He regarded Serbia's efforts to campaign against Kosova as being in 
contradiction with the common aspiration for the region.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Serbia's efforts to prevent the recognitions of Kosova are 
unprincipled, and based on policies that are against European 
integration processes," Selimi said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kadaj-Bujupi was also not aware of any agreement reached between Serbia 
and the US company. She criticized the Kosovar institutions for their 
lack of strategy to oppose Serbia's campaign against Kosova.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Serbia has continuously utilized all possible mechanisms to issue 
propaganda against Kosova, whereas the Government of Kosova is not 
fighting back. ; We do not see any strategy or the contracted companies 
using any mechanism to undo the Serbian propaganda against Kosova," she 
said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kosova has been recognized by 85 countries after it declared 
independence on 17 February 2008. This year Kosova has been recognized 
by 13 countries. The latest recognition came from Kuwait on 11 October.

            I recently viewed a private collection of Lucian Freud (and inspired) work. I have to admit the paedophile overtones were a bit unnerving. Lucian had over 500 sexual partners most of which were in their teens. He painted his children nude in many works.
           </p>
           <p>
            Breadcrumb: The collection I saw included a bust sculpture by a US born Sir. Jacob Epstein - I'm actually terrified to go digging down this rabbit hole!
