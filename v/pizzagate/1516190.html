<p>A few months after this story broke, at only 41, Beau suffered a stroke, and eventually was diagnosed with brain cancer and died. </p>
<p>I find this suspicious, and it makes me want to dig and find out if he might have found out something he wasn\'t supposed to know about a bigger pedo ring. In fact, he did end up taking the issue to the National Association of Attorneys General in DC, before he eventually died. That, and also the Attorney General of Hawaii talking about schools on the island dealing with sexual predators are in the following video (these C-SPAN videos are a great resource, by the way):</p>

(Skip to 37:50)</p>
<p>It\'s worth mentioning that this became such a big issue for him that he ended up dedicating his legacy to protecting children. He joined Darkness to Light with the mission to &quot;Empower People to Prevent Child Sexual Abuse.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://d2l.org">http://d2l.org</a></p>
<p>And after he died, a foundation was set up in his name called the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children. Notably, one person who is NOT on the board is his disgusting father.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beaubidenfoundation.org">https://www.beaubidenfoundation.org</a></p>
<p>Here\'s President Obama\'s eulogy for Beau that illuminates some of his upbringing:</p>

<p>I\'m going to keep digging and see if I can find out who he talked to in the initial case that led him to realize this was an epidemic. Meanwhile we can also consider reaching out to the board members of the two organizations I listed. I believe they haven\'t been compromised, which I cannot say for any other foundations who portend to &quot;protect&quot; children. </p>
<p>We have friends in heaven, people. And maybe a few here on earth.</p>
<p>Edit: An interesting element... Beau decided not to run for Senate that year, which everyone seemed to think was strange. Here\'s an article talking about it:</p>

           I believe the reason we are finally discovering Pizzagate is only  because there have been many people working on unearthing this pedophile epidemic for a while now. One of those people was Joe Biden's son Beau, before he died.

           What's interesting about Beau is the timing of the stroke that signaled his eventual death.

            Are their any statistics on victims becoming abusers?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are there abusers that were never victims?

            In this case, it's a little close to home considering allegations  and  theories pertaining the Joe Biden.

            The serial pedo I knew as a kid was turned in by his own son. Its not right to assume a son is his father. Then again, its also foolish to assume he isn't.

            I won't pass judgment either. But I thought I'd document that here for completeness. Some of the people we investigated will prove to be villains. Others will turn out to be normal people, but completeness will aide us in that distinction along the way.

            This doesn't  make  any  sense,
if Biden is  part  of this Luciferian Group then  certainly his son has  been  groomed from childhood,
so why did he  publicly  pursue this case, the  way  he did? Then he dies, son of one  of the  most powerful  people  in  the world, with access to  ANY medical care he  needed  by the  top Dr.s and  hospitals in the world, with any organ he might  have  needed at  his  disposal (gotta love  THAT irony) -but he dies? This does not  compute

               I could be just an act to show to the American people that he is against it, when in fact he is protecting his father by having inside information.  Sort of like the Haiti foundation Clinton runs, yet we all know she doesn't help children in Haiti. In fact the complete opposite . I find it hard to believe that his own son doesn't know how much of a perv he is

            Another one for the list of suspicious deaths, murdesr and fatal "accidents" happening to people investigating and uncovering pedophile-rings. But there's nothing to see here according to the MSM. What a world!

            I haven't checked the sources/credibility for this yet, but there was another thread not long ago claiming that a person who claimed to have information that Beau Biden was murdered, was then murdered, themself.

             Cliff Arnebeck (above) wrote letters to Obama, Biden, Bernie, and Loretta Lynch. In one letter to Biden and Obama he claims that he has inside information that Biden's son was murdered. Here is the interview about the letters;

             This is the direct link to his FB post copy of his letter about Biden's son to Obama and Biden Now, I don't know how to save all of these links forever incase they end up deleted, but the copy of letter was still there. If anyone wants to copy/save all of this, please do.

             Like I said, most people don't even know about these things because it was a huge coverup during our 2016 primary and now. Beverly Campbell, who shared info with Cliff and feared for her life for knowing inside info about Biden's son, mysteriously died.

            Again I haven't vetted this stuff myself, yet, so I won't vouch for it nor dismiss it, just thought I'd add it to this thread for consideration. I'm tired and going to bed for now.
