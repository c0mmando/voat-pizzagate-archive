            They were all over this story from the beginning, but the big dogs buried it so when it broke in 2007 I think it was, you didn't hear anything until now.

            So a computer used to send email’s TOO Hillary was hacked. This info seems important, even if the post title is a little bit misleading. This is what happens when average citizens have to step up and take the places of traditional journalists and investigators.

            Your headline is disingenuous.
           </p>
           <p>
            The person who had his computer hacked is, Edgar M. Bronfman Sr.   And the clear purpose of why they hacked his computer is not blackmail, but to find out what he was saying/doing about NXIVM.  Because he wanted his daughters out of the cult and they were the primary financiers of NXIVM.  The article mentions, once they hacked his account, they had a woman spend a year going through his emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Albany Time Union's coverage of NXIVM goes back to at least 2009.  Here's an article from 2010.
           </p>
           <p>

            NXIVM is based in a surburb of Albany.

             Allison Mack will be released on $5 million bond stemming from sex-trafficking charges, Yahoo Entertainment confirms. She will serve home detention with electronic monitoring until her next court date.

             The Smallville star was in federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday where Mack’s mother, Melinda Mack, put up her home in Los Alamitos, Calif. as collateral, in addition to property and a bank account owned by Allison Mack. According to Variety, Allison Mack will live with her parents during home detention.

             A lawyer for Mack entered a “not guilty” plea following her arrest on Friday. If convicted on all charges, Mack could face up to 15 years in prison. It’s believed that she is working on a plea deal with federal prosecutors

              That was awfully nice of mom to put up her home as collateral.  I'm sure it was a family affair...

               I read in another article Allison's blackmail item that NXIVM had on her was shit about her parents. I bet they don't want anything getting out.
