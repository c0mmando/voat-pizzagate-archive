            The report also said 20 British girls had been victims of human trafficking, in cases where they were raped and exploited by gangs of Asian men.

             By gangs of Asian men they mean MUSLIM! Pizzagate goes hand in hand with immigration. I believe the official number of "displaced refugees" GLOBALLY is at 65 million.

            One can only imagine how easy it would be to shuffle children around during such a humanitarian crisis. How easy would it be for them to take any child they please and then turn around and just say "oops sorry we lost 'em"

             Exactly.  When they closed down the Calais immigrant "jungle" it was widely reported that a number of unaccompanied children were admitted for care into the UK (although the news focussed on those asserting to be children who were in fact much, much older in order to gain UK access).  However, despite many enquiries no one I know of as yet has been able to determine exactly where those children were "placed" for care.  In fact we were surprised to find that this is not necessarily documented.

             Exactly.  And the right people with the right connections could place orders too, oh we foresee a need of x amount of 'parts' in y country.  Next thing you know country y is required to accept so many refugees, and 'oh darn we lost some of them'.

            I'm posting this out of some frustration.  What started as a discussion about banking, and how poor people are disadvantaged, in banking and generally, getting fees every time they turn around etc. the topic of the rich preying on the poor came out of that, and I started telling my friend about elements of what we know has and is happening in the world of globalism. I brought up the aspect of organ harvesting, telling about the people who sell their own kidney to pay of micro loans from the global NGOs that wanted to "help" the poor.  I mentioned that the black market organ harvesting was a problem, as is the massive market to sell baby parts/stem cells, mentioning that Planned Parenthood International operates in 170 countries, and that it's highly likely that the black market operates in some of those countries.  I had recently read this:
            <a href="http://archive.is/0Mhoe">
             http://archive.is/0Mhoe
            </a>
            and this
            <a href="http://archive.is/EcVaE">
             http://archive.is/EcVaE
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            My friend said that I sounded 'scary', as in I read too much.  Maybe I do read too much I said, but I'm not scary, it's the information that is scary.  Overall my friend's response frustrated me because I don't have that ability to "not see it" just by stopping my research.  I know I can't change people or change the world, but researching is the one thing I CAN do, and it's hard to explain that to someone who can't stomach even a tiny, scratch the surface level of awareness.

            <p>
             Allegations that the Chinese regime has been harvesting organs from political prisoners have persisted since 2006 when two Canadian human rights lawyers, David Matas and David Kilgour, published their report on the topic.
            </p>
            <p>
             Evidence has continued to mount since then, with investigative reporter Ethan Gutmann uncovering that organ harvesting from executed religious minorities appears to have begun in Xinjiang, a province in China home to Uyghur Muslims. 
Gutmann’s book on organ harvesting in China, “The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China’s Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem,” is due out in August (2014)

            An article from 2013....do we still see articles like this anymore?  Or are the numbers so great that this is just part of "The New Normal"?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A young girl has been smuggled out of Africa and sold for organ harvesting, authorities have revealed.
It is the first case of a child being trafficked into Britain for the express intention of providing organs for people desperate for a transplant, reports the Telegraph.
            </p>
            <p>
             The girl, whose identity has been protected, was taken from Somalia and smuggled into the UK so that her organs could be removed and sold.
            </p>
            <p>
             A British government report revealed human trafficking has reached record levels, rising by 50 per cent in the last year.
Of the 371 children exploited, most of them were used as slaves or were sexually abused.
            </p>
            <p>
             They included 95 children from Vietnam, 67 from Nigeria and 25 from China, with other victims coming from Romania and Bangladesh.
The report also said 20 British girls had been victims of human trafficking, in cases where they were raped and exploited by gangs of Asian men.
