<p>MEDFORD, Ore. – Officers shot and injured an Oregon man Thursday afternoon when he started firing a rifle during a standoff at a home in Medford, Oregon State Police said.</p>
<p>The incident started about 1:15 p.m. when Medford Police received a report that William Shelton Jr. was menacing other people with a firearm at a house on Garfield Street.</p>
<p>They also learned that there were children inside the home.</p>
<p>Arriving officers tried to talk with the 41-year-old suspect. They said Shelton was hostile through negotiations, and came out of the house with a rifle shortly after 2 p.m.</p>
<p>According to police, Shelton started firing the rifle and a Medford Police officer shot him once in the upper chest.</p>
<p>Shelton was taken to the hospital; he is expected to survive.</p>
<p>None of the children or law enforcement officers were hurt during the exchange.</p>
<p>Oregon State Police will be the lead agency on the officer-involved shooting, and the case will also be forwarded to the Jackson County District Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p>The officer will also be placed on leave through the investigation.</p>

               Don't act surprised, I repeatedly told you not to - very simple request.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have explained in detail, even. Yet you chose to ignore it.

              <p>
               I don't like what happened to your friend, but, not my department and certainly doesn't seem like a smart idea to go outside taunting officers... I don't want to make too many presumptions, but, quite frankly, I saw this thread earlier before it was deleted and wanted no part in it then, even less-so now due to you pinging me with carmencita.

                 And that's a shitty turn of events, to say the least. All other things aside, though, if the situation escalated to the point where he came outside to fire off 'warning shots', then gotten shot himself, there's nothing I can do for either of you.

              Thanks for pointing that out. I'm glad we took this off of immediate visibility, then, though I'm sorry to curb the discussion. We don't want to help them persecute him. Please feel free to ping users to this thread who you think would be helpful in investigating whether the guy was framed.

               Yes, I wasn't thinking clearly when I posted it sorry. I was pretty shook up and should've went about it differently. I think you did the right thing, thanks Vindicator. I will take you up on the pinging recommendation.

            So was he menacing people and children in the home, and then shot a cop? Or is the story bs to justify going after him? If it's the former, well that's kinda what happens when you try to shoot at a cop for no reason. If it's the latter, well then this is scary and I hope he's ok

            So William Shelton Jr. is Kevin Flynn?  Kevin Flynn is his online name?
           </p>
           <p>
            And this does not sound like a swatting.  The original caller to 911 later spoke to the grand jury which cleared both officers
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On Wednesday, the grand jury heard testimony from police who investigated the shooting, officers on scene at the time of the shooting, the officers directly involved,
             <strong>
              and the original 911 caller.
             </strong>
             The case was presented by Chief Deputy District Attorney Jeremy Markiewicz. The jury deliberated for about 10 minutes before deciding the officer was fully justified in using force.

            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The incident began when 911 dispatch received a call from a man saying he and another person had been threatened by a man with a gun near 1039 Garfield St., an area that is home to several duplexes with addresses ranging from 1039 to 1061, the D.A.’s Office said in a release.
            </p>
            <p>
             While Medford police responded, the caller told dispatch he heard a gunshot come from the area where he had been threatened. Police tracked the rifle-wielding suspect, later identified as Shelton, to 1057 Garfield St., according to a probable cause affidavit. Officers on scene contacted Shelton, who refused to come outside.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Mr. Shelton was communicating with dispatch and officers that he would protect his children and wife who were still in the residence and complete the mission given him by God,” the D.A.’s release said.
            </p>
            <p>
             At 2:09 p.m., Shelton went out the back door, fired a shot and said, “Warning shot ... bitches,” the release said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pickens and Bridges were positioned at the rear of the complex. Shelton reportedly saw them and turned toward them with his gun aimed at them. Pickens fired a single round from his rifle and struck Shelton in the upper chest.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Both officers were wearing body cameras, but the visual recording is blocked due to the cover the officers were taking, however, the audio was unaffected,” the release said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shelton then reportedly retreated back inside the home, still holding the gun, yelling something at the officers as he went through the back door. Another shot was fired inside the residence, the D.A.’s release said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shelton surrendered at about 2:15 p.m., the affidavit states. He was transported to Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center for treatment. Police lodged him in the Jackson County Jail on April 1. He remains there on $1 million bail, according to jail records. He was arraigned on six counts of attempted first-degree assault and three counts of  unlawful use of a weapon, court records show. His next court date is scheduled for April 9.

            This is suspect.

           <p>
            The cop who shot him is named Tim Pickens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure this is him on the website, but found it strange that Flynn was touching on this very subject in February 2018.

           <p>
            Tim Pickens is an entrepreneur, inventor, innovator, engineer and educator. His business, Pickens Innovations, specializes in commercial space, technical product development and solutions, and business consulting and strategy for space and technical companies. He is known for applying a lean philosophy to develop creative solutions and innovative partnerships to provide responsive, low-cost products and services for government and private industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pickens’ 25+ years of experience in the aerospace industry, specializing in the design, fabrication and testing of propulsion hardware systems, has earned him a reputation as one of the industry’s leaders in these areas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Early in his career, Pickens served as propulsion lead for Scaled Composites on SpaceShipOne, winner of the $10 million Ansari X Prize. He also worked for small hardware-rich aerospace companies in Huntsville.
           </p>
           <p>
            A serial entrepreneur, Pickens founded Orion Propulsion, a Huntsville aerospace company, in 2004 and sold it to Dynetics in 2009 after growing it to a 40-employee, $6.4 million business. Within five years, Orion had received multiple Small Business awards and become AS9100-certified to build man-rated flight hardware.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pickens served as Commercial Space Advisor and Chief Propulsion Engineer for Huntsville-based Dynetics and as Vice President of Propulsion for Moon Express, a privately funded lunar transportation and data services company.
           </p>
           <p>
            Popular for his inspiring, genuine and humorous speaking style, Pickens is recruited to give presentations at business, space and motivational conferences all over the country. He has also been featured in national media for his inventions and innovative accomplishments...

             Around the 14:00 mark, the video suggest that Podesta basically has fathered Bennington and this Austin shooter and both were "disposable".  Shooter probably MK Ultra'd. THis is incredible!

             There is nothing incoherent about his work at all. He is one of the best researchers pizzagate has. I only shared a small portion of his work.

             He is like my best friend, thats why I care.   I didn't presume anything about the situation at all, I wasn't there.
