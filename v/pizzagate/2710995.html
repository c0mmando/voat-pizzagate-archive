Ann <a href="https://www.barnhardt.biz/2018/09/09/expanded-notes-from-argentinia-on-the-gustavo-vera-natacha-jaitt-tv-interview-on-vera-and-antipope-bergoglios-pedophile-ring/">claims</a> the Argentinian media is openly discussing their pedophile trafficking activities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How sick is it that Antipope Bergoglio’s intimate involvement with a pedophile trafficking ring is openly discussed on television in Argentina, but it is ONLY being reported in the Anglosphere, as far as I can tell, HERE (on Ann\'s website).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ann has written two devastating articles chronicling the explosive claims given by an Argentinian lady of the night, Natacha Jaitt, has says that she was hired by an intelligence agency to spy on celebrity Argentinians:</p>
<p>First article here: <a href="https://www.barnhardt.biz/2018/09/08/antipope-bergoglio-and-his-child-pimping-boyfriend-gustavo-vera-openly-discussed-in-argentine-media/">https://www.barnhardt.biz/2018/09/08/antipope-bergoglio-and-his-child-pimping-boyfriend-gustavo-vera-openly-discussed-in-argentine-media/</a></p>
<p>Main points from that blogpost which are taken from a Spanish article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>– Natasha Jaitt is a “VIP” prostitute who says she was paid by an intelligence agency to spy on a list of powerful Argentinians, starting with Bergoglio’s close friend Gustavo Vera.  
</p>
<p>– Gustavo Vera denies these claims, and has filed charges against Jaitt. He says her slander could jeopardize his career as a primary school teacher. He’s in charge of 90 students across 3 grades (!). He then claims that Jaitt is being funded by a spy connected with the CIA and Mossad and that this entire thing is politically motivated.</p>
<p>3 – The article takes Vera’s side and spends a lot of time insulting Jaitt and going on about the spy allegedly funding Jaitt, named Antonio Stiuso. Stiuso was an enemy of the previous Argentinian president (Christina Fernandez de Kirchner) and Stiuso was collaborating with a prosecutor in an investigation of a terrorist attack that somehow linked to Christina. This prosecutor was assassinated 3 years ago and no one has been convicted, but Vera (and the journalist writing the article) suggests that Stiuso is responsible and trying to frame Christina. Bergoglio also loathes Stiuso.</p>
<p>An interesting quote from Vera “For 18 years we have suffered numerous attacks and if it weren’t for the protection of Cardinal Bergoglio, we would have been floating in the Rio de la Plata in no time.</p>

<p>Ann Barnhardt\'s second article is here: <a href="https://www.barnhardt.biz/2018/09/09/expanded-notes-from-argentinia-on-the-gustavo-vera-natacha-jaitt-tv-interview-on-vera-and-antipope-bergoglios-pedophile-ring/">https://www.barnhardt.biz/2018/09/09/expanded-notes-from-argentinia-on-the-gustavo-vera-natacha-jaitt-tv-interview-on-vera-and-antipope-bergoglios-pedophile-ring/</a></p>
<p>She posts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJMxGoSD2Uw">the video interview</a> by Natacha Jaitt, filmed during a celebrity dinner where she is harassed and insulted by other guests as she attempt to publicize her findings about Pope Bergoglio and Gustavo Vera.</p>
<p>Natacha Jaitt’s main points, as summarized by Ann:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gustavo Vera is the first man she was tasked to investigate, she followed him for a year and has ample video evidence (both of him and interviews of prostitutes) that prove his pedophilia, rape of prostitutes, and management of brothels. She speaks about a time where she definitely saw him with a 17 year old boy. He uses his organization to target the weak, poor children who no one will listen to or care about. These children are made to perform sex acts for others in exchange for money. The clients of this network include journalists, celebrities, and politicians. Those who have spoken out against Vera end up retracting their statements, due to being intimidated (probably by Francis’ “security guards” see my other document). I’m also pretty sure she said that Gustavo Vera films people secretly that use his brothels but it was at one of the (many) moments where everyone was screaming over each other. She also says that Francis saves Vera, but then went on to talk about other priests Francis has helped out, which I detail in the other doc. I’m still looking into the Vera + Bergoglio stuff, there is so much to sift through!</p>
<p>Similarly, the soccer leagues in Argentina are essentially pedophilia + prostitution networks. The poorer boys are forced to perform sex acts in order to make the team (instead of normal try outs) and then they must continue to prostitute themselves in order to remain on the team. The handlers charge clients 200 pence for oral “sex”, and 1000 for anal (ew!). Many of these boys end up getting HIV. Boys as young as 12 years old are being forced into this.</p>
<p>Other people she refers to as pedos/abusers: Julio Grassi (priest aided by Bergolio), Raul Pardo (priest aided by Bergoglio), Leonardo Cohen Arazi (PR officer of the Independent soccer league), Francisco Delgado (reality TV star), Brian Lanzelotta (celebrity/musician), Martin Bustos (referee), Carlos Pagni , Oscar González Oro, Alejandro Fantino (all journalists), and comedian Enrique Pinti. Also a producer named Liliana, the only female mentioned directly.
She seemed to connect the soccer network to what Vera was doing but I’m not sure if she meant to or how exactly they’re related.</p>
<p>She spent her time speaking directly with adult prostitutes, young children forced into sex slavery, that are part of the soccer network. And she also gleaned a lot by working as a prostitute herself, she knows first hand how afraid and hopeless the poor sex workers/slaves feel. She brought lots of notes with her but was prevented from reading everything. She says she has more and video recordings too.</p>
<p>Everyone else was arguing with her and trying their hardest to prevent her from saying these things. They cut her off repeatedly, interjected countless times to defend Vera and Bergoglio, downplayed the charges against Vera, and made Jaitt out to be an extremist with an agenda. Nothing they said was of any importance. Mercedes Ninci (blonde, botoxed guest) is called an accomplice to pedophiles to her face; I’ve written a bit more on her in the other doc. She is pretty much a shill for Bergoglio.</p>
<p>Following Jaitt’s appearance on the show, Federal Police raided her house on April 11 2018, searching for the evidence she claimed to have. I’m not sure what they were able to get, if anything. This raid was authorized by Judge Sebastian Ramos.</p>
<p>Apparently Jaitt clarified to her lawyer who she was talking about re: the 17 year old boy, amidst the chaos of the dinner it wasn’t clear that she was talking about Carlos Perez. There are a slew of articles explaining this, just discovered them, seems like everyone watching had a different idea of who she was referring to at the time. I was trying to find out more info on that particular story and thank goodness I found these articles!</p>
<p>I’ve collected a list of mainstream Argentinian news outlets and blogs so I have a lot of places to cross reference information and this won’t happen again. To be clear: she explicitly states multiple times that Vera himself is a pedophile, abuses prostitutes, and uses his organization to shut down the competition + get more slaves for his network. She followed both him and Carlos Perez for a year – one source of confusion and then others thought she was referring to Carlos Pagni…she kind of made a mess for herself with this gaffe. The media is using this to discredit her, but she has been upfront the entire time and must be filled with stress and fear. She’s not a professional spy, politician, or journalist so it isn’t fair to expect her to handle everything perfectly. I’m grateful she’s speaking out and holding her ground.</p>

<p>Plenty of new material here to consider. </p>
<p>N.B. Did anyone catch Natacha\'s characterization of soccer teams as &quot;essentially pedophilia + prostitution networks&quot; particularly relevant in light of recent discussions on Voat Pizzagate about the Thai soccer team rescue.</p>',

            From the same site this blog comment:
Fr. VF said... 
Investigate Gustavo Vera, Argentine legislator, gay activist, etc., and close, close, close friend of Bergoglio. Or was. There was some sort of breakup in early 2017.
A goldmine of information and insight into Bergoglio is waiting for anyone who will investigate Gustavo Vera.
           </p>
           <p>
            Up until last year when Antipope Bergoglio and Gustavo Vera had a fight and broke up, Gustavo Vera would travel from Buenos Aires to Rome MONTHLY. After the big fag fight, Antipope Bergoglio had the Swiss Guards go into Vera’s suite in the Casa Santa Marta, pack his bags for him, and then they met him as he was walking through the Vatican returning to the Casa Santa Marta, handed him his bags, and escorted him off the Vatican premises.

            Lionel Messi of Argentinean Soccer Fame has been said to show signs of Autism / Paranoid Schitzo (abuse victim).  He also dodged jail with the help of the Argentinean elite last year.  Wouldn’t be surprised if this network is protecting him and other high profile people as described.  More than anything I believe the details in this account depicts the GLOBAL power these criminals have, not just in Argentina.  Really incredible.

            Its all one big mess in the Vatican. This does not undermine the great spiritual force that the Church represents and this scandal should not undermine or its legacy.

            I suppose it is trying to head in the right direction, even though I do not agree with it. Perhaps, it will reach out to a certain part of humanity that needs its intercession. I don't see as an ally though, given how tyrannical its theology and notion of God can be at times.

             Fuck the Catholic Church. Fuck the pope.
Their legacy has been in tatters for hundreds of years.
The Catholic Church is a satanic organization masquerading as a saintly institution. They've always been a vile disgusting den of murders and rapists since time immemorial.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's what they were founded upon. They were never anything else but that.

            Congrats!  What an Amazing Breaking News Report!  After reading your last post on Vera being Bergoglio's bf, I am not surprised at this report. A teacher responsible for 90 children.  How frightening.  This news just has to reach the Mainland USA  This woman trying to spread the truth here in Col. is a Saint.  Both of these women better get security and quick.  The pope has everything that is evil at hand in order to put an end to this story.
