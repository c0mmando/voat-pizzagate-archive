<p>SNIP- &quot;MEMORANDUM OPINION
HILTON, District Judge.¶1
This matter came before the court on defendant Trammell Crow Asset Company\'s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff Robert Mr. Hamady is a real estate broker for First National Real Estate Corporation. In the summer of 1991, Mr. Hamady heard a rumor from a friend who worked at the District of Columbia Ramada Inn that the government of Saudi Arabia was in search of office space to expand its embassy in Washington, D.C. With this information and nothing more, Mr. Hamady set out to find the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia new office space and began examining office buildings in Washington, D.C. &quot;</p>
<p>SNIP- &quot;This unidentified man referred Mr. Hamady to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\' Real Estate Division which handles real estate transactions for foreign governments and their embassies in the United States.&quot; </p>
<p>SNIP- &quot;The broker in the sale was Spaulding &amp; Slye Colliers, which had been retained by the Army Corps of Engineers in July 1991 to locate an appropriate site for the Saudis. The first offer for the building by the Saudis was presented to defendant by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on March 30, 1992. In September 1991, when Mr. Hamady told Mr. Roth that he was the Saudi Arabian Kingdom\'s exclusive agent, Spaulding &amp; Slye Colliers actually was that agent. Mr. Hamady had nothing to do with the sale.&quot;</p>',

            FYI, I am almost positive that PeopleIsVoat is a shill, pushing crap from earlier posts and the continued false push of Andrew Kline @ DOJ (debunked). He seems to be a zionist hater trying to plant this theme. He is just posting crap.

            In 1972 USA was bankrupt. The gold was gone from Fort Knox. Nixon took USA off the GOLD standard. Kissinger idea for Petro-Dollar.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudi would require world to buy their oil in dollars, SAUDI would use dollar to buy t-bills, and CIA would provide unlimited children for SAUDI elite to fuck,kill, and bleed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since 1972 the US DOLLAR is not the Petro-Dollar, it is the PEDO-DOLLAR.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudi used Trillions of Dollars to BUY real estate all over USA, and most of DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudi is tightly aligned with Israel, AIPAC is a foil, it controls WASH-DC, but Saudi MONEY controls AIPAC.
