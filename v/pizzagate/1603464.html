            You're sadly mistaken if you believe this is a partisan problem. Politicians on both sides have been controlled this way for years. Brace yourself for your guys to take a fall, as well.

             I think Trump is pretty anti-establishment, he scrapped the TPP and is about to renegotiate NAFTA which is kind of interesting and very anti-globalist but I still don't trust the guy I mean look at his cabinet picks, some of them good some of them seem really terrible but I'm waiting it out just like you guys my trust is with Christ not in man, but it's kind of funny in a way cause the bible does says not to judge on appearance but of the fruits of that person and looking at Donald trumps funny hair and spray on tan makes him rather laughable but he's saying some interesting things that's for sure.

            The glimmer of hope for me would be if people on Sunday would walk out of every Church Service and yell Stop Abuse of Our Kids!  We will not be back until you do.  It is going on in every religion.  There are good people in every religion but it seems they are quiet about what is going on behind the scenes.  A Catholic priest asks people at sermon to come forward if they have been abused by such and such a priest?  People!  Walk Out!  Walk Out and do not come back.  This will either change things or you will know the abuse is so deep it cannot be fixed.  Believe me in the religions, the abuse goes right to the very top.  The truth is staring us right in the face.  We get angry at the clerics and priests from all religions, but we do not face the truth about those at the top of the mountain.  I have stopped giving money to them.  I am giving my money to and time to soup kitchens and food pantries.

             You should never give your valuable money to the church, but if you see someone in need give them something to help them in some way, I do not advocate the churches because they have become perverted in everyway! what I say is believe in Christ, that is the only way to save yourself, not believing in Mary or the 7 sacraments just CHRIST,  you seem like a very caring person and I applaud your kindness to those in need, I wish nothing but the best for you! God bless!

              I know.  We always keep a couple dollar bills in our wallets or glove compartment to give to people on the street or corners.  We are in no lap of luxury position but believe in helping others when we can. No money to the Church.

            Okay then riddle me this, Would any decent father let his children go unpunished for their rebellious attitude?, would he let them go smoking, drinking, not pay rent, have sex, curse at him, let them go out past their curfew? and basically "do what thou wilt" which is the satanic mantra that everyone believes in... Would he let these children continue to live under his household? no he would send them away because under his household he has rules that everyone must follow and if you don't well your basically "cast out" from his blessing and from his nurturing spirit which then leads to the story of the prodigal son who in turn will suffer the consequences of not obeying the father and the hope in that story is that the son comes back to the father and apologizes for his disobedience, God will not listen to those who don't listen to him period, I know it's like salt to your wounds for some but this is the truth and for anyone who has a ear to listen; Accept Christ as your Lord and Savior and God as your one and ONLY God and you will find peace..

            My attitude? Have I not shared some hope to all you who tirelessly work to expose these scum bags and have I not spoken the good word of god and said he is the only way? was it not said " Blessed are thee who hunger for righteousness, for they will be filled", I don't know why you wish that upon me, was it because I said that God's children are only the ones who believe in his law? tell me my friend what did you get out of all this if you believe in pizzagate? If anything all of you should know we live in perilous times, our leaders are definitely doing some weird occulted demonic stuff so if you can believe that why is it so hard to believe in god? surely if you believe in pizzagate and you've done your homework then you would know the real truth that's being hidden from you... Which is that Christ died for us!

             My friend, God solves all the problems if you just give him a part of your day and read the true gospel of Christ you won't be blind you will see everything face value and clear, and having that feeling and experiencing it myself I wouldn't want to deprave anyone from it, so I felt obligated to share this with you guys amongst many more things I will share in the hopes you open your eyes and ears to the truth

              I Thank you for wanting to share that which makes you feel so good, I think you could reproduce the same good feeling you have if you lie about anything similar to people since they are kids, I don't have to make this experiment, it is happening around the world, all have one thing in common, apparently we have the biological need to know the "truth" and if we are convinced we have it by repetition or "miracles" then we feel bliss, just like our biology wants us to reproduce so having sex feels good, knowing the truth feels good for the same reason, but only if you are "convinced".
I wish you could convince me so I could feel that, but I know too much about my own human biases and biological similarities with animals to believe yours, I need one more elaborated and convincing one.

              Do not think just because BO and the Podestas our out that there will be a clean house because of Trump.  There are still many Bush people behind the scenes and they are heavily involved as well.  The Bushes are part of the Cabal as are many Republicans.  The swamp is filled with dirty scum from both sides and some of us will be surprised as to who they are. Many may never admit it. I tried to tell this to someone about their party and she could not believe it.  They would never do all that.  Wake up people.

                No harm.  I have been doing a lot of research regarding the Archdiocese in St. Louis and it is a lot of work.  Night and Day a lot of us are working on different aspects.  Keep up the work people I believe we are and will make a difference.

            My friend you don't know what you're talking about, GOD HAS A LAW that everyone should obey.. the failure to obey these laws is on us, we saw the signs, we heard the "conspiracy theorists" and did not listen, we've heard these people arrogantly quote in many books what they were going to do to us but we didn't listen, we knew that Stanley Kubrick tried to tell us this in eyes wide shut but oh no he was just a conspiracy theorist... WHO DIED btw, we knew about the evils in music but we enjoyed it...etc, This is our fault, I pray everyone comes to their senses...

             Yes, it is our fault, but we've ALL  been so brainwashed from every possible angle. I just recently red-pilled. Before I was red-pilled, I was brainwashed into believing the evil in music, tv, movies and entertainment (in general) was truly benign. That it was just "art," but now I know the truth. I've always been conscientious about what I feed my body, but never about what I feed my mind. Now that I know, I've shunned all the crap and am working on cleansing my mind. God gave us free will, but when people are only presented ONE version of the truth (the "truth" that MSM shoves down our throats), does free will truly exist? I'm not justifying our ignorance, I just want to expose the cycle so that we understand why and how we were deceived. Thank God for Wikileaks and whistleblowers who reveal the REAL truth, not the "truth" the MSM wants us to believe.

              That was so bang on man, so much so that I think the spirit of Christ is already working in you brother, keep turning to him and more things will be revealed to you, you've seriously been soooo blessed man believe that. We've been given the illusion of free will in this world but we don't truly get the gift unless we have Christ's spirit which is the "overcoming spirit" as I would like to call it and Satan is like the Grinch stealing all of our gifts and using it for his own twisted agenda, it's the truth everybody and I hope everyone truly wakes up to all the madness around us
