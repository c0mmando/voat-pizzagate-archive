            What boggles my mind, is the popularity of Elsa videos.

            I really cannot understand how anyone who has reached some level of maturity would or could watch that kind of trash. It feels like that those people are from the another planet totally.

            This video by Rhett &amp; Link pokes fun at Elsagate at the end which might or might not be a good thing because it seriously pisses me off the way the whole show is going lately, seems like they are into it in some way, with all the disgusting drinking of urine, eating poop and other themes of their show. I thought these guys were supposed to be good, with their singing for Veggie Tales. Guess not.

            Yeah I just spent two days trying to post about something indirectly related to Elsagate all the code in the comments...pedo talk...couldnt post tried like 6 times messages with moderators had 6 posts deleted and now someone else gets to post about Elsagate. Not fair . I  wanted to talk about the grossest shit shot on earth! Just kidding. I worked soo fucking hard on that though.
           </p>
           <p>
            About the code. I got a thousand examples. The code is in Google search leads to child porn the code is in Facebook leads to child porn try it yourself it's easy just take a couple words out of the two examples that we have.

            one example of the code is from the article about Elsagate i couldnt post...called "Elsagate gibberish comments" and the other phrase is from the tweet someone found of a black and whit photo with a string of illegible text that reads who finds what the finders hide? That post got deleted......
           </p>
           <p>
            The picture is a man with an infant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take GUVAX which is in the one with the photo for example and start a string of any letters
 but ........
Let the computer choose the next letter.!!!
Try pushing space bar and JUST LOOK AND SEE WHAT THE COMPUTER GIVES. Its there in the search engines, it leads to cheese pizza photography. Hmm oh her. I don't why I could by post about that.

             Can you link to the deleted posts? I tried to look at the ones you submitted in /conspiracy but it said they contained unsafe or unknown tags.
            </p>
            <p>
             Without knowing what the posts were, it's hard to offer suggestions for next time. However, if it does in fact lead to child porn, the mods won't let direct links go through. That's for everyone's safety. They will however, let screenshots of the parts of the webpage without child porn go through, to show as an example. I know it's frustrating that we can't show the most obvious evidence, but that's the rules we have to play by. Since even viewing child porn can lead to jail time in most countries, we don't want to have everyone clicking on those links.

              Yeah
I wasn't doing that I was doing what you said first. I only had screenshots and I took like maybe 30 all in all and made three different post always trying to diminish the Elsagate aspect and just talk search engine. I just copied this comment someone made on post I made.../

Pizzagate has a very specific definition outlined in the sidebar. You can put elsagate stuff almost anywhere else on Voat and it'll be fine. Try
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/whatever">
               /v/whatever
              </a>
              , that's my favourite go-to. People on the rest of Voat see that and upvoat things like that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway Im not supposed to re show deleted stuff but this is how to find it your self 
There are two examples you have access to Google Elsagate gibberish comments find the article 2nd down, where someone gives an example phrase...and says the meaning is GO TO BED and that the code is only in Thai, ok well, no. It's not only in Thai, and if you take the phrase from that article and put it in QUIPQUIP it says something completely different like I THINK HE IS A SERIAL KILLER  do uremember those go to sleep messages???? In the comments of ppl looking for crumbs Anyway....the other example is scarier  from Twitter of that who finds what the finders hide,
             </p>
             <p>
              You can find both those examples easily and then just take words from those phrases and just SEE for yourself that shit is in the computer already
 Ok?

                 Yes it's weird. Channel has only 12,599 subscribers and the video has almost 8 million views.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So there has to be big pedo "portal" somewhere, where they share these videos. There has to be, because otherwise that view count isn't really plausible.

                  Found myself all kind of weird Russian sites, im not even gonna click around on them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Could easily be some sort of pedo sites among them.

            How do you make it generate the longer link. All I ever see when I archive is the short link it generates in the address bar and then the original link I gave it in a line below that.

             Under the URL bar, click "History". It will take you to the long address. I added the asterisk * at the end so all of the pages with the first part of the URL, such as videos and playlists, would show up too.
