<p>A former soldier and bodyguard to Prince Harry has been spared jail despite downloading images of child sexual abuse, after a judge praised his “examplary” service record.</p>
<p>Timothy Murfitt, 47, used search terms including “toddler”, “kids” and “baby girl pics” to seek out more than 10,000 images. He was given a suspended sentence at Maidstone crown court by Judge Martin Huseyin, who said: “You spent a great deal of your life protecting people from harm. You had an exemplary military career, you put your own life at risk. Equally importantly, you spent your life working to protect other soldiers from harm.”</p>
<p>The court was told that Murfitt was working in London when police went to his home in Sevenoaks, Kent, in April last year. When officers spoke to him by phone he said he had his laptop and hard drives with him and arranged to hand them over.</p>
<p>Mary Jacobson, for the prosecution, said Murfitt at first claimed that he had been looking only at adult pornography but examination of the drives revealed images of children. More than 250 were in the most serious and second most serious classifications. Hundreds of others featured bestiality.</p>
<p>Ms Jacobson said that Murfitt had been open and honest when interviewed by police, claiming that he had been sent images of children and had continued to search for them. He denied having a sexual interest in children and said he was believed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at the time. “He said he had trauma from active service. He said it didn’t excuse him from looking at the images,” she said.</p>
<p>Rebecca Nieto, representing Murfitt, said that Murfitt was “absolutely deeply ashamed” of this behaviour. “There is a deeper psychological issue here,” she said. “He has tried to get help with his mental condition, but has not received much. He got so desperate that his partner actually wrote to Prince Harry.</p>
<p>“There was very little help for soldiers. This is an unusual case. The harm he poses is very low. He has become entrepreneurial. He employs 11 people in his company.”</p>
<p>Murfitt was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment suspended for two years and must complete 160 hours unpaid work. He will appear on the sex offenders’ register for seven years..</p>',

                 LMAO all you're proving is what I always advised: you'll never know for sure who's an alt of who,  so try to use your puny brain to objectively evaluate information.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If I "admitted" openly rather than DM that means it wasn't nefarious: I make alts when YOU KIKESHILLS BAN OR BRIGADE ME.

                <p>
                 like when you said "he admits to controlling the legion of Keyhote accounts" -- you think no one notices your ridiculous phrasing there?  Filthy jewkike manipulation tactics

                      You try to provoke me with all your woman hate comments. As if I should be ashamed of bejng a woman. It doesn’t work. But you can’t even make one comment to a female without doing it. It’s a waste of time for me. I have more important things to do.

                      Your genitals do not make you a man. You’re a male. Not a man. I ignore most of your pings because all you do is repeat yourself and offer no value to a conversation.

                   I believe its unlikely that ES and Donkey are the same person. Different style of writing. Donkey is DEFINETELY a pedophile given hus comment defending Mohamad diddling a 9 year old girl.

                   You ALREADY SAID HE WAS ME.  so my pointing out that we don't behave the same is not DEFENDING HIM against the charge (currying favor with mods). It's the exact opposite of that: he does it,  I don't.

            You have to wonder whether the trauma he says he suffered was having to facilitate and then watch royals and friends rape children during his active service as a bodyguard.

            I wonder what Prince Harry’s response would have been?! Nothing. He seems so caring in the media but in real life I highly doubt it. Although I do believe he is more so than William. Remember when Harry was busted having sex with prostitutes in Las Vegas and on drug binges? Just like Ashton Kutcher and his Thorn sex trafficking foundation helping victims yet he is photographed leaving a dingy brothel on Christmas Day. Someone went in and found out young foreign girls/women were working there. These people are hypocritical in everything they do.

           <p>
            BS.  This is not a mental condition that can be helped.  The problem is way lower than in the head.  Cut it off and lock him up. These guys are so sick that if we handcuff them for life they will use their feet.  There is no solution other than locking them away forever.  I will never believe nor will I fall for the lies about getting them proper help.  There is NOTHING PROPER about this whole mess!
