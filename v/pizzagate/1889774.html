           Someone a day or so ago had brought up the idea of a "Twitter Brigade" Which would be an awesome add on the daily "TO DO" List. I saw this but don't have an account.

            What a great weekend to do it is right.  Seth Rich was a very patriotic guy that loved his country.  We could not pick a better time.  I do not have an account either and really am all thumbs when it comes to tech stuff and setting up accts.  C'mon guys what do you think I think it is a  really great idea.  What better way to honor Seth.
