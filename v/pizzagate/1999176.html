<p>&quot;Veselnitskaya works closely with another Russian emigre other than the suspected former Soviet spy.
Anatoli Samochornov, a Russia-born professional translator who worked as a part-time contractor for the State Department, worked with Veselnitskaya last year on an effort to roll back the Magnitsky Act, a law passed in 2012 which allows for sanctions against Russians accused of human rights abuses.
[Update: Samochornov confirmed to other news outlets after this article was published that attended the Trump Tower meeting as Veselnitskaya’s translator&quot;</p>',

            I believe he is also pictured in the Senate hearing where Veselnitskaya was pictured sitting directly off the shoulder of the Obama Admin Russian Ambassador Michael McFaul.

            Odd you would have these "alleged foreign agents" who one had to get special entry to the US by Loretta Lynch sitting in a Senate hearing. Pictures speak a thousand words.
