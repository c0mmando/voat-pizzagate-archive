<p>&quot;Veselnitskaya works closely with another Russian emigre other than the suspected former Soviet spy.
Anatoli Samochornov, a Russia-born professional translator who worked as a part-time contractor for the State Department, worked with Veselnitskaya last year on an effort to roll back the Magnitsky Act, a law passed in 2012 which allows for sanctions against Russians accused of human rights abuses.

            I believe he is also pictured in the Senate hearing where Veselnitskaya was pictured sitting directly off the shoulder of the Obama Admin Russian Ambassador Michael McFaul.

           <p>
            Odd you would have these "alleged foreign agents" who one had to get special entry to the US by Loretta Lynch sitting in a Senate hearing. Pictures speak a thousand words.
