<p>DOCUMENT #1
Undated FISA memo from DOJ (No. 1 of 22)</p>
<p>&quot;...Mr. Seth Rich broke into the IT Server Room and transferred files from the server to an external hard drive.  The investigation concludes that the transfer rate of files was consistent with a local breach; and does not align with assertions that the breach occurred through a transfer over the internet.</p>
<p>Once the information had been downloaded off of the server, it was emailed to Wikileaks secure files drop box site.  As noted on previous President Daily Briefings, President Obama was aware of ongoing operations that had continuous monitoring of Wikileaks secure drop site.  Individuals aware of this file transfer from Mr. Rich to Wikileaks included Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, and CIA Director, John O. Brennan.  Upon receipt of this information, Mr. Clapper and Brennan met with (redacted) these twelve individuals continue to be monitored and are the subjects of later investigations. </p>
<p>Using the information provided, Mr. Brennan reached out to his Department at Google, requesting that they fund an organization called CROWDSTRIKE.  Funding for the organization was to be used to produce documentation indicating that the files seized from the DNC were a hack, perpetrated by agents linked to the Kremlin.  Any documentation or information suggesting that the hack occurred locally was to be destroyed.  The narrative that was to be pushed was that the emails from John Podesta\'s account were the result of an elaborate phishing scheme.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the production of the documentation to be used to allege that the Russian hackers were the source of the leaks provided by Wikileaks, Mr. Brennan notified both the DNC and Hillary Clinton that Seth Rich was the source of their leaks.  This investigation has uncovered documentation indicating that Mr. Rich was to be made an example out of.  Internal sources in the gang known as MS-13, indicate that they were used to perform the hit that occurred in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington D.C.&quot;</p>

<p>DOCUMENT #2
Top Secret - Memo dated 11/27/16 from GCHQ
To: Hon. Boris Johnson MP, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
From:  Robert Hannigan, Director of GCHQ</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;On 28 August 2016, GCHQ/CSO filed for permission to execute Pr object FULSOME at the request of the US President seeking intelligence gathering into the Trump Organization and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.  Activities include foreign and domestic signals collection in regards to communication with Russian hostile actors.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;IOCCO approved FULSOME on 15 September 2016, allowing 90 days of Initial SIG INT gathering with the potential for renewal should the situation allow.  This men\'s purpose is to request a 90 day renewal of FULSOME\'S original charter with further potential for renewal thereafter.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Since FULSOME\'S start, a clear pattern of actionable leads have accrued, both from the Trump campaign itself, from former M15 agent, Michael Steele, and from others (see fig. 1-7 in attachment).&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;US National Security Advisor, Rice, has requested that we continue our surveillance during the transition period, as internal US intelligence is potentially compromised by the incoming Trump administration.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;For these reasons, we are requesting that FULSOME\'S charter be renewed for another 90 days.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>DOCUMENT #3
An undated bulleted points document from an unidentified source</p>
<p>•  &quot;Six US agencies crested a stealth task force, spearheaded by CIA\'s Brennan, to run domestic surveillance on Trump associates and possibly Trump himself.&quot;</p>
<p>•  &quot;To feign ignorance to seemingly operate within US laws, the agencies freelanced the wiretapping of Trump associates to the British spy agency GCHQ.&quot;</p>
<p>• &quot;The decision to insert GCHQ as a back door to eavesdrops was sparked by the denial of two FISA court warrant applications filed by the FBI to seek wiretaps of Trump associates.&quot;</p>
<p>•  GCHQ did not work from London or the UK.  In fact, the spy agency worked from NSA\'S headquarters in Fort Meade, MD with direct NSA supervision and guidance to conduct sweeping surveillance on Trump associates.&quot;</p>
<p>•  &quot;The illegal wiretaps were initiated months before the controversial Trump dossier compiled by former British spy, Christopher Steele.&quot;</p>
<p>•  &quot;The Justice Department and FBI set up the meeting at Trump Tower between Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner with controversial Russian officials to make Trump\'s,associates appear compromised.&quot;</p>
<p>•  &quot;Following the Trump Tower sit down, the GCHQ began digitally wiretapping Manafort, Trump Jr., and Kushner.&quot;</p>
<p>• &quot;After the concocted meeting by the Deep State, the British spy agency could officially justify wiretapping Trump associates as an intelligence front for NSA because the Russian lawyer at the meeting, Natalia Vesselnitskaya, was considered an international security risk, and prior to the June sit down was not even allowed entry into the US or the UK, federal sources said.&quot;</p>
<p>•  &quot;Byh using GCHQ, the NSA and its intelligence partners had carved out a loophole to wiretap Trump without a warrant.  While it is illegal for US agencies inside the US, absent a warrant, it is not illegal for British intelligence to do so on US soil at Fort Meade.&quot;</p>
<p>•  &quot;The wiretaps, secured through illicit scheming, have been used by US Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe of alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 election, even though the evidence is considered \'poisoned fruit\'&quot;.</p>

             , here is the link to the 3 documents.  I saw reference to these documents from the brief post on godlike productions where the OP stated you can find them on borderwallbricks.com, a website totally unfamiliar to me.

            These definitely seem too good to be true. They lay it out it too straightforward a fashion. They say what we want to hear.
            <br/>
            The way the memo is being hyped, it really better have something this good and not just a bunch of shit we already know. The wiretapping news is already out there, why would anyone think a memo further confirming wiretapping is going to magically redpill the masses? It better be this explosive.

             Lots of sliding happening here on Voat too.  There's some thing very real out there and TPTB don't want us to find it.

              You hit the nail on the head. I've see at least fifty users that were all created in the last 48 hours. They're spamming all sorts of bullshit to all kinds of boards. A disinfo campaign is definitely underway.

              The first one (link ^) was scrutinized and analyzed extensively on Twitter... The verdict was that it's fake. The other two I haven't looked into.
