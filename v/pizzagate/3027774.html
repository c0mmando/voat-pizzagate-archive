<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbY0VW7gtBc">this</a> (fairly old) interview she says that lot of politicians are involved in the trafficking of children, not necessarily directly but by being involved with the businesses of the mafias and the traffickers, who use  legal and illegal means to traffic children and set up companies to launder money. She says that children from poor countries are given $5 or $10 for each man that rapes them. But the john pays $3000. That means that $2995 or $2990 goes to the traffickers. She says that Berlusconi was using a company to bring in virgins for rape/sex by politicians and wealthy businessmen.  As Berlusconi owned most of the media, the issue was never reported. Cacho talks about the Russian mafia finding legal loopholes and operating worldwide.</p>
<p>Cacho was targeted by politician <a href="https://cpj.org/2006/02/tapes-reveal-plot-to-jail-and-assault-mexican-jour.php">Mario Marin</a>. She named Kamel Nacif as protecting pedophile Cancun hotel owner Jean Succar Kuri, who admitted to raping a four-year-old girl and other children. Succar was sentenced to 112 years in prison. Kamel Nacif accused Cacho of defamation and she was taken by police and tortured. Two months later tapes were sent to the media. In one conversation, presumably recorded the day of Cacho\'s arrest, an unidentified voice tells Nacif to pay &quot;a woman in the jail to rape her.&quot;   &quot;No, no, no,&quot; Nacif responds, &quot;I\'ve already given the order. . . . She\'s with the crazies and the lesbians.&quot;  On another tape:  &quot;My precious governor,&quot; Nacif can be heard saying.   &quot;My hero,&quot; another voice says.</p>
<p>That second voice was Puebla Gov. Mario Marín, a stalwart of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. &quot;Well, yesterday, I gave a fucking whack on the head to that old bitch,&quot; Marín tells Nacif.  Nacif thanks his &quot;precious governor&quot; for ordering Cacho\'s arrest and says he will send Marín &quot;a beautiful bottle of cognac.&quot;</p>',
