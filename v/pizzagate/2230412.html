<p>please look down in comments on Jared Cohen</p>
<p>This trip leads to what I have discovered</p>
<p>I trying to kill two birds with one post</p>
<p>Google: Search Engine or Deep State Organ</p>
<p>To that end, in 2014, Wikileaks published an extremely powerful excerpt from Julian Assange’s book, When Google Met Wikileaks. The post was titled, Google Is Not What It Seems, and it is an incredible repository of information and insight</p>
<p>While WikiLeaks had been deeply involved in publishing the inner archive of the US State Department, the US State Department had, in effect, snuck into the WikiLeaks command center and hit me up for a free lunch. Two years later, in the wake of his early 2013 visits to China, North Korea, and Burma, it would come to be appreciated that the chairman of Google might be conducting, in one way or another, “back-channel diplomacy” for Washington</p>
<p> The people at Stratfor, who liked to think of themselves as a sort of corporate CIA, were acutely conscious of other ventures that they perceived as making inroads into their sector. Google had turned up on their radar</p>
<p>Cohen’s directorate appeared to cross over from public relations and “corporate responsibility” work into active corporate intervention in foreign affairs at a level that is normally reserved for states. Jared Cohen could be wryly named Google’s “director of regime change.” According to the emails, he was trying to plant his fingerprints on some of the major historical events in the contemporary Middle East. He could be placed in Egypt during the revolution, meeting with Wael Ghonim, the Google employee whose arrest and imprisonment hours later would make him a PR-friendly symbol of the uprising in the Western press. Meetings had been planned in Palestine and Turkey, both of which—claimed Stratfor emails—were killed by the senior Google leadership as too risky. Only a few months before he met with me, Cohen was planning a trip to the edge of Iran in Azerbaijan to “engage the Iranian communities closer to the border,” as part of Google Ideas’ project on “repressive societies.” In internal emails Stratfor’s vice president for intelligence, Fred Burton (himself a former State Department security official), wrote:
Google is getting WH [White House] and State Dept support and air cover. In reality they are doing things the CIA cannot do . . . [Cohen] is going to get himself kidnapped or killed. Might be the best thing to happen to expose Google’s covert role in foaming up-risings, to be blunt. The US Gov’t can then disavow knowledge and Google is left holding the shit-bag</p>
<p> Looking for something more concrete, I began to search in WikiLeaks’ archive for information on Cohen. State Department cables released as part of Cablegate reveal that Cohen had been in Afghanistan in 2009, trying to convince the four major Afghan mobile phone companies to move their antennas onto US military bases.16 In Lebanon he quietly worked to establish an intellectual and clerical rival to Hezbollah, the “Higher Shia League.”17 And in London he offered Bollywood movie executives funds to insert anti-extremist content into their films, and promised to connect them to related networks in Hollywood.18 
Three days after he visited me at Ellingham Hall, Jared Cohen flew to Ireland to direct the “Save Summit,” an event cosponsored by Google Ideas and the Council on Foreign Relations. Gathering former inner-city gang members, right-wing militants, violent nationalists, and “religious extremists” from all over the world together in one place, the event aimed to workshop technological solutions to the problem of “violent extremism.”19 What could go wrong? </p>
<p>It was also in 1999 that Schmidt joined the board of a Washington, DC–based group: the New America Foundation, a merger of well-connected centrist forces (in DC terms). The foundation and its 100 staff serves as an influence mill, using its network of approved national security, foreign policy, and technology pundits to place hundreds of articles and op-eds per year. By 2008 Schmidt had become chairman of its board of directors. As of 2013 the New America Foundation’s principal funders (each contributing over $1 million) are listed as Eric and Wendy Schmidt, the US State Department, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Secondary funders include Google, USAID, and Radio Free Asia</p>
<p>Schmidt’s involvement in the New America Foundation places him firmly in the Washington establishment nexus. The foundation’s other board members, seven of whom also list themselves as members of the Council on Foreign Relations, include Francis Fukuyama, one of the intellectual fathers of the neoconservative movement; Rita Hauser, who served on the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board under both Bush and Obama; Jonathan Soros, the son of George Soros; Walter Russell Mead, a US security strategist and editor of the American Interest; Helene Gayle, who sits on the boards of Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, the Rockefeller Foundation, the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Policy Unit, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the White House Fellows program, and Bono’s ONE Campaign; and Daniel Yergin, oil geostrategist, former chair of the US Department of Energy’s Task Force on Strategic Energy Research, and author of The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power</p>
<p>The chief executive of the foundation, appointed in 2013, is Jared Cohen’s former boss at the State Department’s Policy Planning Staff, Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Princeton law and international relations wonk with an eye for revolving doors.40 She is everywhere at the time of writing, issuing calls for Obama to respond to the Ukraine crisis not only by deploying covert US forces into the country but also by dropping bombs on Syria—on the basis that this will send a message to Russia and China.41 Along with Schmidt, she is a 2013 attendee of the Bilderberg conference and sits on the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Policy Board</p>

            If you already have a bale mover or you’re purchasing a bale mover

            for the first time, chances are you’ve got some heavy duty work ahead of you this season. Here are a few quick tips to get you started on the right track.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Be mindful of moisture. The moisture content of your hay makes a difference in the baling process, as well as the quality and quantity (by preventing loss) of the hay. This is particularly important if you’re working with round hay bales. The key here is that your hay isn’t too dry. If the moisture content is lower than optimal, you will experience more hay loss, both in the movement and storage of your large, round hay bales. Harvesting early, before the hay has become too mature, can result in bales with more moisture.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Be prepared for setbacks. They are going to happen, but they don’t have to result in a day’s worth of lost work. Have replacement bale spears at the ready. When working with bale movers, the last thing you want is a broken bale spear bringing your whole operation to a halt. Sometimes, a bale spear will break. With a little preparation, however, this can be merely an inconvenience rather than a catastrophe.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Keep your bale mover and all associated equipment in good repair. Whether you’re working with a three-point bale mover or some other kind of bale mover, it’s essential that you understand your equipment and keep it well maintained. Well-maintained equipment is not only more efficient equipment, but it’s safer equipment as well. Be sure that all parts and implements are free of debris, well lubricated, and inspected for safety. Keep your bale mover in optimum condition by lifting only the recommended size and type of hay, and not rushing the process.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            While you can’t control certain factors like the weather or temperature, which can be somewhat unpredictable this time of year, you can make the most of your equipment, increasing productivity, efficiency, and profitability.

            I might seem like the typical anti Ashkenazi, but I am not. The Cohen's are a troubled line due to the fact hat they are expected to tow the line in a very old tradition in a modern world. The name means Priest roughly translated. Try being born one.

            Google is a tool used to control the flow of information...it is also a tooled to control the flow of commerce.  What if you started a business, perhaps a web business and were planning on advertising using google's adwords.  Did you know Google only allows certain type of businesses to advertise?  If you have an e-cigarette business you CANNOT advertise it on Google.  If you have an herbal business or a supplement business you CANNOT advertise it on Google...NOW..what industries do those 2 things threaten?  So advertising controls envoked by Google shield MANY MANY "cabal" type companies...

            It absolutely is. The connection is simple but difficult to see. Hivites. The Phoenician culture and their practices that consolidate power and control, revise historical narratives, and are based in Iran through the installation of Zoroastrianism. This is the hidden culture behind the global deep state. HRC was a US queen bee of the Hivites. Please research this topic and understand it in depth. I'm a survivor of this culture and know what I'm talking about.

            Cohen's ties to Twitter
           </p>
           <p>
            Jared Cohen, the youngest member of the State Department’s policy planning staff, and Alec Ross,
           </p>
           <p>
            Ross and Cohen have formed an unlikely and unprecedented team in the State Department. They are the public face of a cause with an important-sounding name: 21st-century statecraft
           </p>
           <p>
            And then Hillary Clinton arrived. “The secretary is the one who unleashed us,” Ross says. “She’s the godmother of 21st-century statecraft.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Early this year, Ross and Cohen helped prop open the State Department’s doors by bringing 10 leading figures of the tech and social-media worlds to Washington for a private dinner with Clinton and her senior staff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among the guests were Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google;
           </p>
           <p>
            Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chairman of Twitter;
           </p>
           <p>
            James Eberhard of Mobile Accord; Shervin Pishevar of the mobile-phone-game-development company SGN;
           </p>
           <p>
            Jason Liebman of Howcast;
           </p>
           <p>
            Tiffany Shlain, founder of the Webby Awards; and Andrew Rasiej of Personal Democracy Forum, an annual conference on the intersection of politics and technology. Toward the end of the evening, Clinton delighted those assembled by inviting them to use her “as an app.”
           </p>
           <p>
            A few days later, they did. On Jan. 12, the Haiti earthquake struck, and within two hours, Eberhard, working with the State Department, set up the Text Haiti 90999 program, which raised more than $40 million for the Red Cross in $10 donations.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was also the day Google announced that Chinese hackers tried to break into the Gmail accounts of dissidents. In response, Google said that it would no longer comply with China’s censorship laws and for a few months redirected Chinese users to its Hong Kong search engine. The dispute rose to a high-level diplomatic conflict, but it also gave added resonance to the 45-minute “Internet freedom” speech Secretary Clinton delivered a little more than a week later, in which she placed “the freedom to connect” squarely within the U.S. human rights and foreign policy agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            At Google, and later at YouTube’s headquarters, Ross and Cohen stressed the political power of viral videos and the potential for mobile phones to become widespread public tools for education, banking and election monitoring
           </p>
           <p>
            As the recent Wikileaks scandal suggests, new technologies may usher in as many diplomatic catastrophes as breakthroughs. (In June, a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst claimed to have given 260,000 diplomatic cables to Wikileaks, a Web site dedicated to publishing confidential material.) When I asked Cohen whether sites like Wikileaks made the kind of diplomacy he advocates harder, he allowed that they posed a challenge: “All of these tools can be utilized by individuals for everything from Wikileaks to other negative purposes” — at least as the State Department sees it — “but that technology isn’t going anywhere. So we can fear we can’t control it and ignore the space, or we can recognize we can’t control it, but we can influence it.”
           </p>
           <p>
            real dangers when companies are conflated with states. “The risk,” Carlos Pascual, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, told me in February, “is if and when in a particular country — whether that’s China or Iran or Cuba or North Korea — there’s a perception that Twitter or Facebook is a tool of the U.S. government
           </p>
           <p>
            It is crucial to how Cohen and Ross see themselves: equal parts barnstormers and brainstormers, creating and sustaining networks of networks. Ross and Cohen share all their contacts and remain in touch constantly, though they’re often on opposite sides of the globe. (“Jared and I divide and conquer,” Ross says.) Their closeness might come as something of a surprise: Cohen was appointed by Condoleezza Rice and still considers her a mentor; Ross was deeply embedded in the Obama campaign. And they pursued very different paths to the State Department.

             Oh Jeeze, now you make me sound like I am defending those people. I was just trying to say that all the people in the related family are not bad people. There are a great many, (mostly orthodox, and still can't trust them completely) who are trying to solve this internally, and need outside support.  I was one of the few that pointed out that Israel  has no law against slavery.  The good guys in the arab and so called jew are pro USA, and they have homes here.

            Isn't it funny how power-hungry the google fagots are?  Like we don't trust them to run a shitty search engine, and they want us to trust them to run ops in developing countries.  I wouldn't trust those fuckers to do my laundry.  Funny how they don't understand why people hate them.  I'd trust the Bush family before I'd trust a Google Exec.  Met a Google Exec once.  Really self-centered.  It just oozed off of him.  And he was pretty much a dope.  Nobody special.  Just a self-important software wienie who wanted to branch out into other power games.  They're not into "community, openness, free ideas", they're into spying, commercialism and hipsterdom.  They ask for much and offer society little.

            There was a really great /Pol/ thread yesterday that may have solved the Vegas shooting. The thread titled literally VEGAS SOLVED! VEGAS SOLVED! VEGAS SOLVED! We are going to war with Saudi Arabia if the theory in the thread happened and even if it didn't happen we know the deepstate caused a false flag in Las Vegas so hopefully at least one of them will be abolish and /or should be abolished. And what 3 letter layer burrito keeps getting caught doing evil and stupid things lately like all ways? Answer. the FBI A.K.A The False Flag Bureau Of Instigation United Abomination Deadpartment Oligarchy Of Injustice. Good bye FBI demon goodbye.

            Google is not what it seems!...Thanks Assange!...Didn't know that years ago!...Sooo....Ho was the Children of god cult experience? How was going out wihth Lady Gaga while supposedly running for your life frim the NWO? So how was MIA singer as a friend? You shure do spend a lot of time with those who are part of the cult. You sure did grow up with those who were part of the CIA pedo cult experiment. You sure have exposed next to nothing. You sure have never been stopped by the global criminal network. Guess they just can't stop you? Gueess their news is forced to report your words? Guess we are supposed to be dumb enough to by this psyop of a lone wolf freedom fighter who escapes the NWO global criminal network? Bullshit.

                 What will it take for you to understand that the "jews" hide under every checker on the checker board? All those checkers have different names. Yes, they all belong to secret societies commonly affiliated with jews but sticking to the term "jew" allows the many others to bask in safety. Attacking one label is a non starter. I understand the value of "jew" as an identifier but it is woefully lacking, and, it is too vulnerable to attack.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This war will be won with the support of the normies. Has to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "fuck the normies those dumbasses get what they deserve" IS NOT AN OPTION. That is the speak of "jews" and dumbasses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They are the army that must be led in the right direction. Because, if this battle ends up having to be fought from the bottom up, and it would probably have to happen that way, then the numbers will be crucial.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Otherwise the normies will help round up the few people that truly understand what is going on. Our society has been designed to be self policing with normies attacking "the crazy people that believe in conspiracies" and that shit must end for there to be success.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Normies will NOT go after the "the jews." Period. This is a war of brands and right now we are losing the branding game.

                  Nice try but in checkers all the pieces are of the same size unlike the vastly disproportionate influence of Jews in PG.  It is logical to pursue the clear root of a conspiracy over the subordinate groups

                    LOL what website do you think you're on?  Millions are waking up to the Jews malign influence even in their own lives.  Because the schtick failed among those who matter:the new generation of white males.  The rest are worse than useless as far as this goes, another reason for mass immigration.  Mexico had the same corrupt ruling party for over a century.

                   <p>
                    Soon the Christian zionists having been disappointed by Trump will revert to the natural safety of racial solidarity as their numbers fall.  By then there will be Fahrenheit 9/11-popular documentaries about the Jews. And PG.

             what I got is Cohen ties to Hillary,  he went to Russia with group to help start Russian Silicon
            </p>
            <p>
             Cohen worked Google, Strafor saw possibilities and contacted him
            </p>
            <p>
             listed are places he went, before shit hit the fan
            </p>
            <p>
             Schmidt also has background and started a foundation which started New American
            </p>
            <p>
             Cohen was involved with this
            </p>
            <p>
             Strafor is using Goggle, probably twitter too, to do things they can't
            </p>
            <p>
             The Foundation has to have huge money sliding through it
            </p>
            <p>
             was thinking McCain using ASU as go between with his funding
            </p>
            <p>
             SA donated a million
            </p>
            <p>
             why would a university donate money to a Foundation

             Always good to have shills like you attacking something. Lets people know we are over the target and that the information might be important.

              If some parts of your post are direct quote of Assange mark them as such (e.g. use the &gt; mark) and provide a link to the source. Co-mingling yours and Assange's words is misleading.

               I agree it needs editing but your initial dismissal of it was wildly inaccurate. As well as the author might need to do some editing you might delete your inane comments and check your brain before you shit on good information.
