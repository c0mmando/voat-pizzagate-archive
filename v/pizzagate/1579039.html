            RE:  Podesta emails and occult connections
           </p>
           <p>
            I am reposting this submission from a month ago because it bears revisiting due to the pushback against the occult elements being "real" in the pizzagate narrative, as we have seen lately on these boards. This was originally posted to sift through some of Podesta's close relationships, starting with the strange remark made by his brother Tony at his mother's passing and leading to a core group of 25 possible ritual occultists, with Tamara Luzzatto as a central figure.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: I'm interested in the 25 - we actually have the emails of the people in this alleged coven as a string of emails under Luzzatto's when she is talking to Podesta about the Mary Followers after the car crash.
           </p>
           <p>
            Original Post (edited a bit): The close reading of a string of Podesta emails seems to indicate that there may be a strong connection to Crowley/Gardnarian witchcraft traditions within Podesta's close circles. In this pizzagate investigation, examining the lingo and possible code language of the more minor players around Podesta, Alefantis and others constitute much of the circumstantial "orgy of evidence" pointing at a Satanist child trafficking subculture that was flourishing in DC for at least the last 10 years - from guys who built child size coffins for a hobby and dug underground tunnels at night, to moms who made sure kids were in the pool to entertain adult male dinner guests, "spirit oooking" dinners at private homes, and so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Powerful DC operator Tony Podesta raised some eyebrows with this strangely specific comment about his and John's mother Mary when she died
            <a href="https://archive.is/ztlnH">
             https://archive.is/ztlnH
            </a>
            comment "She had two sons, but she adopted another 25 people during the time she came to Washington, said her older son, Tony Podesta, a Washington public affairs strategist." The usual figure of speech would be more like, "She had two sons, but adopted a whole lot of our friends over the years."
           </p>
           <p>
            The article adds, re: mother Mary Podesta- "So its no surprise that once Mrs. Podesta moved to Washington, D.C., to be closer to her sons, she took to cooking at political fund-raisers. (any spirit cooking?) What is surprising is how she became a celebrity of sorts...Mrs. Podesta, known to many of the nations Democratic elite as Mama Podesta, died Friday in Washington from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was 88...She had two lives. She was a wife and mother in Chicago, but then..." etc...
           </p>
           <p>
            Who were the 25 mother Mary Podesta "adopted"? Was it a group of devoted Satanists that she assumed a leadership role over as an elder female High Priestess? Let's look -
           </p>
           <p>
            At about 4:55 in this videoYouTube you are viewing a Podesta wikileaks email originally written by Tamara Luzzatto, the DC lobbyist and the mom who assured Podesta that for a dinner party "the kids will be in that pool" when he visited. Here, just after wife Mary Podesta is involved in a car accident in May of 2010, Luzzatto offers that since she is "...hearing from book people galore, I thought I'd better send this out. At your and Mary's service to guide a circle of 25 or so totally devoted fellow readers, but also friends, and again, anything else I can do to just keep people informed. I hope I worded this suitably or aptly or whatever." Here Tamara is afraid to misstep and so hopes she speaks carefully enough - why? And here is a specific reference to 25 - the 25 that Mother Podesta "adopted" perhaps? Finally she offers "pain for her pain" which isn't the most common way to say Get Well Soon, but makes a bit more sense in light of our new understanding of "spirit cooking" circles. Marina Abramovic's theatrical blood ritual performance art uses similar lingo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later in the video we see an email (5:56)Luzzatto writes to John Podesta about the accident of "OUR Mary" - Mary Podesta who is in "our own circle", and who drives her to their "book group" of "devoted readers". She writes that she is at Podesta's service "to guide the circle of 25" This is likely the string of about 25 names (26 plus Luzzatos email) that is also shown.
           </p>
           <p>
            She informs the group (4:35) that in her talks with Mary who drove her to the "book group", Mary declared her "love for her family, Truckee, AND our own circle - we really did talk about all that, SO I will refrain from saying what I REALLY think about a vehicle hitting her or why this all happened to her." Since they REALLY did talk about that, does that mean that the 25 the email went out to can be assured that Mary's devotion to the group is not in question... The whole train of thought and speech is decidedly odd. Truckee is a rural town where there seems to be a retreat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Earier in the video (2:34) Luzzatto writes to Podesta - "I will try to keep sending word, or find a way that you get word, and when we can all do something to help. I and our other Mary Followers will round up ways to truly help" Sorry, this just isn't your usual book club or bible study group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thelema Favor email - (2:09 same videoYouTube Is a forwarded email from wife Mary to John with the subject line "Thelema favor", a hard to explain away reference to Aleister Crowley's (self-proclaimed Beast) cult religion of ritual Satanist worship called Thelema. At the top of this email, it is clear that Podesta has recently changed his email so the writer, another "John" goes through Podesta's mother Mary to reach him. This favor is no small thing - a meeting with the US President for the mother of a friend's family doctor who is in "Love" with Obama. Really? Of course Washington runs on favors, and a "Thelema favor" must be a special one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do these emails help us reconstruct the barely suppressed lingo of a cult group of about 25 or so close knit people who meet regularly but not in a way that can be openly discussed? This is a group that you have to worry about how you are "aptly" phrasing your words, in fact.
           </p>

            Gerald Gardiner was an admirer of Crowley, and elaborated on Crowley's Thelema witchcraft rituals by being "the first to promote and publicize a magical-religious pantheaon headed by The Goddess, an idea which he seems to have gotten in part from the writings of C.G. Leland, a folklorist who described late 19th century witch cults in Italy....Gardner's rituals had a number of Crowley-like aspects: Rituals were to be done in the nude; sexual arousal was a source of magical power , the High Priestess was to perform sex acts with the High Priest (if not the whole of the male congregation); flogging and brandishment of knives (dominoes?) went hand in hand with a mythology of ritual incest (mother/son) and human sacrifice." Is this what happened at the Truckee retreat with Mother Mary Podesta presiding as elder female and High Priestess, the symbolic Mother Of 25 Mary Followers?
           </p>
           <p>
            It should be pointed out that the Gardinarian tradition has a strong tradition of female leadership (reference same book and page as above), and this string of emails underlines the importance of Podesta's mother, his wife, a female doctor's elder mother, and the central role Tamara Luzzato plays within this "book circle". The fact that many of these women come from Italian heritage is also interesting, considering the Gardnarian connection to Goddess oriented witchcraft from Italy as recently as a century ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Final thought - Politics and Prose comes to mind when discussing a "book circle" that would be right on ground zero of the connected compounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could use assistance finding the original emails in wikileaks - I will archive and update this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            UPDATE: The emails discussed are now linked instead of having to look at that video. (sorry about that but the video does also go on its own track about these emails, which can be interesting.) THIS ONE is the "OUR Mary" email about M. Podesta's accident, and lists 26 names that T. Luzzatto is informing about it aside from another Luzzatto email which I didn't count. So it is speculated that this may be the "25 adopted children" and "circle of 25"?

            Voat doesn't use practices that potentially
            <em>
             deanonymize
            </em>
            users who have opted to be anonymous, through a VPN service or a node network like Tor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Voat is also open-source, meaning you get to read the  code and decide for yourself if the service is trustworthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, Voat is not trying hard to get all the information collected in this investigation hosted on its servers.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a website that is literally a few weeks old, hides its code from the users, uses anti-privacy and anti-anonymity practices, and promotes itself repeatedly on the main platform this community uses. That should raise a few red flags.

              Please come to CitizenInvestigators.org. I have found a huge doc filled with big info.  It all has to be researched, archive before posting ow they will alert their peeps to scrub.  I don't want to say much here bc probably reading this.  Let me know if interested. You are a great researcher and are so needed. I trust you. My name over there is RazorShark.

            I've flaired this as
            <em>
             Potential Security Risk
            </em>
            because the linked website still uses practices that can be exploited to uniquely identify its users by IP address (the site extracts HTML5 canvas image data which is often used to circumvent anonymity provided by VPN services).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             As a reminder:
            </strong>
            OP has been
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1561491">
             heavily criticized by the community
            </a>
            about their questionable privacy and security practices implemented on said website. While some of the community's concerns have been addressed, it seems that the site continues to operate with dubious solutions that cost users their anonymity.

            This post actually violates rule 4 as well. I'm leaving it up so that the information about the security risks involved in visiting this website reaches the largest number of people possible.

             What raises a red flag to me is that your account was just created December 6th, yet you were made a mod after only a few days and you have not really made any evident contributions to the investigations, you've just deleted a bunch of posts. Then considering that someone is trying to help the investigation, you do whatever it takes to try turning people away?  How does someone with such a new account and no helpful submissions become a mod? Everyone should keep their eyes on this guy.  Look at his comment history to see all the posts he deleted.

              I actually encourage the community to see my track record. It is a fallacy that mods need a track record of investigation in order to be good mods. What we need is a track record of critical thinking and a tendency of caring for the community. If we had our comparative advantage in research then we would be doing research. According to your logic, a researcher with valid results should not be trusted because they don't possess a track record of assisting the community.

               You are not even the OP of the comment I replied to but you responded literally 2 minutes after I made the comment? Are you and wecanhelp the same person? That is suspicious and would make sense considering such a basic account become a mod only a few days after being created. I have no idea who the fuck the OP is. I can just see through the bullshit here.

            Don't panic, just yet. A lot of wealthy and politically powerful people are involved. DMCs probably filed and some threats of legal action/lawsuits. Make back ups VIA screen caps, CTRL+S (to save copies to your rig) and archives.

They want Comet ping pong to be our only focus, I noticed this because the douchey CIA mods, here on voat!! Delete any of my posts that are related to human trafficking and the Clintons. Realize that pizzagate on voat had been co-opted by controlled opposition.

              I've been a lurker here for a little while and I  agree that some of the mods here are controlled opposition after what I've seen. Check the mod who flaired this thread (wecanhelp) he created his account December 6 and just a few days later was made a MOD. Looking at his history, he never even contributed anything helpful and his comment history gives a picture of how many posts he deleted. Then I made a comment here in reply to wecanhelp and mod crensch replied immediately after I commented, almost as if he had the notification of my comment. Some really cucked things going on here with the mods.

               I was thinking since there is so much doubt with the honesty and integrity of the Mods here, they should All permanently step down whether they have done something wrong or not and be replaced by Mods that were voted to be Mods by the members of this main PizzaGate subverse. It would end all this 'the mods are fucking with us' bullshit which stymies the investigation. And the focus can be once again to gather and vet the info being posted here.

                I was asked if I'd be a mod, and I said ok but I don't have much time and have not been a mod before, so was made a mod and I am definitely not an evil one, so I would say that means the person who contacted me is not one either. I kind of assumed they asked everyone, because I'm not a prolific submitter of stuff or anything.

                I have noticed a lot of people getting upset at things being deleted when the actual reason they were deleted was to protect the legitimacy of PG in the eyes of newcomers doing their first venture here to see if there really is anything to it - posts without good sources or evidence, or posts that were irrelevant and taking up space on the front page that cold be taken up by really damning, well-sourced posts. I think there are a lot of people investigating who have not done research or presented evidence before in a way that is as water tight as possible in terms of potential criticism, and that can lead to misunderstandings about why something was taken down. The objective is to preserve the credibility of the investigation, so that it is too difficult for the MSM and casual first time visitors to dismiss it as crazy people reading too much into stuff. Trying to be both a place for ideas and out of the box suggestions to look into, as well as a sort of PR presentation of PG and the more solid evidence, is incredibly difficult. And some of the posts that contain really weak evidence and tenuous links are suspected of being submitted by 'the other side' in order to discredit PG. So everyone's suspicious of everyone else!
               </p>
               <p>
                It would be great if we could think of a way to really verify everyone's status, like if there was something simple people could be asked to do that someone on the other side would never do, even to preserve their cover. I can't think of anything though that wouldn't involve doxxing everyone. And voting sounds good, but then we'd be worried that pedo subscribers had infiltrated in great enough numbers to ensure their people got voted in. I don't know, it's a really difficult problem but I'm sure there must be some clever solution we could come up with somehow.

               I agree - wecanhelp REFUSED to take down a doxxing post that called for harrrassment - said he didn't want to "go rogue" and needed KevDude's permission as "the higher up" etc, excuse after lame excuse....THE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT PIZZAGATE ARE NOT STALKERS AND HARRASSERS - but they'd like to give every opportunity for that to happen.  Disgusting.

               Let's not forget KevDude rewrote the so called "rules" on this sub eliminating that violence and vigilante justice was grounds for removing a post.

            All, remember the paid 2017 disinformation, embedded gov. approved plan. This means they can further their efforts by even sending out email and media files posing as ACTUAL MSM sources. I'm not trying to offend the OP but you all should be sure if you put all your eggs in one basket you have a verified trusted secondary and tertiary also holding all the sent information. Please...

            Does anybody recall that analysis by a construction worker about how he thought the 'kill room' freezer wasnt really a freezer?  It pointed out that there were no inside door handles and that it looked to have a hole filled in with concrete on the floor?  I thought i had saved it, but i cant find it now.  It was a meme.

            'Andy Redwood' police chief put in charge of Jill dando Murder. Jill dando was a journalist looking into a pedophile ring involving celebrities and members of the royal family. The investigation was a white wash cover up and framed a man who was later released for being innocent. Later he was put in charge of the Madeline McCann case (Also stinks of a cover up) he should be added to persons of interest for what it's worth.

                Nice try. You have NO credibility whatsoever.  Go back to your fatso anti-semitic cave cause what you hate is actually what you live with constantly.  What you think you hATe is what you surround yourself with pleasure - weird, right?

                  absolutey happy you show yourself right here publicly - keep talking!  it's good for you, get it out.  BTW I recommend anyone reading this look up Crensch submission history - he hides behind bland submission titles, but it is all there if you look.

                   I can't imagine a thinking human would actually believe that any and all "leads" no matter how sketchy or far-fetched or impossible belong here.  The options are that you are either unthinking, subhuman, or paid to harm this place.  Then again, you being a kike narrows it down to you being subhuman.

            As for the "scrubbing" of info from the archives, shouldn't there be some changes in the procedure?
Like, if something is questionable that it be put in a "Hold" or "Pending" file for a time?
Or that when anything is scrubbed from archives that planned removal has to be reported first and reviewed?
And, guess someone might have a better plan or two?
But  this seems to be an on-going problem that should be fixed.

            Who here is familiar with how steemit handles publications? Can you upload photos/videos to the site itself, or must they be linked from elsewhere?
           </p>
           <p>
            I hear they blockchain articles posted there, making it harder to tear down than a typical site host. If true, we may want to copy everything we can there in addition to this citizeninvestigator page.

             You can't use Steemit to post pics-- they have to be linked to externally. It's a good platform, imho, but it won't work for backing up pics.
            </p>
            <p>
             How about getting blogs, like blogger.com or wordpress.com, uploading to there? Don't need to make posts or anything; just use the image-holding capability. Free blogs are all over the net.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do wonder though, if using a service that has its servers overseas would make a difference?

              Good idea, a few blogs / Wordpress set up just for hosting images (and memes). Screenshots.
This would make material easy to access.
             </p>
             <p>
              We still need to save offline as much as we can, as some heros have been doing.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is just a suggestion for ease of access and for us to save to offline.
Blogs can easily be shut down by providers too.

             I don't know about steemit, I've never used it because I heard you have to give your phone #. But the more places we can copy the info, the better. I am copying
             <strong>
              everything
             </strong>
             so that any info we need can be referenced quickly without having to search and dig through threads.

              I waited until two days ago to join. Using a burner. Somehow am getting magic internet money from posting my videos. Wierd as fuck, but very few shills so far. My first experience WAS with a major Troll, however. I like Steemit.

               'Somehow am getting magic internet money' -- What like more internet traffic or above and beyond or ad revenue? I ask because that's how the alphabet gangs usually work; fund generally, anonymously. In this case, it could be good or bad. Someone on the inside that's good or someone outside bad (set up a trap). Leastways, someone wanting this funded would be curious, indeed.

                Everytime content is created, cryptocurrency is produced. Liking/resteeming (reblogging) things makes one a curator, and they get a cut of the profit for the post.

               <p>
                The currency is Steem, which one can convert into bitcoin and then into whatever currency the user wants.
