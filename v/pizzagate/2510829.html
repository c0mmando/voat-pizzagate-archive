<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>: <em>Due to my previous post on the new technology platform being used by the ICMEC - (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2505478">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2505478</a>) - this post takes a closer look at Amazon Web Services (AWS), identified Israeli military connections  and looks at connections with the education system in Washington.  As recent online alternative media outlets in the UK are concerned about possible Israeli survelliance of the UK population, the identified connections through AWS as they pertain to the pizzagate investigation are highlighted.</em></p>
