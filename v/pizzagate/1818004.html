            What courage these two victims have. They did not give up.  This is what it takes.  Fighting back.  We must keep standing up for the victims and letting the know we have their backs.

             I thought that it is particularily gross that one of the ethics commission that voted against is the nun who is Chancellor of Salve Regina College. How could any students there ever think that she has their support. Disgraceful, and yes, very brave of the victims but I dont know if this means that their case will be overturned.

              We can hope and pray.  It seems that it will be a never ending battle.  I read on here that Netflix is coming out with an old case of a nun by the name of Sister Cathy  that was murdered, being that they expect she knew something.  It is called The Keepers and took place in Baltimore. I do not have Netflix but 2 friends do.

               Some nuns have been excommunicated for reporting pedo priests. It's because when Ratzinger was the Grand Inquisitor, he published a document saying that anyone who reported pedo clergy would be excommunicated. Ratzinger later became Pope Benedict XVI.

                  Yes, Fiona Barnett.  He is so arrogant with his stupid red shoes. Somehow I picture Francis in the privacy of his room with his own pair of red shoes.  I think all of them may be highly compromised now so that they can be blackmailed like the political pedos.

                    Yes, I remember reading that Post before.  Many people do not even know about the Court of Brussels.  I wonder how things are going with the Italians renegotiating their Treaty with the Vatican.  We can bet they are in no hurry to make changes. Hopefully this is something they can accomplish with legislation and not with meetings and negotiations.
