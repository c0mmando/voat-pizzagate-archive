<h1>Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, wrote to the Vatican offering his resignation on Friday, which was accepted by Pope Francis.</h1>
<p>\'A statement from the Vatican issued on Saturday read: &quot;Yesterday evening the Holy Father received the letter in which Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, Archbishop Emeritus of Washington (USA), presented his resignation as a member of the College of Cardinals. </p>
<p>&quot;Pope Francis accepted his resignation from the cardinalate and has ordered his suspension from the exercise of any public ministry, together with the obligation to remain in a house yet to be indicated to him, for a life of prayer and penance until the accusations made against him are examined in a regular canonical trial.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr McCarrick, 88, was ordained in 1958 and rose through the ranks in the Archdiocese of New York before being installed as archbishop of Washington in 2001, a post he held until 2006.</p>
<p>He is officially retired but continues to travel abroad regularly, speaking on issues such as human rights. </p>
<p><strong>The allegation related to Mr McCarrick’s time in New York. He was accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old who was being measured for a new cassock, according to The New York Times.</strong> </p>
<p>The claim was investigated for the New York archdiocese by a group of jurists, law enforcement experts, parents, psychologists, and religious figures.</p>
<p>The group judged that the allegations were “credible and substantiated”. Mr McCarrick was removed from public ministry on June 20. </p>
<p>Mr McCarrick said in a statement at the time that he was “shocked” by the report and maintained his innocence. He also said he had co-operated with the investigation. </p>
<p>“My sadness was deepened when I was informed that the allegations had been determined credible and substantiated,” he said in the statement. </p>
<p>Mr McCarrick added: “While I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence, I am sorry for the pain the person who brought the charges has gone through, as well as for the scandal such charges cause our people.”</p>
<p><strong>At the time senior US church officials said they had received three allegations of McCarrick\'s sexual misconduct with adults decades ago, two of which resulted in settlements.</strong></p>
<p>A Catholic University canon law expert, Kurt Martens, noted that this was the first time an order of penance and prayer had been issued before a church trial could take place.\'</p>
