             It says the battery is non-rechargeable but there’s obviously a charger. Was that a typo?

            If this item, the cell phone charger , is not available online or by any other company then I propose that it is pretty obvious where that item came from.  It is not Rocket Science.  If Paddock was in that room, as Investigators have been saying, then it does point at his having some kind of connection to the CIA.

             The arrest of David Timothy Deakin in the Philippines has revealed one of the darkest corners of the Internet, where pedophiles in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia pay overseas facilitators to sexually abuse children and babies.
            </p>
            <p>
             The arrests come two weeks after Philippine authorities, acting on an overseas tip-off, made one of the largest seizures of its kind in the country, uncovering a major operation live-streaming the abuse and torture of children from dark corners of the internet to predators in Australia, the US, Canada and Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             The AFP also played a key role in the arrest in the Philippines of 52-year-old alleged Australian child sex predator and "dark web" mastermind Peter Scully, who has been charged over what police say are the most shocking cases of child murder, torture and abuse they have seen in the country.

            Seems Australian CP producers have quite a connection to working in the Philippines.  Stephen Paddock didn't have a social media 'footprint' so we are told, but no one has told us whether or not he had a Dark Web 'footprint', using aliases...  CP involvement would an ideal way to make money perhaps, if you want to spend a lot time gambling, or traveling.

            Just wanted to share this link.  Even aside from it pretty much showing 2 shooters, it really hits home what it was like up close and personal at the event and it evokes anger thinking that it was some type of orchestrated event (no not isis)

             Read a report that some of the shooters were Irish or British citizens. It would be naturally assumed those of different nationalities are not directly connected to the Deep State. Perhaps they actually could be connected to ISIS.

              isis im pretty sure isn't an entirely organic org anyway and has zionist (or at least western) funding. also, if there's anyway to plant this on "isis" you'd think the msm et al would jump on it (like they usually do) to keep the 'war on terror' going full bore.  i'd say keep looking as to who is usually behind these types of hings

               There already was an article in the NY Times by Pamela Gellar explaining why ISIS was at least partly responsible. At least 3 times ISIS has taken credit, including posting a picture of Mandalay Bay covered in blood on their latest newsletter.

                meh...  most authorities and msm sticking with the 'lone gunmen' meme.  and, as i said earlier, from a lot of info i've seen over multiple years i don't buy into 'isis' at least as it's widely portrayed, so we'll have to agree to disagree

            Also, I want to mention that on Youtube, two or three days ago, Debbie, aka "The Sane Progressive" posted a bunch of videos detailing some very logical and well thought out points which poked some serious holes in the narrative the MSM was trying to sell surrounding Paddock, the timeline, and the footage they were peddling over the news networks. Every single one of those videos were flagged and removed subsequently. She talked about it on her Facebook page yesterday. She mentioned in her videos the MSM's  bogus story about how he slipped and fell in the Belagio. They then release this footage of him surrounded by police and what appear to be agents of some sort in an exit lobby. She made a lot of really great points about it. - However, today the videos are gone. - Here's that link.

            My brother and I were watching youtube the other day and came across this video. - It appears to us, and the commenters that at around 11:30 -11:42 in the video, you can see that the people in the crowd are being spotlit. A bright light is shining on them blinding them. Then you see this guy creep into frame and draw a firing stance on the people trying to get out. He then ominously exits the frame. This was caught on phone I'm assuming.  - The coverup is strong, and with all the new evidence and tips from researchers, - I think they're going to have a hard time keeping this one under wraps.  - here's the link. -

            I keep hearing the suggestion that the Beliman investigation was not connected to paddock  but,  I can't seem to find any explanation as to why Beliman was under investigation otherwise. Does anyone have information or an explanation as to why Beliman was under investigation? Like, the official reason?

              I understand that. What im trying to figure out is if the feds are stating that they were investigating. Usually you have to be looking for something specific and document that on a search warrant. If looking for something related to paddock that would surely prove in my mind that the cia was involved.
