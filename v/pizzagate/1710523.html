            This is something. It's not a "typo" obviously. The shills can't even convince themselve of that, and they're actually getting paid. Jim Jones event... he's asking if the child is going to die as part of the ceremony.

            I'm guessing he/she is saying, "we only have one PIZZA (or pie) and are not sure how to cut it up, because we need to know how many people want some."

            Not to be an idiot, but is there any chance that this email is being misconstrued, due to a typo?
           </p>
           <p>
            What if the author simply meant to say, we only have one PIZZA and don't know how thinly to slice it?
or just one "pie" or whatever....
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, wouldn't that make sense?
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hey everyone...Who wants Pizza? We only have one and are not sure how many pieces to make?"
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel like many of the original emails I was really worried about, don't seem too scary when you look at them a few months apart. They seem just sort of lazy and casual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please -- no flames.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've just seen several of the emails in this pretty much overblown and this sort of "feels" like another one.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, the Podesta posting with one hand painted with a fish and another with the number 14. That picture was really quite easily debunked just looking at the original post and not what people were saying it meant.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you read my other posts, I'm clearly not a shill, but this email just seems like it would be awfully different if just that one word was off.

             It's good practice to question our conclusions and to have a fresh look at these things. So, no flames here. ;) Most of the emails remain very problematic when I read them. The handkerchief with the pizza related map is definitely on top of the list, followed closely by "Do you think I'll do better playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta". Oh and what about "Would you like a pizza for an hour" and "Last night was fun / still in torture chamber".
            </p>
            <p>
             And there's something I don't understand: if this is all just innocent chatter about food, why aren't these people defending themselves? You can be sure that if half of the internet was accusing me of being a pedophile, I would come here and tell the story straight. Look, you got it all wrong because "innocent reason here". Why not one of these people have done this? It's a total mystery to me... that is, unless the emails are not so innocent.

              I like the way you think and appreciate the sincerity.
             </p>
             <p>
              I still do see some of the emails (and most of the IG stuff, bands, art etc.) as extremely off, but some of the emails could be so easily interpreted as meaningless, if sent between close associates.

             <p>
              For example, if one were busy or knew a friend was busy, couldn't they just say casually, "Hey, wanna grab a pizza for an hour?"  -- Couldn't it just be a lazy way of saying "I don't have a lot of time, or I know you don't have a lot of time, let's just get a quick pizza."?
             </p>
             <p>
              As for last night was fun / still in torture chamber:  Seriously, let's suppose you're at work and it is particularly grueling, I mean, I myself have used the term "it's like a torture chamber" to mean I'm stressed out or super busy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Couldn't one easily say something like "Yeah, last night was fun/cool/nice diversion/break/escape, but I'm now back in the "torture chamber" -- meaning back to the shit I had to do before we hung out?
             </p>
             <p>
              Some of these people had major roles in major things. Why wouldn't that feel like torture at times?
             </p>
             <p>
              To interpret that so literally without proof seems pretty far-reaching.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, who would be emailing anyone, if they were actually IN a torture chamber raping or torturing or molesting a child?
             </p>
             <p>
              I just think some of these interpretations are being read literally, when they they be written as casual emails to friends or associates.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I were to say "I'm in hell." -- I would not literally mean I'm in hell, but that circumstances are such that I might feel things are hellish.
             </p>
             <p>
              --
             </p>
             <p>
              As for dominoes on cheese vs pasta, no idea.  -- Still puzzled.
Handkerchief -- no idea.  - Same

              I took a look at my text chats and some emails that I have that are ongoing between friends.
             </p>
             <p>
              Looking at them and not knowing myself or my friends, I look like a crazy chick. Actually, we all do. We talk about what brands of spray paint are the best to huff, we discuss how there is a lack of practicing bird lawyers and what the best packaging would be ship a box of spiders to an enemy. I talk about my dream of owning a "murder cabin" in the woods. If you read that you would think I am insane.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first three are all references to our favorite tv show and the murder cabin would be a scary cabin in the woods that you just know someone was murdered in. That can be easily explained away and someone somewhere would catch the references. These could be inside jokes in the emails for all we know.
             </p>
             <p>
              But there is no one coming forward and ther is no simple explaination for all of it. I would easily be able to explain away my stupid emails. I would explain them and leave it up to people to decide not caring about outcome. Actually I don't even know if I would bother to explain them. However, if I were accused of nasty suit with children I would be on every news show explaining myself. I would sue anyone who posted that I was hurting children and ruin them for even accusing me of it were not true.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember, a simple explaination could clear this all up but no one seems to want to clear their name.

               I see that response as a way of saying a mass infanticide basically. " Disposing of the remnants once we're done with them".. I'm sure they do the children's killings in groups, not singular, as to produce more fear from the children watching and the adrenaline from which evil people feed off of. The more fear and adrenaline, the higher they get. So when someone sees someone else being killed, it strikes the most intense fear within them as they know they're next. A huge circulating wave of adrenaline and terror. I'm sure the methods are beyond imaginable, just as this theory is.. but I'm sure it's been done before (I feel sick beyond belief having to type that out)
              </p>
              <p>
               Just how I view it. I have had to grow a tough exterior to the whole thing. It's the only way I can investigate without deeply pondering and becoming suicidal. Just know the children have eternal life with God, and the people doing this will experience unimaginable pain for all eternity. It will make their killings of these infants seem like a mercy killing in comparison.

            I remember reading that before. I did think it was strange, but I thought it was probably just a sick joke between sickos referencing that they were all involved in the pizza that night and would one day probably have to commit mass suicide if caught. But more in a just kidding kind of way, like arrogant / complacent / almost. Like how Hillary looked during the Benghazi hearings every time she laughed or scoffed.

            Some people believe the CIA was working with Jim Jones on some weird MK-Ultra research and things got out of hand. I don't know who to believe but like everything in this abscessed wisdom tooth psychotic clown pageant there is probably much more to the story than what was officially told to us. For example the location Jim Jones and company set up shop was used previously as a CIA black site dealing with drug running if I remember correctly.

            There are tons of youtube documentaries about it, you'll find them pretty easily.

              This is pure speculation but he could have meant the Jim Jones references as a play on the Mafia's "blood in blood out", as in "We're playing for keeps here people in case anyone forgets." kind of thing.

              Maybe the person or even the group had been reprimanded recently for breaking a rule? Something is up for sure, would you ever send an email to your office mates implying you may all be murdered at the company picnic? Actually don't answer that, lol, I've worked at places where we'd email each other jokes like that. Long story, company running out of money layoffs etc.
