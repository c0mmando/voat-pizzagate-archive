<blockquote>
<p>Justin Trudeau has been a vocal advocate on women’s issues.</p>
<p>Our Prime Minister has been praised, both here and abroad, for his efforts to advance equality among men and women.</p>
<p>He’s been particularly effective advocating for the United Nations and other governments to do more to help women living in violent or oppressive conditions, particularly women in those parts of the world subjected to barbaric practices such as female genital mutilation or child and forced marriages.</p>
<p>We could not be more supportive of this sort of advocacy.</p>
<p>Canada can and should play a leadership role in advancing initiatives that foster real change in the lives of women globally.</p>
<p>However, we have real concerns with plans announced Tuesday by the Liberal government to hand $20 million over to the Clinton Foundation to <strong>“support projects that will provide critical sexual and reproduction health (SRH) services” around the world.</strong></p>
<p>The initiative was created under the umbrella of the Clinton Foundation, formed by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, and prominently supported by both Hillary and daughter Chelsea Clinton.</p>
<p>The Clinton’s have earned millions from their association with the foundation, not from direct compensation, but through book and speaking tour fees.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton, for example, reportedly received $26 million in speaking fees from organizations that donated to the foundation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the lavish foundation-related travel needs of the Clintons – including first-class tickets and charter planes – are covered by its donors.</p>
<p><strong>More problematically, the foundation was at the heart of the cash-for-access scandal that dogged Hillary during her failed bid for the U.S. presidency.</strong></p>
<p>While Hillary was Secretary of State, the Clinton foundation received millions from rich and powerful donors, including foreign governments – many of whom were seeking favorable decisions from the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>Without doubt there were inflammatory allegations during the campaign about improper ethical behaviour, but just as clearly there were legitimate questions about relationships between the donors, the Clintons and their foundation.</p>
<p>And there’s no doubt the foundation has served as a powerful political tool for the Clintons.</p>
<p>Into this sticky wicket wades Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>We take no issue with our government showing leadership on women’s issues.</p>
<p>We do question the wisdom of using Canadian taxpayer cash to get into bed with the Clintons.</p>
<p>Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly noted the sum handed over to the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The total is $20 million, which is a portion of a broader $241.5 million announcement of numerous contributions.</p>

            The CF received millions from rich and powerful donors and foreign govts. hoping for favorable decisions made by the US State Dept.  THIS. Is exactly why many govts. should not be allowed to donate taxpayer money to a private charity.  WHY so many people have failed to understand this just BURNS Me Up!!!

            <p>
             Thanks for sharing this vid.  I'll have to watch it later tonight when I have more time.
When this sub forum first opened I researched a little into how, or if, the Haiti scandal could have been connected to Canada.  I discovered odd timing and circumstances around a woman named Michaelle Jean, from Haiti, immigrated to Canada,  and the Queen appointed her as her go-between-person  (liason) called the Governor General of Canada. This was around the time of the Haiti quake.   Shock that the then Govenor General was pulled and a complete nobody inserted was everywhere.  Her husband is an eclectic film director or producer (can't remember exactly now but I'd never heard of him - he's sub culture indy nobody.)
            </p>
            <p>
             After the Haiti ordeal she withdrew from her position and was given a place in the UN.  I looked into their child help agency.   That's when I stumbled on a lot of   child help fund agencies in Canada that didn't appear to be showing that their massive  fundraising events were helping the children on a level that should reflect the moneys in the streets and families. Most weren't transparent.   I sent my info to a now non-existent  voater called, GrimReader.  This person submitted info that made me seem to trust them.
Nope.
Never heard of GrimReader again but a few weeks later all the agency account info had either changed their data profile info or in some cases scrubbed it altogether.
             <br/>
             A few of the articles involving changes to  ocean port  border shipping and travel law was removed on the major website.  I couldn't find it so I couldn't even remember what website it was, I'd looked at a lot of sites.   That website showed that they were changing how they viewed family and ages travelling to Australia.  the ages of families appeared young.
             <br/>
             My screen shot didn't work, have since changed my laptop,  so I have nothing now.  After I sent it to GrimReader I deleted it from my account because I was scared.
