            That he was called by God three times would resonate with Christians, I would have thought.  I haven't seen if or where he details the mechanism of the Call.
           </p>
           <p>
            And his message about the Deep State is mainly what I had in mind.  I've seen him explain how the seal was killed, in the helicopter crash, but not heard him say why.  And what was the message about the Deep State?  He seemed to think his sister controlled it.
           </p>
           <p>
            He seemed to think Trump had surrounded himself with the military [and marines in particular] as protection against the Deep State.  Of course, there was much more.

              The guy in video clearly didn't watch any of Trump's speeches and doesn't have a clue.

             <p>
              There has been over 4000 arrests, who is he kidding?
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump did bring up the Clinton's and Epstein on multiple occasions during the campaign.
             </p>
             <p>
              If someone that worked for him,  just recently, was arrested for molesting children that just makes me feel that much more confident in him doing the right thing, and that was a judge, so he is working his way up.

                This was addressed during the election to. He did go there and when he realized what they were trying to do, (blackmail him) he picked up and left. Do you have ANY credible evidence that shows he did anything wrong?

                 He lied about Jerry Epstein's connection and how many times he was in contact with him. he made jokes about him liking his women young, there are phone logs with trump and Jerry, Thats enough for me.

                  How do you know that didn't take place prior to Trump figuring out what Epstein was about? I remember on a few occasions, Trump stated "Epstein said these girls were his neices, one can have so many neices before you figure out something is not right."  I watched every speech he gave.  Can you post the phone logs? Or video of him lying?

                   I am just bringing a few facts to light, I know we want so badly to believe that Trump is doing something great for us and is working against the sick fuckers in our government. Hilary, Podesta, Alefantis are laughing in the worlds face right now. Trump lied about his connection to Jerry Epstein. i dont see anything changing except for a drama show between trump and obama.

                   Read the information above in regards to Trumps lies on his connection to Jerry Epstein. As far as the Syrian crises, Trump did exactly what Obama did on the Fake Sarin gas attack blaming Assad and continuing the support of the rebel terrorists.  Trump is continuing the war and sells of weapons to the Saudis. Trump has just expanded Monsanto's power just like Obama. How can one care for children and allow these unjust wars to continue? Many innocent children are dying every day.  The only thing I see thats keeping people thinking that there is change, is that they are playing a personal drama between Trump and Obama. No high level official involved with Pizzagate is even questioned and still is making decisions for America. When Obama came back from vacation, back out in the public eye the first thing he did is program the people and said that he had to remind the people how radically different he is from Trump. If Obama is so radically different than Trump, why do we need a reminder? what has really changed?

            As for Tim Nolan, just be grateful that it was even covered on small and local news outlets.  MOST child sex abuse cases don't even make it that far!  Especially if the perpetrators are Jews or Protestants!!!

            Nolan is small potatoes, hasn't been a judge since 1986, back then many county/district  judges didn't even need to be lawyers in some of these rural backwater  Kentucky communities. Campbell County population is 90,000 altho It is part of the Cinncinatti metro area across the Ohio River out of Nolans political jurisdiction and influence. One girl exploited and used by several customers and/or friends of Nolan . Nolan did play a significant role in primary selecting delegates to cast vote for Trump but no hint of further connections with Trump.  He was likely a large fish in a small pond in Kentucky for 2016 only.  I've already wasted my time in bringing forth these details  but I just want to put it in some perspective. While all trafficking is horrible this is not a case of a well connected big cheese with any significant link to Trump beyond the election. It's a local ho hum story that does not reflect on Trump.

             Do you think this is note worthy?
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump's attorney Alan Garten told VICE News in January 29, 2016 that the presidential candidate had "no relationship" with Epstein, and only knew him because Epstein was a member of Mar-A-Lago, Trump's private club and residence in Palm Beach.
            </p>
            <p>
             "A lot of people hung out there, including Jeffrey Epstein," Garten said. "That is the only connection."
            </p>
            <p>
             But according to someone with intimate knowledge of the situation, Trump and Epstein appeared to have a somewhat stronger connection.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,'' Trump told New York magazine in a 2002 profile of Epstein written three years before Epstein began to be investigated. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
            </p>
            <p>
             When asked about a subpoena served to Trump in 2009, Garten said it "never happened." The subpoena called for Trump to give a deposition in a case against Epstein; Garten's denial baffled Brad Edwards, one of Virginia Roberts' attorneys.
            </p>
            <p>
             "There is no debate over what happened," Edwards told VICE news. "I served Mr. Trump with a subpoena for deposition in 2009. He talked to me voluntarily, and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information…. I can't imagine there being any dispute of any of this."
            </p>
            <p>
             Edwards also said that it is "obvious" Trump himself was not involved in any of Epstein's illicit activity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Three days after denying the subpoena, Garten emailed VICE News.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Brad [Edwards] called me to let me know that you had reached out to him," Garten said. "I looked back at my records and saw that Mr. Trump was subpoenaed."
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2000, both Trump and Epstein reportedly attended a small party hosted by media magnate Conrad Black, who in 2007 was convicted and served time in prison for fraud and obstruction of justice (the fraud charges were overturned on appeal). Black is currently an enthusiastic supporter of Trump's presidential bid.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffrey's private jet at least once. Meanwhile, message pads [see below] from Epstein's Palm Beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by VICE News indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.

              What I'm  trying to say is this not HUGE.  I want to see a really big cheese fall! Or melt. I'm talking about someone ranked in the top 100 influential people in DC , or NYC, Nolan doesn't qualify.

             Trump's attorney Alan Garten told VICE News in January 29, 2016 that the presidential candidate had "no relationship" with Epstein, and only knew him because Epstein was a member of Mar-A-Lago, Trump's private club and residence in Palm Beach.
            </p>
            <p>
             "A lot of people hung out there, including Jeffrey Epstein," Garten said. "That is the only connection."
            </p>
            <p>
             But according to someone with intimate knowledge of the situation, Trump and Epstein appeared to have a somewhat stronger connection.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,'' Trump told New York magazine in a 2002 profile of Epstein written three years before Epstein began to be investigated. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
            </p>
            <p>
             When asked about a subpoena served to Trump in 2009, Garten said it "never happened." The subpoena called for Trump to give a deposition in a case against Epstein; Garten's denial baffled Brad Edwards, one of Virginia Roberts' attorneys.
            </p>
            <p>
             "There is no debate over what happened," Edwards told VICE news. "I served Mr. Trump with a subpoena for deposition in 2009. He talked to me voluntarily, and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information…. I can't imagine there being any dispute of any of this."
            </p>
            <p>
             Edwards also said that it is "obvious" Trump himself was not involved in any of Epstein's illicit activity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Three days after denying the subpoena, Garten emailed VICE News.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Brad [Edwards] called me to let me know that you had reached out to him," Garten said. "I looked back at my records and saw that Mr. Trump was subpoenaed."
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2000, both Trump and Epstein reportedly attended a small party hosted by media magnate Conrad Black, who in 2007 was convicted and served time in prison for fraud and obstruction of justice (the fraud charges were overturned on appeal). Black is currently an enthusiastic supporter of Trump's presidential bid.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffrey's private jet at least once. Meanwhile, message pads [see below] from Epstein's Palm Beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by VICE News indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.

                 There are phone logs with Trump and Epstein
                </p>
                <p>
                 Trump's attorney Alan Garten told VICE News last week that the presidential candidate had "no relationship" with Epstein, and only knew him because Epstein was a member of Mar-A-Lago, Trump's private club and residence in Palm Beach.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "A lot of people hung out there, including Jeffrey Epstein," Garten said. "That is the only connection."
                </p>
                <p>
                 But according to someone with intimate knowledge of the situation, Trump and Epstein appeared to have a somewhat stronger connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,'' Trump told New York magazine in a 2002 profile of Epstein written three years before Epstein began to be investigated, on January 29, 2016 "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

              What is this tape you mention that has trump admitting that he sexually assaults people? If you are referring to the edited pussygate video than your opinion is worth shit if you fell for something at face value without every fact checking it.

               The American public in general doesn't give a shit about sex scandals. Hearing that he flew in a jet with a bunch of beautiful women to go to an island to hang out with a registered sex offender really wouldn't touch the American conscious.

              I have heard that one, and it is a good question? But again its another thing that brings in FEAR and makes one believe that we should be afraid to get rid of this massive sickness!, I say NO!, bring the filth down now, lets clean up and not let it fester and burn on any longer, this reality is getting disgusting to a most shocking degree.

             yeah cuz msm isn't compromised, bought and paid for by globalist entities which on some level at least approved of trump's election.  they'll smear trump with all types of fairly unimportant stuff, but will leave alone anything that runs deep such as Epstein's pedo/compromise enterprise  (how else would you explain Epstein getting to go to jail for like less than a year where he could leave each day and had private cell AND the names of anyone else given immunity as part of plea deal?)  BTW, i have yet to watch the linked vid above and am still on fence about how involved Trump was with Epstein, but please don't tell me that the MSM would open up such a rabbit hole

            I kind of hope they have something on Trump because to be honest Trump is a fucking idiot and I can easily see him being stupid enough to get caught banging underage girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't see Trump's exit changing anything in fact I think it would shut up the MSM because they'd have nothing to talk about anymore whiiiiiiiich kind of makes me think Trump isn't going anywhere.

            Who knows. All I know is this cluster fuck is coming down. Field McConnell says he's never seen so many people getting involved in his reporting, asking him questions, offering to help etc. This thing is going to go viral as some point this year, it's too big to forget. It's too big to get distracted from by some false flag attack in Syria or putting a few carriers through the South China Sea.

             He was also talking about 10,000 views or so.  Not infowars numbers.  But I can see his message resonating with the Christians and, boy! do they know how to get out the Good News.
