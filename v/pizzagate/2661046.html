            Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer is not one of the ONLY TWENTY PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on an imageboard. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from multiple people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 20 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors bleeding onto imageboards expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved!
            <em>
             Don’t ever question the validity of these claims!

            Just spend MONTHS ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

            <strong>
             Here are some more questions you’re too afraid to answer:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you substantiate your claims?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you answer any questions that someone asks about the credibility of his statements?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you answer any questions that someone asks about the MERE CONTENTS of his statements?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why did nothing he said in the first half of November come true? Much less any of his longer-term predictions.
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why would he ALERT HIS FUCKING ENEMIES about a mass arrest on a public venue?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why isn’t he using this public venue (again, alerting all of his enemies and exposing him and his coup attempt) to DIRECT PATRIOTS AT A LOCAL LEVEL? Because he isn’t.
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why did these alerts begin MONTHS before the actual events? Do you have any idea how quickly these traitors can mobilize and flee a country? Still waiting for that martial law, by the way.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Do you fucking faggots put ANY thought into your spam these days? Why isn’t Q posting standardized, organized talking points that we, as individuals all around the country, would use in our home cities? When the fucking power goes out. When the fucking news comes on with, “We’re just getting word that Donald Trump has directed members of the armed forces to arrest every member of congress, much of the agencies of the executive branch, several justices, and may even be performing arrests of news officials. This is a coup, ladies and gentlemen…” NORMALFAGS ARE GOING TO BE FUCKING TERRIFIED, CONFUSED, AND WILL RALLY AROUND SOMEONE THEY KNOW AND TRUST IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITES (between rioting, that is). So if Q is real–and is a patriot–why isn’t he disseminating things for us to hold onto that can be spoken through a loudspeaker in a town square, when surrounded by friends, family, and fellow citizens?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because he’s not real. Because his earliest claims were proven false. Because only a fucking dipshit would give MONTHS notice to kikes of their “imminent” (Still waiting! Listen and believe!) arrests. And because only a fucking PAID SHILL would think we would fall for the “free lunch” scenario where the ✡government✡ (funny how Q, the civic nationalist, hasn’t directly mentioned anything about jewish control, huh?) arrests itself and we, the people, don’t have to lift a FUCKING FINGER, because the ZOG military will SURELY protect us!

            Now please, run along and kill yourself, you pathetic milquetoast piece of moral relativist shit.

             I call on anyone else who normally posts on CBTS or any of the other Q-related… what do I want to say, discussions… to enter into a dialogue.
            </strong>
            I’ve been following Q since the first threads in late October. I would like my questions answered, because none of the fucking faggots shilling for Q anywhere else on any other board is man enough to answer them.

               Here are some more questions you’re too afraid to answer:
              </strong>
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               If Q is real, why can’t you substantiate your claims?
              </li>
              <li>
               If Q is real, why can’t you answer any questions that someone asks about the credibility of his statements?
              </li>
              <li>
               If Q is real, why can’t you answer any questions that someone asks about the MERE CONTENTS of his statements?
              </li>
              <li>
               If Q is real, why did nothing he said in the first half of November come true? Much less any of his longer-term predictions.
              </li>
              <li>
               If Q is real, why would he ALERT HIS FUCKING ENEMIES about a mass arrest on a public venue?
              </li>
              <li>
               If Q is real, why isn’t he using this public venue (again, alerting all of his enemies and exposing him and his coup attempt) to DIRECT PATRIOTS AT A LOCAL LEVEL? Because he isn’t.
              </li>
              <li>
               If Q is real, why did these alerts begin MONTHS before the actual events? Do you have any idea how quickly these traitors can mobilize and flee a country? Still waiting for that martial law, by the way.
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              Do you fucking faggots put ANY thought into your spam these days? Why isn’t Q posting standardized, organized talking points that we, as individuals all around the country, would use in our home cities? When the fucking power goes out. When the fucking news comes on with, “We’re just getting word that Donald Trump has directed members of the armed forces to arrest every member of congress, much of the agencies of the executive branch, several justices, and may even be performing arrests of news officials. This is a coup, ladies and gentlemen…” NORMALFAGS ARE GOING TO BE FUCKING TERRIFIED, CONFUSED, AND WILL RALLY AROUND SOMEONE THEY KNOW AND TRUST IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITES (between rioting, that is). So if Q is real–and is a patriot–why isn’t he disseminating things for us to hold onto that can be spoken through a loudspeaker in a town square, when surrounded by friends, family, and fellow citizens?
             </p>
             <p>
              Because he’s not real. Because his earliest claims were proven false. Because only a fucking dipshit would give MONTHS notice to kikes of their “imminent” (Still waiting! Listen and believe!) arrests. And because only a fucking PAID SHILL would think we would fall for the “free lunch” scenario where the ✡government✡ (funny how Q, the civic nationalist, hasn’t directly mentioned anything about jewish control, huh?) arrests itself and we, the people, don’t have to lift a FUCKING FINGER, because the ZOG military will SURELY protect us!

              I’ve been following Q since the first threads in late October. I would like my questions answered, because none of the fucking faggots shilling for Q anywhere else on any other board is man enough to answer them.

                 Nowhere was any pizzagate user (or anyone who believes in it) called a jewish spammer. Pizzagate (and its attendant predecessor groups–“pedogate” and “pedowood”) is proven to be true. It’s part of a far-reaching and decades-old system of child trafficking.

            Nearly every time politicians, celebrities or elite behave strangely, something akin to Trump Derangement Syndrome, it bolsters FBI Anon's earlier remarks. I ask myself if their behavior matches his accusations. It does always.

            My anti-Trump coworker heard about Q on NPR and started up a conversation with me. Apparently NPR is saying Q is Trump. I told him it didn't matter who Q is, but that Q has predicted future events and brought attention to criminal behavior. Pointed out some examples that he checked in real time on his computer. Seeing a hard core liberal, Obama fan, red pilled is something you don't forget.

            His jaw on floor, asks outloud, "Have you ever wondered what else they've lied about?"   I chuckled and told him to start with the Kennedy assassination.

            Thing is, it didn't just start under the Obama administration.  Its a non-partisan swamp. Every new government that takes control just continues and piles onto the corruption and evils of the previous one. The Bush years were also horrendous. He brought 9-11 and the invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq and more. Clinton... Poppy Bush... need I say more? Nixon was a choir boy in comparison to what came after him. 
I have to say, so far, Trump has been a breath of fresh air in regards to the atrocities committed.

             Yep. And how come that Trump appointed John Bolton of all people as his NSA? Bolton, who was one of the hawks of the Bush administration plotting the Iraq invasion....

                 You're not using commas correctly, so you really need to get off your podium and get back to what's important. Best to you.

                  Don’t discredit this sub by communicating like a grade 5. It doesn’t help anyone. I’m happy to learn and read about the information in your post but you aren’t doing yourself or any of the others any favours. All it takes is a screenshot, and everyone gets written off as stupid conspiracy theorists who can’t spell.

            People who support this Q character are going to feel like jackasses when his identity is finally revealed and everyone realizes that he is just an average jerk who doesn't know anything. I was listening to Lionel over at the Lionel nation, and he was gushing about Q. Talk about a Q fanboy! It was embarrassing.

             If I were Q, and my intentions were pure, then even if I knew nothing over-all, the breadcrumbs I do know, and have dropped, have lead many autists to find the truth of our recent history.  I would feel happy to go down as a sham, especially if it helps the movement to a better America.
            </p>
            <p>
             If my intentions were not pure, I would try and create divide.  So far, the only people trying to create divide are the MSM, Shills, and useful idiots.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q is playing a game that is making the right people scared.  I hope to keep them scared, because fear leads to mistakes.

             from.the thousands of sealed indictments, but Im.sceptical, too. Could these excessive number of indictments refer to.immigration  cases? I dont feel like we have been.given adequate  clues.  Might these be in reference to asset forfeitures as a result of Trumps executitive orders? Could it be indictments against foreign nationals that we cant arrest because they are not within our jurisdiction but they can be nabbed if they ever cross our borders? I am just speculating.

              I’ve been seeing more and more Trafficking and pedo ring arrests.  Here’s a great resource group.  Great Awakening on Reddit.

             </p>
             <p>
              And on this Great Awakening site, here’s the indictment info.  Notice that the busiest states are generally southern border - trafficking - and northeastern - including the politicians heavily involved?

              I noticed in all your speculation you conveniently avoiding making the case for human trafficking and treason being behind the MASSIVE AND UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF SEALED INDICTMENTS.

              This could all still take quite a while. There's still much to be revealed; even more being processed behind the scenes.

               My hope is that they're timing it out for the elections. If there's no boom similar to when comey reopened the clinton investigation right before the last election, I will become discouraged. Hopefully I'm right. I know I would drop the big stuff around September or maybe October if it were up to me.

                This is what I suspect the plan is, as well. There's no way anyone with any business sense -- let alone someone who likes winning as much as DJT -- would orchestrate this sophisticated and successful of a communication campaign selling such specific promises if there wasn't a plan to deliver on them before that huge of an accountability event. The whole thing would implode and doom everyone associated with it to perpetual ignominy.

                I expect the shitstorm to hit before the election, and the 11-11 parade to be a key element. I think Trump is going to bring the people in to peacefullly take back Washington, D.C. in an event that will hearken back to Julius Caesar bringing the Roman army home to Rome across the Rubicon. He's going to scare the piss out of the Cabal.

                 So far, Qniversists have just 'forgotten' how many predictions haven't come true - ankle boots anyone? Soros going to 'a very special place' anyone? (He turned up in public shortly after that, at Davos.) Sex slaves rescued by Salman after Trump's visit (there never has been
                 <em>
                  any
                 </em>
                 proof). Etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So I guess Q/Trump doesn't have to worry. Qvernists will continue finding excuses for everything that doesn't happen. :-/

                <p>
                 But hey Vin, I'd be delighted if you'd join Eric and me for a couple of beers after the whole Q stuff will turn out to have been a psy-op and nothing else.... :-) :-) :-)

                  Tons of predictions have come true, would the mainstream media report that they had ankle boots on? They tried to hide it. Of course not. Would the mainstream media report if there were any arrests? No.

                  We don’t know what’s happening behind the scenes. But, what people get wrong all the time is that they are taking what WE may interpret, and they put a Q label on it. Q didn’t say these things. I don’t know wheee this is even coming from.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Be careful to not take an anons opinion and mistake it for something Q said.

                  "Believe" is the wrong word. It's a theory which remains to be seen and which fits the observations of events as well as likely outcomes. It may well be proven wrong. Time will tell. :-)  I think it's a bit premature to say Q fans are "finding excuses" when the timeline Q laid out from the beginning hasn't played out yet. Especially given the mammoth scope of the corruption problem we know exists and which Q has continually referenced.

                    Why do you say this? There are multiple photos of both of them in cast boots. McStain has it on one foot in one photo, and the other foot in another photo a week later.

                    I don't know of any Q post that references sex slaves in SA. He did reference Haiti trafficking being "paused" until the full dismantling of curruption is complete.

                     Sorry, I was tired. Yes, they had ankle boots. I meant ankle monitors - obviously they now don't have boots anymore from what I have seen / understood, and that wouldn't make any sense.

                      It would if, as Q has said, extradition arrangements had been made with everywhere they would run to and their passports have been flagged. There would then be no need for ankle monitors.

                      I never saw that, and I have been looking through the leaks and have not found it. What Q did say (numerous times) is that the House of Saud was the funding for the majority of the Cabal's nefarious shit, and the MBS coup in SA cut the purse strings and thus the majority of the Cabal's power (though not all).

                BUT, The executive order that Trump signed allowing for the military tribunals and arrests does not start until Jan 2019. Besides, even tho tons of the swamp have either resigned or been fired, we still have to get rid of some if we don’t want people getting away with it. We have bad people in high positions everywhere.
               </p>
               <p>
                If we don’t do things right and in the order in which will make it stick, then there is no point in arresting anyone at all. This isn’t something that is a quick process.
               </p>
               <p>
                I won’t argue with you. It’s just hard to explain to someone who hasn’t been following along. It’s really in depth.

                 So it's January 2019 now?

                <p>
                 Which EO are you referring to exactly? (I admit that I might have forgotten about it - I only see people talking about the EO that has been aiming at foreign nationals, and wrongly thinking it could be used for arrests of US citizens.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 And why military tribunals in the first place? I can't believe that you guys are delighted at the prospect of military tribunals and Martial Law.

                 What about restoring the civil liberties that were taken away by the Patriot Act?

                  If we don’t do things right and in the order in which will make it stick, then there is no point in arresting anyone at all. This isn’t something that is a quick process.

                <p>
                 I don't agree. 1,5 years should be enough to arrest lots of pedos. Just use the CIA blackmail files.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And you think there are no pedos among the people Trump appointed? Do you honestly think the Trump administration doesn't use the same MO like any other government before? And why did he choose John Bolton as his NSA, a hawk from the Bush administration?
                </p>
                <p>
                 You think there are no pedos among high-ranking military, who might take over?

                  As far as pedos... Of course, there are pedos on both the Republican and democrat side. That’s why there have been so many resugnations.

                I don't necessarily disagree with you or fault anyone for wanting something to be done sooner rather than later, it's killing me too, having to sit here doing my thing while seemingly very little is done with regards to arrests.
               </p>
               <p>
                The point I was making is not to dose yourself up on hopes that 'mass arrest [are] coming soon', as this can just lead to disappointment and frustration, making it harder to have any amount of patience. Unfortunately, patience is still necessary at this point, even considering the proximity Trump has to people we know are bad.

                 Trump could start with people who are working for him - or does anyone here believe there are no pedos in team Trump?
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                A brilliant case in point there is Cindy McCain. We know she's a fucker and I'm guessing Trump does too, by now at least.
               </p>
               <p>
                Personally, the reason I can remain patient, is because I know that I myself have several somethings coming up which will help put the final nails in the coffin - if nothing changes after said nails are hammered in, I'll be more inclined to lose my patience :P

            I have commented about this 3 or 4 times in the past few days...Its so.much easier to gripe about mis-spellings than it is to study the situation.  Q predicted that something big was going to happen and he was right. He predicted that MSM would get their 4:30.am memos to castigate Q in unison the next day.and thus the Streisand effect has the whole  world asking : who is Q.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many naysayers here who will role their collective eyes at Q. For those of you who are open minded, I urge you to play Praying Medic's  "proofs" announced in July, then read or listen to all of his programs in chronological order for July and August.  When you are finished, then express your opinions here..You can read the 1700+ Q drops but PM does the work for you.
