<p>First, Comet is a small fraction of pizzagate.</p>
<p>Second, the idea of it being&quot;proof&quot; is a red herring as crowd sourcing information is only good for finding suspicious information.</p>
<p>Third, the photos on Instagram chosen are cherry picked and then tossed out because Alefantis didn\'t even post them.</p>
<p>Fourth, no mention of Alefantis\'s profile picture being pedo lover Antinoo.</p>
<p>Fifth, they focus on some really fringey stuff here and don\'t get to any truly suspicious data like Haiti death of Petersen and Silsby\'s
arrest (they do conveniently mention tunnels and connect it to Haiti), Podesta\' code words are barely touched upon, Podesta\'s art not explained, the bands that play at Comet who make pedo jokes and show the symbols are not mentioned, no mention of Breitbart\'s calling Podesta A pedo and his subsequent death.</p>
<p>Sixth, they just take Alefantis\' word for it when it comes to the photos he actually put up. This is not research. Especially if he has not been able to actually back up what he is saying (&quot;we don\'t have a basement&quot; anyone?)</p>
<p>I can go on but I think we should analyze this hatchet job as a community.</p>',
