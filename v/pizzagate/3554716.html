            when fiona barnett described australia and I think sydney specifically as "a pedophiles paradise", my first thought is that she was definitely largely referring to the kings cross and darlinghurst area, in the 70's - 90's, which was a major redlight district and tourist area. I once met a man who grew up in boys homes in the 70's. He told me that he was brought to an infamous male prostitution beat in this area in broad daylight by his "carers", who encouraged him to join other boys from state care who were being prostituted from the pavement there in broad daylight. It was well known, during those decades that underaged boys were prostituted  there, and they could be plainly seen by any passerby or local, whether they realised what was going on with them or not. Many of these boys were addicted to heroin and / or homeless. There were also underaged girls working the streets in the female prostitution beat/territory and they would have been more numerous. Child prostitutes also frequented the el alemain fountain park and the pinball parlours and video game arcades that were on darlinghurst road in the 80's. Understand that this is the most populated area in the southern hemisphere, and the most famous and infamous area in australia. It was extremely popular in those days.

            Evidently he as a pedo  Child rapist did not classify Children as humans. They look through blinders when it comes to wrong or right. Their rights come first and totally skewed. Children are there for their taking. This the sick perverted world of a pedophile.

            anyone who lived in kings cross in the 70's to early 90s, and many who visited during this time as well can attest to the fact that well underage boys were openly prostituted at the infamous 'wall' / green park beat for male prostitutes at the top of darlinghurst road

             she has mentioned kings cross as a child trafficking hotspot. I always thought when she described australia and I think she specifically said sydney as a "pedophiles paradise" that she was referring largely to the kings cross/darlinghurst area in the 70's - 90's. At one particularly infamous male prostitution beat on the main road of the  it was common to see very underaged boys loitering even in broad daylight. It was pretty well known what was going on there. It allegedly dates back even to the 1800's when boys and young men were trafficked there in the manner of a victorian era child labour auction.
