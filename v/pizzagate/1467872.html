<p>I checked out the three files that did not have to be downloaded, which were the ones dated 31-December-1979. These were all medical/dental/psychological records about Julian Assange. These are in the <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file/cms/">cms</a> folder. The other files which predate October 18th look like audio and video files. I am too afraid to download any of the other files, however, because of rumors that Wikileaks is compromised. </p>
<p>I am much, much more curious about what is in the <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file/icwatch/">icwatch</a> folder. The file titled fbi_dhs.7z could potentially be worth checking out in light of this pizzagate investigation. Is there anybody out there who is brave enough to download this file and check the contents? Given the current state of Wikileaks I do not advise anyone to download this file unless they know how to stay safe and anonymous, but I think there are people here who are bright enough to do that.</p>',

            Good find.  I think we have to be very careful with information that we are looking at online.  I'm beginning to consider the possibility that some information is compromised in order to discredit us.

            I found the icwatch folder on archive.org with different dates. I downloaded the fbi_dhs, but did not extract it. I did check to see what was in it and there are 2 JSON files, FBI.JSON and DHS.JSON

            It's javascript database. I don't know enough about it to unzip that sucker. I deleted it.

            Wow, some of those files are huge. As far as the date change goes, if individual files were copied to these locations AFTER things got changed to 1984, they could just be retaining their original time/date stamps.
