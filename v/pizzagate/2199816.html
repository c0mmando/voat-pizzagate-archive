            Nice try guys. Ads are transparent and testimonial ads are sad. Those who attempt them here are obviously desperate and afraid, and I understand why you'd try anything at this point being in your situation, but know that this attempt, like all of your deceptions,  will ultimately end in your untergang. You guys like words, right?
