<p>RebelSkum is the owner and creator of the wiki site. He hasn\'t posted anything for 4 months on Voat nor has he for Steemit after commenting frequently. By frequently, I mean all the time. He was very commited and organized all of his sources and information. He hasn\'t made a post or answered anyone\'s concerns about the suspension of pizzagate.wiki on steemit, which can be bought now as a domain page on Godaddy.</p>

<p><strong>Why create a 16,000 page database of pedogate and all those involved if you\'re just going to delete it, and then shut down all the rest of your sites?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>So, somebody wanted Pizzagate.wiki off the web or at least specific information on the site.</p>
<p>The reason why I beleive is wasn\'t deleted by Rebel but censored by someone is becuase of the swift deletion of thousands of pizzagate archives on several archive sites. So, after the deletion of the website a brigade of people started to deleted archive links from the site. </p>
<hr />
<p>Update: He wrote a voat post on his rebelscum account 5 months ago that provides evidence that someone has been ddosing his site; trying to change numerous things on his stratfor page. IP shows aformer dynocorp or what has moved into the MA location. So, massive DDOS attack on pizzagate.wiki. Site shuts down with all of his other sites and shortly after archives of the sources are deleted!!! This was cordinated, no doubt about it.</p>

            Nice try guys. Ads are transparent and testimonial ads are sad. Those who attempt them here are obviously desperate and afraid, and I understand why you'd try anything at this point being in your situation, but know that this attempt, like all of your deceptions,  will ultimately end in your untergang. You guys like words, right?
