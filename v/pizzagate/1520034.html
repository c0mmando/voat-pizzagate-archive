<p>The only discussion I\'ve seen about this thread was the fact that Podesta found out Tim Kaine was HRC\'s VP pick as early as July 2015. The rest of the thread received little if any analysis and is somewhat confusing, if not disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>Quick email summary:</strong></p>
<p>July 15, 2015 </p>
<ul>
<li>Time unknown - Erick Mullen, who is at dinner with some senators, emails Podesta letting him know that HCR personally told Tim Kaine he\'s the veep.</li>
<li>8:50 PM - John Podesta, &quot;And here I thought it was going to be me.&quot;</li>
<li>Time unknown - Erick Mullen, &quot;We\'d get your famous spaghetti and meatballs at least!&quot;  <em>(Huh? Why would you get spaghetti and meatballs if Podesta becomes the Vice President? Makes no sense.)</em></li>
<li>8:57 PM - John Podesta, &quot;I was hoping to be on the Cheney program... I don\'t really know him. Is he just a self promoter?&quot;</li>
<li>11:16 PM - Erick Mullen, &quot;Me neither. Maybe it\'s just what people do at fundraising dinners. I’m sure I\'m overreacting... I\'m off to <strong>tickle the kids</strong> and relieve Kelly. Have a good one! Erick&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>WTH - who goes to tickle their kids that late at night before relieving their wife? </p>
<p>Do these two even have kids? My limited research did not uncover any evidence of them having children. I could sure use some help digging.</p>
<p>I do know that Erick and Kelly were married in 2001 and the ceremony was performed by none other than Hillary Clinton. I also know that Kelly served as one of David Brock\'s top advisers during Media Matters\' formation in 2004 and became the managing director of the Democracy Alliance. Erick Mullen was former aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer and now a big time Washington lobbyist.</p>
<p>This power couple is defiantly part of the Clinton core – and if it is found they don’t have any kids, another incriminating lead. If it\'s found they do have kids, still a strange if not disturbing thread.</p>',

            This may deserve another thread, but Podesta hoping for the Dick Cheney treatment reveals that he truly is the brains behind the Clintons, the man behind the curtain. I think this is a crucial piece of information.

            No, it's NOT normal to tickle your kids at night when they're supposed to be asleep. Tickling is a method used by pedos to groom the children.

            Knowing the background of the Podesta Boys I believe this calls for looking into. I find it creepy that Hillary married them. I read before that Bill also married someone.  What a bunch of sick kooks.

            On the whole tickling thing, someone posted a clip from family guy where Lois tickles Stewie, then throws up all over him and says "I'm sorry I'm so nervous, it's just I like you so much". There is also a crescent moon, known as a satanic symbol, on his bed.

            Fine thought, but even without autocorrect, etc, it could be an innocent remark.
            <br/>
            As in:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I'm off to tickle the kids (as in tickle them, literally, because he is playing with his kids), and relieve Kelly (as in, relieve her of her duties entertaining the kids)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Nobody uses the term "relieve" to mean "get off". And nobody is going to email their friend and say "well, I'm off to tickle my kids then make my wife cum".
           </p>
           <p>
            There's nothing here.

             Sorry but this made me genuinely lol - since when has 'tickle the kids' meant 'to play with ones balls and masturbate'?! That's great though, I think you should add it to urban dictionary and maybe it will catch on.

            I think this is one that can be resolved. Tickle is an auto correct for tuck in. "Tuckln" offered me "tickle" and "ticking" but not tuck in. So he is going home to tuck in the kids and give his wife a break from watching the kids. Sounds normal to me.
           </p>

            I have no idea what to make of the spaghetti and meatballs. That doesn't make any sense in that context.

             I would say that the spaghetti and meatballs one is not weird.
            </p>
            <p>
             Podesta is known among his friends and publicly as something of a chef. The other guy was saying that if he would have been elected, at least they would have gotten some good dinner out of the deal, kind of a friendly way of saying hey sorry man, you didn't get the nomination.
            </p>
            <p>
             Really, this is kind of a stupid thing to analyze. It doesn't lead anywhere; it's just "omg he said spaghetti and meatballs." Unlike the pizza emails, it can easily be explained as regular conversation.

             I second that. The email even reads "Erick's iPhone" at the end. I and U are next to each other, so "tickin" corrected to tickle instead of tuck in is a likely autocorrect error.

            " I'm off to tickle the kids and relieve Kelly. Have a good one! Erick"---Alone that is not abnormal.   Tickle means have fun with your kids while giving your wife a break(relieving) from watching them all day.
           </p>
           <p>
            11:16 pm at the earliest to play with kids..i assume they are small..is late to be up, even in the summer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other parts of the email are weird and it makes it more convoluted when the Podesta's also cook for fun.

            In this context I don't believe "relieve" means he's going to do the no pants dance with his wife. I'm reading it as she was stuck at home baby sitting them while Erick was at dinner. Just my 2 cents

             I tried coming from that angle as well, that she was just stuck at home with the kids and he came to relieve her. But tickling, or playing with your kids that late at night so your wife can relax seems odd. It really depends on the age of the kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you consider though the message he sent just before this one which contained potential pedo-code, I just don't think this should be brushed under the rug.
