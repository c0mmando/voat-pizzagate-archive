<p>What else :</p>
<p>SOLLIS HEALTH LAB</p>
<p>170 E 77th St</p>
<p><strong>Lower Level</strong></p>
<p>New York, NY 10075</p>
<p>is on the ground floor of the LARGEST BLOOD LABORATORIES IN THE USA: NORTHWELL HEALTH</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As one of the <strong>largest laboratory systems in the Northeast</strong>, Northwell Health Labs recognizes the importance of laboratory results in a patient\'s care. We offer a wide variety of clinical testing procedures at our conveniently located Patient Service Centers across New York City and Long Island, where our phlebotomists examine <strong>samples of blood</strong>, urine, other bodily fluids and tissue to get information about a patient’s health. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Northwell Health makes $13Billion yearly, is one of the main beneficiaries of covid testing, and seems to have CUOMO by the nipple rings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governor Cuomo said on Sunday: “I want to thank our host very much, Northwell. Michael Dowling, to my left, is head of Northwell. They’ve done an extraordinary job all through this situation. They have an extraordinary leader in Michael Dowling. Michael Dowling ran health care for the State of New York, health services for the State of New York. He worked with my father. Came for one year, wound up staying with my father for 12 years in State service. He’s one of the really beautiful and brilliant leaders in this State. It’s a pleasure to be with him. I want to say to all the people of Northwell who have done extraordinary jobs, thank you so, so much. Thank you for having us today.”</p>
<p>Michael Dowling is one of health care’s most influential voices, taking a stand on societal issues such as gun violence and immigration that many health system CEOs shy away from. As Northwell Health’s CEO, he leads a clinical, academic and research enterprise with a workforce of more than 72,000 and annual revenue of $13.5 billion. Northwell is the largest health care provider and private employer in New York State, caring for more than two million people annually through a vast network of nearly 800 outpatient facilities, including 220 primary care practices, 52 urgent care centers, home care, rehabilitation and end-of-life programs, and 23 hospitals.</p>
<p>Northwell also pursues pioneering research at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and a visionary approach to medical education highlighted by the Zucker School of Medicine, the Hofstra Northwell School of Graduate Nursing and Physician Assistant Studies, and one of the nation’s largest medical residency and fellowship programs.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming president and CEO in 2002, Mr. Dowling was the health system’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. Before joining Northwell Health in 1995, he was a senior vice president at Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield.</p>

           Northwell Health makes $13Billion yearly, is one of the main beneficiaries of covid testing, and seems to have CUOMO by the nipple rings.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Governor Cuomo said on Sunday: “I want to thank our host very much, Northwell. Michael Dowling, to my left, is head of Northwell. They’ve done an extraordinary job all through this situation. They have an extraordinary leader in Michael Dowling. Michael Dowling ran health care for the State of New York, health services for the State of New York. He worked with my father. Came for one year, wound up staying with my father for 12 years in State service. He’s one of the really beautiful and brilliant leaders in this State. It’s a pleasure to be with him. I want to say to all the people of Northwell who have done extraordinary jobs, thank you so, so much. Thank you for having us today.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Dowling is one of health care’s most influential voices, taking a stand on societal issues such as gun violence and immigration that many health system CEOs shy away from. As Northwell Health’s CEO, he leads a clinical, academic and research enterprise with a workforce of more than 72,000 and annual revenue of $13.5 billion. Northwell is the largest health care provider and private employer in New York State, caring for more than two million people annually through a vast network of nearly 800 outpatient facilities, including 220 primary care practices, 52 urgent care centers, home care, rehabilitation and end-of-life programs, and 23 hospitals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Northwell also pursues pioneering research at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and a visionary approach to medical education highlighted by the Zucker School of Medicine, the Hofstra Northwell School of Graduate Nursing and Physician Assistant Studies, and one of the nation’s largest medical residency and fellowship programs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prior to becoming president and CEO in 2002, Mr. Dowling was the health system’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. Before joining Northwell Health in 1995, he was a senior vice president at Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield.

             Gabrielle Rich Aouad, Denise and Marc Rich's daughter, died of leukemia at age 27. As a result, Denise Rich and Philip Aouad, Gabrielle's widower, and her daughters Ilona Rich Schachter and Daniella Rich Kilstock founded the G&amp;P Foundation for Cancer Research.[12] It has since been renamed Gabrielle’s Angel Foundation for Cancer Research.[15][16] As of 2018, Gabrielle's Angel Foundation has awarded $33 million in research grants. Rich also made a $1 million donation funding the construction of The Gery and Emil Eisenberg Assisted Living Residence on the grounds of the Jewish Healthcare Center in Worcester, an 80-unit facility named for her parents.

             Marc Rich received a pardon from U.S. President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, Clinton's last day in office.[13][21] The pardon became controversial after reports surfaced that Denise Rich had made donations totalling more than one million dollars to the Democratic Party and the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park.[13][21] At a congressional hearing into whether the pardon was granted in exchange for her contributions, Rich invoked the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which denies the government power to compel self-incrimination.

                The island is known as Sedir Island. It seems that the house was designed and yet never built, as the Island has always been a historic preservation site. This real estate guy in Turkey sailed to Sedir to investigate the viral claims and walk across the island. He found nothing but two beach cafes servicing tourists visiting the Byzantine/Roman ruins.

                Whether a symbolic house was built or not doesn't really change the fact that IT IS A SYMBOL. Also mainstream news picked it up and spread (and never corrected) the story, meaning it could have been created more for the power of the story than the actual place itself. What did the story signal? What was the power of spreading that Eye of Horus image, and creating this illuminated utopian island fantasy in our mind? The billionaire and architect must have known the island couldn't be developed, but perhaps the rich history, and Cleopatra sand, mixed with their occult appreciation of past lives and sacred sites, made for a perfect ritual. The ritual just happened in in the imaginations of those exposed to the story. Its a stretch but this is how they think.

                 Cheops Eco-House is located at the top of the pyramid of Cheops, in Cairo, Egypt. The goal is to build the most important museum in the history of mankind, in the most emblematic place on the planet. As in reality little is known about human behavior, there is little to be displayed in the museum, so that only multimedia equipment and a continuous connection to the global network is needed. Thus, more than a museum, Cheops Eco-House aims to be a unique place for meditation. A place of pilgrimage for all those who want to transcend as humans, and wish to meditate about the future of mankind and the human network on the planet Earth.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Along with Warren Eisenberg, whose family has also appeared on the ARTnews Top 200 Collectors list, Leonard Feinstein is a cofounder of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which was originally called Bed ‘n’ Bath when it first opened in New Jersey in 1971. He has served as co-chairman of the company since 1999. Along with Warren and Mitzi Eisenberg, Leonard and his wife, Susan, donated a joint $7 million to the New Museum’s building campaign in 2005. “New York City is the cultural capital of the nation, and the new New Museum will provide visitors to the city with an experience that is unmatched by others,” Susan said in a statement to Philanthropy News Digest, adding that “the new building will be a new landmark for the city.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Susan was elected to the New Museum’s board of trustees in 2004, and she also serves as a trustee of the Jewish Museum in New York and is a member of the Contemporary Collectors Council of the Nassau County Museum. The Feinsteins are noted collectors of Gerhard Richter’s works, a number of which they have gifted to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. As part of a joint donation with the Eisenbergs, the Feinsteins gave MoMA Richter’s 2006 series “892-1-12, Abstract Paintings,”which was shown at the Marian Goodman Gallery in Manhattan in 2006. The title reflects the artist’s practice of recording his paintings by number. When asked by ARTnews in 2017 to share the names of the people who inspired them to begin collecting, the Feinsteins replied, somewhat unsurprisingly, the Eisenbergs. In fact, Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg are so close that they are executors of each other’s estates, according to Forbes.

             Grendene is a Brazilian company that is the world's largest manufacturer of sandals. It was founded by Alexandre Grendene Bartelle and his twin brother Pedro Grendene Bartelle
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1979, Grendene produced their first sandal, the Melissa Aranha, after Pedro noticed the strip-sandals of fishermen from the French Riviera. A year later, the first Grendene plant specifically made for shoe mold manufacturing was opened in Carlos Barbosa. The company would go on to form partnerships with designers like Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler. In 1984, the company started producing shoes for kids and 1986 saw the first men's shoe released. In 1990, the first Grendle shoe manufacturing plant was built in Fortaleza, with a second one opening in 1993 in Sobral, and a third in 1997 in Crato. Grendene would start creating new brands, with the Grendha line in 1994, the Melissa line in 1996. 2002 saw the shoe take stage at Sao Paulo Fashion Week, and partner with models like Gisele Bündchen, along with becoming the number 1 shoe manufacturer within Brazil, by number of pairs. On October 29, 2004, Grendene began trading shares on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. A new plant was open in Teixeira de Freitas in 2007. Grendene partnered with Vivienne Westwood and Zaha Hadid in 2008, as well as the launch of the Zaxy brand.

             Joe Biden “made a highly unusual move” and endorsed a billion dollar referendum in a rigged election to combine Common Core (established as the World Core Curriculum in Racine) with Community Health and Community Policing (established as the national and global model in Racine). They purposely withheld testing until weeks after the election
            </p>
            <p>
             The Mason Lab doing the experimental testing is run by the mayor of Raicne’s brother, with connections through Chris and Linda to many others involved in elite circles with connections to Epstein, Brookings Institution, Aspen Institute, Atlantic Council, CFR and more. Rotary also plays an important role along with the Interfaith Coalition with Unitarians and others including Siena Center, United Way, Red Cross and more “foundations” and other groups involved. The mayor was installed in a rigged election after allegations of extreme corruption, embezzlement, fraud, blackmail, inappropriate relationships and abuse caused the former mayor to resign. The mayor before him was arrested for pedo crimes. THe mayor before him was a convicted felon. They are currently attacking a woman who served on city council in corrupt courts and withholding evidence and committing criminal acts of abuse within the court.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you know why judges end up in the Root River, and you know why past mayors were convicted of pedo crimes, you start to figure out how they gained and retained control over a small city to use as the model over generations.

               The City Council also approved a new lease agreement where Toys for Tots does not have to pay rent but would agree to move some of its storage and work stations to other areas in the annex to accommodate the testing site. City personnel involved with the testing project agreed to help the charity relocate.

             More than 500 admirers from around the world gathered at the Pierre Hotel in New York City on May 25 to pay tribute to businessman, philanthropist and community leader Morris W. Offit as Hillel honored him with its Renaissance Award for "enriching the campus, the Jewish community and the world." The event raised $1.75 million for Hillel.

             In presenting the award to Offit, Bed Bath and Beyond cofounder Leonard Feinstein said, "Morris represents the best of the Jewish community. He is a man who cares deeply about his family, his community, and his world. This is exactly the type of individual that Hillel seeks to nurture."
