             Are you referring to the comments on Jeselnik's tweet?  I was horrified when I discovered this story, then pissed when I read the monster's obituary where the family had the gall to say he died peacefully, paint him as a saint and humanitarian and then follow it up by saying he was looking forward to dancing through life with the mother and her kids. But then I lost all hope for humanity after reading the callous responses to that tweet...what is wrong with people?

              Our people have been trained by the media and HWood  to accept sick humor as funny.  I don't know how old you are but there was a slow change to very dry humor and then to sick.  It was a process to accept the change, imo.  People are falling for accepting that it is only humor.  NO IT IS NOT. It was all part of The Plan.  Do you still go to movies?  We don't.  But I have seen on TV when we used to watch Sat. Nite Live that people would laugh at the dumbest stuff.  And Sick Stuff.  We would wonder, Are they getting paid OR are they just that stupid and sick.  I know people that laugh at some of it but they still would not laugh at the stuff we saw in those tweets.  But don't worry, they are still working on them.   The only way we can combat this stuff is to SPEAK OUT to our friends and relatives to not laugh at the low hanging fruit, before it gets worse. When people laugh at something you think is totally unacceptable STOP THEM.  It is our responsibility.

            DISGUSTING.  Makes you wonder how many kids did he raped during his LDS mission to Guatemala.

            Farr's father is Stephen Farr, an attorney who defended this former teacher and scout leader who was accused of child sexual abuse:

            He got a plea deal for the pedo he defended, so the child sex abuse charges were dropped and he was sentenced only for child porn:

             I have a feeling this is a generational sexual abuse family. That's why his father tried to cover his past deeds and this story up.
            </p>
            <p>
             The little girls family are saying he is related to the local,  prominent,  Farr Ice Cream family.  Farr Ice Cream is trying to deny this, but someone posted a family tree showing that he is fact related to them.

              And remember, Ogden is in the "Wasatch Front" region of Utah, ground zero for the Mormon fundamentalist satanic ritual abuse problem as investigated in 1990 by Mormon Bishop Glenn L. Pace:

             I agree.  Prayers for that baby.  Why wee the family not helping out with that baby?  There must be someone.  It's so very sad.  I have heard that some pedos hate themselves and wish they were not pedos.  Well, if you feel that bad, why don't you just end it before you commit it.  Sick Perverted Scumbags.

            This was a guy with severe mental problems. I am much angrier about Tony Podesta getting immunity from Mueller to testify against Paul Manafort when the Podesta Bros. are the ones who should be arrested for actually organizing parties where kids are tortured and raped and killed then eaten. Trump has to release videos of this happening the public needs to be shocked.

             Okay, I am so confused about this post...
            </p>
            <p>
             Where does it state anywhere this guy has severe mental problems? Does that even matter or negate it?
            </p>
            <p>
             This man was from a prominent Utah family, parents are lawyers. The Farr Ice Cream family, that he is related to, are wealthy, old school money.
            </p>
            <p>
             Been here since the beginning and of course I am also pissed that the Podesta brothers are still walking free and all of the Mueller bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe I am just taking your post wrong. But it seems like you dismissing this story because the baby wasn't part of an elite party where she was tortured, raped and eaten.
            </p>
            <p>
             She has suffered horrific injuries and I am putting a face to the many victims that are out there. I just wanted to share this story so that we can remember that these poor kids are why we continue to fight, pray, research, connect these dots, and blast it all over social media.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want justice for ALL the children and the bastards responsible held accountable.

              I agree it's horrible awful terrible horrific in every way my point was this guy is hopefully just a lone nut and not part of any organized pedo group but maybe he is and police can find his friends and associates.

               Appreciate the response. Quite a few of these victims, remain faceless and hidden. I knew when I posted, that this was a  bit off topic and there was no justice to be had here, as the perp did humanity a favor and killed himself (wish it has been sooner)
              </p>
              <p>
               But, after reading the article, seeing her precious face, reading those vile tweets and hearing about her horrible injuries (one thing I forgot to mention is she has to have a colostomy bag) it fired me up, reinforced my vigor and I posted it wanting to fire everyone else up too.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's all good. After going down this pizzagate rabbit hole, we all are fed up of being told it's a hoax, had enough of the injustice and watching the elite get away with it. Thanks for being my battle brother, let's all win this war together! :)

             A very disgusting and distrubing story. I  highly doubt the Mormon Church is going to cover this up. As a Mormon, saying that is hate mongering against a religious sect, the main stream LDS Church who teaches against all evil acts. Just like other religious sects in the U.S., each has an element of evil doers. Blame the person and make them accountable for their actions.

              I have friends who are Mormon. You are right many are good people, have good values etc. and like many other religions, organizations etc. there are a small minority who are not so good. Other than the reddit post that I linked here (that I did not make) no one here really attacked Mormons. I brought up how I thought the family was trying to cover for their son (they were) and someone else brought up his mission wondering if he did anything to children while he was there (valid questioning) but there was no witch hunt against your religion in this thread.
             </p>
             <p>
              But here lies the problem and why other people may wonder about churches covering up misdeeds. As soon as anything comes to light about a persons misdeeds and their religion is reported. You will have people come into the conversation immediately defending their religion against any attack. So it makes other people wonder, would they report  wrongdoings of there fellow members or would they be more worried about making their church look bad and keep quiet? I know some personal stories of churches covering up for their members and vice versa, it happens sometimes. Let's not pretend it doesn't.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am not interested in attacking your church. Faith in God is a good thing and we need more people to believe in him again.  We are here to fight for the children and I want to fight that battle with you. With Light and Love &lt;3
