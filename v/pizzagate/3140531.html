<p>Lawmakers were concerned about a number of program cuts. Among them: <strong>a significant decrease in programs that combat human trafficking.</strong></p>

<p><em>Video: \'Rep. Katherine Clark just tore into Acosta big time!\'</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAGR2ZlebMk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAGR2ZlebMk</a> <em>(17 min.)</em></p>
<p>Acosta, while U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, helped orchestrate an unusually light plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, a politically connected New York hedge fund manager accused in 2005 of molesting and sexually assaulting dozens of girls, mostly ages 13 to 16, at his mansion in Palm Beach.</p>
<p>Instead of going to prison like most sex offenders in Florida, Epstein was given federal immunity and was allowed to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court. A number of other people involved in his operation were also immunized and never charged.</p>
<p>He served 13 months in the county jail. But had Acosta prosecuted him on sex-trafficking charges, Epstein could have gone to prison for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>In February of this year, a federal judge ruled that the deal that Acosta arranged was improper because federal prosecutors failed to comply with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.</p>
<p>The deal, signed in 2007, was done in secret, and it was sealed so that no one could know how many girls Epstein abused or who else was involved in his scheme. Moreover, Acosta’s staff agreed to demands by Epstein’s lawyers that the victims not be made aware of the federal non-prosecution agreement until after it was signed and executed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The judge found you broke the law, Mr. Acosta, when you chose not to tell the victims about this deal and you gave them the impression that the investigation was ongoing,’’ said Clark at the hearing. “Was the judge right?’’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acosta attempted to pivot, but Clark continued. “I asked you a yes or no question,’’ she demanded.</p>
<p>Rep. Lois Frankel, a Democrat whose constituents are in Palm Beach, quizzed Acosta about how it was that a sex abuser got off so easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Many people in my community are upset that you allowed a sexual predator on the loose,’’</strong> Frankel said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acosta has never said why the deal was kept under wraps. At the hearing Wednesday, Acosta told lawmakers what he has repeatedly said for years: The deal ensured Epstein went to jail and had to register as a sex offender.</p>

           <p>
            That is 100% false. He wrote a letter about it shortly after the case concluded because people were upset. He claimed that the defense attorney's were so aggressive, even to the level of harassing him and his family as well as the other prosecutors, that this was the best they could do.
           </p>
           <p>
            He even said that one of the defense attorney's was his friend prior to the case, but after the case he could no longer be friends with him anymore because of how unethical and aggressive they were defending Epstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            So my personal opinion is that Acosta is being thrown under the bus unfairly, unless he is lying in the letter he wrote explaining why the case ended that way.

             WAIT. WHAT EVIDENCE WAS PRESENTED TO THE GRAND JURY? They recommended NO JAIL TIME. Acosta managed to get a light conviction with some sex-offender registry for Epstein. In his view, better than nothing.  I read about this case several years ago. At the time, I thought Acosta was the good guy trying to convict a VERY POWERFUL sex offender amongst a corrupt system.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps Trump brought him on because Acosta knows ALL ABOUT EPSTEIN.  LET'S SEE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO THE GRAND JURY, before we judge Acosta. Was the case mishandled, or was the Grand Jury rigged?

             Well, as far as I know, never anything came out of the info he gave them. The whole 'FBI informant' thing might have been just a pretext for giving him this lenient plea deal.

              Epstein was looking at 300 years minimum in Federal prison. Trafficked 39 minor girls in the original indictment. Mueller steps in and now Epstein owes Mueller his life. I can't wait to see how this ends.
