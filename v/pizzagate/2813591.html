<p>In part 5, I covered how AHEPA &amp; Sons Of Pericles President Stephen A Scopas escaped conviction in NY for operating an international orphan-stealing/dealing ring. </p>
<p>Here\'s his obituary: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/12/classified/paid-notice-deaths-scopas-stephen-s-sr.html">https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/12/classified/paid-notice-deaths-scopas-stephen-s-sr.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Scopas served until his death as the National Chairman of the Ahepa Cooley\'s Anemia Foundation&quot;</p>
<p>What is Cooley’s Anemia? It’s a genetic mutation that causes red blood cell irregularity. As a result, the blood is less capable of holding oxygen and iron.</p>

<p>Thalassemia, also known as MEDITERRANIAN ANEMIA, is an ANCIENT group of diseases that have existed for over 7,000 years. The name thalassemia comes from the ANCIENT GREEK word for sea, thalassa, as the ancients believed it was an &quot;illness that came from the sea&quot;. In 1925, pediatrician Thomas Benton Cooley published a work on thalassemia. This was the first description of the disorder, and for a long time it became known as Cooley\'s anemia.</p>
<p>Traditionally, beta thalassemia major is particularly prevalent in a belt stretching from West Africa through the Mediterranean, the Arabian Peninsula and the Black Sea to India, South China and South-East Asia. However, due to global mobility in modern times, sufferers are now found nearly everywhere. Throughout the world, it is estimated that 4.6 million children and adolescents are affected by thalassemia and every day hundreds of babies are born with this inherited disorder. A high number of CARRIERS of the thalassemia genetic trait are found in countries where MARRIAGE BETWEEN RELATIVES was, and still is, common practice and in third-world or emerging countries. Little or no schooling, social or religious stigmatization, and a lack of useful information and education all help to spread this genetic disorder. In many cultures, sick children, particularly girls, are often hidden away, abandoned or killed.</p>

<p>Countries like ITALY, GREECE, and Cyprus have the highest frequency of thalassaemia cases in the world, 10 percent of the Mediterranean population are carriers of this gene. There exists a thalassaemic &quot;belt&quot; that includes the Mediterranean passing through West and Central Asian countries like Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan onto Pakistan &amp; India and passes on to the South East Asian countries like Indonesia, Burma &amp; Thailand. Cooley and B. Lee (American physician) described the disease in children of Italian immigrants in the USA.</p>

<p>Children\'s Hospital Oakland, a world recognized center for treatment and research of thalassemia, has formed an international network treating patients throughout the world. Thalassemia is the WORLD’S MOST COMMON GENETIC BLOOD DISORDER and it is RAPIDLY INCREASING. SEVEN PERCENT of the world\'s population are CARRIERS, and 400,000 affected babies are born each year. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts a DOUBLING of these STATISTICS within the next few decades. Once rare in California, it has become the most frequent disorder detected in the state newborn screening program of over 700,000 annual births. Thalassemia is usually FATAL IN INFANCY unless ONGOING TRANSFUSIONS are initiated.</p>

<p>AHEPA Cooley\'s Anemia Foundation Cooley’s Anemia, also known as “Thalassemia”, is a rare but fatal genetic blood disorder. It mostly affects people of Mediterranean descent. In its most severe form it requires bone marrow transplants but usually those who are diagnosed experience symptoms of fatigue, weakness, paleness, and slow growth. Many are unaware they are carriers of the genetic disease until either their child suffers from it or a DNA test result is acquired. In it’s major form, Thalassemia “Cooley’s Anemia” is fatal and requires bone transplant surgery. In 1990, after the son of one of our chapter members was in need of this surgery, it quickly became obvious that an even greater need existed, thus the AHEPA Bone Marrow Donor Registry was incorporated. Today, there have been incredible breakthroughs in gene editing that may allow for children to live Thalassemia-free! Since 1947, AHEPA has supported the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the AHEPA Hospital wing. It has helped over 10 million patients and continues to serve the community of Thessaloniki today.</p>

            Ok. Here we would need a connection of dots - if there are human blood banks (and NGOs like the Red Cross trade in blood IIRC) - do they not suffice to supply everyone that is in need of a blood transfusion with blood?
           </p>
           <p>
            If so, that needs to be stated and proven with statistics etc. (Like you would do when talking about demand and supply of human organs.)
           </p>
           <p>
            And it would be great if you could put the focus on US or European demand, if possible.

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              So we would reduce your statement to: 'All in all, I suspect that much of the PizzaGate, Ritual Sacrifice, Blood-letting and other blood-based cult activity has some biological, eugenic imperative.'
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Since PG already comprises Ritual Sacrifice per definition, you can leave it out here imo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suggestion: Boil it down to ''All in all, I suspect that much of the Ritual Sacrifice and blood-based cult activity like Blood-letting [I'd suggest to add: blood drinking] has some biological, eugenic imperative.'
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             And here we have the main problem of this post imo:
            </strong>
            From what we know about Ritual Sacrifice and blooddrinking as part of Satanic rituals of the elites, the reasons
            <em>
             why
            </em>
            people participate is that they are part of power circles - some are certainly involved in generational SRA (but this already is difficult to prove - we can see some actual proof when looking at the Rothschilds or the Vanderbilts, but many others, like actors, people from the music industry, bankers etc. where very likely
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            part of generational abuse families before they were initiated in SRA cults).
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR:
            <strong>
             I can see where you're coming from
            </strong>
            , but you would have to prove that the families you are talking about have *
            <em>
             all
            </em>
            been involved in these rituals for generations, and this is nearly impossible imo.
           </p>

            This means you should also delete this paragraph:

            , this is a very interesting theory, but you are taking several massive speculative leaps here that you haven't sufficiently supported. I'm sorry, but an emo vampire blog isn't sufficient evidence to support the theory that a cabal of anemic super-rich are behind global child trafficking for their blood supply.
           </p>
           <p>
            The main problem you've got here is that vampires supposedly drink blood, not transfuse it -- which is a clear bastardization of the Catholic Mass dating back at least a millennia. You need to show some evidence of blood being stolen from trafficking victims. You also need to show evidence of this anemia being prevalent in Cabal families. I've seen reports of flesh stolen, spinal fluid stolen and organs stolen -- but I have yet to see blood stolen. The genetic vampire theory is something we're going to have to treat as disinfo until further evidence comes in supporting it.

            This would also need some linked evidence supporting it. I've seen
            <em>
             families
            </em>
            obsessed with blood lines. I've never heard of a religious order obsessed with it. Typically, religious orders require you to forgo all ties to your family line.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will give this the 24 Hour Grace flair in the off chance real evidence exists to support these claims, but then you'll have to repost in our speculative subverse (which was made for stuff like this).

             Noble’s new book, Medicinal Cannibalism in Early Modern English Literature and Culture, and another by Richard Sugg of England’s University of Durham, Mummies, Cannibals and Vampires: The History of Corpse Medicine from the Renaissance to the Victorians, reveal that for several hundred years, peaking in the 16th and 17th centuries, many Europeans, including royalty, priests and scientists, routinely ingested remedies containing human bones, blood and fat as medicine for everything from headaches to epilepsy....BLOOD WAS PROCURED AS FRESH AS POSSIBLE, WHILE IT WAS STILL THOUGHT TO CONTAIN THE VITALITY OF THE BODY. This requirement made it challenging to acquire. The 16th century German-Swiss physician Paracelsus believed BLOOD WAS GOOD FOR DRINKING, and one of his followers even suggested TAKING BLOOD FROM A LIVING BODY. While that doesn’t seem to have been common practice, the poor, who couldn’t always afford the processed compounds sold in apothecaries, could gain the benefits of cannibal medicine by standing by at executions, paying a small amount for a cup of the still-warm blood of the condemned. “The executioner was considered a big healer in Germanic countries,” says Sugg. “He was a social leper with almost magical powers.” For those who preferred their blood cooked, a 1679 recipe from a Franciscan apothecary describes how to make it into marmalade.

             The first recorded attempt of a blood transfusion was described by the 15th-century chronicler Stefano Infessura. In 1492, Infessura noted that the blood of three boys was given to Pope Innocent VIII, who had fallen into a coma. Following orders from a physician, the blood was transferred to the pontiff through the mouth, as the concept of intravenous circulation had not yet been discovered. The three young blood donors, all ten years old, had undertaken this experiment after being promised a ducat each. Unfortunately, the Pope and all three boys died.
            </p>
            <p>
             An Hebrew  manuscript  refers  to an actual possible transfusion as follows
"Naam,  leader  of  the  armies  of  Bed-Adad,  King  of  Syria,  afflicted  by leprosy, consulted physicians, who in order to cure him,drew out the blood from his veins and put in that of another."
            </p>
            <p>
             OVID wrote in the 7th book of Metamorphasis  "Medea took her unsheathed knife and cut the old man's throat letting all of his blood out of him. She filled his ancient veins with a rich elixir Received THROUGH HIS LIPS and wound, his beard and hair no longer white with age, turned quickly to their natural vigor, dark and lustrous; his wasted form renewed, appeared in all the vigor of bright youth".

             According to Steven Gruenstein, a hematologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, some people may be drawn to drinking blood due to an iron deficiency or the absence of another mineral.

             Inbreeding in wealthy families (for religious, economic, or eugenic purposes) has occurred since Ancient Egypt. Beyond physical deformities, it led to genetic blood diseases (Like Haemophilia, Porphyria, and Thalassemia). Treatment of these diseases require blood transfusions (or some component synthesized from blood)

              Thank you for the additional links. Unfortunately, they do not help support the pizzagate thesis you appear to be trying to make here: that the elite are kidnapping and sexually abusing kids to take their blood. The links you provided do not give any evidence of this at all. You've added:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               evidence of blood drinking as medicine from hundreds of years ago which is not relevant, since it is not actually efficacious for treatment
              </li>
              <li>
               evidence of blood farming from adult men in India for local use
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              You have not edited your thread to make it clear you're "using Vampirism as a metaphor". Nor have you edited or removed the speculative claim from the vampire blog I already mentioned.
             </p>
             <p>
              You provide no evidence whatsoever that
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               there is any connection between pedophilia among the elite (pizzagate) and this blood theory
              </li>
              <li>
               the orphans that were brought from Greece were abused sexually or used for their blood
              </li>
              <li>
               children anywhere are being abducted and raped for their blood
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              Therefore, I have to remove this thread per Rule 1.

              </p>
              <p>
               I've never made that thesis. I've avoided pedophilia/sexual abuse in all of my posts so far. Pizzagate includes the trafficking/abuse of children by Elites for reasons besides
               <strong>
                just
               </strong>
               pedophilia/SRA. You were closer when you summarized it as
              </p>
              <p>
               "the theory that a cabal of anemic super-rich are behind global child trafficking for their blood supply"
              </p>
              <p>
               ...Still dismissive hyperbole. But closer. I'm saying that child &amp; organ donation/blood trafficking are
               <em>
                a part
               </em>
               of Pizzagate. My post meets Rule 1: as it addresses "Physical abuse" &amp; "Trafficking" by elites.
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                I've satisfied your requested edits. You 1st asked me to provide evidence for 4 points:
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               A. "Main problem Vampires supposedly drink blood, not transfuse...a clear bastardization of the Catholic Mass"
              </p>
              <p>
               I provided 2 books referencing early medicine and its development of "Vampirism" &amp; "Medical Cannibalism" by elites, scientists, royalty, and the Catholic Church itself. I next provided a book by two doctors on the history of blood transfusion, The book describes multiple historical child victims of these blood transfusion experiments.
              </p>
              <p>
               B. "evidence of blood being stolen from trafficking victims"
              </p>
              <p>
               I provided evidence of "blood-farming" in multiple cities in India from 2011-2015, A book entitled "The Red Market: On the Trail of the World's Organ Brokers, Bone Thieves, Blood Farmers, and Child Traffickers," and an official declaration from the government of Slovenia: Combating trafficking in human beings: Trafficking in human organs, tissues and BLOOD.
              </p>
              <p>
               C. "evidence of this anemia being prevalent in Cabal families"
              </p>
              <p>
               I provided multiple examples, you didn't address them, so I assume they were sufficient.
              </p>
              <p>
               D. "evidence supporting...Religious orders have long been obsessed with Blood-Lines which led to inbreeding"
              </p>
              <p>
               I provided examples of blood-line preservation in The Mormon Church, Shiite Islam, the Fundamentalist Mormon Church, Ancient Hawaiian Tribes, Ancient Incans, Ancient Egyptians, and American Anabaptist populations.
              </p>
              <p>
               I completely answered all of your concerns. You then removed my post for issues you never asked me to clarify (moving the goalposts)

                 I proved that blood was harvested from trafficking victims like you asked. You didn't ask for "children's blood" until after you deleted my post. Nonetheless, I'd already provided sources with multiple examples:

                 "it  is  reported that  a  physician  (or  mystic)  of dubious  reputation,  named  Abraham  Meyre,  appeared  in the  court  and promised to save the Pope's life by

                  <em>
                   the blood of the dying Pope was passed  into  the  veins  of one  of  the  boys, "...  who  gave  him  his  own  in exchange". The process was apparently repeated with the other two boys. All  three  boys  apparently  died  shortly  after  the procedure

                 ,  possibly  as  a result  of  air  embolism,  but  there  was  no  change  to  the Pope's  condition. This  story  is  however  controversial  and  is  open  to  interpretation, being based  on  translations  from  the  original  script.  It  is  possible  that this presumed transfusion‟ stems from an incorrect translation by Villari of an earlier account  of  the Pope's  illness.  If  this  is  the  case,  what  is  likely  to  have happened is that the Pope was asked to drink the blood.
                 <strong>
                  In any event, all authors  seem  to  agree  that  the  three  boys,"...  costing  one  ducat  a piece"  died  shortly  after  the  procedure

                  It absolutely IS right when you refuse to edit, instead dump tons of baffle-with-bullshit ancient history into the post burying any relevant info, and then claim mods are "misrepresenting your evidence". That is why this subverse

                   has
                  </em>

                   Are we investigating the Elite or not? Catholic Church, Masonic Organizations, Royalty, and Elite Scientists? My evidence links directly to the Alefantis family. In my previous post I demonstrated how AHEPA's St Basil was harboring a 14 year old orphan for organ donation to her brother.  In the next part of the series I show how the Granddaughter of Ahepa's most powerful president has medical and genomics holdings.

                  <p>
                   The entire organ donation industry is based on an extensive medical history of child abuse and child trafficking.  all organ donations are at a demand surplus. Every time a kid is found to have been abused/organs stolen/blood drawn by the medical industry, it's to cure an ELITE wealthy member of society.

                   "the protection or assistance provided to people who engage in said activities" So the whole grey market organ system. From the poor indian, to the wealthier doctor, to the Elite transplant.

                   I'm sorry if it's disorganized, There are a ton of pieces and I was hoping to provide as much context  as possible. As a history dude, I look at things as long term trends not isolated incidents. But there's a difference between ineptitude and shilling.

                    It doesn't really matter, though, because the link doesn't prove anything. It's just more historical stuff you failed to directly connect to anything our rules require.

                    It does not solve the essential problem with this thread -- it still breaks the damn rules. You've established no direct connection between all these scattered bits of history and the people we are investigating. Your refusal to take responsibility for this fact, while continuing to insist I am the problem is quite telling.

                     Does AHEPA not count? How old does a post have to be about Catholic Church abuse to not apply towards pizzagate? I've seen posts about St Louis, NY, and many other dioceses that extend 50+ years. I see posts about Ritual Abuse that don't have ANY direct connection to the Alefantis/Podesta/Washington clan.

                     Do posts about elite child trafficking have a "statute of limitations" if they aren't related to pedophilia?  because you haven't made that clear at all.

                    <p>
                     Rule 1 says
                     <strong>
                      <em>
                       Elite

                     </strong>
                     . and it doesn't provide

                      any relevant time periods
                     </em>
                     . So your argument that my evidence doesn't apply seems arbitrary. My post demonstrates the motivation behind multiple historical trafficking networks for the purpose of life extending technologies. And the catholic church is one obvious example. The technology was developed and drives much of child orphan/organ trafficking.

                    Pontificating over hundreds-of-years-old abuses is kind of stupid.  And his part about it NOT BEING RELEVANT is that a hundreds-of-years-old lie of a medicinal practice that doesn't continue to today and isn't continued to today is irrelevant.

                     History is the only way to contextualize trafficking. The medical industry developed due to institutionalized child abuse. By tracing the historical connections, it informs where to look for criminals today. Not to mention I'm explicitly naming the modern descendants of these people and their current medical and genetic company holdings.

                     By that logic, Mengele didn't traffick and abuse kids because his twin experiments were dismal failures.

                    <p>
                     That's a very narrow view. Information and logic builds on itself. Even failures Especially in medicine. The motivation for child trafficking isn't the point. The trafficking is all that matters

                     Finally, the only way we can reform the law is by understanding the historical precedent and resulting abuses. Do you want to actually stop this trafficking trade, or just lust for pedo prison justice?

It's not incumbent on mods to rewrite shitty posts so that they meet the submission guidelines. We give you pointers because we care about this place and those trying to help the kids, not because we have to.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If you don't want posts removed, write tighter, to-the-point submissions. If you want the community and/or mods to help you edit posts that aren't quite on point, don't dumb six massive submissions on the board in 48 hours, and don't bury the most relevant information way down in the Comment section.

                      this ^^^^ is exactly the same tactic that EsotericShade used to get Falcon demodded. I'd say it's looking more clear by the minute that NomoChomo is a new ES alt, sadly.

                       The only reason Crensch was summoned was because you misread or ignored my supplementary citations. I included specific secondary sources. I'm fine making it tighter. But don't fucking call me a shill while simultaneously acknowledging the quality of my other posts. You ignored my citation; Crensch didn't read it, and called "dusty old shit"

                         My argument has been this:
1. Inbreeding creates genetic disorders
2. There was heavy inbreeding in Greece which led to most ethnic greeks carrying defective genes
3. These defective genes require consistent blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants
4. AHEPA pioneered research/blood drives because many of its members had blood diseases.

                          <em>

                           Vampire (Noun)
1. (in European folklore) a corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living by biting their necks with long pointed canine teeth.

                           The term is widely used in political discourse. I've never accused AHEPA of literally drinking blood. All of my posts have been titled "Vampires of Ahepa" because the organization itself is parasitic in nature. As OSS operatives they destabilized Greece for US policy purposes. Then they imported orphans illegally. Then they began funding/sponsoring blood drives/research for a parasitic medical industry.

                <p>
                 "The practicality of transfusion has, to some degree, paralleled and in some instances been the consequence of, developments in other sciences. The idea though of the theoretical beneficial effects of blood transfusion has  been recognized for  over  three centuries.  This  older  history  is  based on the traditional idea of blood as being the "living-force" of the body....Blood was recognized as having numerous mysterious properties, including initially that of carrying both the mental and physical characters of its owner. EARLY ATTEMPTS AT REPLACING LOST BLOOD involved the DRINKING OF BLOOD  by  the  patient.  By  choice,  this  was from  a YOUNG, HEALTHY, FIT PERSON or animal. The legend of the vampire originates from this concept. This  somewhat  mystical  fascination  with  the  properties  of  blood  is  to some degree still with us today" (pg 1)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Instance 1:
                </p>
                <p>
                 "On  one  occasion,  after  all  means  to revive  the  Pope  had failed,  it  is  reported that  a  physician  (or  mystic)  of 
dubious  reputation,  named  Abraham  Meyre,  appeared  in the  court  and promised to save the Pope‟s life by transfusing him with the blood of young "donors". Apparently, three young 10-year-old shepherd boys were selected as
donors and Villari states that the blood of the dying Pope was passed  into  the  veins  ofone  of  the  boys, "...  who  gave  him  his  own  in exchange". The process was apparently repeated with the other two boys. All  three  boys  apparently  died  shortly  after  the procedure,  possibly  as  a result  of  air  embolism,  but  there  was  no  change  to  the Pope's  condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This  story  is  however  controversial  and  is  open  to  interpretation, being based  on  translations  from  the  original  script.  It  is  possible  that this presumed "transfusion" stems from an incorrect translation by Villari of an earlier account  of  the Pope's  illness.  If  this  is  the  case,  what  is  likely  to  have happened is that the Pope was asked to drink the blood. In any event, all authors  seem  to  agree  that  the  three  boys,"costing  one  ducat  a piece",  died  shortly  after  the  procedure,  as  apparently  did  the Pope." (pg 13)

                 "In  1654 Florentine physician, Francesco Folli wrote: "This I pointed out in my pamphlet on life culture which was published for  no  other  reason  than  to  make  known  to  all  that blood  transfusion had  been  invented  by  me  at  the  end  of 1654  and  demonstrated  to  his Serene  Highness  Ferdinand  II,  Grande  Duke  of  Tuscany,  of  undying memory.   The   novelty   of   it   had   pleased   him,   or   the   fascinating ingenuity  or  the  considerable  experimental  elaboration.  To  no  one  else  did  I  impart  my  idea,  believing  that  if  such  an  invention  were successful, MONARCH ALONE WERE WORTHY OF IT."Later  Folli  described  in  some  detail  the  apparatus  required  and  the method of using it. He even postulates the presence of TWENTY YOUNG MEN AS BLOOD DONORS,  so  that  the PATIENT MAY RECEIVE FRESH BLOOD  of  a  FRESH DONOR every  day  over  a  considerable period." (pg 15)

                 BEIJING - The National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) issued a circular denouncing forced blood donations in Northwest China's Gansu province on Monday. China condemns illegal blood collection Seven arrested over China blood scandal. A total of ten victims, including seven under the age of 18 were forced to donate blood every month between November 2013 and May 2014, the circular said. Seven people in Wuwei, Gansu province were orchestrated the scandal. They were led by a man named Huang, who was identified as the deputy chief of a state-run blood center, and illegally collected 10,700 yuan ($ 1,742) from more than 48 forced blood donations.

                <p>
                 Children were beaten and threatened if they did not cooperate. The scam was uncovered when one boy sought his parents' help after being beaten. Local police arrested six of the seven suspects, with one suspect declared exempt from criminal responsibility for being underage. NHFPC called on nationwide blood centers and pharmaceutical companies to learn from the scandal. It also required local drug administration to strengthen supervision to eliminate further violations.In China, the legal age for blood donation is from 18 to 55. Blood centers are required to double-check the donor's identity before taking blood

                 "Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal led his men to arrest the suspect in his 18 Kusa Bus Stop, Bariga one-room apartment where he operated from. He was said to have collected blood from children there for sale to some clinics.
It was gathered that the police recovered seven pints of blood from his home. According to residents, the suspect got into trouble on June 10, after a 17-year-old boy, Ayomide Adesanya, he collected two pints of blood from, passed out.
He was said to have earlier drawn two pints of blood from the same victim on June 4. The suspect reportedly gave the victim N2,000 on each occasion. Edgal, who visited Adesanya in hospital, told reporters that the suspect lured underage children with N2,000. The suspect, the police chief said, had confessed that he sold the blood for N7,000."

                 "Blood donation is a medical procedure with attendant risks, and thus blood donors should undergo acceptable informed consent. There are no guidelines for the informed consent forms (ICFs) for whole blood donors or for parental consent forms (PCFs) for minor age blood donors. The goal of the study was to determine if the majority of the generally accepted elements of informed consent are provided to volunteer allogeneic whole blood donors in the United States. ICFs and PCFs along with their accompanying general information forms (GIFs) from nonmilitary blood collection establishments for allogeneic whole blood donation were collected throughout the United States and scored using a system based on the essential elements of informed consent derived from guidelines of consent for research subjects. The overall score for each ICF and PCF was obtained. Twenty-one ICFs and 37 PCFs from 48 states representing major collection centers within the United States were scored. The mean score for the common essential elements ICFs was 35 percent (range, 10%-80%) and for PCFs was 46 percent (range, 10%-90%). None of the whole blood allogeneic donation informed consents surveyed contained all the common essential or specific blood donation information desired. There is a need for national guidelines for the informed consent process for both the donor and the parent of a minor to ensure adequate information is specified. "

                     Britain hunts for 300 lost children: In September 2001, in the River Thames near the soaring columns of Tower Bridge, the police discovered the torso of a black-skinned child they called Adam. The suggestion from subsequent investigations was that he had died in some kind of ritualistic murder linked to West African witchcraft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Years later, the discovery has brought another chilling fact to light:
                     <strong>
                      In the three months before the body was found, 300 other black boys between 4 and 7 years of age were missing or unaccounted for
                     </strong>
                     . “We were really looking at black children, black male children, aged between 4 and 7, and we found 300 of those that couldn’t be accounted for,” Detective Chief Inspector Will O’Reilly told British radio on Friday. “
                     <strong>
                      In the main, these were African children
                     </strong>
                     .” What happened to the boys remains a mystery. While the police said they had no evidence of murder, they also acknowledged that the
                     <em>
                      absence of immigration records prevented the authorities from tracing the youngsters.
                     </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     When the police discovered Adam’s body , they found it had been DRAINED OF BLOOD. Forensic tests found a poisonous bean in his stomach and traces of crushed bone and clay pellets studded with gold and quartz in his lower intestine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The police questioned people who were supposed to be taking care of the missing children and were often told that they had returned to Africa.
                     <strong>
                      Only two of the missing children were traced.
                     </strong>
                     It is not unusual for African parents to send children to Britain and other places to be looked after by relatives and sent to school. But
                     <em>
                      the people who look after them are not obliged to register with British authorities.

                <li>
                 "You've added evidence of blood drinking as medicine from hundreds of years ago which is not relevant, since it is not actually efficacious for treatment"

               </ol>
               <p>
                My posted evidence clearly indicates it IS EFFECTIVE and used in MODERN TIMES. You didn't address the longstanding SUCCESSFUL medical treatments of EATING cowsblood for anemics/pregnant women. You also didn't address Dr. Steven Gruenstein, a hematologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who says some people may be drawn to DRINKING BLOOD due to an IRON DEFICIENCY (anemia) or the absence of another mineral.
               </p>

                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                Nowhere does the article say the "17 people freed" were all adult men. You again forgot Slovenia. I can give you more countries, and instances of underage donors, but you didn't ask for children, you asked for trafficking victims. You also didn't address the 2011 book "The Red Market" which includes "blood farming, and child trafficking" in its title. Also the articles explicitly state the blood industry in India is driven by child Beta-Thalassemics!

               <p>
                You didn't ask me to to do this, I volunteered the clarification. Its an incredibly apt and accurate metaphor (from a historical, linguistic perspective, and in modern political discourse).

               </ol>
               <p>
                You didn't ask me to edit/remove, you asked for

                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                Pedophilia is not my focus in any of these posts! Again you are excluding medical abuse and trafficking by elites from your definition of Pizzagate. My posts meet rule 1. I'm not going to attempt to prove your strawman.

                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                Totally new concern you're asking me to substantiate. But I've previously demonstrated a Greek orphan named "KT" was brought to the US for organ donation to her "brother". She resided in the AHEPA supported Stephan Scopas founded orphanage St. Basil's Academy. The NY family services dept brought a lawsuit against them for it, claiming she was brought here illegally.

                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                I can happily substantiate underage children are abducted for their blood. Not necessarily raped
                <em>
                 again, you're putting words in my mouth
                </em>
                .
               </p>
               <p>
                My main point is our current system allows for LEGALIZED medical child abuse. To effectively stop this evil of child trafficking, we need to focus on the adoption and medical structures that create the child-trafficking pipelines. One of the first is legalized/mandated anonymity of the birth parents/source donor. We need this information tracked and documented, not destroyed or legally censored.

              Druidic/Druish rely on inbreeding as an inversion of what is currently referred to as diversity. By continuing inward with their gene pool, that mutation
              <em>
               is
              </em>
              the desired effect. The true essences of Druidism was predicated on knowledge of the human body. Their texts and magic are codified by referencing the human body's form and process. Wales, Britain, and Celtic knowledge collide within the Druidic Arts. Dark Magic is purposefully inbreeding to induce a mutation versus the inverse process of interspecies breeding to remove undesirable or harmful traits.

            What Vampires have long known, Medicine has proven. Blood transfusions are more effective when they are transfused within hours from when the blood is drawn. This creates the imperative for literal human blood banks. UNDERGROUND MEDICINE IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING
           </p>
           <p>
            I knew it would come to that.   Using the Blood of the Poor and Minorities.  This is disgusting and I am going out on a limb by saying that I would not be surprised if this was an engineered disease.  A disease that will start making them big money while using Humans as Blood Banks.  Are they going to have them laying in underground basements, tunnels and hidden places plugged into the wall?  Idk if that is possible but it sounds like something they may already be doing or will be coming soon.  God this is so sick.

             The emaciated man brought the officers to his prison of the last three years: a hastily constructed shack sandwiched between Papu Yadhav’s concrete home and a cowshed. A brass padlock hung from the iron door’s solid latch. The officers could hear the muffled sounds of humanity through the quarter inch of metal.
            </p>
            <p>
             They sprung the lock and revealed a medical ward fit for a horror movie. IV drips hung from makeshift poles and patients moaned as if they were recovering from a delirium. Five emaciated men lying on small woven cots could barely lift their heads to acknowledge the visitors. The sticky air inside was far from sterile. The sun beating down on the tin roof above their heads magnified the heat like a tandoor oven. One man stared at the ceiling with glassy eyes as his blood snaked through a tube and slowly drained into a plastic blood bag on the floor. He was too weak to protest.
            </p>
            <p>
             A crumpled nylon bag next to him held five more pints. Inside were another nineteen empty bags ready for filling. Each had official-looking certification stickers from local blood banks as well as bar codes and a seal from the central regulatory authority.
            </p>
            <p>
             The room was not unique. Over the next several hours the cops raided five different squats on the dairy farmer’s land. Each scene was as bad as the last, with patients constantly on the verge of death. All told they freed seventeen people. Most were wasting away and had been confined next to hospital-issued blood-draining equipment. In their statements the prisoners said that a lab technician bled them at least two times per week. Some said that they had been captive for two and a half years. The Blood Factory, as it was quickly known in the press, was supplying a sizable percentage of the city’s blood supply and may have been the only thing keeping Gorakhpur’s hospitals fully stocked."

              Greeks and Italians I believe are more prized than Asians.  That's not my opinion, it's how I think the people running the show, how they feel.  Just my thoughts.

               In general, Europeans are more prized (though Greeks and Italians are mongrels by some elitist standards)
              </p>
              <p>
               What I found very interesting is the Catholic Church required all Italian provinces to submit lineage reports/get approved to put an end to invest/inbreeding
              </p>
              <p>
               The only region they didn't require to do this was Sicily (I think this helps explain higher levels of inbreeding in Sicilian families)

                A lot of the mafia came from there.  The Sicilian Mob was and still is one of the worst. The Church pretty much makes the call in Italy.

                  To try to discredit what I am saying.  It could be an James A shill. There are all kinds of shills on here.  Some for pharma for the vatican, etc.  You have to just ignore it.  Most people get to trust you by your posts and they know who is true and is not.

            More interesting notes regarding attempts to increase Greek Organ Donation:

            </a>
            Organ transplantation has been commonplace over the last decade but Greece still remains the lowest numerically among European countries in this field because of the lack of organ donation although it is highest in traffic accidents. Despite this, the legal framework regulating transplantation was enacted late in comparison to other European countries, and was not the only obstacle to the development of organ donation. Several other factors such as philosophy, culture, traditional and religious attitudes, lack of public information and lack of the relevant social fabric, have all contributed to the current sad situation. This article aims to present a critical view on the evolution of the legal framework in the field of tissue and organ transplantation in Greece. Issues that still deter organ donation are discussed along with an insight into the current situation in the Greek social context in order to make a constructive contribution to future perspectives.

            New legislation in Greece towards presumed consent for organ donation, effective as of June 2013, has come at a critical moment. This pilot study aims to explore awareness, specific concerns and intentions about the new organ donation framework among patients attending Greek general practices in a rural and urban setting. Only 2.6% of respondents had a donor card, a mere 9.6% was aware of new legislation, whereas only 3.8% considered that the public had been adequately informed. Higher income respondents were more likely to be aware that they would be considered organ donors upon death, unless declared differently. Urban practice respondents were less likely to have previously discussed with a significant other their intentions in regards to presumed consent. One quarter of all respondents (22.4%) intended to carry out their right to prohibit organ removal upon death. Survey results reveal that organ donation reform has yet to be disseminated by the Greek society, underscoring the urgency for targeted information campaigns.

            Pro Bono Effort Thwarts State Attempt to Decertify Orphanage:
           </p>
           <p>
            The latest development in a long-running legal battle between a Hudson Valley orphanage and a public school district that has resisted accepting some two dozen orphans into its classrooms involves the claim by a state agency that the institution is “HARBORING” an ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. On Nov. 3, an administrative law judge in Albany shot down the claim – advanced by the New York State Office of Children and Family Services – as arbitrary and capricious. The state licensing agency had attempted to withhold operating certification for the orphanage, Saint Basil Academy in Garrison, which has been operated since 1944 by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese. At issue was the presence of a 14-year-old resident – “K.T.” as she is known in documents submitted to Administrative Law Judge William B. Day – who was ABANDONED in New York City four years ago by her MOTHER, a Greek national. According to legal papers, K.T. WAS BROUGHT TO NY AT AGE 10 AS A POSSIBLE ORGAN DONER for her 20-year-old brother, who later died at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. DISTRAUGHT AT HER SONS DEATH, THE MOTHER LEFT “KT” TO THE CHURCH AND RETURNED TO GREECE. “St. Basil is not ‘harboring’ K.T. as an illegal alien, as her presence in this country and her whereabouts have been made known to appropriate federal officials at all relevant times,” the decision said. “No action has been taken by those federal authorities or any other law enforcement entity against St. Basil in connection with their continued efforts to keep K.T. in their facility while seeking to resolve the child’s immigration status.” Lawyers for the Office of Children and Family Services did not appear at the Nov. 3 hearing, nor did they file documents challenging the position of K.T.’s attorney – James M. Stillwaggon, of counsel at White &amp; Case and chairman of its pro bono committee. Previous attempts by counsel for the Garrison school district to intervene on behalf of the state agency’s earlier attempts to decertify Saint Basil, in 2004 and 2005, were rejected on grounds of improper standing. Attorneys for both sides declined to comment on why the state agency has been so insistent in attempting to decertify the orphanage.

             St. Basil's operated as an unlicensed orphanage since 1997

             GARRISON, NY — In a letter dated January 2, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) formerly notified St. Basil Academy Executive Director Fr. Constantine Sitaras that the institution had been denied an operating certificate. While the property continues to be owned by National Philoptochos, the archdiocese has long administered the academy as one of its ministries. In recent years, St. Basil has transformed itself from being a boarding school to providing residential care for an estimated 24 children. In denying the application for an operating license, the State of New York cited a number of reasons for its decision, including “a history of unlicensed operation” beginning in 1997. Once St. Basil ceased operation of its educational program, it was no longer exempt from compliance with New York’s Interstate Compact in the Placement of Children (ICPC). Nevertheless, according to the State of NY’s document denying certification, St. Basil continued to accept placement of children from outside New York state without first going through ICPC. The question concerning financial responsibility for the support of those children has resulted. Because St. Basil no longer operates as a boarding school for instruction in elementary subjects, “it has no authority to provide residential care for children outside the context of a boarding school.” According to the State of New York, “St. Basil has not taken steps to ensure that children in their care receive an appropriate education in accordance with the requirements of education law.” While in recent years the children of St. Basil would receive their education in the Highland Falls school district, that school has now refused to accept the children due to the institution’s alleged failure to pay more than $236,000 in tuition costs owed to the district. In September 2003, St. Basil then sought to enroll the children in the Garrison school district without payment of $46,000 in tuition costs to date, which the district said it is owed. As a result, the State of New York alleges in its denial for certification “St. Basil failed to meet its financial obligations, which calls into question the willingness of the agency to make the financial resources available to properly operate the program.” While St. Basil has 60 days within which to challenge the state’s denial of certification, the NY Division of Development and Prevention Services has directed the institution to “cease and desist any further operation for the residential care of children by January 31.”

             ST. BASIL ACADEMY TO CLOSE DAVID NOVICH THE JOURNAL NEWS (January 6, 2004) “St. Basil officials have said the children have no parents to care for them and have made the academy and the school district their home. But Garrison officials disagree and have said the children go home for the summer, make telephone calls to their parents and are covered by their medical insurance. Garrison Schools Superintendent Ellen Bergman had mixed feelings about the denial of the license. She said St. Basil students have done well at the school but have been a heavy expense for the district. Last month, school officials had to borrow $410,000 to cover the costs of the St. Basil students. In 1997, the academy stopped educating its children because of a lack of funds and started sending them to the neighboring Highland Falls-Fort Montgomery schools in Orange County and paying tuition. In addition, the academy was chartered as a boarding school, not as a residential-care facility.”

              While all the fighting and arguing is going on, back and forth, all I have to say is Why Are Those Children There?  And what are they doing during the day and night?  Something seems seriously wrong that those Children are not in school and it also seems that no one is sincerely concerned about their welfare.  Back and forth and Back and forth and treating them like a tennis game.  All the while nothing is resolved.  Someone is playing games and I think it is St. Basil Academy.

               They were being bussed to a local school. The students however, aren't residents, and the orphanage doesn't pay any taxes to support the school.
              </p>
              <p>
               The school realized most if not all of the children aren't actually orphans, and cried foul as they were going into debt for their education. They demanded the orphanage pay for tuition, which it refused.

                My thoughts too. But what are they doing that can't be detected?  If they Children were being sent to a school why would no one notice if something is wrong? I am also convinced they are hiding something.
