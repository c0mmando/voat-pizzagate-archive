            Hi rickman2. Might want to add the DCF profile page to this showing their inspections. A quick perusal showed that inspectors could not confirm any of the complaints articulated in the negtive reviews. I didn't read them all, but this one had a staff member missing a background check as well as use of a child's image on social media without parental permission:
            <a href="https://cares.myflfamilies.com/InspectionReport/PublicReport?id=426417">
             https://cares.myflfamilies.com/InspectionReport/PublicReport?id=426417
            </a>
            . There are
            <a href="https://cares.myflfamilies.com/PublicSearch/Search">
             many reports on the DCF page
            </a>
            that show various violations, including one that showed they weren't keeping admissions records of who the kids were allowed to be released to. Their last few inspections were all compliant.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you're right that the numerous five-star Google reviews seem fake. But we ought to note that the one-star reviews all seem to be made by the same disgruntled parent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we have any idea what role Villasana plays at the daycare? Who owns it? Does she, or is she just a teacher?
