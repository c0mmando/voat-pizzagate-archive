            Relax. Manafort was working for the Podesta group.
That is why he is in trouble. To me it looks more and more like Mana fort was a spy for the clintons

             We'll see. Mueller was the courier in the Clinton uranium sale so I'm not sure why you're trusting him. If Manafort were working as a spy for the Clintons, then Mueller and Manafort -- and the Pedostas -- would all be on the same side.

            Manafort will be sent to prison but it wont be for any "collusion" to win the election it will be for past financial crimes and hopefully the Podestas will also be sent to prison. That's all that will happen. Trump won't be impeached and Hillary won't ever go to prison. I think Hillary will run again in 2020 and the voting machines will be rigged to Maximum Level to get her in the Oval Office. The only way she won't run is if she dies or if her health is so bad she can't walk or stand but even then she could win in a wheelchair the fake news media will gin up the sympathy factor to help her win. She is desperate to be President so she can try to bury all the evidence that Trump and Sessions are too cowardly to prosecute her on.

            Curious week.  What has been most interesting to me is watching Democratic Congressmen and Senators not back up one inch.  It's like they are living in an alternate dimension or something.  The position they are pushing is that it doesn't matter that there is a mountain of evidence that Hillary and Bill, Comey, Mueller, Lynch, Obama, and a multitude of their cronies are guilty of multiple felonies stretching over a period of many years.  The important thing is Trump got peed on in a bed in Russia, even in the absence of any proof after a year of investigation that anything at all happened.  Uhh... these things are why i take the moniker huhWHAThuh.  Ok this is my best guess at what's going down.  I think they are continuing to do what they've done for the last year.  They have a huge political machine, unlimited finances, and a totally obedient dishonest media behind them.  They have nothing,  just as a year ago they had nothing.  That hasn't stopped them from  24/7 attack mode using anything they can make up and have the media push until it is proven to be false.  And then they just ignore that it has been proven false, and move forward attacking more.  They have nothing, but it's the best they can do.  Their only alternative would be to say ok ya caught us red handed, and shuffle off to the rest of their lives in Federal Prison.  I seriously think Mueller intends to swing for the bleachers and TRY to impeach Trump.  Yeah i know how crazy that sounds, but it's all they got.  And the old saying is that a prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich.  That would at least REALLY complicate matters, and throw everything into total confusion.  Maybe they think if they create enough chaos they can find a way to slip off the hook.  It's crazy, but apparently it's all they got.  You can't hit a home run without a bat.  But i at least suspect that Mueller is going to try.  Interesting week.

             Awesome summarization.

            <p>
             Yes, if you read the comments from the tweet, you'll see that the libtards are buying all the shit they're selling. Just because Assange, the person who would know who linked the emails, has only stated fifty million times that IT WASN'T THE RUSSIANS, no one believes him. They instead believe the people that brought us false narratives, socialism, Soro-paid terrorism, and 100 children being pulled off the streets of Haitit in one afternoon to fill some sort of quota!!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             If Mueller tries this, I hope when he goes down, it's on charges of TREASON!!!! May they all rot in prison!!!!

            Also interesting timing on the new fake uranium scandal.  Almost like Team Trump knew these indictments were coming.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you genuinely surprised someone got indicted?  They got a search warrant for Paul Manafort's house.  You need to have pretty solid evidence for that.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               A former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos, secretly pleaded guilty as part of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
              </p>
              <p>
               Papadopoulos had suggested that Donald Trump meet with top Russian leaders during the campaign. He pleaded guilty to making false statements during an interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

              Here's why's it's important, he was trying to set up meetings between Trump and Putin.  Manafort shot it down because it would be too obvious
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Three days after joining Trump's campaign, Papadopoulos sent emails concerning Vladimir Putin to seven campaign officials. Between March and September 2016, he made at least six requests for Trump to meet with Russian politicians, one of which was rejected by Paul Manafort in May....
              </p>
              <p>
               Senator Richard Burr, chair of the Senate panel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, said in October 2017 that the panel was interested in Papadopoulos because he had sent e-mails attempting to set up meetings between Trump and Vladimir Putin.

               Two other lobbying firms were mentioned in the Manafort indictment.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 As part of the scheme, in February 2012, MANAFORT and GATES solicited two
Washington, D.C., ?rms (Company A and Company B) to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych, the Party of Regions, and the Government of Ukraine. For instance, GATES wrote to Company A that it would be representing the Government of Ukraine in [Washington,] ....
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                At the direction of MANAFORT and GATES, Company A and Company engaged in
extensive lobbying. Among other things, they lobbied multiple Members of Congress and their
staffs about Ukraine sanctions, the validity of Ukraine elections, and the propriety of
Yanukovych?s imprisoning his presidential rival, Yulia Tymoshenko (who had served as Ukraine
President prior to Yanukovych). MANAFORT and GATES also lobbied in connection with the
roll out of a report concerning the Tymoshenko trial commissioned by the Government of Ukraine.
MANAFORT and GATES used one of their offshore accounts to funnel $4 million to pay secretly
for the report.

                 To minimize public disclosure of their lobbying campaign, MANAFORT and GATES
arranged for the Centre to be the nominal client of Company A and Company B, even though in
fact the Centre was under the ultimate direction of the Government of Ukraine, Yanukovych, and
the Party of Regions. For instance, MANAFORT and GATES selected Company A and Company
B, and only thereafter did the Centre sign contracts with the lobbying ?rms without ever meeting
either company. Company A and Company were paid for their services not by their nominal
client, the Centre, but solely through off-shore accounts associated with the MANAFORT-GATES
entities, namely Bletilla Ventures Limited (in Cyprus) and Jeunet Ltd. and Global Endeavour Inc.
To conceal the scheme, MANAFORT and GATES developed a false and misleading cover

weekly scheduled calls and frequent emails with Company A and Company to provide them
directions as to specific lobbying steps that should be taken; sought and received detailed oral and
written reports from these ?rms on the lobbying work they had performed; communicated with
Yanukovych to brief him on their lobbying efforts; both congratulated and reprimanded Company
A and Company on their lobbying work; communicated directly with United States officials in
connection with this work; and paid the lobbying ?rms over $2 million from offshore accounts
they controlled, among other things. In addition, court?authorized searches of MANAFORT and
DMI email accounts and Virginia residence in July 2017 revealed
numerous documents, including documents related to lobbying, which were more than thirty?days

               Yes, nonsense verified by the FBI? The $145 million is a lie too? Clinton's $500k? Mueller's involvement? Podesta Group being investigated alongside Manafort?

               What do you mean he doesn't care about Manafort - they searched his home via warrant. You even cited that yourself.

            Its a Hail Mary....the FBI informant testimony will hang GPS, the DNC and Hillary....selling US uranium to Putin.....and Mueller was INVOLVED, courier to the Russians with a sample of the yellow cake in his briefcase.  Congress is going to call for a special prosecutor after the informant testifies....Mueller at risk of indictment, even as he tries others.  Its crazy.

            Do you really think a scumbag like that did the right thing? Pedosta should be charged! He's the one that's been lying! And his firms were colluding with Russia! Hell, he was in bed with them and everybody else!!!!
