<p>So after reading a few reviews on Comet Ping Pong\'s Yelp page, I came across this guy Greg O. who gave 4 reviews with all 5 stars, one of them being Comet Ping Pong.</p>

<p>I clicked on one of the other restaurants he rated called &quot;TACO-ma Yucatan Chicken&quot; in Takoma Park, Wash, DC located ~3mi. away from Comet Ping Pong, and noticed a huge resemblance to the \'little boy lover\' pedophile symbol in its business logo and a chicken (which is also a key word among pedophiles for \'little boy\').</p>
<p>Directions from TACO-ma to Comet Ping Pong on Google Maps:
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/353+Cedar+Street+Northwest,+Washington,+DC+20012,+USA/5037+Connecticut+Avenue+Northwest,+Washington,+DC+20008/@38.9364131,-77.0583597,13z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c884c2ba6825:0x9f389bc149e1650!2m2!1d-77.0182416!2d38.9749179!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c9b98f2f14f1:0xdbe7c200b0db3497!2m2!1d-77.0699666!2d38.9559497">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/353+Cedar+Street+Northwest,+Washington,+DC+20012,+USA/5037+Connecticut+Avenue+Northwest,+Washington,+DC+20008/@38.9364131,-77.0583597,13z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c884c2ba6825:0x9f389bc149e1650!2m2!1d-77.0182416!2d38.9749179!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c9b98f2f14f1:0xdbe7c200b0db3497!2m2!1d-77.0699666!2d38.9559497</a></p>
<p>TACO-ma Yucatan Chicken Logo:

<p>Then I was flipping through the other photos and I noticed one with many different pedophile symbols plastered all over the banner surrounding the top of the wall over the kitchen. It shows four different symbols including \'boy lover\' symbols, \'little boy lover\' symbols, cacti (which can be interpreted as a trident, which is a symbol of enforcement among occultist groups), and lizards or reptiles of some kind (which also has a huge connection to satanism).</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, I found out that this establishment is owned by someone who also owns a PIZZA restaurant in Takoma, Maryland called Roscoe\'s Mediterranean Pizzaria. I cannot find the name of the business owner(s), other than this guy named Ed Grossman. According to another guy who I\'ve been working with on this, there are multiple owners (possibly 4 or more). </p>

<p>What I found peculiar is the common theme of chickens/roosters. They seem to have an obsession with chickens an roosters. I know it is like their &quot;mascot&quot; but come on... a Pizza place obsessed with chickens/roosters?</p>

<p>Anyway, due to my lack of resources, this is where I stopped investigating. I couldn\'t find anymore information on the business owners and I don\'t know where to find any other type of financial information on the restaurants. If anyone wants to help investigate this company, I encourage them to do so. Otherwise, I\'m simply going to post this and move on to anything else I can find.</p>

            If you don't like how we work and don't think it's credible, fuck off.  We don't give a fuck.  And that's how we've gotten this far.

            Who said anything about demonizing anyone before digging further? I don't do that, do you? There are other paths to the money. I haven't even tried to follow the money only because I'm not experienced in that field, which is why I stated that in the post. Plus, I don't see that you've made any significant discoveries, so what do you have to lose?
