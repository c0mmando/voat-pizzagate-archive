<p>If you haven\'t been following <a href="https://voat.co/user/GeorgeWebb">@GeorgeWebb</a> on this topic, I highly recommend. After watching his videos, and doing some of my own research, I do believe that Braverman is a key to all of this. He had access to all of the dirt &amp; it seemed was willing to expose it. Onto what I discovered today...</p>
<p>Eric Braverman was also involved with an organization called the &quot;Tembo Group.&quot;, which it says &quot;provides strategic support to philanthropists, companies and non-profits looking to build, enhance or launch a significant social impact effort.&quot; </p>
<p>He as listed as an &quot;expert&quot; on their website, but, was taken off of the website on November 2. (See Reddit Link here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bdsvm/eric_braverman_silenty_removed_from_the_tembo/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bdsvm/eric_braverman_silenty_removed_from_the_tembo/)</a>)</p>
<p>That is interesting in itself, but, after digging through the other names listed on Tembo Group, one that stood out was Eric Nonacs. Eric Nonacs has been highly involved with the Clinton Foundation (Senior Advisor) &amp; also was the President of Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership. Giustra is a shady character himself, but, that\'s for another post. </p>
<p>I did a Wikileaks search for Nonacs and the email address it returned was &quot;eric@skollglobalthreats.org.&quot; Skoll Global Threats was an unfamiliar entity to me, so, did some digging on that. And what I found I think is highly correlated to why Braverman may be missing, in FBI custody, asylum, or whatever.</p>
<p>Skoll Global Threats says its mission is to confront global threats (poverty, water, nuclear, pandemics, and <strong>MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT</strong>) imperiling humanity. It was founded by EBay founder,  Jeff Skoll. Skoll Global Threat\'s CEO, Sally Osberg, identifies &quot;pioneers with scalable solutions to meet global challenges.&quot; A bunch of wordy non-sense. One of those pioneers is a company called Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC)</p>
<p>And here\'s where it gets interesting. CCC is <strong>the largest construction firm in the Middle East</strong>. The company basically comes in and rebuilds the infrastructure in countries like Libya, Syria, Iraq, etc. CCC also has strong ties to the Clinton Foundation, as shown here, as being a sponsor and contributor at the 2015 Clinton Foundation Annual Meeting:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/new-participants-and-attendees-announced-address-future-impact-11th-clinton-global">https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/new-participants-and-attendees-announced-address-future-impact-11th-clinton-global</a></p>
<p>It gets even more interesting. For those that have been following George Well, he has shown how Clinton used HSBC as the bank to hide assets in after governments fall -- like Qaddafi/Libya. And what construction firm built HSBC\'s new headquarters in Egypt? CCC.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marcopolis.net/consolidated-contractors-company-ccc-and-their-projects-in-egypt.htm">http://www.marcopolis.net/consolidated-contractors-company-ccc-and-their-projects-in-egypt.htm</a></p>
<p>It doesn\'t end there. **CCC is also heavily invested in oil and natural gas, and in pipelines like Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan&quot; -- located in Turkey. </p>
<p>CCC Pipeline Investment link: <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2016/08/20/politico-dems-worried-about-influence-peddling-optics-of-clinton-global-initiative/">http://hotair.com/archives/2016/08/20/politico-dems-worried-about-influence-peddling-optics-of-clinton-global-initiative/</a></p>
<p>Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku%E2%80%93Tbilisi%E2%80%93Ceyhan_pipeline#/media/File:Baku_pipelines.svg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku%E2%80%93Tbilisi%E2%80%93Ceyhan_pipeline#/media/File:Baku_pipelines.svg</a></p>
<p>George Webb has shown how Clinton Foundation goes into North Africa &amp; Middle East countries, with the goal of dismantling them, and then taking their own rights. A highly known goal was to create a pipeline from Qatar, up through Syria and Turkey, into Eastern Europe. <strong>Russia, of course, also is looking to build a pipeline through Turkey, the &quot;Turkish Stream&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Stream">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Stream</a></p>
<p>So, there is a very apparent conflict of interest between Clinton and her Foundation &amp; Russia. Billions on the line. It\'s not difficult to figure out who might be interested in disrupting Turkey-Russia relations. Maybe offing a Russian Ambassador is one way to try and do that.</p>
<p>Anyways, there is still more... The CTO of CCC, Nafez Housseini, is also the founder of &quot;Partners For Sustainable Development&quot;, a Palestinian NGO which &quot;is committed to working in partnership with the poor, youth, women, recovering from natural or man-made disasters.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.psdglobal.org/">http://www.psdglobal.org/</a></p>
<p>The Clinton Foundation -- and Hewlett Foundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation -- is tied into this organization, via the &quot;Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data.&quot; Basically, they use organizations like PSDglobal to gain data -- data on victims of disasters, under the guise of &quot;using satellites to monitor agriculture efforts, to citizen engagement tools to understand sanitation requirements in villages in remote parts of the world&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.data4sdgs.org/who-we-are/">http://www.data4sdgs.org/who-we-are/</a></p>
<p><strong>More specific to Hillary Clinton, she is at the forefront of creating Data2X.</strong> Data2X is run through the UN (shadiest of all global institutions) and is used to advance gender data, focusing on civil registration statistics via cell phone records, satellite datasets, and social media. It says, &quot; The work is exploratory and aims to demonstrate what big data can and cannot achieve.&quot; Basically, its formed just as a reason to compile large sets of data on young women in impoverished countries -- <strong>including Haiti</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://data2x.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Big-Data-Projects.pdf">http://data2x.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Big-Data-Projects.pdf</a></p>
<p>So, basically, to sum this all up: Eric Braverman was cut off from the Tembo Group, because he knew about the connections between Skoll-CCC-Clinton Foundation. And the CCC is connected to an organization which essentially collects data on young women in geographies that have been inflicted by man made or natural disasters. The exact population set that is most in danger of trafficking.</p>',

            Excellent research and post...Tom Heinemann made a documentary on micro loans for debt enslavement. The Clintons and Giustra have enlisted Digicel (Denis O'Brien - Billionaire junk bond man/ donor to the CF etc) in 3rd world countries - Haiti, PNG, Africa etc to enlist their labour slaves...especially women.
“The Micro Debt” - trailer.

             Interesting, because people have been warned in regards to researching Muhammad Yunus....
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “The Micro Debt” also takes a closer look at the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, Grameen Bank and Mr. Muhammad Yunus. The film reveals a number of secret documents proving how Mr. Yunus back in the mid-90’s transferred 100 mio. USD – where most was donated as grants from Norway, Sweden, Germany, USA and Canada – to a new company in the Grameen-family
             </p>
             <p>
              The poor always pay back
The film crew travelled several times to Bangladesh, and visited some of the most hailed villages in the history of the Nobel laureate Grameen Bank.
In Jobra we met the daughter of the famous loan taker, Sufiya Begun and in “Hillary Village”, where the former first lady in the USA, Hillary Clinton in 1995 came and cheered both Mohammad Yunus and Grameen Bank, the crew meets poor people who has gained nothing else but more debt due to microcredit.
Almost each and every loan taker interviewed told the same story. All had multiple loans in various Micro credit banks and organisations and all interviewed had a hard time trying to pay back their loans. Some had sold their house, others had their tin-sheets pulled of their houses to cover the weekly payments.

            Yes...which leads all the way back to Muhammud Yunus, king of the human enslavement tool known as "microcredit". Did you know the clintons were interested in utilizing microcredit all the way back during their AR days? Now how would a podunk governor from AR come to know the king of microcredit and future Nobel peace prize winner?? Do you know who lobbied  really hard for him to receive the Nobel? Ah, yes.. The clintons.

            Hell yes. Upvoat from hell. Great work! I feel like I remember reading something somewhere about "Partners For Sustainable Development" ... can someone check to see if there are any ties to the Haitian earthquake efforts or Bernard Kouchner/France/Zoe's Ark?  I know I have seen this organization mentioned somewhere else in my digging, I just can't remember where.

            Kudos on "possible disappearnce."  So few leave room for doubt or use proper caveats.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, your setup is a bit off.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             My research today started with looking into the possible disappearance of Eric Braverman, the former CEO of the Clinton Foundation who resigned after telling an MSNBC reporter to "follow the money". 
Braverman Resigned in January 2015.
             <br/>
             In March 2015 an article appeared where the source told the author to "follow the money."  So this happened after Braverman resigned.
We don't know that Braverman is that source, but he is a strong suspect of being that source due to the timing and he was John Podesta's first hunch.
The quote was not made to an MSNBC reporter.  (And Joe Scarborough is not a reporter, he's a pundit.)  The source said this to a National Journal reporter/columnist, Ron Fournier.   Joe Scarborough tweeted in reference to this article.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The other point from that article that people overlook is the source said he had not evidence of wrongdoing.

             Ignore AreWeSure, he's a possible shill. I've caught him numerous times saying "there's nothing to see here folks, move along". AreWeSure doesn't realize the Witness Protection Program was specifically set up for RICO cases which no doubt The Clinton Foundation will be when Trump takes office and drops the hammer on Killary.

            It is the other son, Hunter. Beau Biden was the Delaware AG who prosecuted the pedo crime ring, which, I am guessing was either to eliminate the competition or, he was cancered for being honorable.

            Came in to suggest George Webb myself. He's brilliant at at he does.  For anyone interested here's his channel:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb">

            Get ready to be amazed.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know, I've been thinking about him for the last couple of days and may leave him a comment. I'm not sure that he would do it or that he would have the time or interest, and I certainly don't want to do anything that might put him in danger (although only he can judge that for himself), but I think he would be able to make strong connections between pizza gate/ human trafficking/ ritual sexual abuse/Murder and the Clinton foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel like you probably have been following the hints and clues that FBIanon left for us. S/he emphasized the connection to the Clinton Foundation. There are many spectacular investigators here that are making some connections in that regard but he is able to go so deep and so wide that I think only someone with his skills is really going to be able to do that.

            One other thing to add here is the hot bed of human trafficking involved over there .  When I was researching Cheryl Mills' prior job with New York University there were complaints of human slavery building NYU's Abu Dhabi campus.  As well as NYU's Shanghai campus. NYT did a story about the complaints. Somehow I could see CCC involved in all of this.

            They are a cozy group aren't they?  I keep seeing the same players in forming these organizations.  What was the thread that spoke about having IT people set up a huge IT database?  I remember HRC wanted to be kept in the loop on the issue.  I think this thread was involved in the shipping aspect. (I save threads on here, but I don't know how to find them later! Talk about being IT challenged!)
