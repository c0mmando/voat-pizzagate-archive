           <p>
            You know, I honestly don't think we have to try as HARD to get people to see what it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've got 3 types of people, regardless of what any of us do:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The believers/researchers
The immobile (They don't care either way)
The denials
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            There isn't a way (to the best of my knowledge) to create another category. The only way to increase a category is to move the immobile to the believers. We haven't had another ACTUAL leak (via wikileaks, what pizzagate is really standing on by main form of information) in over 2 months. Yes, we've had anons on 4chan, pedo busts with norway and austraila, and "new" information/updates via "alternative" media (zerohedge, breitbart, your news wire, etc.), and we've had one local MSM outlet (Ben Swann) cover pizzagate and it's concerns of being "fake news".
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone is still in denial by this point (without further damning information like a wikileak leak/s), I believe, IMHO they will stay in denial even if they seen Hillary or Podesta's fingering a child and sacrificing it to satan. It's sad, but true. These are they same people that criticize Trump for actually doing what ever other president has promised to do for the past half century, and he gets called horrible names for doing it. You can't reason with these people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I applaud all of us for keeping on keeping on as we should continue to do, but me PERSONALLY, I believe our work and tactics bringing awareness to pizzagate have been a complete success.
           </p>
           <p>
            As David Seaman put it: "Federal agencies and high gov't officials have it in their hands now." For me, that gave me a huge sense of peace. We have made this our lives the past almost 3 months, and it's paying off now. We should continue to post no doubt, but i don't think awareness is our problem anymore. I truly believe EVERYONE will become aware aware of it soon, very soon. But whether they accept it then despite irrefutable evidence we can never control.

            I agree this is a great way to get everyone's attention and, before the mods remove your post through compartmentalization, I recommend tweeting on Lady Gag's Twitter account and ask her why she's best buds with Abramovic and how she was able to get all of that blood into her hotel room, so she could bathe in it. You know, inquiring minds want to know.

             Hi!  Wolftrail7272 and I are still investigating the Archdiocese in St Louis being involved with Organ Harvesting and tying in with the West Lake Landfill.  It is a disgusting operation they have going on.  Also, the tweet is a great idea.  It is disgusting to think of what they will be doing to little children during the game.  We are not watching we are boycotting.  I think all Pizzagate Believers Should Boycott The Game.

              While probably not directly related, I believe I have stumbled upon something that may be of interest to your research. I was trying to find more information about the MOCA Gala and checked out their donors. Well, when I dug deeper into the Dr. Steven F. Roth Family Foundation, this page came up:
              <a href="http://worldoilcorp.com/roth-family">
               http://worldoilcorp.com/roth-family
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              It seems the family is deeply involved in Cedars-Sinai Hospitals with organ transplants as their main interest. Take note of Steven F. Roth's dedication to the Wilshire Boulevard Temple and its schools, the Special Olympics, and Big Brothers and others. 
" Steven F. Roth manages World Oil’s extensive real estate assets throughout California, including marine terminals and large infill development sites. Prior to joining World Oil, he was one of the original founding partners of Creative Artists Agency (CAA), and served as Vice Chairman of the board of International Creative Management. He was also partner of the literary firm Zeigler, Disktan and Roth, and produced several motion pictures including Scrooged, Mobsters, Gladiator and Last Action Hero. Steven has served concurrently as a board member of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA).
             </p>
             <p>
              Through the Steven F. Roth Family Foundation, he and his family have made significant contributions to leading institutions including LACMA, Wilshire Boulevard Temple and its schools, Cedars-Sinai Hospital, the Music Center of Los Angeles and Special Olympics. He is also a strong supporter of inner city Los Angeles charities such as Meals on Wheels, Big Brothers and others, and is a member of the Watts Walk of Fame."
             </p>
             <p>
              Checking out Wilshire Temple and its schools, they describe themselves as liberal and are partnered with Warner Bros.

             </p>
             <p>
              Interesting that the Roth family seems to have their hands in everything from medicine to schools to Hollyweird, with a special interest in organ transplants and extremely high priced art auctions.

               You may have discovered a ball of yarn that may keep unraveling.  It may be the copy of what is occurring in St. Louis.  I believe this is going on in all large hub cities possibly also connected to the Catholic Archdiocese.  You may try to start connecting what you have discovered to Archbishops or Cardinals and sexual abuse.  In St. Louis, the Archdiocese owns the deed to the Landfill, So........somehow it is all connected in some way, maybe to the Vatican? Just a wild guess at this point.  I don't know, maybe we can just keep researching (I now almost hate using the word dig) and then try to connect?  We shall see.  Keep in touch and I will too if I find something new.

                Yes, a ball of yarn indeed! I must say that I find it strange that all these religious groups are so intent on working with and learning about organ transplants. I was under the impression that death was a normal part of life that God intended, so why work against it? Especially if being a good person gets you into heaven, or where ever your religion teaches that your spirit goes, why try to avoid this wonderful place? And if heaven is no longer a goal, what difference is it if you're a good person or not?

                 The reason they are involved is big money.  They don't care about us.  They could give a rat's behind about the children of the world either.  They would take your child or any of your family.  They do not care.  Children are disposable, especially if they are poor.  The only reason the Churches are against abortion is because they want more kids, for themselves.  Harsh, but true. And so very sick.

                  I totally agree with everything you said. If you haven't watched it, you should check out The Outer Dark's video about Father Malachi Martin and why he left the church. In his book, he states that Satanism and pedophilia were taking over the church in the late 70s.

              I completely agree. I've been boycotting the Super Bowl for a few years now. It really isn't worth the hype that it is when you see that some of the players do horrible things, yet get slaps on the wrist. I have been reading a lot of what Woldtrail7272 has been revealing and I'm keeping up with his work. I haven't really found anything that hasn't been discussed yet. I'm just hoping that the arrests are indeed happening this week and we can stop holding our collective breaths and focus more on what you and Woldtrail7272 are looking into as well as other things. It's tough to stay focused as I work two jobs and studying for a certification. Now, if I could figure out how to get by on 3 hours of sleep, I could get so much more research accomplished! We're all in the same boat though. It's tough trying to do the jobs of those our tax dollars are going to, and knowing that all of them are white hats is so disturbing. I'm glad you have been making headway and tomorrow I'll see what I can contribute seeing as work should be slow because the of the Superb Owl.

             mods said events are OK in the main sub as long as they aren't in some long-term planning type stages..

              , and just to make this clear: I'm not advocating that the huge visibility

              offers should not be used to help activists raise awareness. Quite the opposite: I would like these posts to be on the front page of the main sub, but only if and when the proposed events are organized and are practically guaranteed to happen.

             spreading awareness during the big game is short-term basic and would be awesome as others have mentioned everything to raise awareness helps
