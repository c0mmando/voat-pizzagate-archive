Of course, he\'s building another mosque to worship moloch there as well.    
</p>
<p>Then I got to thinking, this is pretty close to the mainland. Could someone not buy a drone and fly over the island to check it out? You\'d need to stay somewhere on the mainland. Enter Ritz Carlton Club

Seems pretty odd there are no pics of the actual place you\'d be staying, and almost all of the ones there have pictures of children or babies<br />
Could he be trying to nab the same rich clientel that don\'t want to stay on Epstiens rape islands but still want to be within a 10 minute boat ride?<br />
Owner is Philip Tirone, an apparent real estate guy and works in the tax field<br />

<p>Could be something or nothing, but he makes a reference to pizza<br />
&quot;suggest a few other options like a pizza party with his friends&quot;<br />
Also attended a jobs tour event for Carly Fiorina and Carlos Gutierrez at Patty\'s Presto Pizza in California <br />
<a href="https://archive.fo/GNyet">https://archive.fo/GNyet</a>

Someone definitely needs to look further into ASSET and the names involved
Is the Philip guy a pedo? ehhh...sketchy connection there, but he certainly posts a lot of photos of his kids on the place he rents, and runs in the same crowds as a lot of the rich and powerful. 
Someone could also be looking into Great st james island.  
</p>
<p>At the very least this generates some leads for names that could be involved in pizzagate / trafficking</p>',
