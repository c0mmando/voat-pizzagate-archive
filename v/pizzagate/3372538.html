</blockquote>
<p>That\'s the contrarian Musk for you.  Warns about the dangers of AI then  produces a brain-computer interface.. I guess we should trust him coz he knows what he\'s doing, right?</p>
<p>Well, what about OpenAI?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAI is the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP, whose parent organization is the non-profit organization OpenAI Inc[3] that conducts research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the stated aim to promote and develop friendly AI in such a way as to benefit humanity as a whole.  </p>
<p>..The founders (notably Elon Musk and Sam Altman) are motivated in part by concerns about existential risk from artificial general intelligence. </p>

<p>Searching voat\'s archives you will find that Y Combinator is quite a controversial company on Voat because of its connections to Peter Thiel, Palantir and Dyncorp.  
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Y Combinator is an American seed accelerator which was launched in March 2005. Y Combinator is consistently ranked at the top of U.S. accelerators </p>
<p>In 2009, Sequoia Capital led the $2 million investment round into an entity of Y Combinator which would allow the company to invest in approximately 60 companies a year as opposed to their previous 40 companies a year.[4] The following year, Sequoia led a $8.25 million funding round for Y Combinator to further increase the number of startups the company could fund </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sequoia Capital is an interesting company because of its deep links to the intelligence community.. it has close links with In-Q-Tel, the CIA venture capital firm: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-funded-by-cia-2016-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-funded-by-cia-2016-9?r=US&amp;IR=T</a> </p>

<p>In-Q-Tel (named after &quot;Q&quot; in the James Bond films) invests in companies that can deliver useful technology to the intelligence community within 36 months. </p>

<p>This link shows Sequoia\'s prominence in In-Q-Tel\'s company portfolio: <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/in-tel-portfolio-companies#section-investors-that-invested-in-companies-in-this-hub">https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/in-tel-portfolio-companies#section-investors-that-invested-in-companies-in-this-hub</a> </p>
<p>Here\'s a comment I made a few months ago on a pizzagate post about Sequoia in :</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2702836/13716304">MUSICAL.LY Is Apparently The New YouTube Of Underage Children Being Allowed to Post Suggestive Videos...Spokeswoman Says.&quot;This Is Where Kids Can Get Their Groove On</a></p>
<p>So, with all this talk of technology doesn\'t it make you think of Epstein and Nicole Junkermann? Are there links?  Hell, yeah...let\'s head on ver to Junkermann\'s Carbyne911: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/carbyne-raises-15m-for-its-next-gen-911-service-as-founders-fund-invests-in-its-first-israeli-startup/">Carbyne raises $15M for its next-gen 911 service, as Founders Fund invests in its first Israeli startup</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The round is significant not just because of the boost that it will give to Carbyne  itself, but because of who is doing the backing. Led by Elsted Capital Partners, it also includes Founders Fund, the VC that has backed the likes of Facebook and Airbnb, but also startups that have made strong inroads into working with government and other public sector organizations on data-based services, such as Palantir, Anduril and Deep Mind (now a part of Google). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Founders Fund <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founders_Fund">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founders_Fund</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Founders Fund is a San Francisco-based venture capital firm. Formed in 2005, Founders Fund had more than $3 billion in aggregate capital under management as of 2016. The firm invests across all stages and sectors, including aerospace, artificial intelligence, advanced computing, energy, health, and consumer Internet, with a portfolio that includes Airbnb, Lyft, Spotify, Stripe, and Oscar Health. Founders Fund was the first institutional investor in Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and Palantir Technologies, and one of the earliest investors in Facebook. The firm’s partners, including Peter Thiel, Ken Howery and Brian Singerman, have been founders, early employees and investors at companies including PayPal, Google, Palantir Technologies, and SpaceX. </p>

<p>Well, we\'ve got a few pizzagate posts on AirBnB and Lyft...(as well as Palantir and Google).. like: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3182143/18249617">PSU Chemistry Professor who faces 35 Counts Of CHILD PORN drives for Lyft, DoorDash and Postmates and has links with Jeffrey Epstein</a></p>

            Researchers funded by NLink and Musk released this proposal for HUMAN brain injections/implantations containing neural RECORDING and STIMULATION devices!!!! Seems they are normalizing MK brain electrode style procedures within Biology/Medical Journal for peer review, and they even have a device, not just an implantation needle- a fucking sewing machine :

           <p>
            A SEWING MACHINE is essentially a mechanized needle, able to cover a large swath, rapidly penetrate many consecutive holes, controlled by one common thread.  Priming the biologists, doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, and medical industries for mass robotic implantation of a mind reading/contrlling chip, under the guise of evolved health care?

             We present a system for scalable and customizable recording and stimulation of neural activity. In large animals and humans, the current benchmark for high spatial and temporal resolution neural interfaces are fixed arrays of wire or silicon electrodes inserted into the parenchyma of the brain. However, probes that are large and stiff enough to penetrate the brain have been shown to cause acute and chronic damage and inflammation, which limits their longevity, stability, and yield.

            Whenever a major Corporation or a Government announces advances in a technology, you can assume they're actually 5-10 years (if not further) further down the road in their private labs. I wouldn't put it past them to have already implanted the chips in live human subjects (homeless people who wouldn't be missed) who are disposed of afterwards.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Camelot began as a consortium which had to fight many rivals to win the role of being the National Lottery controller. The groups making up the consortium were International Computers Limited (ICL), Racal, Cadbury Schweppes , De La Rue and GTECH Corporation. After they won the original bid in 1994, the year the National Lottery started, Camelot executives were criticised by Labour for their desire for big salaries and bonuses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Camelot has been operating it for 24 years. However, serious challenges have been made by Richard Branson, in 2000, and in 2017 media mogul Richard Desmond was planning a takeover bid too. As of 2010, Camelot has been owned by
