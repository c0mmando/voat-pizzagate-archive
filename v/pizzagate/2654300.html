            "Late last month, a former Shambhala teacher released a report alleging that the Sakyong had sexually abused and exploited some of his most devoted female followers for years. Women quoted in the report wrote of drunken groping and forcefully extracted sexual favors. The report said that senior leaders at Shambhala — an organization whose motto is “Making Enlightened Society Possible” — knew of the Sakyong’s misconduct and covered it up."
           </p>
           <p>
            …
           </p>
           <p>
            "The woman behind the exposé, Andrea Winn, grew up in the Shambhala community in Halifax and says that she and many other children were sexually abused by adults in the community."
           </p>
           <p>
            …
           </p>
           <p>
            "The downfall of a Buddhist leader in the West accused of sexual impropriety has become its own sorry tradition. Last year, Lama Norlha Rinpoche, who founded a monastery in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., retired after allegations of sexual misconduct. So did Sogyal Rinpoche, author of “The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying,” who was accused of decades of sexual assaults and violent rage. In the Zen tradition, fallen masters include Joshu Sasaki and Eido Shimano, two of the leading proponents of Zen in America.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Shambhala, bad behavior runs in the bloodline. The organization was founded by the Sakyong’s Tibet-born father, Chögyam Trungpa, a wildly charismatic man, brilliant teacher and embodiment of the concept known as “crazy wisdom” whose alcoholic exploits and womanizing were well known. He died in 1987. In between Chögyam Trungpa and the Sakyong, Shambhala was led by an American-born Buddhist who is mainly remembered for having sex with students even after he knew that he had AIDS."

            "In 2014, before this rampant abuse and tolerance of pedophilia in the community, for the last forty years,  leaked out in 2018,   Shambhala was conducting politically correct campaigns and nice words from their psychologist cult members, and public relations department, with the usual soft-propaganda- designed, Shambhala rhetoric  created to make people think this group was about gender equality, as a recruiter technique. So, of course the sexual abuse inside the group got worse."

               No problem, I'll try to explain it better. Please don't hesitate to get back to me once more if it should be too cryptic.

              <p>
               In 2014, before this rampant abuse and tolerance of pedophilia in the community, for the last forty years, leaked out in 2018, Shambhala was conducting politically correct campaigns and nice words from their psychologist cult members, and public relations department, with the usual soft-propaganda- designed, Shambhala rhetoric created to make people think this group was about gender equality, as a recruiter technique. So, of course the sexual abuse inside the group got worse.

                 , no worries. Sorry to hear that the post is gone. (Happened to me two days ago - I wrote a post, but unfortunately didn't save it to my hard disk, like I usually do - then I submitted - but Voat showed only an empty page. And the text was gone, of course...... So you're not the only one fighting the Voat system... ;-))
