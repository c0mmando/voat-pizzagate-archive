            I believe Joaquin is one of the few who exactly knows what's going on. He wants to expose the babylonian masquerade as much as he can do.

            The title makes me think of the photographer who realized the crooked pol he was working for had a body double for him. If they can't seduce someone, they could get a body double to do something awful and film it and use it as blackmail; they just might have to drug the target and then say while they were out they did that.

            They make such movies to appease people. It's a bit like when people were saying Aviici was working against child trafficking. He wasn't - he was replacing thoughts with fiction.  I'd have to watch the film myself to see what subtext the "Hollywood ending" was masking.

            Another hiding in plain sight Movie Message.  How many of these have been churned out by Follywood?  Some will think some actor is a good guy and wants to let us know what is going on behind the scenes. The Message is not for us it is for THEM.   It's all a Big Joke on us.

              There was no statement about the real Jews.  We know that Zionists are not the real Jews.  There was nothing about knocking Jews only Zionists.  Besides I agree with the background story being a hidden message.  Many have discussed this on here before.

               Yeah you should be careful carmencita...the guy who lives 8 miles from Langley Virginia is concerned you might figure out that Zionism is the secular movement that runs the worldwide organized crime syndicate...
              </p>
              <p>
               And remember...Jews loved Jesus to death and have a long and detailed history of always being morally upstanding and religiously tolerant individuals who never manipulated anyone, anywhere, ever...Just ask Voltaire, Richard Wagner, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, and Mark Twain...they'll vouch for them too...

                I understand your feelings about the Zionists but regular everyday Jews have been very kind to me.  One took me in decades ago.  I hope you do not hate ALL Jews.  Only the pedophiles.

            Thanks for the heads up. A similar theme is contained in the movie "Taken"  starring Liam Neeson as a retired CIA agent using his deadly skills to recover his daughter and her friend who were kidnapped for the sex trade.

            Those films might educate the public of this scourge better than we can. But what if it gives bad guys ideas?  Of course it might encourage vigilante action, too. I wish I had never heard of this stuff. I grew up in a Leave it to Beaver environment in the 1950s and it is so sad that children may never experience that kind of innocent wholesome upbringing again.

            Folks, I've been recovering from surgeries that gave me the luxury of making lots of comments here lately but I'm going to take my leave and get back to my normal routine for awhile. Love to all.

             I remember pinging you when I first started commenting.  Things always seemed clearer when you jumped on. Thank You!   I hope you will not pull out completely for with the new NXIVM charges coming we will need a lot of help.  Maybe you can recommend someone.  I hope you have a Speedy Recovery and you will be in my prayers.  &lt;3

              thank you, its time consuming to participate here and this board was my best friend  while laying around in bed Hospital and nursing home staff during 3 major joint relplacements were wondering what the hell was I doing. But I have alot of catching up to do at home and need a break from here for a month or 2.

             Considering the film's screenplay and production was the work of Luc Besson (rape allegations the last week) I'd say he projected his reality into the "artistic façade" of the silver screen and profited in TWO WAYS...

             Taken is an amalgamation of true stories.  Many of the movies theme are "urban myths" based on real stories.  Taken goes on daily all over the US and Europe.

             Knowledge of such evil is a real burden. I wish you well in resuming your routine. What's most effective in thwarting the traffickers' agenda is building strong community ties and readily embracing whatever responsibilities you are entrusted with in your own role as protector. The Serenity Prayer is very valuable in mentally processing evil of this magnitude, but be sure to seriously reflect on the list of things you "can change" and be diligent in addressing them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Allowing yourself to be numbed by a media and entertainment that atomizes us and isolates us makes it that much easier for them to act in the shadows.
            </p>
            <p>
             Will say a prayer for your continued recovery!
