            Boy it sounds like most of you here haven't been down the rabbit hole for very long.. This isn't a criticism. Im just seeing a pattern here.
Lots of people researching pizzagate are really just getting their eyes opened now for the first time in their lives.
To call Icke a shill and all that, well its just kinda stupid. And as crazy as it seems there is a lot of historical evidence, eye witness testimony and other forms of evidence for reptilian beings operating just outside of our frequency range and plugging into humans who have allowed that, either by choice or because they have been victims of abuse themselves and their spirit has been compromised.
I know it all sounds crazy to all of you "normal" people. But to many of us, none of it is anything new under the sun.
Sacrifices and satanic activity has been  going on throughout history. And its only in recent times that beings that used to be the rulers on earth have changed their form to look a lot more like us. 1000s of years ago they we much taller and crazier looking.
What were talking about here is reincarnation and the same personalities operating on this planet generation after generation in new "avatars".. We are all doing it in fact. Many famous people of today were the same kind of famous people hundreds of years ago. They even look exactly the same.. and there are plenty of examples of this to be found. But you all just gonna call me crazy.
But im speaking from over 30 years of research and personal experience including tons of research into out of body experiences and im telling you that long before Icke ever talked about reptilians they were popping up all over the place. They have always been the face of a popular monster because there is an historical link. In Africa for hundreds of years they have talked about these beings..
People who took DMT tests back before Icke was famous in several different studies all reported the same or very similar experiences of finding themselves transported to another space within this dimension where they could see reptilian beings operating screens and computers.. Its really weird I know. But the way you all dismiss Icke and assume he's a loony and that none of his conclusions are based in reality is just like how normal people are attacking you now, and calling you a loon because the idea that a huge chunk of the elite are actually sacrificing or abusing children is completely ludicrous to the vast majority of humanity. 
But you guys are guilty of the same thing! Your doing the same exact thing, your attacking Icke based entirely on what you have read or heard about him over the years from the MSM!
I mean I read your words.. oh everyone knows hes a loon, that he thinks hes the son of god (total rubbish he never said that and was taken entirely out of context during one interview and this mantra was repeated endlessly by the MSM)..
As crazy as Icke sounds that doesn't mean he is wrong. You guys are fooling yourselves because your assuming you have something worked out! You don't. You have barely started to scratch the surface of what pizzagate is all about!
You don't know shit!!
When someone says, oh im going to sacrifice a "chicken" to molech.. well we know what that means now don't we. We are disgusted.
But its far worse than you can imagine. These people have no empathy. Zero empathy. They are bred that way. Its in their genes.. They are not like us. They laugh at us, consider us cattle. They are made differently. You need to dig deeper, because arresting all these people will not make the problem go away.. it will pop up again soon enough.. and the underground network that snatches and supplies these kids.. which by the way are almost exclusively blond or red heads, because of the dna they carry, the ones they train for certain tasks anyway, well they will keep on snatching kids.. the real monsters are far more well hidden than these clowns in politics and hollywood.
Your just scratching the surface here. This whole thing is satanic. Satanism is alive and well. Id suggest you research Credo Mutwa and his reptilian stories from 80 years back. Reptilian high priests of egypt. Sure there are a lot of bullshit idiots on youtube saying every video on screen with compression artifacts must be reptilian.. those guys piss me off they are real idiots.
But the reptilian thing is related to all of this.. if you go deep enough into this world youll see whats going on. Research Molech. Find out what this owl god is all about. Research the royal bloodlines. Where is royalty come from? They claim to be superior to humans and not human like us. Its in the history. How do you think we ended up with Royal beings and royalty, the divine right to rule.. as gods over men. Princess Diana said to her friends that the Royals are not human. She really meant that. Icke didnt make that up. She said it in private to friends who wrote about it. There are hundreds of other examples like this in history. Icke just picked up on this in the last 15 years.. but 30 years ago id heard about it from all kinds of books and sources. You guys assume so much! Assumptions are the worst kind of logic. You people know nothing about the nature of reality on this planet. The levels, dimensions and the beings operating within them and manipulating humanity. You've got no frigging clue by the sound of it. Well some of you have I hope.
You not taking into account other realities and dimensions. The new D-Wave quantum computers google use are actual proof of parallel dimensions.. watch the Ted talk on the D-Wave and you'll see they admit that its accessing other versions or dimensions parallel to this one.
Its said that Reptilians exist in a parallel dimension and they already have vastly superior quantum computing power and can easily access and mess with our reality.
Does this all sound totally crazy to you?
Well a lot of you here a few months ago probably didnt know that the elite had child trafficking on a huge world wide scale.
Think about it! These are not ordinary caring loving trusting gullible humans. They are cold calculating psychopathic beings.
They are different. They consider humans as energetic food.  Humans blood when they die violently is flooded with adrenochrome.. this is the most powerful drug on the planet. Blood drinking with adrenochrome is addictive and powerful, but its not for humans. It will kill a human if you drink too much.. blow out the adrenal glands.. but not if your....._________! something else.
Hey if you've gotten this far .. good luck... I don't care what any of you call me or think of me.
I don't care if you call me crazy. Just remember you have friends and family likely calling you crazy for believing in pizzagate.
you've only just gotten started. Ive beenl looking into this stuff for about 30 years now. Ive seen and experienced enough myself personally to know there is way more going on that what most of you here realise. This is much worse than sacrifice or abuse.
Im talking about human harvesting. Im talking about humans been used as a food source on a huge scale. We are been farmed here!
We are like cattle, and those sicko pedos are just at the bottom of the rung.. they are the idiots who are too stupid to stay under the radar.
All these people your researching now, they are just puppets, public figureheads, no-bodies. You arrest them and throw them in jail.
So what they are just the public face of a much bigger story and horrific situation. Im not religious but I do believe in spirit. That we all have a spirit/soul whatever you want to call it. And I say hold on to your hats, because Kansas is going bye bye :)
Good luck trusting humans :)

             Excepts from Tranceformation of America and related info..
            </p>
            <p>
             There are the experiences of Cathy O'Brien, the mind-controlled slave of the United States government for more than 25 years, which she details in her book, "Trance Formation Of America". She was sexually abused as a child and as an adult by a stream of famous people. Among them were former US Presidents Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton, and George Bush, a major player in the Brotherhood. It was Bush, a pedophile and serial killer, who regularly abused and raped Cathy's daughter, Kelly O'Brien, as a toddler, before her mother's courageous exposure of these staggering events forced authorities to remove Kelly from the mind control program known as "Project Monarch".
            </p>
            <p>
             Cathy writes in "Trance Formation Of America" of how George Bush was sitting in front of her in his office in Washington DC when, he opened a book at a page depicting "lizard-like aliens from a far-off, deep space place." Bush then claimed to be an alien himself and appeared before her eyes to transform 'like a chameleon' into a reptile. Cathy believed that some kind of hologram had been activated to achieve this. From her understanding at the time, it is easy to see why she rationalized her experience in this way. The truth is too fantastic to comprehend until you see the buildup of evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             A 5th-dimensional reptilian parasite will enter a human body that is open to invasion, transforming the body into a "host". The more access the reptilian can gain over the mind and body of the human host, the more it will be able to alter the molecular structure of the human body, to the point that the parasite will have the ability at certain times to shape-shift the human host into its reptilian form, by assimilating and consuming the host, from the inside out, until it is fully integrated into the reptilian parasite's energy field. Then it will take on or project the 3rd-dimensional nature, or basic form of the human host, thus successfully concealing its true identity.
            </p>
            <p>
             There would be massive chaos throughout the world if the veil of deception was lifted and the vibrational frequency of the reptilian parasites altered, so that the masses could see how many reptilians from the 5th dimension are in high positions of authority on Earth!
            </p>
            <p>
             Many people say that they have seen humans transform into reptiles and go back again in front of their eyes. Two television presenters had just such an experience while interviewing a man who was in favor of the global centralization of power, known as the New World Order. After the live interview, the male presenter said to his colleague that he had experienced an amazing sight during the interview. He had seen the man's face transform into a lizard-like creature and then return to human. His female fellow presenter was astounded, because she had seen the interviewee's hands turn reptilian.
            </p>
            <p>
             The male presenter also told me of an experience a policeman friend had while making a routine visit to an office block in Aurora (near Denver), Colorado. The policeman had commented to an executive of one of the companies on the ground floor of the extreme nature of security in the building. She told him that he should look at the higher floors if he wanted to know how extensive it really was. She also pointed to a lift, which only went to certain floors at the top of the building. As they continued to chat, she told him of something she had seen some weeks earlier. The lift had opened and a very strange figure had emerged. He was white to the point of being albino, but he had a face shaped like a lizard and the pupils of his eyes were vertical like a reptile's. This lizard-like figure had walked out of the lift and into an "official looking" car waiting outside. The policeman was so intrigued that he decided to check on the companies at the top of the building served by the mystery lift. He discovered in time that they were ALL fronts for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

             PS: im not saying we should focus on reptilians, that would be suicide.. no ones gona touch that.. but if you wana understand whats going on here with child sacrifice on earth and get a deeper understanding for yourself then you might learn a thing or two by reading The Holographic Universe, DMT The spirit molecule, and possibly Tranceformation of America (reptilian references), 3 books that might help you work it out.. Also any of Ickes more recent highly researched books! All these books are available as free pdfs online..

            Bullshit. He doesn`t say pg-researchers are trolls, he just doesn't want people to jump to wild conclusions without being able to provide comprehensible proof of some sort. He actually is being very reasonable in his argumentation and string of thought. No matter what you think of him as a character, how you feel about his undoubtedly highly controversial views on certain things or his businessmodel; He is a very dedicated and educated person on many levels and has been doing exactly the same thing which private pg-investigators around the world have being doing for the last couple of weeks... researching and trying to find proof to support a theory of which he is 100% convinced of, to be able to communicate it with the public. The only difference is, he has been doing it on his own and for something like 20 years non-stop. Most people working on pizzagate just started a couple of weeks ago. It really is unfair and bottom line plain stupid to "punish" him with downvotes. First of all he wouldn't give a flying fuck about it anyway, that dude has been "downvoted" hard in real life for so many years and stayed on his path no matter what, i personally do have respect for this kind of endurance and passion. Second, if you would be at least a little bit self-reflected and in it for the right reasons, it should be very obvious to you, that "downvoting" does not have ANY positive effect at all with regard to helping the pg-investigation. Your request is just another uneffective, hate-fueled distraction and following it would be a waste of highly needed human ressources and time. Wrong focus!

             Yeah right, you are lying. Watch the damn video before calling bullshit. He clearly says that pizzagate researchers are trolls attacking anyone who doubts pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             You dont seem to comprehend that ranting about shape shifting pedophilic lizards for 20 years does shit to ones credibility if you immediately flip sides the moment real evidence and leads surface. Guess who else flipped? Alex jones. It's call disinformation. Think for yourself instead of bullshitting.

             Yeah which make his shilling so transparent. When it's about lizards and places no one can ever find he's all for it. By mention some names and physical locations with strong leads and his true colors come through.

              You actually missed his entire points in the video. Youve just not listened or watched it all..  this whole thread is based on really poor assumption and zero research..  Ickes not saying Pizzagate isnt real, hes just saying theres too much polarity and not enough  balance with some people,

            I think icke is saying to be careful that we don't do to non believers what they don't us.  If we want them to have an open mind to our message, we should have an open mind as to why they don't believe.  He also said be careful of where we focus because one wrong messy and the press will use that to roast the cause and delegitimize the investigation.

            David Icke thinks he's the son of God, and frightens people with his "lizard people" theories (No evidence like w PizzaGate). He's just trolling b/c his money maker is an actual "conspiracy theory",  dude's a fucking lunatic
