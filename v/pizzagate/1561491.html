<p><strong>Quick Look of Feature List:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No email required to sign up (to allow more anonymity)</li>
<li>Flexible tagging system. No more scattered evidence. This is going to help us organize and see the big picture, big time!</li>
<li>Submission feed similar to reddit/voat except no downvotes allowed - upvotes only. Big discouragement for shills! No more vote manipulation.</li>

<li>Private 1 on 1 messaging</li>

<li>&quot;The Break Room&quot; Basically an off-topic area for posts not directly evidence related. No more getting your posts deleted for being &quot;unrelated&quot;.</li>

<p>Go make an account now! It takes 5 seconds. This is the next step for Pizzagate. I think this is going to put us on a more serious and powerful level. We have to show the uninitiated and misinformed that Pizzagate is serious and real. </p>
<p>We are not just a bunch of &quot;unemployed basement-dwellers with nothing better to do than start conspiracy theories on internet forums&quot; as the media wants to portray us.  We are real, intelligent, and concerned individuals putting our time and effort into working and fighting for justice. </p>
<p>Having our own dedicated site for research and collaboration will help show the world exactly how serious we are.  Hope you guys like it!</p>',

            I think it's great what you have done.  Thank you for your hard work and sharing your expertise.  If any lazy assholes below want to undermine your work, as means of knocking your confidence and demoralising your efforts, it will be returned to them in kind.  Keep up the positive work.  Respect.

            It's good to have an alternative.   I can't get behind steemit because I have to give my cell phone number and it says I may have charges.   What?   So, no I didn't follow through with steemit pgate.

            Sounds like you've done a good job and really listened to what people wanted. There's a lot of security concerns in light of the threats JA has made and the many many people who stand to lose everything. Thanks for doing that....so good to see doers rather than "someone needs to"....

            The problem I have on Voat is that due to free speech concerns, they allow racist, homophobe, bigoted, etc comments to stand.  What is your policy? Is it different?  Also you must clearly state that vigilante justice/violence type submissions and comments are NOT ALLOWED as well as CP, doxxing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would suggest that at least for the pizzagate subverse on your site, hate speech will be removed.  It can/will be used by the media and critics to label the pizzagate investigation as bigots, racists, homophobes, etc.  There needs to be a website for pizzagators that is CLEAN.  Sorry Voat but this is your big failure to the pizzagate community in my opinion, although I will say that overall the forum seems to have self corrected to fairly clean in many of these respects lately.

            I think downvoting is essential.  With the transparency you speak of, it would reveal shills right away.  Even people that aren't shills get carried away sometimes (Ichiban, looking at you man) and need to be reigned in by the community.
           </p>

             I understand you wanting to flag it as a security risk due to the initial feedback, but I have addressed and resolved the concerns that were brought up as soon as I could. I think it would be nice to give it a less malicious tag if you have to tag it with something - if there are other concerns still, I would like them to be addressed here as opposed to tagging and writing it off.

              You still haven't given us any information about who you are. I asked this in a previous response and you provided no answer. I'm sure I'm not the only one wondering about your background and why we should trust you.

              I understand that you've been working hard on addressing the community's concerns, and that is appreciated, but there is nothing standing in your way to revert your current fixes at some point in the future when you're not placed under this level of scrutiny. I'm not saying you
              <em>
               will
              </em>
              do that, all I'm saying is that we have a responsibility to protect the community, and warn them if they
              <em>
               might
              </em>
              be at risk. As such, the flair is appropriate as it is saying
              <em>
               <strong>
                <em>
                 Potential
                </em>
               </strong>
               Security Risk
              </em>
              , not flat-out
              <em>
               Security Risk
              </em>
              . This, in fact, is fitting for any closed-source (or freshly released open-source) website or application that tries to persuade the community to visit it. I'll leave the flair up.

            I can't seem to create an account. It keeps looping. When I put in a new username and PW, I get looped back to the create an account page. Maybe my username has already been taken or the password is not within spec? I don't know since no alert pops up telling me the issue.

             Thanks for your report. There is currently an issue with registrations after adding SSL security that I am working on fixing. Will give an update as soon as it is fixed and registrations are enabled again.

              Thanks for your message... I appreciate the time and work that went into your website and understand it is a work in progress. I also support the idea of Citizen Investigation and the creation of this platform to enable the free uninhibited exchange of factual information, theory, idea's, research and such in a safe environment, so thank-you for your efforts.
However, I can't use this site anonymously, behind a VPN. Is this intentional?

               Thank you for the words of encouragement! Hmm. What is it saying when you try to use a VPN? It's definitely not intentional and I would like to fix this if I can figure out what's going on.

            My biggest concern is that this investigative community will split up and lose focus as some people will stay here, some will be mainly on other sites.

            I really love how it's set up with a board for each player /concern.  So much easier to see everything you need by just clicking on their name/topic.  Thank you.  It's clean and easily readable.
            <br/>
            However,  i too will be waiting until its more secure.  I dont hide too much, but i tend to agree with others regarding the sites privacy/security.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also,  anyone who has legit concerns on being taken out... Point them my way.  They can kill me.  I volunteer.  I dont have anything else going on now anyway ;-)
           </p>
           <p>
            Again,  thank you for the hard work you have clearly put into this site,  but again,  ill wait a bit until fb/twitter etc is taken out of the equation.

            This site allows facebook, google, etc to track you.  Happily, serious researchers will know not to visit that site.

            Advice:
1.  Drop all trackers!!!
2.  Don't track IP's.  Change your access log to not do this.  There is tutorials online to do so.
3.  Use Letsencrypt for free SSL
4.  Cloudflare is the government's biggest honey pot.  The CEO was the creator of project honey pot.
5.  Make it open source

            I would caution anyone from using a new site without fully vetting this guy's background and maybe some of the more techie people in here can check for any potential security issues on the back end.

            If you've gone through the trouble of making the site, you're clearly not afraid of putting yourself out there and should be comfortable sharing a little more about your credentials with this community. I'm not clicking on any links or signing up until I know this new place is secure. Can someone post a new thread once the site has been given some sort of seal of approval?
           </p>

            I don't think there's a problem with VOAT, it's the lack of organization of information. I haven't had the opportunity to contribute much in terms of leads because I actually search the subverse before posting and find that the information has already been shared. I find it strange that with so many mods, it takes hours before irrelevant information is deleted and the front page is usually littered with posts of old news or purely informational topics that don't require actual research and should be moved to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             /v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . That continues to be my frustration with continuing use of this site, or at least this community. I'd be happy to support a new site that has a true focus on investigating, if it were legit.

            Fantastic effort!  I see pluses as being able to find things that have been researched and posted. I don't know Voat well as I am sure there are others and wish there was a place to see prior research that may tie into a connection I am working on.   I also love the no censorship issue.  There are things deleted that I have found linked later on to something I am researching! I think if you get issues worked out wirhwith SSL and whatever else that dilutes danger to exposing us it will soar to another level. Great job! A+++ for hard work and effort.

            The site simply wasn't remotely built with privacy in mind. There is Google Analytics, as well as Google Translate, and Google Fonts as if ordinary browser fonts weren't good enough, and something that calls simply to www.google.com. There are Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and off-site comments. There is Cloudflare. Google and Facebook in particular have very much taken sides.

            Great work, but i don't see much difference with Voat, except for the mods. In my belief the only real improvement would be a fully decentralized forum, built for example on Ethereum. I see that coming in 2017, many projects ongoing.

            I just checked out the site. It seemed pretty low tech, had a poor color scheme making it hard to read lots and lots of text and lastly just a hunch but it looked sketchy to me.

             Don't use it until you can confirm that it doesn't use telemetry to track you and put you on a kill list.

             There is a reason that voat.co was a safe haven for Pizzagate. It has always been specifically maintained to allow for freedom of speech. To do that, the founders had to use a .co domain.

            I agree the ssl cert and https not being available is a turn off, I do understand not having that setup right away however. Just at first glance I see a lot of cool features. That does beg the question of load, is the server capable of holding a high load, even a ddos attack as I could see happening against it. Is it on redundant hardware that is backed up and is the database backed up? These are all very important questions before we could fully trust just switching the full investigation over to. That being said I personally don't see any problem supporting the effort, and actually have skills that could help. Anyway I see this as a good thing if not just as a backup plan or another avenue of discussion.

            bbPress sucks as a forum software, it needs a whole lot of work to even come close to being as great as voat is. Just use voat, quit trying to split off the investigation.  Also these fucking possible shill tactics are lame.

            Very nice! I hope you guys that are interested support my site as I a small group of us are taking over ownership shortly of RightSideNews.Com - I'll be a regular on this corruption site as I love the leaks, digging and staying nimble.

            Doesn't use https:// but instead pesters the user with at least six trackers from google to facebook. This isn't looking good at all for a site with such a purpose.
Oh and thanks to cloudflare you can't even look at it from a semi-secured browser like TOR bundle with scripts turned off.
OP's contributions on voat also don't give any reason for confidence. Not a single contribution but admits to having used tons of alts.
Chances are this is a honeypot to identify curious users who fly too close to the sun.

             Maybe make the url in your comment not a link so people don't accidentally or foolishly click it.  As soon as someone visits there, the tracking sites can confirm the identity of another pizzagate researcher.

             I have no ill will towards the site creator. But this isn't a game. Investigators are having their families threatened. Frankly we can't afford the privacy risks. Facebook and Google have colluded with Clinton's people. CIA is compromised.

             Everyone should wait on another site to be created and suffer voat in the meantime.

             Yeah. Take great care with shit like this OP. Even if you're on the level, cover your ass and your user's asses, because they'll be coming after you if this site even remotely starts resembling a base of operations for Pizzagate investigations.
            </p>

             You could even get yourself or your loved ones killed if you screw up on security and anonymity protections.

             Fingers crossed that Trump's bureaucratic purge cuts off pizzagate subjects from their Hillary era wetworks connections.

             Yep, I totally agree. I only was on there less than a minute and the sketchyness started. Plus the colors aren't right. Text on black backgrounds is hard to read and looks pretty low tech.

             Yes, I have not purchased the SSL extra yet. Please realize I spent a month working on this, I didn't know if you guys would like it or not. I am going to need some help with some of these things - so bear with me. Remember, I literally just released the first version today so there will definitely be things that need fixing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, this is NOT a honeypot. Good god. Are you against progress for our cause? Yes, I haven't had a single contribution in the last month since I made this account because I've been building the site! You try to do something to help, and people just want to say ridiculous things like this to slow the momentum. I can give screenshot proofs that I have contribution history here on other accounts and even on

             Dude - you don't think this site has any tracking? Hello, IP tracking which can directly identify you! Anyways, if you have suggestions on how to improve certain functions of the site such as this, please feel free to leave them in the feedback and suggestion section of the site with details on how to improve. That would be a lot better than using scare tactics here to scare people away from making progress.

              Advice: 1. Drop all trackers!!! 2. Don't track IP's. Change your access log to not do this. There is tutorials online to do so. 3. Use Letsencrypt for free SSL 4. Cloudflare is the government's biggest honey pot. The CEO was the creator of project honey pot. 5. Make it open source

              The caution expressed here, and throughout the thread, is very legitimate. Any good platform should have a strong focus on security and anonymity, with zero tracking.

              Just keep using Voat, make progress here, like its already doing. Waiting for someone to be really good at using WordPress/bbPress and PHP is just a waste of time. It might take someone a year or more to even create Voat from something like bbPress. If this site took you about a month, then it might be longer. SSL should have been first priority if you are trying to get an investigator community.

               Dude - you don't think this site has any tracking? Hello, IP tracking which can directly identify you! Anyways, if you have suggestions on how to improve certain functions of the site such as this, please feel free to leave them in the feedback and suggestion section of the site with details on how to improve. That would be a lot better than using scare tactics here to scare people away from making progress.

                I can use voat via proxy via TOR and it has https://. No, I can't find any active trackers on voat. Same goes for the relevant chans - that's what makes them usable.

             I think that we need to take a serious look at whether or not alt-accounts are manipulating voting on this submission. You guys have access to this data. Any alternative website to voat could be a honeypot. Let's err on extreme caution. Right now this is on the front page.

              No, we really don't.  The only way we can detect the likelihood of vote manipulation is the same way you can: a post gets upvoted extremely fast, or doesn't seem like it deserves the upvotes it's getting.   Honestly, I don't suspect vote manipulation here.  People are just seeing a post about a website purporting to contribute to the investigation, and they are upvoting it.
