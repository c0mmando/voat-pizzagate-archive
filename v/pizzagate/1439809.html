   Jimmy Comet went to Georgetown Day School. He claims he dropped out. Can we find him in a yearbook, or did he use a different name then? He would've graduated around '90-'94

            We hear about Brock, but what about his other gay lovers?
           </p>
           <p>
            Given that he owned restaurants since quite young he obviously had a sugar-daddy taking care of him. Who might that be?
           </p>
           <p>
            How did he get introduced to Brocks world (DNC), Podesta Klan?
           </p>
           <p>
            In the street interview on youtube he doesn't come off as gay at all, seems to be very good at playing both the HET act, and the gay act as needed, definitely a theater guy,
           </p>
           <p>
            Most likely closely related to scientology this kind of smugness, think Tom Cruise, pure scientology
           </p>
           <p>
            Brock comes off as gay, was it common for Brock to be the bitch in his relationships? Clearly in the gay world Jimmy Comet would be the alpha dog, Brock actually comes off as a flamer.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Above said, so now the rabbit hole sends investigators over to Georgetown and more fodder for the NYT
           </p>
           <p>
            When R ppl going to focus on Andrew Kline, and Podesta's and the real ppl  who broke criminal law's?
           </p>
           <p>
            This post just asserts the NYT accusation that #Pizzagate is about personal attacks on shop owners.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            IMHO jimmy-comet was probably brought up as a chicken in the DC community, and later became a chicken manager, which became a front and introduced him to Brock and the DNC/RNC PTB DC, but so what is this, was this a crime? In DC? Nada
           </p>
           <p>
            Follow the money,
           </p>
           <p>
            Given that NO child victims have come forward there is no crime to speak of, no proof of crime
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure ppl R shocked over victorian ideas, but your looking at the DC community where life is only about cocaine, sex, and food.
