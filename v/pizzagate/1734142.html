<p><strong>ARTIST: Moon Duo</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Album: Occult Architecture Vol. 1</li>
</ul>
<p>*Featured on the front page of Sacred Bones. Name is a straightforward reference to the occult. Straightforward. *</p>

<p><strong>ARTIST: Lust for Youth</strong> [interesting name] </p>

<li>Album: International</li>

<p>This album features a triangle composed of trapezoids on a white background.</p>

<p><strong>ARTIST: Uniform</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Album: Wake in Fright</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This album cover features what appears to be an black inkblot abstraction of a bull. Track titles on side A include “Tabloid”, “Habit” “The Light at the End (Cause)”. On side B: “The Killing of America (music video linked below album link)”. “Bootlicker”, “Night of Fear”, “The Light at the End (Effect)”.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Album: Ghosthouse 12&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ghosthouse shares a basic configuration with the previous Uniform releases, but the tools have evolved far beyond their initial drum machine and bass synth setup. These songs have grown from a broader palette of sounds - shots, explosions, implosions, impacts, ricochets, collapse; the sounds of conflict, war, and destruction that we witness every day. The result is the most sonically confrontational Uniform material to date, and Berdan’s lyrics, largely inspired by his lifelong battle with insomnia and depression, match them for relentlessness.</em></p>

<p>*This album cover features the gnarling teeth of a dog. </p>
<p><em>“As humans, we are aware of our inner beast and should therefore be able to control it. We understand our hard-wired primal urges and why they exist in an evolutional sense. We understand the relationship between mind and body. Highly evolved and intelligent, we should be able to recognize these genetic hangovers and control them as a means to act positively and move forward as a compassionate species. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Recent global events have proven this. The human race is consuming itself. World Eater, the new album by Benjamin John Power’s Blanck Mass project, is a reaction to this. There is an underlying violence and anger throughout the record, even though some of these tracks are the closest Power has ever come to writing, in his words, “actual love songs.”&quot;</em>
