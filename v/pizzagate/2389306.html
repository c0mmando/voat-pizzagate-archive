            I spent a lot of time looking at the McMartin case. I find it credible. It was, no doubt, a victory for satanists and abusers. However, victims speak out about it to this day. The bruising and signs of abuse were documented and most damning: the incredibly well hidden tunnels were found. Too late for the law, but the truth supported the victims, as should we.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most damning for this case? The satanic church hails it as a victory.  We are hunting witches, but it’s not gonna be a witch hunt, however. Vengeance belongs to the Almighty, not us.

             so if you report abuse and your kid has a bad therapist then the abuse is no longer real?? If you read the actual case there were real signs of abuse. If it was the mcmartins or not, I don't know, but someone abused the kids.

              In the Oak Hill case, there were not signs of abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the McMartin case, the woman who made the first charges of abuse was a paranoid schizophrenic and alcoholic.  She accused Raymond Buckley of abusing her son.  Her stories kept going.  She also accused her husband, an AWOL Marine, three models from the local health club and a member of the school board.  She said the Marine also molested her dog.
             </p>
             <p>
              She claimed that her son watched Ray Buckley fly through the air and another child have his armpits drilled with a electric drill.  This information was kept from the defense attorneys.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the children who made accusations, came forward as an adult and said that he lied.   He said he knew other kids had been interviewed for hours, so he just told them what he knew they wanted to hear.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               so if you report abuse and your kid has a bad therapist then the abuse is no longer real?
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              That's too generic a situation to respond to.   However, we know that bad therapists or bad interviewers can lead kids to making things up and and the kids believing them.  This is shown over and over again in studies.  It's not all kids, but a very high percentage.  The kids can give very detailed even graphic testimony of things the researchers know did happen.   It can happen in adults too, but with kids and especially young kids, it's pervasive.

            The Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial occurred in Oak Hill, Austin, Texas, in 1991 when Fran Keller and her husband Dan, proprietors of a small day care, were accused of repeatedly and sadistically abusing several children. The Kellers were convicted of multiple charges and sentenced to 48 years in prison, but were freed in 2013 based on newly revealed information about misconduct by the prosecution and other authorities. The charges against them were dismissed in 2017.  WAKE UP!  No One wants to hear the words Pedophile but that is the only way we will be able to Stop this.  Face It Head On.  Who Overturned this case?  Did Bush have anything to do with this?  I am so sick of this. REALLY.

             O.J. Was innocent in a court of law. so was Nixon. Injustice is common. Satanist have friends in government these days, especially if they have opportunity to take fotos of powerful people  with kids in their stable. Just a scenario to explain why abusers and traffickers escape justice sometimes.

              Exactly.  And those that question my naming someone famous that we have mentioned many times as involved with running of drugs, we should not count out also with their being a former Pres. that they would not have connections or put pressure on someone.  That is laughable.

             This "Story No One Talks about" was heavily discussed on VOAT.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are sick of the fact that INNOCENT people were set free for a crime they didn't commit?  You'd rather have a full on witch hunt and evidence be damned?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not a case where the defendants were eventually declared not guilty on some technicality.   They were declared ACTUALLY INNOCENT because no crime ever occurred, there was no abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a case where the children told fantastical, literally unbelievable stories and the bad old days of the first Satanic Panic, these folks were convicted.  There was only one critical piece of physical evidence that anything occurred.   A doctor claimed a child showed signs of physical abuse on her hymen.   Years later he was at a medical conference and found that the exact symptoms she had were a commonly occurring genetic defect, when he realized the DA had nothing else on the Kellers, he recanted his testimony because he realized he was giving false information.  There was now no credible evidence of abuse.

             <p>
              Who Overturned this case? Did Bush have anything to do with this?

            <p>
             What are you talking about?  What would Bush have to do with this?
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2013, the
             <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/convictions-tossed-out-austin-satanic-day-care-case/K6StF2Myd1lC0RUMZ4X3MI/">
              Texas Court of Appeals unamiously threw out the original conviction.
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A unanimous Court of Criminal Appeals instead overturned their convictions based on false testimony by an emergency room doctor whose hospital examination had provided the only physical evidence of sexual assault during the Kellers’ joint trial.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Dr. Michael Mouw later admitted that inexperience led him to misidentify normally occurring conditions as evidence of sexual abuse in a 3-year-old girl.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2017 the new DA came in and looked at the evidence of the trial and the post conviction evidence and dismissed the case because they were "actually innocent."
            </p>

               I believe that the defendants are actually innocent of the crime for each was sentenced
              </strong>
