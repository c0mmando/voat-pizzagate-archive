First, her sister, Maya Harris, raises money with James Alefantis in what appears to be a money laundering scheme to break down larger sums of money. Additionally, a former deputy AG of hers was turned in by the NCMEC for trading child pornography. She has a history of PROTECTING Catholic child abusers, despite the news trying to paint her as &quot;anti-catholic.&quot; Kamala Harris, along with the Clintons, Maxine Waters, a variety of police organization, were tied in with a bizarre story of &quot;secret masonic police&quot; and Grandmaster Henry X who built an army in Mexico. An army that is here, now.</p>

           Kamala Harris is related to Pizzagate for a number of reasons. First, her sister, Maya Harris, raises money with James Alefantis in what appears to be a money laundering scheme to break down larger sums of money. Additionally, a former deputy AG of hers was turned in by the NCMEC for trading child pornography. She has a history of PROTECTING Catholic child abusers, despite the news trying to paint her as "anti-catholic."

          <p>
           But the story gets more and more bizarre, the closer you look.

           He also alleges a connection to Armenians. The most prominent Armenian that comes to me, for me, is Ruben Vardanyan, who works for Putin and who paid John Podesta through Joule Unlimited and Tony Podesta through Troiak Dialog, both of which are backed up by public documents.

             She really reminds me of HRC in some ways. I hope she doesn’t get away with what she has done for that’s how Hillary got to where she is. So many believed her while she was lying through her teeth.  She got away with it for decades.       This is how we end up with these satanic immoral elites running our country.
