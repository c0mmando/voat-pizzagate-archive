            There's a reason team Trump stopped make this claim of illegal wiretaps.  It was completely untrue.

             How's the Russia investigation going? I think Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are doing an excellent job... I like the transparency.

              Pretty good.   The Fusion GPS testimony is very clarifying.

             <p>
              So you discovered FBI Agents have personal opinions.  Good to know.  So, now that you know about about the political opinions of these two, who was Strzok's preferred candidate?

            There was a scandal in the 70’s where a sitting president’s lackeys, Nixon, purportedly broke into a hotel suite belonging to the opposing political party with the intention to plant/access bugging devices. That’s only a generalization of the official story, of course. This led to a huge scandalous news cycle that continues to this day. It was called. WATERGATE. Nixon was disgraced, though not really punished.

            Revisionist history at best; more Pedosta false narratives at worst.
           </p>
           <p>
            The scary thing is that Google has been scrubbed of everything except that Trump should apologize to The Kenyan for making false claims. Nothing at all about The Kenyan doing the apologizing because it's true. Wha' happened to the little slip ups that leaked the true story of The Kenyan's administration desperate to get all the dirt they could because this was the last chance to collect it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Evidently, some people believe that manufactured evidence that recites fairy tales constitutes reasonable cause to listen in on private conversations ... private conversations of a man that was running for president of the United States. Further, this faux narrative was enough for the press to shitload on the public as factual even though they knew months prior that this was Killary passing gas again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's the unmasking ... yup ... no treasonous acts here because nobody messes with Susan Rice and, really, that last part is totally understandable. I wouldn't want to be within ten feet of that Travel Velocity gnome either. You know, Iceland has a legend about trolls that throw rocks and I suggest one of them is Susan Rice.

             But on a brighter note the No Such Agency has copies in triplicate of every internet transmission since Al Gore
             <em>
              invented it
             </em>
             , and much more than has been divulged or imagined by John Q Public.  Add to that every intel agency on earth most likely kept a running log of Hilary's bathroom server, and probably most 14 yr old kids with too much time on their hands.  Also full updated copies in the Pakistani ISI.  And the list goes on and on.
            </p>
            <p>
             The documentation is
             <em>
              there
             </em>
             and available if Trump and Sessions want it.  My only real concern is whether or not the
             <em>
              white hat guys
             </em>
             are for real, or just playing us. If we are being played there are a variety of future possibilities.  From all my research and experience with this i handicap it at around 50/50%.  But i remain very optimistic at this point because so much is finally out, and so many millions of people know about it.  Even if this is some type of
             <em>
              unveiling
             </em>
             exercise to tell the public
             <em>
              this is it, now get used to it.  welcome to marshal law and FEMA camps,
             </em>
             i'm not at all convinced they are able to pull it off.  And those immunity deals Comey was handing out to all the Clintonites like reese's pieces are only valid if the recipient has provided the truth and the full truth. Those get out of jail free cards are not worth the ink cost to print them.  The whole lot can be had if Trump and Sessions really want them.  And it will take the whole lot of  people domestically and internationally that we've not even heard the names yet it anything substantive is accomplished.
            </p>
            <p>
             Time will tell.  Even if this is nothing more than a b-movie script being acted out to use our hero figure to launch us into marshal law and end of constitutional privileges,
             <strong>
              things don't always work out as planned.
             </strong>
             Too many know too much, and nobody's gonna unknow those things.  I don't look for any magic wand solution to save us one shiny morning.  I think more likely a long protracted struggle that in the end could take down the country.  All the chips are pushed out onto the table for all involved parties.  I suspect a long messy struggle ahead.

              Great summation. And when I heard about such things as airquotes the love bill unairquotes, I get a queasy feeling in my solar plexus. It's because of the disquiet stirred up by countless other champions/heroes that turned out to be scum. But in terms of this:

              No, it'll save our country. That's what this is about. You can't save your country by allowing predation and the Cannibal Elite feeding on it, anymore than you can save your kid by letting pedos teach him Common Core. I'm sticking with Trump and Sessions being on the right side of things because: (1) Scalise got shot; (2) indie journalists have been threated, poisoned, had their friends killed, and been called out/harassed. It would seem excessive if a dog and pony show. What will ultimately convince me is if: (1) Assange is granted immunity and/or pardoned and is afforded US protection, and in return coughs up evidence that puts Killary in prison. That would be demonstrable You'll notice that while Bush and assorted dems went at it, there was an unwritten rule that established no putting the other guy behind bars. So if she were to be inconvenienced by ten to twenty years, it would show a clear departure from business as usual. I also think that this is what those sealed indictments are. I believe that some evidence was handed over -- in good faith -- to show JA had the stuff and wasn't blowing smoked herring out his ass. But I think that the ability to act is dependent on the final mother lode.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm also hoping that the indictment of Killary will prompt whatever unsavory videos to finally be published, posted, and go viral. I'm sure seeing her romping with whoever she was romping with (and this has been hinted at a few times by the legitimate press -- their legitimate; not our legitimate) will not cause the calamity you envision. Think about it. If a video of a Eyes Wide Shut sort of ritual were released, and Killary was in it along with numerous other notables,  no one could possibly say it was fake. Well, let me backtrack ... they could try to say it was, but no one, but Pocahontas would listen. While Russia could find a double for Killary and her kankles, they're not going to be able to find a hundred for every politician or star in the video. And you know these things have to be taped. How else would they be able to pleasure themselves and friends while sitting around the eating those Bellumaniti Stackers for only $1?
             </p>
             <p>
              That's always been my contention. All the tribulation will go away if something surfaces that is so bad and so convincing that all feeling for these demons drains out the brain. It's what has happened to me several times. There was a huge pang over an idol being shown for the scumbag perv that they are, but after that initial disappointment or a fantasy bubble bursting? I was done. Done, done, done, done, done. So get that bottle of champagne ready. If anybody is going to pull this off, it'll be Trump and the team he's assembled.

               Excellent.  You are channeling my optimistic 50%.  But even my pessimistic (experienced) 50% tells me the days of
               <em>
                business as usual
               </em>
               for these evil creeps is

                over
               </strong>
               .  The path of the more pessimistic scenario might take humanity back to stone tools and flint sparks for fire.  But one way or another i believe an awake population will refuse a future that includes what they have planned - at any price.

            What if Trump and Hillary are really laughing at us??
           </p>
           <p>
            What if there really is something in Trump flashing the 666 hand signal every time he speaks?

            Let me sum this up:
           </p>
           <p>
            They acquired tap orders through fabricated evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its REALLY NOT a:  'who is allowed to look issue'. It's a "who committed treason" issue..  But no one is sure how hard Trump will retaliate. (He's already got beefs with nsa/cia/dark gov)..
           </p>
           <p>
            I assume he's taking names/ tightening the noose.   DOJ seems ot be coming back online. They are going to give Gowdy some teeth: Ohhhhhh boy.

             Just a little clarification; when you say fabricated evidence are you referring to the extremely untrustworthy and poorly written intelligence report, made by a former agent at MI6 that is the laughingstock of the intelligence community? It is also known as the "Russian dossier", in a pathetic attempt to sound more important and hard-hitting.
