            Alex's activities are far more subtle than those of Rene O.  who was busted in 1994  for  illegal weapons chargss and child abduction who reportedly had plans ( or fantasies) of bringing  children to his apartment in order to torture and murder them and then feed their remains to pirahnas. His name comes up in connection with several posts back in December on Bubblegum Satanism, that is the marketing of Satanic   images and concepts to small children via youtube. Never leave your children unsupervised with youtube videos

             Sun: Way too many rays for picturing a sun. It has exactly 34 sun-rays. That is 2 x

            As far as I am concerned; this guy is involved with the logistics of child-trafficking where as his company offers ways to get close to schools and possibly watch for, pick, select victims.
