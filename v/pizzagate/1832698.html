&quot;PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – A 23-year-old registered sex offender, who has participated in several recent protests as a leader of ‘Portland’s Resistance,’ is now being accused of sexually abusing a teen boy and girl.
Micah Rhodes faces 4 counts of second-degree sexual abuse.
On Monday, the Oregon State Police Sex Offender Registration Unit confirmed Rhodes is a registered sex offender. His name does not appear on the pubic state-run website because he is not considered predatory. It’s also absent because when Rhodes was convicted, his case was settled in juvenile court.&quot;</p>
<p>Rhodes is a well-known community activist. He has led several recent protests, including one with dozens of high school students.
He’s a former member of the organization Don’t Shoot PDX. On Monday, the group denounced Rhodes and said he has not served in a formal leadership role since November 2016.
&quot;The group Portland’s Resistance also posted a statement on its Facebook page calling the allegations serious. Both organizations said they had no prior knowledge of the allegations against Rhodes.&quot;</p>
<p>Got a little sidetracked while editing for Rhodes\' affiliations.  Back to the May Day Antifa kids under arrest:</p>
<p>Antifa continues to use it\'s brainwashed Lost-Kids as political fodder..
Three minors — two 17-year-olds and a 14-year-old — were among the 25 arrested, authorities said. All three teens are facing riot charges, while the remaining suspects face second degree disorderly conduct charges. One suspect faces charges for interfering with a peace officer, police said.

            Good find, Even if Micah Rhodes is not part of Antifa I would still bet your on to something. But don't expect much of anything from our State police, They are a very shady group themselves.

            Typical.  At risk kids, often sexually confused, runaways, psychologically damaged and manipulated, are used by these groups/cults as their front lines, goading them into states of reckless abandon, ready to "bash the fash" and commit acts of criminal aggression, risking the potential life destroying effects of being branded as felons, while the actual leadership hides behind the scenes, grooming, seducing, and ever-producing more little soldiers for their ideological war against the very freedoms they hide behind.

             Agree, even worse when those people are like Yvette Felarca, a middle school teacher hard core communist member of BAMN, or Shanta Driver a prominent immigration rights attorney and BAMN cult leader (a group that promotes pedophilia group NAMBLA), lure confused unhappy kids, away from parents, take them across state lines and give them a fake name.  The infiltration of our schools with people doing these things to further their political causes has to be exposed and parents need to be aware of how political cults (with sexual exploitation of teens and illegal use of prescription drugs) operate.
