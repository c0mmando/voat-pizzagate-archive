            Daniels married conductor Scott Walters, at Dumbarton House in Washington, on June 21, 2014; the ceremony was conducted by United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[4][2]    WHAT?  RBG?

            Daniels has been accused of sexual assault by three University of Michigan students.[5][6]      THREE?

            WOW.  No matter what age this guy was, it is disgusting.  These two raped him and used a date rape drug of some kind surely.  His account in this article is beyond sad.  He certainly is not promiscuous nor has he had this problem before.  He had no idea to make his way to the hospital to be tested nor did he go to a gay doctor to seek advice.  These two certainly have done this before.  I am waiting for others to come out.  Reminds me of Cocky Spacey.

            Err...@fogdryer? How old was the student when he was raped? It has been my understanding he was an adult? Then the post should go to
