<p>The invitation is not actually available in the email, meaning that it can\'t be seen by public eyes, and was likely meant to be hidden from Podesta\'s staffers. It really puts Lynn Forester de Rothschild\'s recent tweet in a new light. </p>
<p>Alefantis was actually in the New York City area at around the same time, at a <a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/593/32401567065_983f248243_b.jpg">gay art retreat on Fire Island known as Fire Island Pines</a>. While it doesn\'t prove Alefantis was there, it would make sense that he would at least show support for his boyfriend as he releases his new book. </p>
<p>But it gets weirder. Tijuana Picnic has hosted parties with familiar faces mentioned in the Pizza investigation, including <a href="http://www.talkingwithtami.com/jon-neidich-and-jean-marc-houmard-celebrate-cinco-de-mayo-at-tijuana-picnic">Walis Ahluwalia</a>. Dan Neidich, who hosted the first reception, is on the board of directors of <a href="http://www.drep.com/team/dune-professionals">The Child Mind Institute and MoMA</a>. You can connect the dots if you like. <a href="http://www.hanukhanuk.com/2015/01/011315.html">Also pictured</a> is Lucali Pizza owner Mark Iacono, whose pizza place became extra popular after Jay-Z called it his favorite in Brooklyn. </p>

            yes, the certainly do influence both sides, but its the cyclical emphasis/bias I'm referring to. Its like Ford manufacturing armored tanks in both america and Germany during WW2 - yes they profit from both sides, but they also seek to have one side prevail, and in this era it is the left.

            "To-day the term Jew is used very loosely to define people who have at one time or another
embraced the Jewish Faith. Many of these are not actually Semitic in racial origin. A great
number of people who accepted the Jewish Faith are descendants of the Herodians who were
Idumeans of Turkish-Mongol blood. They are actually Edomites.[2] The important fact to
remember is that among the Jewish leaders, in exactly the same way as among the Aryan
leaders, there always has been a small, hard core of men who have been, and still are,
Illuminists or Atheists. They may have given lip-service to the Jewish or Christian religions to
suit their own purpose, but they never believed in the existence of God. They are
Internationalists now. They give allegiance to no particular nation although they have used, on
occasion, nationalism to further their causes. Their only concern is to gain greater economic

and political power. The ultimate objective of the leaders of both groups is identical. They are
determined to win, for themselves, undisputed control of the wealth, natural resources, and manpower
of the entire world. They intend to turn the world into THEIR conception of a TotalitarianGodless
Dictatorship.
The Non-Semitic and Turk-Finnish races infiltrated into Europe from Asia about the first
century after the advent of Christ. They took the land route North of the Caspian Sea. These
peoples are referred to in history as Khazars. They were a pagan people. They settled in
Eastern Europe and established the powerful Khazar Kingdom. They expanded their domains
by military conquests until, by the end of the 8th Century, they occupied the greater portion of
Eastern Europe west of the Ural Mountains, and North of the Black Sea. The Khazars
ultimately accepted Judaism as their religion in preference to Christianity or Mohammedanism.
Synagogues, and schools for teaching Judaism, were built throughout their Kingdom. At the
peak of their power the Khazars were collecting tribute from twenty-five conquered peoples.
The Great Khazar Kingdom flourished for almost five hundred years. Then, towards the end of
the 10th century, the Khazars were defeated in battle by the Varangians (Russians) who swept
down upon them from the North. The conquest of the Khazars was completed by the end of the
13th Century. The revolutionary movement inspired by the Khazar-Jews went on within the
Russian Empire from the 13th Century until the Red October Revolution of 1917. The conquest
of the Khazars in the 13th century explains how so many people, now commonly referred to as
Jews, remained within the Russian Empire.
There is one other important fact which sheds light on the subject of Aryanism and Semitism.
The Finns, and other groups generally classified as Varangians (Russians), were of non-Aryan
origin and the German people generally speaking have treated them as enemies"

            id rather just call em khazarians, but yes u are right. edomites. genetically they trace back to caucasus mountains doeeeeeeeee. also, yeah holohoax i know im well aware the entire war was 1984, but jews did die. other races did die. they were put in camps and they did die from lack of food or harsh conditions but thats war. the whole 6 million jews blah blah blah is yeah obvs not true. jews with actual heritage in modern day israel and palestine were targeted

            - churchills mother was an american jew who changed her name, which has been a very common practise of khazarian jews. this is because historically they were barred from so many countries that they had to pretend to be natives of said land to even be there. thats how awful they and their culture and practises were. so ever since they did that hundreds and hundreds of years ago its been common practice to change ones name to a more native name. her name jenny jacobsen originally, then changed to jerome.

            google "ashkenazi" then google "sephardi" then "mizrachi" then "palestinian jew"
what this will show you is basically zionist and sephardi jews are all that exist now. what happened to the actual jews who were from palestine? they zionists claim to be from palestine or israel or w.e but the only 2 honest tests conducted, both by jews, show conclusively that the modern zionist jews dna traces back to khazaria and the caucasus mountains

            this "theory" has been "debunked" many times over but im sure you see what debunked tends to mean.....
its really thoroughly documented historical fact oh well tho.
           </p>
           <p>
            so if 80% of todays jews are not from palestine or judea, and the other 20 are spanish or whatever.... where did they go?
the zionists made sure that they were wiped out during the 2nd war so there would be nobody to defend the palestinians when the jews started immigrating. churchill was complicit in this

            jews were dying on british soil in camps identical to german ones the irony is fucking i dont even know what
           </p>
           <p>
            also churchill was key role in creating UN out of ashes of League of Nations which was owned by rothschilds(see the connection?) and the UN then played key role in setting up Israel

            so yeah. honestly read pawns in the game by william guy carr. every chapter is phenomenal. he got some stuff wrong(simply missed) i think but its because he was focused very clearly on showing their plan and how theyve repeatedly done it with provable evidence. i heard 3 separate people whose information i use mention this book as one of the FEW actual accounts of modern history. this being the best entire account from what i understand. enjoyyy sorry for long and messy

            This may be related, maybe not. There's another connection between JA and the R0thschilds.
According to the anon who looked into JA's registered voting addresses, he is registered to vote at an address which used to belong to a RC.

            You had me until the end. Last time I checked, the Jewish diaspora all descended from the 13 tribes, originating in what is now Israel. Therefore all Jews should have an "anscestral claim" to the land. Am I wrong here?

            September 2015 was a time of silly Apocalyptic predictions : end of the world du to a giant Comet. Lots of freaks going to Bugarach about which you may read this :

           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure going all the way from Basque region to Bugarach for the fun of it would be a trendy occult way of spending nice vaccations in South-West of France. Anyway the point on the map is off the road.

            This is the satanic family that pretty much rules the world, they have pulled the strings of all presidents /politicians throughout history. With their never ending money supply they have created wars and basically turned everything we know about the world upside down and inside out. These people have made the truth into lies and lies into truth, they have created a topsy turvy world for us to live in. They are responsible for Nazi Germany, big pharma, where our Dr's are told what to learn and think by the drug companies, owned by Satanists and for all the lies in the media and on the news. They own most if not all of Reuters and most the news companies around the world. No wonder the world is such a mess, it's been taken over and controlled Satanism!!

             The yellow (golden) globalists of Wall St. financed the red globalists in Moscow, just like they did 70 years later with China form 1990 on, and the golden and red globalists are the two sides of the same coin and are united to fight souvereign nations and worship world government, the NWO - until this very day.
The Nazis were Nationalists and were fighting the globalists.

            What in the hell are you talking about? Do you think Podesta reads his mail through the wikileaks interface or something? Everyone who received the email also received the attachments. There is no way to "hide" an attachment to an email.  The fucking email says "Attached please find an invite to

            Its because of the shift in globalist leanings. For decades - at least since around the 1930s the illuminati primarily used the conservative right to enforce their global agenda.  But somewhere around the turn of the century they shifted and started using the politically correct Left.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the primary cause of much world confusion right now. People cant work out whats left and whats right anymore, and its because of this dynamic. In its inception, Political Correctness was in the service of the Humanist cause and were the underdogs.  Hijacked by the illuminati, and corrupted, now they are drunk on their authority, bullying and morally perverted/twisted.   And the Right, who used to have the authority of the global forces behind them, now feel like they are the underdogs fighting for justice
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember in my youth it was the Left who always had to remind the right of Voltaire's immortal maxim: "I may disagree with what you have to say but i will defend to the death your right to say it."  Notice it is now the Right that has to remind the Left?
           </p>
           <p>
            That is a function of the favouritism of the Paedostocracy, and its why Brock switched from Right to Left - he cottonned on - or was straightened out by Lynn - that the illuminati were shifting emphasis to the Left

             While I agree it certainly appears the left is far more corrupted than the right, I believe the Luciferians/Globalists have always used both sides to their advantage.

             Rosicruicianism and Freemasonry emerged in the early 17th century and were far from conservative movements. These societies had to remain secret because of their association with the occult and secularism. The French Revolution was instigated by the Bavarian Illuminati and freemasons. It changed the face of Europe and ushered in an era of radical political revolution in the 19th century that gave birth to socialism and radical anarchism.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Bolshevik Revolution was conducted by assorted Jews of Eastern Europe who were backed and financed by the elite as was Fabian Socialism in Western Europe. Eugenics, contrary to popular belief, was predominately a product of progressive thought. Conservatives likened nationhood and economic development to "struggle for survival" to be sure (everyone did at that time), but it was the Progressive left and their financiers that began looking for ways to improve the "racial stock" through population control, selective breeding, legislation, and sterilization.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Global Elite has always been in control of the left.

             they did it through the hippie movement and rock and roll, "the devils music". so after the 50s with all the religious people there was the hippie 60s or w.e then my parents generation, who grew up in the 70s and 80s on rock and roll and hair bands n shit like kiss n acdc grew up being pushed in the opposite direction of the religious and good conservative concepts their parents had grown up on 20 years prior or had just been ending... so by the 90s it was pretty much set in stone that they could push the luciferian agenda almost openly through the left based on peoples rights and liberties like "its okay to do whatever if u dont hurt anyone its none of my business. its my body i can do what i want, etc.." and inverting values through all media and entertainment so that the public would idolize and idealise what used to be taboo a few decades earlier. as tv and entertainment blew up, they were able through subliminal messaging to corrupt and poison and mold minds much faster and with a previously unimaginably wide reach. other shit too but mostly through pop culture and entertainment they subverted minds and made the opposite of organized religion and conservative values much more appealing

             I think you've hit the nail on the head with your comment.  The Left's raison d'etre has always been social justice and protection of the working class.  But since the Left has been hijacked by George Soros and the neolibs--with the trans agenda, pushing porn and prostitution as empowering for women, open borders and shutting down any dissenting voices under the guise of 'micro-aggressions' and 'hate speech'--the Left has been flushed down the toilet.  A huge vacuum has been left and the working class (because no one is representing them) are turning to Brexit, Trump, LePen.   The Right are now the underdogs.  I hope one day we remember that we will be judged by how we treat the most vulnerable in our societies.

              The challenge now is for the Left to abandon Political Correctness and return to being  'Critically thinking Humanists'.
And they need to do it quickly before the right in its return to ascendancy overbalances to its uglier instincts. Doubling down on political correctness is the danger because it stymies the reasonable aspirations of the right, bottling up their frustration, and prevents solutions from being negotiated before the problems get out of hand and start to prompt radical right solutions.
             </p>
             <p>
              A critically thinking leftist understands that mass migration of islamic people is a jepoardy to other Leftist aspirations (like feminism and gay rights) - PC people dont see islam for the religious conservative trojan horse it is. Its an 'aspirational clash' - compromising some leftist values in the pursuit of others

              Robert David Steele is a limited hang out, controlled opposition guy. I don't trust him. He thinks Dick Cheney 'failed' to act on the knowledge he had prior to 9/11. No, Dick Cheney was planning 9/11. Steele is covering his ass.

               He says Cheney was responsible for the training exercises on 9/11. I just found a clip of an InfoWars interview where he says, "Dick Cheney murdered 3,000 people... Larry Silverstein was briefed by the Mossad and put in the controlled demolitions." He also stands behind Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth.

            I'd like to point out that there was a 2014 movie called "Kill The Messenger" written by an incredible investigative reporter ( that just so happened to write this incisive article about the scope of child sex trafficking for the New York Times in 2004
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/25/magazine/the-girls-next-door.html?_r=0">

            </a>
            ).  The movie he wrote was about the investigations and death of reporter Gary Webb, who was exposing CIA/Contra cocaine drug trafficking and that whole side of the dark operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Brock smugly writes a book titled "KILLING The Messenger" a year after this reporter was found dead with two gunshot wonds to the head, ruled a suicide of course.  Knowing what we know, I'd call it a suspicious choice of book title.

              technically AreWeSure has a point. Gary Webb died in 2004. You were probably thinking of Peter Landesman who's also a journalist and made the movie in 2014. No big deal.
             </p>
             <p>
              The way to rub AreWeSure's face in it is to challenge him (still haven't gotten your preferred pronouns yet AreWeSure) on what Gary Webb found and was killed for.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hillary and Bill Clinton were most likely recruited by the CIA while they were both still in college or shortly there after. They were probably even asked to get married and appear as a normal couple and then told don't call us we'll call you. Ya da yada yada, Bill becomes Governor and all of a sudden he's in the middle of Iran/Contra and unleashing the depths of Hell into every Black neighborhood in America in the form of Crack Cocaine. The rest is History.
             </p>
             <p>
              So with AreWeSure you've got to rub that in his face nice and good so he can't ever forget the Clintons and the CIA are tied at the hip.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can't let AreWeSure forget who he's shilling for. He's shilling for people who thought so little of poor Black people they got them hooked on Crack. That's remarkable. You could view Crack Cocaine as just a long acting and very gentle Chemical Weapon that does its killing over decades.
             </p>
             <p>
              You've got to always remind AreWeSure of these things while you remind him of the Clinton Foundations new gig gang raping poor black people in Haiti.
             </p>
             <p>
              My theory is if we continually bombard AreWeSure with the facts he'll eventually re-discover his conscience and maybe be even turn the tables on his pay master.
             </p>
             <p>
              Is that about accurate AreWeSure? What's the probably of you re-discovering your conscience?

               However, IMHO since Brock is part of an Arkancide Machine tied in with the CIA who most likely did "kill the messenger" I think his book title is just another example of hubris in the form of a sick joke- HAHA you might write a screenplay Landesman about the kill, but we are the ones who do the killing and put it right up there in our publicity and book tours.   Anyway, I just thought it was a bit of a tell, doesn't prove anything.
              </p>
              <p>
               You'll see that I linked to Landesman's NYT article above in comments - this red pilled me a long time ago.  I'll link it again here might as well

                I did read most of that article, I didn't finish because it's so disheartening. The one that "red-pilled" me is ironically from the

                Everyone's in on the action it seems. It's just like the

                There are many people on here who possibly mean well, but are blinded by the dogmatic nature of their faith.  They are childlike and believe anything in the world with a spiral on it is "waving Satan in our face!"  and so on.  If you don't know that, you've not been around much.

             She's probably just pissed at Podesta for getting her bastard son into a big mess. Brock wasn't a good match for Jimmy Boy either, so good riddance.

             That is a very strange email! First, she says "the party will be at Tony Podesta's home"... Why would you phrase it that way? It's his fuckin brother. Why wouldn't Tony just invite him? Weird. And her response "I thought you were cooking! Now what!" Huh? You invite him for the second time, apparently after he hadn't responded, and that's the response? So she thought he was cooking and now he's not? Weird.
            </p>
            <p>
             And here's the best part! Let's look at all the names "hosting".... Why it's a treasure trove. Including, drumroll please....ERIC BRAVERMANN. This group is like one big incestual cult.

               I don't think you're missing anything. We never would have noticed his name on there without the emails. Now it just sticks out. To me it just shows he was in the inner circle. He wasn't just some guy brought in by Chelsea to clean things up. He was going to social events with these people too and even being one of the host. So to me, it just shows his closeness to this group.

                 I mean, I've worked for people for many years, that i consider friends, and I still wouldn't be someone called and asked to host a party for them socially. That's a more intimate relationship. So that's why it's of note to me after all this "where is Eric Braverman?" is he a good guy on the run? etc. I don't believe he ever grew a conscience and talked.

                   Then I think "Eric Braverman" is a hoax for some twisted reason which reasonable minds wouldn't fathom. The photo of him 'looks' like a young James Alefantis to my eye.

             not probably, they did. the rothschilds made a deal with the british govt. they would get the americans into WW1 on britains side to ensure victory, and in return Israel would be created and given to the jews. it was called the Balfour Declaration. once agreed, they used the media that they owned all of back then in USA (as they own all of today) to turn from pro germany to pro britain and make the germans out to be truly evil, lying about it all. president wilson was forced to enter the war, so Israel was born. Churchill was a zionist agenda and likely satanist and whatever, he played a huge role in this. it was Important to the Zionists that the real remaining jews who were actually descendants of palestine (and not Khazar satanists from the caucasus mountains) were wiped out by the concentration camps so that there would be no jews defending the palestinians. Also bc right before ww1 they found billions of dollars of precious metals in the ground under israel. most of all they need that land to rebuild the temple of solomon for the anti christ to sit upon, after the upcoming ww3 once the population has accepted the luciferian agenda, thats the plan.

             i could go into greater detail about it and source all of this but i doubt anyone cares anyway.

             </a>
             i really wanna source the science behind this though to show its not just conspiracy its science and history.- 80% of all jews being ashkenazi jews means they are khazarian meaning none of them have the right to palestine hence the planned conncentration camps that the zionists made sure were used to kill the rightful ancestral jews to palestine :/ rothschilds own 80% of israel

              The Haavara agreement between the nazi party and the zionist movement was also of great importance in the creation and finalization of project Israel. It ensured the transaction of great wealth of many wealthy jews from Germany to the new state of Israel.

              It is note worthy that an organisation like the zionist movement had such a strong position during the rise and rain of the nazi party. Futher, legend has it that Hitler himself was part Rothschild(his grandmother was a maiden in the house of Rothschild were she allegedly got pregnant). Hitler also allegedly was trained by the Tavistock institute for the purpose he has served. If all of this is true I don't know for sure. One thing is certain you don't rise to power without the money of the worlds must wealthiest people. Hitler was supported by a lot of wealthy business people in his day(Prescot Bush, Ford etc.). See JFK to 911 everything is a rich man's trick:

               I believe that is Ahriman, the most evil demon in Jewish lore:

              </p>
              <p>
               Apparently Ahriman's face could be seen in the smoke of the Twin Towers on 9/11:

               Could be a public name and not his real name. Someone told me Alefantis means infant lover in either French or Italian. Don't know it that is correct or not, but makes sense (creepy too).

            There is a command performance invite from Lynn in the emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brock had invited Podesta to his book launch but Podesta, because he hates David Brock, ignored the invite.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brock sent it again and he replied tersely that he was booked that day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then Lynn sent the command.

            the email says "both book parties" which implies two events, so why are you suggesting that one is a secret? I am confused at why you think this is a secret

             There was a reference to a 'book circle' by a different individual in the wikileaks emails. I think 'books' is code for satanic rituals, or abuse in general.

              I think "book club" is what they call it.  It seems to be a bit more than a book club though.
