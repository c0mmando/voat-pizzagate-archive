SNCTM Mansion located near the Playboy Mansion
Girls wearing white bunny masks
The article mentions a British Rock Star (my first feeling was Robbie Williams. In the video of his early 2000 Song Come Undone they are at a weird Hoolywood house Party, just not elegant. During his 2006 World Tour he released a Behind the Scene Movie called \'Inner Sanctum\'. Just my thoughts and maybe just coincedence! But who knows how old this cult really is?)</p>

<p>I just had time to read the first four articles.
Maybe we can find more quotes and symbolism or more names in these articles except of Bill Maher and Gwyneth Paltrow.

            It looks like a high end brothel.  I don't see much to suggest anything not consensual.  It looks polished enough to make consent plausible.
The only thing sketchy about it is the human drive to novelty which exerts pressure for more extreme hedonism up to and past tolerable levels.

            Anyone who holds liberty as a value should be concerned with religious zealots proselytizing prudishness as a world view.  One sure way to damage the good work everyone has done exposing pedos, SRA - is to start attacking people for just expressing sexuality.

            Keep rational focus.

             And in the video for ''Rock DJ'' he tears his skin of his whole body and then the muscles ...Today it reminds me of that lady gaga meat dress. He started his career early, with 15 or 16. Then he was a long time drug addict and alcoholic. Once he talked about how wild the drug partys were. These partys are out of the things, I can imagine. Far away from normal.

             "A brief romance on her yacht" means they fucked on a boat. I enjoy translating the way these people talk to common English immensely.  It really cuts through the illusion of who they are. And btw, what kind of person announces to the world that they had sex together like that? That makes me think it isn't true. But why would a man and woman lie about having sex? This must be a beard/diversion type statement. Perhaps to hide his true orientation? Am I seeing connections here or does this conclusion seem logical to anyone else?

            Come On Already.  WHAT MORE WILL IT TAKE?  I am really getting sick of this.   I saw that pic of Paltrow with the Butterfly Pin months ago.  I knew then.  Bill, oh yeah.  He is the one that called Mary Latourneau and Billy Fallau a Family.  (sorry for spelling)  You know the teacher and her 13 yr. old bf and then husband.

             Yeah, it is really sick. I read somewhere in the articles or on the main side, that he sees this whole thing as a gift for the human race. Which part??? Here: (
             <a href="https://www.snctm.com/manifesto/">
              https://www.snctm.com/manifesto/
             </a>
             ), under point Founder Manifesto No. 10, he explains he wants to help people. Just read the whole first block and compare it to this opinion of how women get into the club: ''If they are hot, they are in. If they are not, they can't even pay to get in. Male members are not held to these standards.'' From the Mens health article. I wonder if these ''ladys'' are doing it really for free. This is simply not normal. This is all men dominated. Picture: (
             <a href="https://www.snctm.com/snctmx/">
              https://www.snctm.com/snctmx/
             </a>
             ). 
To me it feels like the abramovic spirit cooking thing. The openly known things are sick and crazy, so what more special party would you become, if you pay 1,000,000$ and it is complete secret?
I followed some names linked on the SNCTM twitterpage: Olive Glass (
             <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/GlassOlive">
              https://mobile.twitter.com/GlassOlive
             </a>
             ) and Christiana cinn (
             <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ChristianaCinn">
              https://mobile.twitter.com/ChristianaCinn
             </a>
             ). Last one is obviously a porn ''star''. Wasn't Stormy Daniels also a porn star and had a NXIVM connection? Well yes.
             <br/>
             I simply don't get it, that they promote this stuff. Feels like every year a little bit more to normalize it. I hope so much, that these things finally come to an end.

              Women have fallen way lower than they were decades ago.  They have somehow gotten the idea that they must be sex kittens and they are allowing men to control them.  This all looks like the Hugh Hefner days only more than even the next level.  This stuff reminds me of what happened in Rome before it fell.  I agree, I can't take this much longer either.  I am hoping that all the people that are woke decide to have kids.  For they will be raised right.  We need more good people in the world to combat these Sick Freaks.

               You say it. yesterday I read an article about a female politician. She said it would be completely selfish of women to get a child. it woudn't be good for the enviroment and we have to think about the future of this planet. I always thought about women, that we are the ones who could bring the god given love into this world. that would be our part. to make it milder to live on this planet. To protect and to give our love to the children. But these days and especially after that comment I thought they don't stop until they take everything away from us, that represents that love.
