<p>SenateAnon specifically singled out the <a href="https://ibb.co/Kxv1g2k">Biliken</a> Property Management Group building at Adams Morgan in Washington D.C. that housed a restaurant called Perry\'s which was known to have <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2006/12/21/coming-soon-to-youtube-len-downies-lap-dance-with-drag-queen/">blackmailed the executive editor of the Washington Post, Leonard Downie, with a lapdance from a tranny</a>. Every Sunday Perry\'s hosts a <a href="https://ibb.co/X3gs22G">transgender brunch (note the hearts-within-hearts symbol)</a> where <a href="https://ibb.co/tK36T4j">activity like this occurs</a>. Strange photos like <a href="https://ibb.co/mX3Zmtt">this one featuring an assortment of unrelated children hanging out with men and trannies</a> were found on Perry\'s Facebook page and were deleted as soon as online investigators pointed them out. Perry\'s is also located right next door to the old <em><a href="https://ibb.co/1T11V3M">Comet Liquor</a></em> building which is <strong><em>the business that sold the Comet sign to James Alefantis</em></strong>. The <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/ae/38/58ae382d898f7a2e749f9434cff6f890.png">Crescent Moon and Star</a> symbols on the Comet sign are symbols used by Shriners. The basement level of Perry\'s contains another restaurant called Mintwood Place, where <a href="https://archive.is/MTuZr">the Obama\'s had dinner with &quot;grassroots campaign supporters&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple high ranking officials who are members of the ROJ have been convicted on sex trafficking charges. Some examples include the former <a href="http://archive.fo/N6DV8">Erie County Sheriffs deputy Michael Lesinsky</a> who admitted to transporting women from the Buffalo airport to a hotel in Niagara Falls, Ontario, where the Royal Order of Jesters was holding its national convention, and the former Supreme Court Justice of New York State, Ronald H. Tills, who was <a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2010/apr/15/retired-new-york-supreme-court-justice-sentenced-to-prison-for-sex-trafficking/">also arrested for sex trafficking prostitutes in his RV across the New York/Canadian border</a> en route to a Jester party. Former Justice Tills told investigators that there were about 30 women at the national event and “<em>described a network of members who had the ability to supply such women</em>.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ibb.co/SdVnBZv">4th Zaim of the SOBIB is John T Stafford</a>, who is the <a href="https://archive.is/DEneG">head of the Sarasota Airport Authority</a> and the current Imperial Potentate of the Shriners, <a href="https://archive.is/l1Qnq">James R. &quot;Jim&quot; Smith</a>, is from <strong><a href="https://ibb.co/1Qsm0Gd">Racine, Wisconsin</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/2643593/13364256/10">Here is an incredibly informative post</a> I found from two years ago detailing how <em>the House of Furstenberg of Germany and the House of Colonna of Rome control the Jesters</em> and the comedy circuit through Jester blackmail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarah Silverman is an Evil Witch, and Jimmy Kimmel is her Whiny Bitch.</p>
<p>The Comedy circuit is also controlled, particularly for anyone on television or in movies like Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer.</p>
<p>See The Royal Order of Jesters for many more involved. There is nothing funny about Pure Evil.</p>
<p>Here is another post from Voat on the topic:</p>
<p>Here is a link discussing Jerry\'s comment &quot;‘What you want in a pancake is to have the consistency of young human flesh’ <a href="https://archive.is/njYqR">https://archive.is/njYqR</a></p>
<p>The following was down in the comments at the link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jim Carry, Stephen Colbert, Obama and more… are extremely malicious and specialize in terrorism, trickery and threats. It’s foolish to think Seinfeld had a slip of the tongue because his shields were down and heart open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Royal Order of Jesters is a Masonic division of the Shriners and headed up by the House of Furstenberg of Germany and the House of Colonna of Rome</strong>. The Shriners are also known as the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. As a European Masonic Order it is Arabic in relation to the Moorish invasion of Europe. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b2/2a/31/b22a31a342202c97e7de37d710d450c4.jpg">The Furstenberg family use a Jester on their coat of arms</a> and have a broad range of influence in politics, banking, and corporations. Court Jesters were used by royalty in medieval times and this still continues today. The Royal Order of Jesters is headquartered in Hawaii where Barack Obama is from. Barack Obama is a Masonic Jester trained in arrogant mockery and joking. Jesters specialize in mocking the truth and making jokes to deflect away from serious issues. Some Jesters are extremely malicious and specialize in terrorism, trickery, and threats and this type can be seen in entertainment like the Joker in Batman. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope of Insane Clown Posse are examples of sadistic Jesters and they have a large cult following known as Juggalos with a portion of them part of violent street gangs also called Juggalos. Juggalo gang members are insane blood intoxicated terrorists known for carrying out violent attacks and murder.</p>
<p>Jim Carrey is a high level Court Jester in Hollywood and mocks people who expose the Illuminati. Jerry Seinfeld is a high level member of the Order of Jesters and like an elder. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is likely a female associate of the Jesters and also one of the highest level witches in the United States. Prince Urbano Riario Sforza Barberini Colonna di Sciarra is an Italian comedian and he oversees the comedic aspect of the Order of Jesters. Jesters are joyful wickedness. They get joy from terrorizing, humiliating, and torturing people. The Colbert family were a lower French nobility with Jean-Baptiste Colbert a Minister of Finance in France.</p>
<p>Stephen Colbert is their Crowned Jester in the United States and a major gatekeeper using comedy to distract from the seriousness of political corruption. The news media even considers him as a legitimate member of the news media. The French House of Colbert use a serpent on their coat of arms and that is exactly the nature of Stephen Colbert. Colbert gets paid very well to consciously spread bold disinformation and lies backed up by comedy to distract society away from criminals that are attempting a full takeover. He even manages an online cult that cyber stalk people exposing criminals and they use mockery to do it. Seth MacFarlane is a high level Jester who subtly mixes comedy with sadism and evil. Alex Jones was even initiated by the Royal Order of Jesters and did a show as the joker. <a href="https://ahuwahzeus.wixsite.com/mysite/single-post/2018/01/14/Order-of-Jokers">https://ahuwahzeus.wixsite.com/mysite/single-post/2018/01/14/Order-of-Jokers</a> Secret societies like Freemasonry and the Order of Jesters are involved with sex slavery, pedophilia, human sacrifice, and a multitude of depravity. The most common practice among these Jesters is the consumption of adrenochrome and adrenaline filled blood. These initiations are how they incorporate and compromise aspects of society to go along with their takeover agenda. <strong><em>Prince Heinrich of Furstenberg and Prince Alexander of Furstenberg are the top managers of the Royal Order of Jesters</em></strong> and they oversee the sadistic and terroristic aspect of the Order of Jesters.</p>

            Jim Carrey is a high level Court Jester in Hollywood and mocks people who expose the Illuminati. Jerry Seinfeld is a high level member of the Order of Jesters and like an elder. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is likely a female associate of the Jesters and also one of the highest level witches in the United States. Prince Urbano Riario Sforza Barberini Colonna di Sciarra is an Italian comedian and he oversees the comedic aspect of the Order of Jesters. Jesters are joyful wickedness. They get joy from terrorizing, humiliating, and torturing people. The Colbert family were a lower French nobility with Jean-Baptiste Colbert a Minister of Finance in France.

            Stephen Colbert is their Crowned Jester in the United States and a major gatekeeper using comedy to distract from the seriousness of political corruption. The news media even considers him as a legitimate member of the news media. The French House of Colbert use a serpent on their coat of arms and that is exactly the nature of Stephen Colbert. Colbert gets paid very well to consciously spread bold disinformation and lies backed up by comedy to distract society away from criminals that are attempting a full takeover. He even manages an online cult that cyber stalk people exposing criminals and they use mockery to do it. Seth MacFarlane is a high level Jester who subtly mixes comedy with sadism and evil. Alex Jones was even initiated by the Royal Order of Jesters and did a show as the joker.

            Secret societies like Freemasonry and the Order of Jesters are involved with sex slavery, pedophilia, human sacrifice, and a multitude of depravity. The most common practice among these Jesters is the consumption of adrenochrome and adrenaline filled blood. These initiations are how they incorporate and compromise aspects of society to go along with their takeover agenda.

           <p>
            a thought has just occured to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            one of my jobs is training people to use epipens.
           </p>
           <p>
            the amount of people allergic to random shit like peanuts and shellfish keep increasing every year its insane, and 'no one seems to know why' with all sorts of theories that well seem to be being researched but given we know all about how the body works it seems to me that its taking a long time to work it out, my own theory is that babies develop the ability to digest these things in-vitro, if mum has a full diet eating everything she is supposed to then the baby should be able to handle what mum was eating... whereas all these fucking retards that think eating anything but grass is inhumane arent eating those things, and so i wonder if theyre not developing enough to be able to eat that stuff but anyway that wasnt the thought i had...
           </p>
           <p>
            what if there is something else going on with getting people to use epipens all the time, its not adrenaline its epinephrine which ... look i probably should know more but without reading up now as far as i know its chemically identical to adrenaline but manufactured in another way.
           </p>
           <p>
            im just mildly concerned now that maybe im perpetuating something i didnt realise i was perpetuating by training people on these. the stuff certainly does save lives but the issue is why they need them in the first place and if that is a genuine immune deficiency because we are fucking retards or if something else more sinister is going on getting us to use them.
