<p>From Judgement
100. As for the very first indication of sexual abuse. Mr Christie\'s account to Mr Yahaouri is both extraordinary and significant. To entertain suspicions about Mr Dearman from the tone of his voice over a Skype call defies reason. Moreover senseless assumptions would seem to have been made by Mr Christie and the mother if, in fact, the children had touched the dog and were &quot;touching each other.&quot; To believe that children who demonstrate curiosity about and touch their own, the dog\'s and their siblings genital areas must have, or probably have, been sexually abused is plainly ridiculous. It shows alarming ignorance about normal childhood behaviours or, as is likely here, wilful determination to distort innocent activities into something sinister and depraved.</p>

<p>Sibling Sexual Abuse — Uncovering the Secret
By Margaret Ballantine, PhD, MSW, LCSW-R, and Lynne Soine, DSW, MSW, LMSW
Sibling sexual abuse has been dismissed as “child’s play” in many cases and/or as a normal aspect of sexual development. More recent research has documented the traumatic, long-lasting, and damaging effects of sibling incest (Carlson, Maciol, &amp; Schneider, 2006; Weihe, 1997).

One form of cruelty to animals that has received scant attention in the literature is the sexual abuse of animals, or bestiality. Bestiality may range from touching or fondling the genitals of animals to sexual intercourse and violent sexual abuse.

<p><strong>Sophie Dix</strong>, BBC actress who worked with Colin Firth in the film <strong>Hour of The Pig</strong> was accused of committing heinous acts involving bestiality, cannibalism and child sodomy.
