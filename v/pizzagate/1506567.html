<p>If you don\'t know JerrySaltz is referenced and linked to several Jimmy Comet photos and is a known friend of James Alefantis and Marina Abramovic. They held an &quot;artshow&quot; where Jerry was bound and gagged at a DC house address 1912 3rd Street. The photo is a cartoon drawing of a young Japanese male boy, who is bound and gagged.</p>

<p>Anyways, artshow references aside (which I think is code for my subsequent interpretation) my point is to decode the first photo which is tangentially related to the John Podesta Fish and 14 symbols on his hands. The symbols represent a story of ancient Egypt where Osiris is cut into 14 pieces and then the penis was eaten by a fish and lost in the Nile river. Osiris\' wife, Isis (which has a different tie-in to why Obama allowed ISIS the terror org to be created in the first place... but that\'s for another time) then has to resurrect Osiris body through magic (dark arts) but is missing the penis, so then she replaces the penis with some sort of dildo, then copulates with it in a necrophiliac ritual which engenders her son Horus.</p>
<p>Aleister Crowley who believed we are living in the age of Horus (most of the Podesta group follow him as well as famous hollywood stars)... the significance of this is that they believe eating the penis is significant and there are a group of followers that actually dismember themselves and then eat their penis. I think this is what they may be doing at some of these &quot;artshows&quot; they may not all be about eating children, but regardless they all reference some pretty sadistic things and this photo by JerrySaltz putting hotdogs suggestively around the private area is just another clue uncovered in the puzzle that shows they are indeed following some pretty twisted theories and ideologies related to ancient cults such as the cult of Isis and not just posting photos of randomness... they all have meaning to them and the more we uncover the meanings the more we\'ll be able to predict and make connections of seemingly unrelated events which hopefully will lead to more arrests.</p>
<p>I know this doesn\'t really get us a lot closer to implicating someone or putting handcuffs on these people, but this is important in understanding how to interpret data and clues that just seem totally unrelated. This video does a really good job explaining everything about the significance to the different cults that made a special ritual of severing the penis and eating it (a la Abramovic\'s symbolism and rituals of cutting the body into 14 pieces and eating human cakes at parties all connects back to the Podesta photo of 14 and fish on his hand).</p>

            google "moloch and alefantis"   - there's a pic on alefantis' IG. The pic, by "jimmycomet" himself not only references moloch but also adds the hashtag #LittleJapaneseThings  ....what does this mean???  I dunno...  but it's weird&gt;

             If we interpret this from their "philosophical perspective" this is most probably a reference to the ISIS ritual above of cutting off the penis and making a ceremony out of it..... just totally sick shit. There are real life interviews with  people that do this, referenced in the video I link in my OP.
