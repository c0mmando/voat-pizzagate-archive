<p>1.) First off and perhaps the most important point in this post, I see lots of comment questioning John Podesta\'s whereabouts. <em>John Podesta is still in Washington D.C. and he seems to still be active in some capacity.</em> All I can say is that I personally saw Podesta with about 4-5 other people as he entered the office of Rep. Devin Nunes (R) at the House of Representatives this past week. I wasn\'t able to identify anyone else and I don\'t know if they were all traveling in the same group or not. </p>
<p>2.) As another user posted earlier today, H.R. 6393 &quot;The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017&quot; was recently passed in the House of Representatives on December 1st. After I took a look at the bill itself, I was surprised to see that the bill was actually introduced on November 22nd and sponsored by Rep. Devin Nunes himself (You can look up the bill and all related actions/info/cosponsors at congress.gov).</p>
<p>My initial thoughts: Nunes is the Chairman of the House Committee on Intelligence so he obviously has a reason to be involved in the introduction of a bill like this. While I have only looked at H.R. 6393 very briefly, the sections that I skimmed over don\'t seem too worrisome. Additionally, it was voted in almost unanimously by 390 \'yeas\' and 30 \'nays\' so most reps didn\'t seemed too concerned about it. If anything it would help prevent another &quot;emailgate&quot; from happening again with official language, but I encourage you to take a look to double-check.</p>
<p>Other questions that I have and things that I haven\'t been able to explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why was Podesta there? It\'s likely that he was consulted to help develop the bill because he is a lobbyist, had an infamous email leak, and a close working relationship with Hillary Clinton who was terrible at following computer security protocols. However, if there were any nefarious intentions it will be clear to see in the language itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admittedly I have a limited understanding of how laws are passed, but my understanding is that the turnaround for the introduction and passage of this bill is <strong><em>very</em></strong> fast. Most bills that I have been looking up seem to have been in limbo for months or even years but this went through the house in a matter of days. Did Podesta personally get involved to expedite the process for some of the reasons that users here have theorized? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I\'ll leave the rest with you to check and verify, but at least you know for now that John Podesta has been in/still is in DC.</p>',

            HR6393 is pure evil. Going to be interesting seeing them try to use. Because there's some serious Unconstitutional stuff in there. -LIke foregoing the need for a warrant in some cases, and WORSE: the broad purview that VPN or TOR uses are automatically criminals in their eyes.

           <blockquote>

             There is established within the executive branch an interagency committee to counter active measures by the Russian Federation to exert covert influence.

            WARNING: I posted about this yesterday Devi Nunes wrote HR6393 with intentional language that gives the government the power to shut down what they consider "fake news" using the excuse of Russian propaganda. If John Podesta is in his office I am sure he had a hand in this and he might also have blackmail stuff on Nunes we need to make this viral. The bill is in the senate now if passed Obama will sign it into law then we all can be shut down.

            If Podesta is around, why is the DC press not interviewing him? He's at the centre of the two biggest scandals in the world right now (Podesta emailgate, Pizzagate). If I were a newspaper editor, I would have my reporters staked outside his house.

             Check section 501 of the bill. It's basically a resurrection of the UAC (Un-American Activities Committee), but against suspected "Russian" media firms. Now, consider this list that Washington Post described as those who have been identified as suspected Russian media firms:
