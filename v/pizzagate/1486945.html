<p>Now we\'re finding out that almost all of these are tied to andrew kline and not 5021 can do corpse-disposal with caustics and drainage, and 5029 is besta-pizza Conneb II LLC, H Gill &amp; Son - sold all on 2003, for $0 ( zero dollars )</p>

<p>If this fetid operation in Comet Ping Pong is exposed, it is putting the Saudis in a position of enormous risk.</p>

<p>The shit has hit the fan folks. For 40+ years the wash-dc has kept the PETRO-DOLLAR alive where the SAUDI\'s accept the USD (FIAT TOILET PAPER ) for their oil, this has kept the USA running, post 1972 NIXON the USA was bankrupt. Sauid\'s only asked for one thing, Infinite little white boys and girls to RAPE, KILL, and BLEED forever. The GOV agreed. Now because of the Weiner-&gt;Podesta scandals all has broke open.</p>
<p>Clinton caused this mess now she has a choice, she terminates PIZZAGATE or she loses her $1.5 BILLION USD in Dubai account.</p>

<p>Once it goes public that SAUDI got thousands of children in exchange for their accepting paper for OIL, then the entire world turns on Saudi, USA, ISRAEL, and UK.</p>
