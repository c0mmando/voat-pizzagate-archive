<p>Dhs.CON.N.E.B appears to be Saudi Arabian owned, this means the entire block both sides the street was bought by SAUDIA ARABIA and given to Friend\'s Andrew Kline for FREE in 2003</p>
<p>Now we\'re finding out that almost all of these are tied to andrew kline and not 5021 can do corpse-disposal with caustics and drainage, and 5029 is besta-pizza Conneb II LLC, H Gill &amp; Son - sold all on 2003, for $0 ( zero dollars )</p>

<p>the entire portion of Connecticut avenue in question is owned by the SAUDI/DUBAI.</p>
<p>CLINTON has $1.5 BILLION US DOLLARS in her DUBAI account.</p>
<p>Follow the money</p>
<p>If this fetid operation in Comet Ping Pong is exposed, it is putting the Saudis in a position of enormous risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shit has hit the fan folks. For 40+ years the wash-dc has kept the PETRO-DOLLAR alive where the SAUDI\'s accept the USD (FIAT TOILET PAPER ) for their oil, this has kept the USA running, post 1972 NIXON the USA was bankrupt. Sauid\'s only asked for one thing, Infinite little white boys and girls to RAPE, KILL, and BLEED forever. The GOV agreed. Now because of the Weiner-&gt;Podesta scandals all has broke open.</p>
<p>Clinton caused this mess now she has a choice, she terminates PIZZAGATE or she loses her $1.5 BILLION USD in Dubai account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once it goes public that SAUDI got thousands of children in exchange for their accepting paper for OIL, then the entire world turns on Saudi, USA, ISRAEL, and UK.</p>
<p>Now is the time to EXPLODE pizzagate more than we ever have. We need to blast this to every corner of the Internet.</p>',
