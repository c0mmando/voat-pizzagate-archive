<p>The wording here sounds strange, like we\'ve seen in other cases. Why does John Podesta say &quot;Tony will send <strong>the</strong> list,&quot; and not &quot;a list of places and things&quot; that might interest someone going to Italy.</p>
<p>Ironically (given John Podesta working for former SoS Clinton), this State Department report discusses human trafficking in Italy:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/PILcl">http://archive.is/PILcl</a></p>
<p>Then another thing about Lockhart is that the Obamas are going to be renting his Washington mansion, which is two doors down from John Podesta\'s house.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1443860">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1443860</a></p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, Joe Lockhart was press secretary during the Clinton administration, was possibly involved in &quot;Rathergate&quot; (the scandal over the forged memo concerning George W. Bush\'s guard service), was company spokesman for Facebook, and is now the NFL\'s spokesman.</p>

            There seems to be an ongoing debate on whether it's a very good or overrated restaurant. A lot of articles about it mention that debate:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Of all the restaurants we had lined up to visit on our current trip to Venice Alle Testiere was the one I was most looking forward to. The guides praise it lavishly. One of my colleagues said we must on no account miss it, that the kitchen would send out a succession of wonderful dishes, that the food was the best in Venice by far.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, it may have been at one stage - and may still be for the favoured regulars who frequent this tiny 20 seater - but if you walk in as a ordinary member of the public I’m afraid it’s a different story.
