<p>The normalization, de-stigmatisation and attempted decriminalization of Paedophilia seems to be coming from the moral and intellectual degeneracy of the post-modern / Cultural Marxism movement, and it may also be a deliberate defensive maneouvre of the Paedostocracy who use child abuse as a depraved mafia style loyalty/blackmail/reward program, perhaps in sensing the considerable increase in general public awareness of the Pizzagate phenomenon, to lower the public’s standards in seeking justice for child abuse.</p>
<p>Also note <a href="https://voat.co/user/Podge512">@Podge512</a> has done a 3 part voat-post series on the topic. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2568406">1</a>, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2574191">2</a> &amp; 3 and a lot of other previous voatgoat posts will be linked to here in collation of our community’s efforts.

<p>I will outline some of the quasi-intellectual ‘argumentation’ paedophile advocates seem to be trying on so that we can most effectively defuse these attempts in social media, and then I will run a list of example links.</p>
<p>How Post Modernism and Cultural Marxism are intellectually responsible for fostering this moral degeneration: </p>
<p>One of the tenets of Cultural Marxism is the Subjective exaltation of victimhood status. If someone claims they are discriminated against, that is the only necessary requirement to qualify for protection under the Politically Correct umbrella. There is no Objective assessment of whether the victim status is reasonable or warranted. Thereupon, the ‘criminal bigotry’ we apply as a cultural defence mechanism to PRE-EMPT incidences of child abuse is misconstrued as sexual orientation discrimination. And Post Modernism is culpable for enabling paedophile normalisers as assuming the power and prerogative over language itself (in word definitions and conventions of language). In this manner, they may seek to re-designate the word ‘paedophile’ to only apply to convicted child abusers, and quarantine ‘non-offending’ paedophiles from public scrutiny or opprobrium. They may also argue that the psychological damage to children from sexual exploitation of minors is also not a function of their exploitation prior to their capacity for consent, but a function of social stigma. That’s generally an argument they use in the same breath of denialism that child abuse does any psychological damage.</p>
<p>With the recent Transgender fad burning out and starting to become problematic for the Left (the fierce division of the TERF war significantly fracturing the Left), the next ‘trendy progressive’ movement seems to be a reconstruction of ‘paedophile’ to ‘paedo-sexual’ or ‘minor attracted persons’, to whatever degree the wider cultural trend is incidental or orchestrated with the cover-up of the Paedostocracy’s evil proclivities.
Also, in historical parallel to the Left’s total disavowal of persona responsibility (“if you are Islamophobic it actually incites Muslims to commit terrorism” - wait, wut? I thought you said last week the terrorists aren’t real Muslims?) by arguing that the Social Stigma against paedophilia is a contributing factor to non-offending paedophiles ‘falling off the wagon’. </p>
<p>The argument for ‘lessening social stigma’ is, I believe, directly &amp; proportionally inverse to the safety of children. Fuck me, I mean, we were told to lose our social stigma and suspicion of Islam, and what did we get? A generation of UK schoolgirls repeatedly pack-raped in Grooming Gangs. With the added issue of ‘sexual imprinting’ [by which those molested as children have a higher incidence of becoming paedophiles, either through self-justification (becoming wilfully predatory) or as a function of reliving Trauma], paedophilia is a crime of ‘virulence’ and therefore a profound danger we cannot take risks on for the mere vanity of appearing ‘tolerant’.</p>
<p>Firstly, and historically, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMq6r9mMLf0">diabolical work</a> of Dr Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s/50s should be noted as perhaps the commencement of State-sanctioned paedophilia for the purpose of ‘research’. Kinsey’s foul <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1819998">atrocities on children</a> were foundational in the development of psychological techniques surrounding psychological trauma and mind control. The Kinsey Institute remains an <a href="https://citizengo.org/en/7707-stop-kinsey-institute?tc=fb&amp;tcid=35144979">extant concern</a> to this day.</p>
<p>With the switch in focus (within Western Society) away from the failing narrative of Economic Marxism to Cultural Marxism (equality for gender/sexuality/race etc), an intellectual argument of ‘moral relativity’ was advanced to assist in the aspiration of the Gay Pride movement in the late 1960’s / 1970s. Whilst ‘paedophile rights’ initially arose simultaneously, the Gay movement quickly realized that the resulting alarm compromised their LGB aspirations, and so for the next few decades Paedophile advocates were generally sidelined. However, some academics, like <a href="https://sydneytrads.com/2016/03/20/gary-dowsett/">Gary Dowsett</a> (the Academic who authored Australia’s current school sex education policy) were bold enough to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9zGmvTCoD74RHhiNHVUa3BOc1k/view">maintain</a> the legalized paedophilia agenda as two peas in the same indivisible pod of ‘discrimination’ as Gay rights. </p>
<p>Sex education in schools, once general and discreet, continues to be <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2021162">increasingly explicit</a> often under purported \'anti-bullying\' campaigns. Then there’s <a href="https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2018/05/29/academic-normalization-of-pedophilia-as-natural-and-normal/">other academics </a>who suggest that because ‘schoolyard lurkers’ is an inaccurate stereotype is somehow means paedophilia needn’t be ‘damaging’ and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR23SXhOKXE">other justifications</a> from an Ivory Tower culture of academics who gain their prestige from competitive moral relativity.</p>
<p>And of course, the institutionalization of this forges ahead, with Sweden, Toronto and parts of California <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sweden+gender+neutral+pre-schools&amp;atb=v56-6_a&amp;ia=web">making it compulsory</a> to use ‘gender neutral’ pronouns in kindergarten and primary school, thus fostering the premature formation of sexual identity.</p>
<p>An example of a twitter account of a ‘<a href="https://twitter.com/MAP_Rights?lang=en">MAP rights Activist</a>’ - some of whose followers are also ‘activists’. This is a good source to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvjkBI11id4&amp;feature=youtu.be">twisted twitter</a> attempts at justifying  normalization / de-stigmatisation. </p>
<p>The #LoveIsLove gay rights campaign<a href="https://twitter.com/Gavin_McInnes/status/1018168155066097667"> crosses over </a>to paedo-normalization. (Loved Gavin McInness’ response here)</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2627189">Daily Caller article </a>about those arguing for full pedo inclusion in LGBT community </p>
<p>This <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2627710">voat post</a> has some gamergate and ebay business awards shows of ‘tolerance’ </p>
<p>There’s NAMBLA (North American Man Boy Love Association) whose manipulation of public acceptance can be seen in<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2210425"> this video</a>. Note too that core members of the parent organisation of AntiFa (BAMN - By Any Means Necessary) were part of NAMBLA. Similar organisations are the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2439304">Rene Guyon Society and Sexology </a> . The Honeybee did some <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1827461">great probing videos</a> on this \'NGO\' aspect.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1801001">Fashion </a>and ‘Little Miss’ pageant competition industry insists on continually <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2240462">pushing the boundaries</a>, and we also have the recent Cause-Celebre of Trans-kids or cross dressing kids such as the open accepted child abuse of the \'career\' of <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/06/18/today-features-10-year-old-drag-kid-who-says-hes-gay-not-trans-parents-say-its-his-life">Desmond</a> </p>
<p>Hollywood, of course, loves to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2122783">lower the standards</a> such as nominating <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2232544">13 yr old</a> actresses for ’50 sexiest women’ lists, and through the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1795406">reduction in opprobrium</a> for prominent Stars who have been caught </p>
<p>Of course, this places the Paedostocracy in a ‘dilemma of depravity’; if they are successful in what appears to be their aspiration to decriminalize Paedophilia - they lose their ability to blackmail.</p>
<p>But then, do these \'Progressives\' really care about that if they have engineered a successful return to the Age of Caligula? </p>
<p>Once again, folks, chip in if you think I\'ve missed some angles/issues/examples and I\'ll edit them in</p>',

            This, below, may not be for the body of your post, it's perhaps distracting, but I wanted to add it here in the comments.  It has to do with the psychological damage caused to minors who engage in "casual sex," -- so accepted and promoted in society especially through the

             This led me to five interesting articles on hormonal system and life disruption caused by child sexual abuse, physical abuse during childhood, and casual sex.  I'm not a scientist nor doctor so I can't judge the science behind them but they make compelling reading.

             wow thanks, interesting. And anecdotally true for me, my high school friends who started shagging early nearly all ended up depressed / bipolar etc with lower life outcomes than those who 'maintained their virtue'
