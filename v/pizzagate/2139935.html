            Our government:
1. Used and paid for a fake dossier to
2. Lie to a FISA Court to
3. Surveil an opponent’s political campaign to
4. Ensure the win to Hillary by
5. Using our intel community to do the dirty work AND
6. When Trump complained about it, the media called him a fool.
7. Then, the Obama holdovers/Comey and crew, further used the KNOWINGLY fake dossier to obtain warrants to search Paul Manafort’s home, pick the front door lock of Paul Manafort, enter his home in the wee hours of the morning..
8. STOLE priviledged communication between Manafort and his lawyer….
9. Threatening an impending indictment.
What do you think such a government would do to you or me?

             You think the Intel Community used the dossier to ensure the win to Hillary?  Because they didn't acknowledge the dossier.  They didn't acknowledge any investigation into the Trump campaign even though a FISA warrant had been issued for Manafort.  So you have this wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Comey intervened to ensure Hillary won?  Can you say that with a straight face?   Can you remember how Comey did intervene in late October?  Because he didn't need to do that at all.  In fact, following DOJ requirements meant he shouldn't intervene.

             Threatening an impending indictment?
            </p>
            <p>
             Manafort is getting indicted.  Also notifying targets of an impending indictment is common and in part of the US attorney's manual
             <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.153">
              https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.153
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              9-11.153 - Notification of Targets
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             When a target is not called to testify pursuant to USAM 9-11.150, and does not request to testify on his or her own motion (see USAM 9-11.152),
             <strong>
              the prosecutor, in appropriate cases, is encouraged to notify such person a reasonable time before seeking an indictment
             </strong>
             in order to afford him or her an opportunity to testify before the grand jury, subject to the conditions set forth in USAM 9-11.152. Notification would not be appropriate in routine clear cases or when such action might jeopardize the investigation or prosecution because of the likelihood of flight, destruction or fabrication of evidence, endangerment of other witnesses, undue delay or otherwise would be inconsistent with the ends of justice.

             👏 Bravo!! Remember, HRC spent a $Billion on her campaign, had Qs ahead of time before debates, roped off reporters, hid from press corp almost a year, had DNC rigging her primaries, destroyed her emails under subpoena, Bitbleached her servers, voter fraud, lied so much to voters she lost track, and after all this shit, she still lost!

              But a small, tightly knit community of computer scientists who pursue such work—some at cybersecurity firms, some in academia, some with close ties to three-letter federal agencies—is also spurred by a sense of shared idealism and considers itself the benevolent posse that chases off the rogues and rogue states that try to purloin sensitive data and infect the internet with their bugs. “We’re the Union of Concerned Nerds,” in the wry formulation of the Indiana University computer scientist L. Jean Camp.
In late spring, this community of malware hunters placed itself in a high state of alarm. Word arrived that Russian hackers had infiltrated the servers of the Democratic National Committee, an attack persuasively detailed by the respected cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike

The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation—conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow.

              The Slate article is evidence.  TP claims the Clinton tweet came out before the slate article and thus they must be getting info in other ways.   This false.  The Clinton tweet is 3 hours After the Slate article.

             Look how fast the "Leftist Elite Defender Shill" comes to jump to the defense of his ever so precious Crooked Hillary.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason he has so many accounts is so he can make more shill comments.
            </p>
            <p>
             Go away snow flake. Nobody trusts you around here. Nobody believes you since you're a known shill.
            </p>
            <p>
             Go do something of actual value to society, like help expose elite pedophile rings. If you would do that, maybe more people would have trusted you.

            Relevant to Pizzagate because it demonstrates the horrendous abuse of power and confirms HRC while under FBI investigation was getting Top Secret Classified briefings on an FBI wiretap of competing Pressidential Nominee....Pizzagate was also being investigated and there were many high level assasinations....She maintains TS Security Clearance now so is getting briefings.
