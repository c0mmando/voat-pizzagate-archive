<p>Relevance:  The autism debate is an issue which many of us are very concerned about on this forum and the links with big pharma and pizzagate have been demonstrated time and again over the years with the many posts.  So, I have started to watch a series of videos of Stanley Plotkin\'s testimony in a vaccine case in Oakland, Michigan.. thanks to this link by <a href="https://voat.co/u/septimasexta">@septimasexta</a>  here: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3308482/19488396">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3308482/19488396</a></p>

            One of them is Direct Relief. Am still new here, so bear with me, but I remember "suspicious" logos contain some kind of butterfly and spiral? If yes, this one does.

           I've recently done a lot of work on shipping containers and this new information will really need some more time and research to add to the growing picture of trafficking.  I hope the list of drug companies will be of interest to some of you.

Mar 2, 2018
Stanley A. Plotkin, M.D. Steps Down from Board of Dynavax Technologies
Dr. Plotkin Will Continue as Scientific Advisor
BERKELEY, Calif., March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dynavax Technologies Corporation (“Dynavax”) (NASDAQ:DVAX) announced today that Stanley A. Plotkin, M.D. has indicated his intention to step down from the Board of Directors (“Board”) effective from the 2018 Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 31, 2018.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I am delighted that HEPLISAV-B has been launched and recommended by the ACIP,” Dr. Plotkin said. “When I originally joined the Dynavax Board many years ago it was because I knew that new adjuvants were needed to enhance the efficacy of vaccines. Now that licensure has been achieved, and in view of my desire to reduce my travel and wider commitments, I have made the decision to resign from the Board."

            December 1987    Merck's RecombivaxHB  patent
           </p>
           <p>
            "Granted Sept. 6 to the inventors of the vaccine at the University of California, San Francisco and at the University of Washington. Patent covers the hepatitis B surface antigen produced from genetically engineered yeast and the Recombivax HB vaccine. In December 1987, Biogen received a patent covering the manufacture of "all hepatitis B surface and core antigens produced by genetic engineering." Biogen's technology is licensed to SmithKline ("The Pink Sheet" April 11, T&amp;G-4). Merck maintains that any recombinant vaccine for hepatitis B produced through genetically engineered yeast falls under the claims of its patent."

            "The din refused to fade and became shriller still when a freedom of information act petition by Congressman David Weldon exposed the minutes of a high profile meeting of 51 officials belonging to the CDC, vaccine manufacturers, and highly placed government officials who had met in Simpsonwood, Northcross Georgia, USA on 7th – 8th June 2000 to discuss two CDC studies that found undeniable association between mercury containing vaccines and autism. The relative risk found in both the studies was 7.62[42]; any figure above 1 being a sure indication.[43]
CDC correspondence between the author Thomas Verstraeten and top notch scientists revealed he had manipulated the data at his level from a RR of 11.35 and unable to do so any further sent an SOS for help, "The association will not go away." Consequently the meeting was held where the guests decided to bury the association even as a member conceded his grandchild would not receive vaccines, another expressed concerns over targets to be met, while a third highlighted a similar role of the vaccine adjuvant aluminium which he felt had equally disastrous consequences. All of them agreed that these results should not reach the public.[44]"

            LOOK AT THE EFFICACY RATES: "The ACIP Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence, including data from four randomized controlled trials assessing prevention of HBV infection and six randomized controlled trials assessing adverse events in adults. Seroprotective antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels were achieved in 90.0%–100.0% of subjects receiving HepB-CpG (Dynavax Technologies Corporation), compared with 70.5%–90.2% of subjects receiving Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals)."
Engerix-B is currently being used for the HepB birth dose to replace Merck's HepB vaccine.  HeplisavB and its novel adjuvant has a FDA approved average 95% rate but can only be used for 18 and up.

           <p>
            "GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has an adequate supply of hepatitis B vaccine to make up for the shortage, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The company produces single-component Engerix-B and combination vaccine Pediarix.
Merck first announced a shortage in July 2017 citing demand and manufacturing process updates. It has pushed back its predicted availability several times and plans to allocate its supply to the CDC."

            California SB276   "(f) Effective immunizations not only protect immunized individuals from disease, but have the ability to provide indirect protection for which immunizations are not effective or safe. This indirect protection is called herd or community immunity.
(g) Herd immunity successfully occurs if and when a sufficient portion of the community is immune. Herd immunity prevents sustained transmission of disease even when immunization coverage is below 100 percent."

              Actually this is research I had done prior to your post. It just happened to fit.
             </p>
             <p>
              I find the timing of the "malware infection" at Merck quite interesting. It happened around the time the qui tam lawyers had to finish up collecting evidence in their case against Merck- which some say will go to trial in 2020. Was certain evidence "wiped"? Merck never directly says the malware attack was the cause of not manufacturing the HepB and Gardasil products- the only 2 affected. Both use aluminum adjuvants. Remember, in the Simpsonwood document one of the "consultants" also brings up the aluminum adjuvant in the HepB vaccine and a possible interaction with the mercury.  The recombinant vaccines heavily rely on adjuvant to reach the 95% efficacy for FDA licensing. Merck only introduced its "new at the time" recombinant HepB vaccine in 1987- just after the 1986 Vaccine Injury law was passed which gave Big Pharma protection from liability lawsuits. For the first time, newborns were given a recombinant HepB vaccine containing  aluminum adjuvant and mercury. Since HepB is sexually transmitted and is mainly a problem in third world countries, the main benefactors of the "birth dose" would be pedophiles- just my opinion. Remember, Stanley Plotkin was on boards of both Merck and Dynavax. While the CDC says that the remaining Merck HepB vax will be mixed in with the GSK Dynavax ONLY FOR THE BIRTH DOSE, conveniently, Merck has NO stock for the 18 and up adults. Enter the "just in time" approved HeplisavB vaccine with a NEVER BEFORE USED non-aluminum 1018 ISS adjuvant (shepherded through ACIP by Plotkin) to be used (GSK product also available) for 18 and up ADULTS. The new adjuvant affects the "Toll-like receptor-9" which theoretically can trigger an autoimmune response.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to "Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee Meeting: FDA Briefing Document: Heplisav-B (Hepatitis B Vaccine Recombinant and 1018 ISS Adjuvant: Applicant: Dynavax Technologies Corp."
              <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/106641/download">
               https://www.fda.gov/media/106641/download
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              on p. 10  "Non-clinical investigations of the potential for CpGs or Heplisav to induce autoimmunity have been suboptimal given the lack of an appropriate mouse or well-characterized NHP models of human autoimmunity."
             </p>
             <p>
              The Simpsonwood meeting was actually looking at the then "new" Merck HepB vaccine- not just mercury. The stats which produced an alarming RR 7.6 for AUTISM were based on a comparison group- one had the full vaccine schedule, including the HepB birth dose, The other group had same vaccine schedule EXCEPT the HepB birth dose.

             In order to achieve "herd immunity" (truthfully, this only works for natural immunity, but we are misled to believe it applies to vaccine immunity) the VACCINES HAVE TO WORK. The "proof" for FDA vaccine licensing is the "Anti-HBs Titer ≥ 10 mIU/ml" rate in efficacy trials. 95% of individuals in the vaccine trials for mumps must reach this titer. Unfortunately, vaccines do not provide lifelong immunity and their efficacy weakens over time. HERE IS PROOF:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Table 1 Anti-HBs Titer ≥ 10 mIU/ml before and after Booster Dose.
From: Immune Persistence After Infant Hepatitis-B Vaccination: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"
             <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30512-8/tables/1">
              https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30512-8/tables/1
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             According to this Table below, U.S.A. babies given hepB recombinant vaccine at birth, 1 month, and 12 months only had a 24% EFFICACY by the time they were ages 16-19. When given a booster at that age, the efficacy was 92% - still below the FDA 95% rate.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Middleman et al.	U.S.A	Cross Sectional Study	2014	16–19	420	24.0%	92%	Recombinant	Standard	00	01	12  "
            </p>
            <p>
             WHY ARE WE NOT HEARING ABOUT "IMMUNE PERSISTENCE?"  Why are they blaming the "unvaxxed" for outbreaks, when the vaccines have UNADVERTISED FAILURE RATES?

             The electronic grid and especially computers and smart phones are programmed with neuro brain interface programs that radiate electromagnetic frequencies designed to hack into the human brain and physiology. Other brain hacking systems include NEURON, NEST (software), and Brian (software). It is like an artificial intelligence radiated out of the electronic grid designed to covertly target the minds and physiologies of people in society. They can target individuals or target groups. Targeting can be subtle or it can be increased and extremely violent and torturous. Targeting consists of invasive and foreign thoughts and targeting of the physiology can cause pain, itching, spasms, pressure, irritation, fatigue and other attacks. The European Union which owns the Human Brain Project is based on the Treaty of Rome and the EU was signed in Rome at Capitoline Hill. The Black Nobility of Rome are leading in this scientific terrorism and have full access to these technologies.....

             Murray Bernard Koffler, OC OOnt (January 22, 1924 – November 5, 2017) was a Canadian pharmacist, businessman, and philanthropist. He was best known for creating the Canadian pharmacy retailer Shoppers Drug Mart, establishing the Koffler Centre of the Arts, Toronto Outdoor Art Fair, and an initial investor in the

             .Both Kofflers were major supporters of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. Both sat on the Institute's board of governors, and Murray was chair of the international board of directors. He was also chairman emeritus of the Canadian Society for the Weizmann Institute. Another of his contributions to the Weizmann Institute was his funding of the Koffler Accelerator—a sophisticated twin-tower instrument for nuclear research.
