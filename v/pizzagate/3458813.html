<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/twistedmac11">@twistedmac11</a> seems more than a little <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152786.png">invested</a> in ESOTERICshade <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152787.png">keeping his good name</a>.

<p>How much of what you see here has been shaped by him?  Does <em>any</em> legitimate user really agree with him, or does he just groom new users into being his cheerleaders when he and his alts do their dirty work?

It\'s usually either that, or thinking all the mods are awful except one.  Never really seems to commit one way or the other.

No, ES did NOT respond to that on the correct username at all, even after the fact.

<p>Feel free to ping all those users you know that are friendly to this pedophile-protecting D&amp;C shill.  I fully intend to put every single one of them under the microscope, along with <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152808.png">anyone that attacks my mods.</a>

<p>This is why you have a MASSIVE asshole as an [O] mod.  THIS is why I\'m not nice to you.  THIS is why I don\'t do daily mod duties here.  THIS is why your mods want me where I am.  THIS is the avalanche I created just by picking a fight with your loudest blowhard member that almost none of you called out.  THIS IS WHAT I DO.  And to all of you that <em>even look at my goddamned mods sideways without a VERY good reason</em>:</p>

<h1 id="md-edit">EDIT</h1>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/twistedmac11">@twistedmac11</a> got flustered and lied about never supporting anyone trying to destroy the subverse, prompting <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2608242/13143338?=20#13142050">dig this one up</a>.</p>
<h1 id="md-edit-2">EDIT 2</h1>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> made the comment below about ESOTERIC\'s bullshit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/TE9Hz">Here</a>, <a href="https://voat.co/u/EsotericShade">@EsotericShade</a> claims he\'s so ignorant of technology (a &quot;retard&quot;) he had to make all these alts because passwords are too hard to remember.</p>
<p>But eight months ago, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11925786">here he is having a conversation about how to use VPNs to game the voting system</a>. Doesn\'t sound too tech ignorant here, now does he? </p>
<p>Incidentally, that thread shows him using multiple alts to try to take over a rule discussion, voting multiple times via different accounts and even bitching when Crensch missed votes that weren\'t made as top level comments that would be seen in his notifications. Lots of brigading, too. Here are <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11926463">three of them talking to each other</a>, pushing the idea the mod team is run by intelligence operatives. </p>
<p>There are multiple comments by him in that thread as ES, rarepeeks, twistedmac11, dragonkiller and others concern trolling the idea that the rule discussion is some kind of trap created by Crensch to get people\'s names on a hit list -- he simultaneously votes multiple times and tries to scare other people away from letting their voice be heard. It\'s rather appalling how glaring it is in this thread, actually.</p>

            claims he's so ignorant of technology (a "retard") he had to make all these alts because passwords are too hard to remember.
           </p>
           <p>
            But eight months ago,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11925786">
             here he is having a conversation about how to use VPNs to game the voting system
            </a>
            . Doesn't sound too tech ignorant here, now does he?
           </p>
           <p>
            Incidentally, that thread shows him using multiple alts to try to take over a rule discussion, voting multiple times via different accounts and even bitching when Crensch missed votes that weren't made as top level comments that would be seen in his notifications. Lots of brigading, too. Here are
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11926463">
             three of them talking to each other
            </a>
            , pushing the idea the mod team is run by intelligence operatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are multiple comments by him in that thread as ES, rarepeeks, twistedmac11, dragonkiller and others concern trolling the idea that the rule discussion is some kind of trap created by Crensch to get people's names on a hit list -- he simultaneously votes multiple times and tries to scare other people away from letting their voice be heard. It's rather appalling how glaring it is in this thread, actually.

             Agree. These threads are always massively downvoted and tend to distract from what we’re trying to accomplish... and it’s the first thing newcomers see, and many of them probably make a 180 there and then. I sometimes question whose side the mods are on. They need to take a step back and see the big picture.

               The only thing Q (Coleman Rogers from Patriot Soapbox) predicted was record T-shirt sales for himself. He was correct about how much he would make on T shirts, a ton. Other than that Q is pure fuckery and pollution in the info stream. Nobody went to GITMO and nobody ever will. Trump filled his administration with some of the worst swamp creatures D.C. has to offer. Trump has not done anything but feed a couple of trillion of OUR TAX DOLLARS to the military industrial complex. Not my fault you were dumb enough to believe it all.

                 I watched about three minutes of that stupid video. Coleman Rogers/Patriot Soapbox grifter, (Qanon) piggy backed on our research, or things that have been common knowledge in the truth community for decades. Anybody with an internet connection can do what that T shirt selling grifter did.

                 He got caught using the Q trip code twice. Cold busted. Interesting how you Qberts pretend that it didn't happen.

              Yeah, my last submission - posted shortly after your initial sticky accusing me of being an alt - that got derailed by bullshit accusations of me being ES. Why would I bother continuing to make submissions? Not to mention, that has no bearing on my ability to have an opinion or say something when you continue to drag me into this.

                At the time, I didnt believe ES to be doing anything wrong. Sure, he was/is arrogant as fuck and loved (still does) to toot his own horn, but I agree(d) with his premise that Q and pizzagate shouldn't be mixed together. Notice how I've not once stated anything positive about him since his rarepeeks alt was exposed? Thats because I saw your
                <em>
                 actual
                </em>
                proof (as opposed to proof based on hearsay or confirmation bias), and I don't agree with having alts at all, much less for consensus cracking. This is why I
                <em>
                 don't have alts
                </em>
                . I also didnt agree with the behavior of the mods for multiple different reasons. So, did I side with someone you don't agree with? Sure. Am I going to grovel or beg for forgiveness because you're just now showing legitimate evidence of him doing wrong? No. Does that make me him, or working with him to subvert the community? No. (To be frank, I've often wondered the same thing about you and the mods, but I digress.) Have I explained myself a million times? Yes. But you and the others will continue to smear me and say what you want, so I'm honestly not sure why I bother. I guess because I've invested so much time and energy in pizzagate, and because pizzagate was what opened my eyes up to what's really going on in the world. I don't want to let go of that, and I definitely don't want to be pushed out of it. But I'm not going to continue to try to contribute if I'm just going to have to defend myself constantly, which is why I've not been as active lately.

                  Okay, sure, I was wrong about him, but again, you had no actual evidence of anything, and I dont just go believing things without proof. That's called being smart. When I see someone making points that I agree with is getting shit talked by mods without proof, no, I'm not going to side with mods. All I had to go on was what was physically in front of my face - not confirmation bias or hearsay. Now that you've actually provided some proof, look! Magic! I admonish him. Amazing how that happens.

                  When did NOMO get pulled into this? Have I defended him? All I said was that it was hypocritical for mods to ban people for what he did, when you regularly do that and worse. I stand by that statement.

                  Again, I don't agree with the mods. That doesn't make me one of them, nor does it make me stupid. I shouldn't have to agree with you guys to participate here without constantly having to defend myself.
