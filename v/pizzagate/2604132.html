            I have been discussing this disturbing trend to normalize pedophilia for several years. Do not for fall for any comparison to adult homosexuality or adult heterosexuality. This is a desperate talking point to muddy the waters. Child predators are concerned strictly with the age of the child and that is why very few will have massive age gaps between victims. There are some that are opurtunistic predators but most fall within a predictable age range. The abuse is about power and control. The power they lack in their lives and the control of a vulnerable individual to compensate for the lack of power. 
This slow indoctrination in modern day started with the use of children in art books and film such as Taxi Driver and Pretty Baby in the 1970s. Brooke Shield even appeared in a Playboy Owned publication called Sugar and Spice as a child nude and in suggestive poses. The excuse of the day was it us artistic expression and it was about human form. In the 1980s news about such scandals involving high ranking politicians was coveted up such as The Franklin Scandal and The Page Boy Scandal. When the Representative Barney Frank was found out running a male prostitution ring in his home he went on the House Floor stating he would out any politician who would not let this scandal go. In the 1990s we finally had a demand for a open discussion on these topics. The Catholic Church Scandal became big news as well other institutions that allowed abuse to go unchecked. But again stories of satanic panic and some cases of false accusations was used to discredit the cause. The crucial time came in the 2000s to present with quicker access to the internet this tool is being used to indoctrinate society to the idea that predators are not sick individuals who destroy lives but just misunderstood men and women who's rights are being stepped on. The dialogue is framed in scientific propaganda that is used not to educate but indoctrinate. The definition of Rape is more important now than ever that definition is sex without consent. Children cannot consent so this anything that happens in a sexual context between an adult and child is rape and rape is not up for debate

            This scientist, like any found in the “Dark Matters” series, is just another Frankenstein... a monster, happy to make more monsters.

            It’s remarkable how politically incorrect (and unacceptable) pedophilia suddenly became after Trump got elected. Under Obama, it was all about normalizing it. I’m almost starting to believe in this Trump buffoon you elected into office.

            The TED talk is by no means an isolated case where sick, depraved, corrupted people are seeking to make their atrocities socially acceptable.  I applaud all who speak out against such examples where advocates are pushing an agenda advocating horrifically inappropriate, illegal and criminal conduct but remember, this is a deeply dangerous mindset that is being normed at the highest levels by “experts”: “Pedophilia is defined as an ongoing sexual attraction toward pre-pubertal children (Freund, 1963, 1967; Seto, 2009). In the new DSM-5, pedophilia is de-pathologized by differentiating between the sexual preference for prepubescent children (i.e., pedophilia) and the disorder in case of additional factors. These factors include experiencing significant distress and impairment by fantasies and urges, or the acting out on behavioral level, including child pornography consumption and/or committing hands-on CSA offenses.”

             She is implying, quite plainly, that those who don't share her ideas regarding pedophilia are immature, and therefore inferior or incompletely developed human beings. She is taking the position that she is above her audience, intellectually and emotionally, and is talking down to them (us).

              CHILD RAPISTS is what THEY are.  I believe on the news they should stop using abuse and other soft words when reporting what an adult did to a child.  They sometimes use the word pedophile but rarely for that even scares people.  But CHILD RAPIST is exactly what THEY did and are.  Gory and disgusting words need to be used to get people to SIT UP and Get Enraged.

              That's a great way to combat the hecklers! Good on you for figuring out this tactic and using it. Even if they block you, it means that you got through to them and they're uncomfortable to the point where they want to block the truth, but they can't because we are many and just blocking you won't stop the ultimate truth from seeping into their little bubble.

            : Thank you so much for your post. I will give it the 'Share' flair, and sticky it for a couple of days, so that it will get some more views.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope that many people will let the TED talk organization know what they think about these kind of talks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, does anyone here have the time to dig, and find out more about the organizers, and about the scholars who have spread these 'teachings' in the first place? That would be awesome! :-)

             gives us a good start at pulling back the curtain on this weird organization that is reported to be freakishly into controlling the speakers they choose as "fellows."  It really is an eye opener.

            <p>
             “Scientific studies indicate that one of the strongest indicators of child sex abuse committed pedophiles is social isolation."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Well, and who conducted these 'scientific studies'? Let me guess....
           </p>
           <p>
            What she says is crap. Most pedophiles were not 'born' with their urge to rape children. They were often sexually abused themselves, and target kids who 'happen' to be at the same age at which the perps' own abuse happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            She's spreading an idea that seems to be taught in many Forensic Studies courses - that pedophiles can affectively treated with behavioural therapy. And it sounds so nice, doesn't it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Even pedophiles who don't attack kids spread pedo culture, they spend their time on websites and boards that try to normalize pedophilia, they watch torture and rape vids aka 'child porn'.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's definitely not a 'normal sexual orientation'.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the TED organization seems to have taken the video only down because the speaker requested it.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it's still a victory. :-)

             These studies are clearly one sided echo chambers: no decent parent send their little kids to participate in sex experiments and neither do non-pedos participate in such.

            If she was there as a "TED Fellow". Then she was invited and encouraged to rub shoulders and network with billionaires and other movers, shakers and influencers. She was there to spread this message. A nice, young, well-spoken slip of a girl. The fair face pushed forward to represent pushing normalization of one of the great evils of the world.

...
Top of the list :
1.Italian nobility
2.German nobility ...
..feel free to complete the list..
...
...all government workers should also be on the list for supply for those hard labour camps...
..they looked the other way ...so shall We..

             Exactly.  Never forget, these small bombs of disgusting, inhuman rot are deliberate controlled demolitions.  Like #FAKENEWS headlines that are eventually retracted, op eds that are eventually disavowed, SuperBowl- and Hollyweird-type earthquakes that are retroactively labelled ‘mishaps,’ and full-on, well organized, calls for violence by highly public figures who hide behind the “drug-fueled” excuse label — the #pedoelite #cabal #Luciferian #MarxistguerillaTrojanHorse does nothing by accident.  These little pop-up controversies are carefully contrived and orchestrated, helping to make the population comfortably numb, damping down their outrage over violations of healthy norms and feeding unhealthy appetites for more, More, MORE🔥

             Hooktube doesn't host the videos. It merely grabs the video from youtube without giving the video views, playing ads, or requiring a login.

             She's a fucking shill for Jews.  The end-game for them is the acceptance of child rape, especially among the hated and vastly superior white race.  Bitch needs to be thrown in a cage with a bunch of nogs....

              How would the world react to the Shillary voice being broadcast 24/7? Unpleasant means not listening, and that would be the purposeful placement of the harpies. It is just like the news anchors who stare at you and drone on, but different. The result is to turn the channel since you have no other life than TV.

                I was not suggesting that,just pointing out that just like when Obama was talking on TV, he was so smug and condescending anyone who knew he was a complete con would turn the channel, thus turning a blind eye to the words coming out of his mouth that could be used against him in political conversation. Ever watch Brit Hume drone on? He puts you in a sleepy trance, and at the end of an hour he really never said anything relevant.
