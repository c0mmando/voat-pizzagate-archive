<p>Relevancy: The relevancy has to do with the recent report of Jeffrey Epstein wanting to impregnate women 20 at a time through in vitro fertilization. Here is one such article: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-epstein-openly-spoke-of-plan-to-impregnate-up-to-20-women-at-his-ranch/">https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-epstein-openly-spoke-of-plan-to-impregnate-up-to-20-women-at-his-ranch/</a></p>
<p>Or you can go to a Voat post that goes into depth: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3361445">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3361445</a> </p>
<p>Virtual reality founder Jaron Lanier told the paper he was informed of Epstein’s insemination plan by a NASA scientist at one of the dinner parties. … </p>
<p>Still, despite his criminal past and his muddied views — and lured by the prospects of funding — many world-renowned scientists entertained his ideas, the report said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above lays the foundation for the assertion Epstein intended and advocated for this. There were enough witnesses solicited to be involved. What I’ve found since then is a story advanced by a finite number of individuals on Twitter and the mistress of a Russian oligarch. The mistress’ name is Nastya Rybka and she’s written a book that ties into this agenda of Epstein’s, but there’s one difference. The submission is posted to amend what appeared in the paper. In other words, I believe, based on the writings of Rybka, that Epstein fully intended to “clone” children via anyone enlisted in his aim. </p>
<p>In order for this to make sense, I’m first giving a short bio of the people involved. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Nastya Rybka</p>
<p>(real name Anastasiya Vashukevich) not only reported on Instagram (18+), but lifted the veil on Russian VIPs’ private life in her book A Story Of Seducing A Billionaire, Or A Clone For An Oligarch. According to Navalny, ‘alum king’ Oleg Deripaska and top official Sergei Prikhodko are easily recognisable in two fictional characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the book mentioned is the one in contention. </p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="md-oleg-deripaska">OLEG DERIPASKA</h1>
<p>Deripaska is a billionaire, director of aluminium producer Rusal; Prikhodko is Deputy Prime Minister, Chief of Staff of the Government. Previously, he was an aide to Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. The video gives evidence of the duo’s taking a boat ride with the so-called good-time girls’to the coast of Norway in August 2016.</p>
<p>Deripaska and Rybka were repeatedly spotted going out together. On her Instagram, there are pictures of her resting on Deripaska’s yacht.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This same link provides Deripaska’s credentials and further gives credibility to her claim that she was: (1) his mistress; and (2) that she was indeed aboard his yacht. This is important and will tie in later, but in the meantime, please note that Deripaska is tied in with the Trump/Russian hoax: </p>

<p>Further, Rybka and and man called Alex Leslie were arrested in Thailand. Rybka was touted to be Mueller … yes, THAT Mueller … star witness?!!!! </p>

<p>“Dear friends from the American press:  I didn’t want to tell you much.  Previously.  But we’re now dealing with the situation where they are trying to “shut us down” and for a long time.  Which is why I’m ready to tell about all the missing puzzle pieces you were looking for, confirm their audio and video regarding connections of our honorable deputies with Manafort, Trump, and all the hoopla around the elections in the United States.  I know a lot.  Which is why I’m awaiting your suggestions and waiting for you in this Thailand prison.” … </p>
<p>Information appeared earlier that Alex Leslie and Nastya Rybka asked for political asylum in the US embassy. We were able to speak with a New York resident and participant of Leslie’s training who was a witness to detaining Pavlo Yunko.</p>
<h1 id="md-pavlo-yunko">PAVLO YUNKO</h1>
<p>Pavlo Yunko is a real estate agent in NY and was acting as representative for Rybka’s book.</p>

<p>Okay, with that out of the way, this is the tweet I saw concerning Epstein’s ‘’baby farm’’: </p>

<p>Next, we have one on sex slave books bought by Epstein and found at his property:</p>

<p>Even more strange after learning about Epstein and eugenics...</p>
<p>Here are the four pages of the book: </p>

<p>Okay, so the question now becomes whether Epstein was interested in cloning. I mean, this book was ahead of the curve. Yes, if you look at the other string of tweets, they try every which way to involve our POTUS in eugenics, but Epstein is the only one where’s there’s evidence that he at least professed to impregnate 20 women at the same time. Now he couldn’t have been talking the normal way … and then there’s that talk he had on Lolita Express with Nicole Junkermann. </p>
<h1 id="md-httpstheswamp.mediathe-epstein-associate-nobody-s-talking-about-the-idf-linked-bond-girl-infiltrating-the-uk-nhs">https://theswamp.media/the-epstein-associate-nobody-s-talking-about-the-idf-linked-bond-girl-infiltrating-the-uk-nhs</h1>
<p>In Epstein’s planes flight manifest, a pattern which was visible from the information available is how he would use his private jet. He would use the plane for two main reasons. Most commonly he would fly himself and a number of his entourage to a destination, or alternatively he would fly people to meet him. The rarest occurrence was when Epstein would fly without any of his usual entourage and just one other passenger. There was only one name that jumped out from the flight manifest as a good example of when Epstein alternated from his routine. His second meeting with Nicole Junkermann.&gt;</p>
<p>So the question becomes, what were they discussing? Why the need for such privacy? Why the deviation from the usual pattern? Well, cloning would be that sort of subject. And before anyone says Rybka is a liar … I know that. And the fact she’s still walking around alive means she’s doing somebody’s bidding for them, but still, are they trying to get ahead of the story? Control it by muddying the waters of what they might find by attaching Trump’s name to it? Remember that Junkermann is in the perfect position to help with eugenics. She was about to be in the position of being privy to NHS patient data …. Then there are the private companies she’s funded. And there is something else about this Trump involvement. Here’s one such tweet where the DNA testing on border children is mentioned: </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>And please read one of the tweets above again. It says: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="md-in-nastya-rybkas-book-she-talks-about-a-fertility-dr-on-the-yacht-w-her-and-deripaska.-allegedly-oleg-deripaska-impregnated-his-concubines-and-the-children-were-raised-and-educated-together-in-a-camp">In Nastya Rybka’s book, she talks about a fertility dr on the yacht w her and Deripaska. Allegedly, Oleg Deripaska impregnated his concubines and the children were raised and educated together in a ‘camp’</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>CAMP? Isn’t that what NXIVM was running? Isn’t that what a lot of these schools and camps are.  But to return to the border … think about what our POTUS is doing another way as concerns this DNA testing. If children were being closed, they couldn’t just get them a passport and have identical children being flown in every hour. But they could sneak these children across the border. But if testing were done and identical matches occurred … well, no more sneaking them into California, Texas, or wherever else they were to go. </p>
<p>There were other posts where clones were discussed. Clones of the elite would make the perfect harvesting crop, but they would also protect the original naturally born ‘’remember Matrix?’’ human. For instance, if a murder were to occur, how would a court of law know which of the donor and clones committed the act? They couldn’t. Not unless one of them confessed which is pretty unlikely. </p>
<p>While I believe Rybka to be an absolute liar, there does seem to be something in there. And with all the perverse knowns we’ve all uncovered, I doubt that the pedo elite cabal getting into cloning is all that far-fetched and is this a way to put a narrative out there to control the shoe that\'s about to drop?</p>',

           Next, we have one on sex slave books bought by Epstein and found at his property:

           Okay, so the question now becomes whether Epstein was interested in cloning. I mean, this book was ahead of the curve. Yes, if you look at the other string of tweets, they try every which way to involve our POTUS in eugenics, but Epstein is the only one where’s there’s evidence that he at least professed to impregnate 20 women at the same time. Now he couldn’t have been talking the normal way … and then there’s that talk he had on Lolita Express with Nicole Junkermann.
          </p>
          <h1 id="md-httpstheswamp.mediathe-epstein-associate-nobody-s-talking-about-the-idf-linked-bond-girl-infiltrating-the-uk-nhs">
           https://theswamp.media/the-epstein-associate-nobody-s-talking-about-the-idf-linked-bond-girl-infiltrating-the-uk-nhs
          </h1>
          <p>
           In Epstein’s planes flight manifest, a pattern which was visible from the information available is how he would use his private jet. He would use the plane for two main reasons. Most commonly he would fly himself and a number of his entourage to a destination, or alternatively he would fly people to meet him. The rarest occurrence was when Epstein would fly without any of his usual entourage and just one other passenger. There was only one name that jumped out from the flight manifest as a good example of when Epstein alternated from his routine. His second meeting with Nicole Junkermann.&gt;
          </p>
          <p>
           So the question becomes, what were they discussing? Why the need for such privacy? Why the deviation from the usual pattern? Well, cloning would be that sort of subject. And before anyone says Rybka is a liar … I know that. And the fact she’s still walking around alive means she’s doing somebody’s bidding for them, but still, are they trying to get ahead of the story? Control it by muddying the waters of what they might find by attaching Trump’s name to it? Remember that Junkermann is in the perfect position to help with eugenics. She was about to be in the position of being privy to NHS patient data …. Then there are the private companies she’s funded. And there is something else about this Trump involvement. Here’s one such tweet where the DNA testing on border children is mentioned:

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           CAMP? Isn’t that what NXIVM was running? Isn’t that what a lot of these schools and camps are.  But to return to the border … think about what our POTUS is doing another way as concerns this DNA testing. If children were being closed, they couldn’t just get them a passport and have identical children being flown in every hour. But they could sneak these children across the border. But if testing were done and identical matches occurred … well, no more sneaking them into California, Texas, or wherever else they were to go.
          </p>
          <p>
           There were other posts where clones were discussed. Clones of the elite would make the perfect harvesting crop, but they would also protect the original naturally born ‘’remember Matrix?’’ human. For instance, if a murder were to occur, how would a court of law know which of the donor and clones committed the act? They couldn’t. Not unless one of them confessed which is pretty unlikely.
          </p>
          <p>
           While I believe Rybka to be an absolute liar, there does seem to be something in there. And with all the perverse knowns we’ve all uncovered, I doubt that the pedo elite cabal getting into cloning is all that far-fetched and is this a way to put a narrative out there to control the shoe that's about to drop?

            Totally on board with this theory. I've always believed Will Smith's kids are cloned. His daughter looks like him, while the son looks like the mother. Maybe cloning yourself into the opposite sex is another Baphomet worship similar to transgenderism?

              <p>
               I wanted to get this out there just in case any of this was true. The signs are there that it is. It's been rumored for years that stars weren't acting the same ... that they didn't look the same. While it could be because of all the cosmetic processes they receive to ''stay young'', there could be this more insidious reason. I mean, if we think about it logically from a financial standpoint, the cabal used to have to kill cash cows when they got out of line. This way, they don't have to. They just slip the clone in place and keeping on milking that cow.

                Right on. I've been researching this for some time and completely believe they are far more along with cloning than the general public is led to believe. China basicly has a cloning factory where they're churning out about 100,000 animal clones per year whether they be dogs or cows, but I think humans are part of this, too. And who knows what's going on down in the D.U.M.B.S.
               </p>
               <p>
                A great YouTube channel about cloned celebrities is Vrillex. He used to post regularly, but it's been a little bit since his last post. He may have moved to a new platform. Two of the most convincing clone theories involves Kodak Black and 21 Savage. What is it with rappers? Are they really the biggest cash cows? Maybe the elite use them to keep old fashioned slavery alive? Trippie Red admits to being a "3rd Generation Clone." Then, there's B.o.B. who's pretty convincing when he's talking about the cloning. Fascinating and terrifying topic indeed!

                 Had no idea about the rapper connection. And, yes, rappers are huge cash cows. Remember, they also push their fans towards the ''thug'' life. Now that is something that constantly needs to be replenished. Both to perform and executive operations and to create domestic terrorism in neighborhoods.

                  I hadn't considered the thug life aspect and all that goes with it. I can believe that and it explains why they're using the rappers for cloning projects. Great way to keep the dirty money flowing. Not to mention how many of the rappers are in the closet and used by the elite and other rappers who are trying to keep their heterosexual image. It's really no wonder why Obama invited Lil Wayne and other rappers to the White House.

                   There is a ton of abuse going on and most of it has been scrubbed from the web. I did a search awhile back, maybe over a year ago and all this stuff came up about rappers speaking and speculation of some success rappers being killed because they were talking about being raped by radio executives. Or talking about little children being raped. Gone. All of it gone. I'll try another search engine, but some of it was on video. I do remember that because it was the rapper's own words.

            I think they only resort to cloning for specific bloodlines. Pumping babies into slaves to make more slaves is much easier and less expensive to do the old fashioned way.

             You could well be right. But what they're looking for is still a mystery. What in the genetic markers is a marker for having no soul?
            </p>
            <p>
             And it stands to reason if your genetic make-up does not include a soul, that a clone would not have one either.

             But even with the babies, they are careful as to who they choose.

              I suppose the word "soul" has different meanings to different people. I don't believe you can have anything that is alive that doesn't have a soul. Just because people do evil things doesn't mean they don't have a soul, they're just evil. And even that determination is in the eye of the beholder.

               No doubt, but there is such a thing. In esoteric books and teachings, it's mentioned ... including the concept of being born without a soul. I guess it would most closely align with what science has learned about psychopaths. They are natural-born killers with no capacity for empathy. Sociopaths do horrendous crimes also, but they are made that way through trauma-induced shutdown of compassion, etc. I think maybe what you're getting at is that only God can distinguish what is going on inside a killer's heart or mind because sometimes a human being will commit egregious crimes ... a whole series of them ... and somewhere along the line, their conscience kicks in. The sense of regret and the realization that whoever that was was not them. It's what it means in Christianity for no sin to be too great not to be forgiven. But ''we'' have no way of telling of a person saying they regret their actions is being truthful. God is the only Supreme Being that can make such a determination. I would tend to agree with that ... that some people do change, but  ....

              Once you see it all hollywood productions are filled with masonic/satanic symbolism and movies like that are predictive programming and to discredit critic.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also that movie is coming out on 10.11.2019... 1+0+1+1+2+0+1+9=15 =1+5=6, these moon worshippers are obsessed with numbers and there are no consequences

               Well, the cloning fits in with why David Bowie and others were so concerned about these ''magical children'' that he didn't let any of his semen, hair or nail clippings get into the wrong hands. I go into it in another submission about Crowley.

              <p>
               The thing is that a lot of stars are concerned about these things, but if they were cloning them, they should be concerned. And semen, bodily fluids, hair and nail clippings all have DNA that can be replicated. The only thing I can't grasp onto is the aging factor. I mean, they would have to wait until the clone were an adult to approximate the age differential. Other than that, yeah, hell, it could work! If some star were acting up, they could threaten to get rid of them and use the clone.

              Yeah, I bet my balls it's a part of their initiation to kill themselves too, I think Max Speirs talked about it. That Danish banker Bernard something also made remarks about the torture they are forced to go through when rising up the masons ranks

               They would almost have to. I mean, look at what they do to those children.
              </p>
              <p>
               I believe I did see a movie where that happened. I don't even remember what the movie was, but somehow this guy had to kill the replica. Maybe it was a cyborg and not a clone. Like I said, I don't remember, but it was this highly emotional climactic scene.
              </p>
              <p>
               An even sicker thought is if a child were made to kill their clone. Now that would break them down. And if you think about it, those women in NXIVM were broken down. They may not want to admit it, but they were so this cabal is expert at torture.

             Since I just ran across the cloning aspect, I haven't had time to investigate the major players involved in this. However, if this is what was going on, I have no doubt she was involved. But the fact Epstein made that flight alone with Junkermann means that this was private Need to Know info.

             I ran across an article the other day where it ended with this impassioned statement on the elite turning themselves into gods. I believe this is what they referring to. If they had clones for harvesting and to hide behind, only a very limited few ... those at the top of the pyramid ... would even know the authentic originator of the rest. And this right here, the cloning thing, if that did get out to the public, that would also awaken a good deal of those still sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for the comment. I'll try to find that other article and about Ghislaine and others that might be involved ... and try to figure out how.

               It's the same with mental health professionals allowing children to choose their gender at three and be given hormone blockers at four. While I see nothing wrong with an adult making these types of decisions, for anyone concerned for mental health not to be screaming bloody murder and stopping this, well, it defies logic. The same with cloning ... or even impregnating and seeding the world with this perv's DNA. I would morality / ethics ranks just as high on the Richter scale as IQ. If you have an IQ and no morals, there is no such thing as intelligence inhabiting your body. For anyone to take this seriously, let alone not spread it far and wide that this is what he was doing, is as bad as those that hid what Raniere was doing ... or Church of Satan ... or Manson.

                With all due respect, doctors are not giving hormone blockers at age 4. That is completely misinformed. They are however counseling adolescents before they go through puberty about their processes and LEGITIMATE trans orientation. And if it is deemed legitimate  as a post to a confusing phase,  then “countries” are  experimenting with administering hormone blockers  to suppress puberty until the attain the legal age of 18. And then  if the individual is as determined and efinote about his or her gender identity at 18, when they are legal, they can then un suppress the hormones associated with puberty, but administer the hormones that match the gender identity. That way when the individual has transitioned and is “legal” they don’t have the “physical” burden of having been born into the wrong body.  It is especially important for males transitioning to females, as once they have transitioned they don’t have a larger more masculine male body. We have hermaphrodite’s that are born with both  sets of genitals. Even though it is not common in nature, it is a naturally a curling phenomenon i.e. it is natural according to mother nature and therefore God.  So let’s get the science and the facts straight regarding the trans community and their struggles.  This is a logical and humane way to treat the topic And this population demographic. If we think about it, it makes a lot of sense so that trans people walking around with a better fit into so-called society and not be the target of misinformed fear mongering intolerant people.

                 With all due respect, you are repeating the NWO Globalist Pedo Elite Cabal narrative like a pro. None of what you say is conclusive, and if we're being honest (I am anyway), you know that this is just a foot in the door to enter phase two which begins something like: ''We let children choose their gender so why don't we let them choose who to love?'' This social experimentation is all about putting the onus on children to decide whether or not they want sex which, of course, they can't decide. And, of course, they shouldn't be allowed to decide what gender they'll be either. The fact this conversation is even coming up is harmful enough. The fact that books are being written to foster this conversation is outright abuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let me state clearly that I do understand there are variables at work in human physiology. While most times, babies are born with clear definable genders, there are instances where hermaphrodites are born. Given this, I can envision a situation where the chemistry or brain functioning is at odds with gender. And, further, even if this is not the case, if an adult, for whatever reason, wants to proceed down the transgender path, I have no objection to them doing so. It's their life and they get to decide what to do with it. However, the introduction and grooming of a Gender Identity issue is tantamount to child abuse. In my opinion, what the Satanist Angelina Jolie did to her daughter Shiloh is and was actionable child abuse. The fact the child was missing a front tooth at three is worrisome, but reading about how Jolie hated her daughter sends chills down my spine. Then we get to African adoptions where crazy PedoWood celebrities are adopting children considered orphans when orphans has now been determined to be defined as maybe possibly having one biological parent. Yet another bizarre misinterpretation of a pretty simple word. But the question is why the always adopt the transgender one? With a percentage that is low, it seems every single time a PedoWood crazy celebrity adopts a child, they end up identifying with the sex other than the one they were bestowed with biologically.

                 As for hormone blockers and my mention of the age of four, I was being snarky and sarcastic, but sarcastic because that is the age that children are nor enrolled for ''transgender camp''? Can the idiocy become more disturbing? But I am not far off the mark because in this article:

                  The first claim is that Lupron is safe. But thousands of patients who have been treated with Lupron for non-sex-related conditions would disagree.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Lupron was originally Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to treat prostate cancer, but it’s now routinely prescribed for other conditions such as endometriosis and “precocious puberty” — i.e., puberty that begins too early (generally considered under age eight for girls, under age nine for boys).

                <p>
                 To paraphrase, if ''precocious puberty'' begins before eight, girls are routinely given Lupron. The age before eight is seven, so we can deduce with certainty that girls are being given a hormone blocker at least by the age of seven. We can speculate that it's even earlier, but since it does not precisely state that, we will go with seven for girls and eight for boys. These are outrageous ages to be giving anything. But what are the physical effects and ramifications of these drugs? From the link given:

                  Many of these patients have experienced extreme side effects that shattered their health and their lives, including severe joint pain, osteoporosis, compromised immune systems, and mental health issues such as severe depression and even suicidal ideation. The FDA has received 24,000 reports of adverse reactions, about half of which the agency has deemed serious.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Lupron manufacturer AbbVie has been fighting lawsuits over the drug for years. In one case pending in federal court in Illinois, 60-year-old Terry Paulsen claims she has endured severe medical problems related to receiving two injections of Lupron for endometriosis 14 years ago. “My body is on fire,” she said. “My joints have arthritis everywhere.” Since her Lupron treatment, Paulsen has suffered not only constant pain but strange rashes, severe osteoporosis, and multiple surgeries.
                 </p>

                  In another lawsuit, gynecologist David Redwine testified as an expert witness about the adverse effects of Lupron he has observed over 31 years of medical practice. Noting that Lupron’s suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system may affect a body’s immune response, Redwine concluded that the plaintiff in that case suffered extreme bone density loss and other symptoms as a result of being administered Lupron beginning at the age of 17.

                  Many Patients Suffer From Lupron-Related Side Effects

                 <p>
                  Tragically, many other young patients have endured similar adverse effects. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on a younger patient’s trauma after receiving Lupron treatment for precocious puberty. Now 22, Brooklyn Harbin was injected with Lupron at the age of 10, and soon found herself in such severe pain that she ended up a wheelchair while still in fifth grade.

                  Dr. Ken Sinervo, an Atlanta-area gynecologist who specializes in endometriosis surgery, reports having seen many women suffering memory loss and joint pain after Lupron treatment. He was quoted as warning that “Lupron or any of the similar types of medications should never be used in someone under the age of 21.”

                  But of course, all gender dysphoric patients who might be placed on Lupron to delay puberty are years younger than 21. Plus, there’s a serious added danger to using Lupron merely to stop normal puberty in a gender dysphoric child. Such treatment is “off label,” meaning the FDA hasn’t approved the drug for this purpose, nor is there reliable research showing the safety of such use.

                  The research and consulting firm Hayes, Inc. warned that “the literature is too sparse and the studies [that exist are] too limited to suggest conclusions” about safety and effectiveness of using Lupron and other GnRH agonists on healthy children to prevent normal puberty. The American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) points out that puberty blockers alter a patient’s body in myriad ways:

                  In addition to preventing the development of secondary sex characteristics, GnRH agonists arrest bone growth, decrease bone accretion, prevent the sex-steroid dependent organization and maturation of the adolescent brain, and inhibit fertility by preventing the development of gonadal tissue and mature gametes for the duration of treatment.

                 Here is another reasoned approach -- one that identifies the problem which is that the child absorbs the burden and the pressure:

                  “I think it’s putting a lot on the shoulders of these children,” said Dr. Eric Vilain, a pediatrician and geneticist who heads the Medical Genetics division at UCLA. “It’s putting them on a path that will have a lot of medical and surgical consequences.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Vilain believes early social transitions unfairly push children to thinking they should identity as the opposite sex. He said these transitions can lead to unnecessary medical interventions for transgender kids.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “People telling me that these boys who behave like girls are in fact girl inside -- I’m saying well, where is the girl?” he asked. “Is their brain different? Are their other genes different? I still have not seen that.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  According to Vilain, physicians are far too willing to recommend social transitions for children.  As a result, Vilain believes the vast majority of children currently undergoing social transitions in the U.S. might not actually be transgender and, thus, might not be best served by embracing a sex that doesn't match their gender.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "If the children are pushed in this belief it will be much much harder for them to get out of this belief because everyone will have agreed on it very, very early on," Vilain said. "What worries me is that, indeed, there might be in the upcoming years a considerable number of these children that are placed on a path that we don’t fully know the outcome."

                 Beyond this, I'm very word of this LGBTQ mafia that has developed and bullying all other voices. This burgeoning growth of this mob is becoming not only troublesome, but scary in its influence to shut down diverse opinion. As an early supporter of the movement way back when, I advocated and voted for people of the same sex to marry. Again, I was hooked by the baited line of people have the right to choose who to love. I absolutely believed that and discounted the wise counsel that promised it was a Pandora's box. I thought the notion ridiculous and, oh, how wrong I was! Now we have MEN./ BOYS allowed in women's bathrooms ... in little girl's locker rooms based on a man/boy identifying as a woman/girl not wanting to be in a male locker room, but there is no weight given to women/girls who do not want a pair of male genitals in their face. Then we have the lovely transgender males being allowed to compete in women's sports? Really? Why do you suppose men and women's sports have been kept separate all these years? And when anyone says anything, the freight train is just sent down the hill with hysterical glee. Mario Lopez states a not disrespectful opinion of what is going on and he's made to apologize and threatened with the loss of his job? And last, but not least, we have the ''scholarly'' opinion that there are 15 genders? STOP!

                 I feel I've been lied to and used. I feel the real agenda is not what it seems. The real agenda is legalizing child molestation and I will not go down that road.
