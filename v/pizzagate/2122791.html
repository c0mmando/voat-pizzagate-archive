            Yeah, it still looks* like that to me... but, even this Fairbanks study is questioning this and apparently recreated a new model. We'll have to see what their official report is (due in early 2018)

            Awans R Muslim they R taught to lie to infidels! I sure hope any one investigating these Evil freaks check into anything they tell them! Plus, their lawyer is from HillPedo's team, so either the Awans will be Vince Fostered or nothing big will be revealed!

            Again I don't want to dash hopes but the Awan are being represented by HRC attorney's, against the DOJ who are all related to Wasserman, in front of a judge who was appointed by Obama and worked in the same law firm as L. Lynch, Mills, et al

            This is dramatic theater. If anything really gets out it is because some good insiders let it out.

              Yes. I called Senator Burr &amp; Senator Feinstein of The Intelligence committees
             </p>
             <p>
              And R-Trey Gowdy and D-Adam Schiff
Of house intelligence
             </p>
             <p>
              Again to state I along with thousands of American Citizens have been investigating, calling, reporting the Awan Spy Ring in congress along with other crimes that the congress and FBI will not investigate. I stated we have gone on record, we have you tube channels, we have served law suits in person to your offices, to beg you to protect our national security for over 8 months and the citizens are the ones that informed the congressmember they had a potential spy working for them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know I made the calls for months on end but I called again today and asked that they give an immediate press conference. Everyone should keep calling....it freaks them out

               If you have a few extra minutes type it up and send it certified mail, return signature requested. That REALLY grabs their attention.  It's cheap and effective at opening eyeballs.

            "... tell a larger story that's gonna be pretty disturbing to the American people." Huh. It would have to be pretty disturbing to shock most Americans. So do tell. Thanks for this info. (The congressman has quite the grave look on his face.)

                    I am baffled why he would care about the points.  Usually popularity contests are for CUNTS not men -- another reason your very presence here is an obstacle to progress.  Even this awful thread of yours: a place to gab like teenage girls. Cuz research bores you, cuz you arent very bright.

                 Damn boy that's a low tolerance level. For a Kike I'm sayin. You'd be running your shoes out back in the day, horses and donkeys are what Mr. Quixote and his nigga friend depended upon, you should know that.

                 I'm not saying I don't love you anymore, but damn, that Quixote crap is one boring POS story to be "one of the greatest novels of all time." And Man of La Manhca REALLY sucked. Tell me I'm not right.

               opened my eyes to some rather serious claims re: Building 7... paired with the recent findings published a few days ago from the Alaska Fairbanks study funded by the A&amp;E 9/11 for Truth group (which apparently determined that fire did weaken it, but the shockwaves unseated the beams... and not anything like controlled demolition)... it doesn't rule out foul play, I think the events that day were still all very suspicious, but, just keeping an open mind. Including variants of the official explanation which I previously thought were total BS.

                Did you know that's a shill? He has several accounts that sound like arewesure. He has negative contributions points. Did you look at his profile? If you did your own research and believe that then ok. But I wanted to let you know who it is that opened your eyes in case you didn't know.

                 Oh, I'm 99% sure he's a shill... but, he took the time to surprisingly craft an incredibly detail-rich post, with some pretty serious links to back it all up. I was honestly shocked. Usually his posts are limited to basically saying "Yeah, right" without much substance. I'd even go as far as to say he's NOT a shill, and just an incredibly, weirdly, dedicated skeptic of everything/anything that isn't approved by the mainstream.

                <p>
                 His post on Building 7 was so intense that I told him he should've been hired by the 9/11 Commission to write their book. Haha.

                <p>
                 But, yeah, 99% of his nay-saying is nonsense and CNN-worthy schlock.

              Most Americans are so medicated, so drugged, so hooked on pop culture, so in debt, and so distracted by things which won't matter in the end to even remotely be able to comprehend what is the real meaning behind PG.  Most of this was by design - use human nature to let it ruin itself.  The surge of opioids in the US - completely intentional - drug commerce or Deep State? - it doesn't matter.

              Until a message can be so outrageous that it can't not be covered by the MSM, you will never get the message through.  The MSM has truth on IGNORE.  Add in all the meds, drugs, and programming via every form of media, and voila - brainwashing.

               You are so right. They are purposely not educating the children so they will remain dumb down. No history or civics classes in school  so they can learn what America was and now has become. All part of the New World Order.

                Its worse than that.  The "new math" or other new "learning techniques" are designed to reshape how the brain processes information.  Very few teenagers or young adults have the logic circuits wired in a way where they can problem solve.  If you interact with young adults and have a good few years on them, its pretty apparent that something is wrong with many of them.  At least the way the handle failure, process logic, adapt to change, and function under pressure.  Something is wrong.
