            Hi everyone. This video was uploaded awhile ago and I think with recent events some peopel can use their heads any maybe start putting this some together.
           </p>
           <p>
            YouTube account created username "C roskilly"
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeziDMY1WbFJWeekGF_BREQ/videos?disable_polymer=1">
             https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeziDMY1WbFJWeekGF_BREQ/videos?disable_polymer=1
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The account has two videos both titled with "hollywood 9 puzzle" 3/72v and 2/72o
           </p>
           <p>
            Both have similar themes between the two.
           </p>
           <p>
            "2/72" Focusing on visual of Danny Elfman with his own theme music for the original Spider-man. Then it blends the visual to Hans Zimmer who also did work on Amazing Spider-Man 2 reboot.
           </p>
           <p>
            We then see Tim Burton 89 Batman classic with Hans Zimmer's Dark Knight music instead of original Danny Elfman theme.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next, it oddly cuts to The Simpsons credits showing Danny Elfman wrote the theme to The Simpsons then cutting to the theme song of "The Critic" which was written by...Hans Zimmer. Both The Simpsons and The Critic  happen to also have the same production company animation however in this upload it does cut to a bizarre and kind of creepy version of ending  production theme animation that both The Simpsons and The Critic have never used unless there was a Halloween episode once. Again, I assume this is connecting two composers who have eventually took over the role of exact projects. If not trying to focus on composers and/or their employers.
           </p>
           <p>
            We then get cut back to Tim Burton's Batman movie with The Joker, again using Hans Zimmer music instead of Danny Elfman. During this scene there are multiple flashes started at :55 seconds in. One recurring flash appears to be picture used in the Overlook Hotel 1930s crowd in The Shinning starring Jack Nicolson (while showing him as the Joker in Batman)
           </p>
           <p>
            There's then a flash from The Dark Knight rises with "322" on wall at the scene right before Bane blows up the Mayor at the football stadium. 322 may be from "Skull &amp; Bones"
           </p>
           <p>
            There's then a flash frame of Danny from the Shinning playing with toys on the carpet. Next to another picture of Buzz Lightyear a toy from Toy Story, standing in a room on carpet that matches Danny's in The Shining.
           </p>
           <p>
            This quickly cuts to another frame panning that same picture earlier of Overlook Hotel 1930s
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, when Jack (The Joker) says the semi-famous line "Where does he get those wonderful toys?"  -- "toys" is then cut to Tom Hanks/Woody saying "Toys" in Toy Story. Where then we see the scene of Toys coming to life scaring the bad neighbor kid. The doll saying "mama" then is slowed down sounding more like "red rum" where you can hear Danny (The Shining) voice mixed in (probably just for this upload)
           </p>
           <p>
            We then see several pictures and frames flash by. The only ones I could make out other than that Overlook 1930s photo was frame from Dark Knight Rises again but showing the "Sandy Hook" map. More people flash in frames which I don't recognize all of them but do see Aleister Crowley and the 322 Dark Knight Rises picture again. Along with other people and historical military photos.
           </p>
           <p>
            The final scene is another Batman movie, Batman Forever showing helicopter crashing into, yes a large all seeing eye, then cuts Jim Carey with again eyes on multiple TV monitors surrounding his character both at his work place then in another scene from his apartment, eye looking shapes at the Circus where Dick Grayson parents are murdered as they fall into another eye. During these transitions you hear random audio including backwards dialog, Jim Carey saying "you won't learn nothing" and what sounds to be the narrator from Donald Duck in Math Magic Land finishing with one more "shh!" sound effect which is the "shh" sound used in the Grace production company behind The Simpsons and The Critic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay so we went from Danny Elfman (Spiderman/Batman/Simpsons) to Hans Zimmer (Spiderman/Batman/Critic) to Batman to Jack Nicolson to The Shining to Toy Story to Batman Forever....
           </p>
           <p>
            The next video is labeled 3/72. (are there 72 videos?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Warning this is NSFW due to partial nudity/sexual theme:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln5gUHvjiP0">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln5gUHvjiP0
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This one seems to continue almost from the previous starting with Batman Forever. However the general theme of this video transitions between movie scenes of several actresses who all appeared in multiple comic book films from what appears to only be DC/Warner Bros. From Superman in the 70s to later generation Batman &amp; Superman films. It seems like in order to be an actress in a comic book movie, you have to be nude first since the following names (in the youtube video description) have all appeared nude and in these superhero films:

            There's also a voice that sounds like it may or may not be Heath Ledger though I am not sure what film it's from where he says "Continental United States. Japan"  right after his Joker / Dark Knight scene.

            Hardly perfect.  The only dirt they had on Harvey Weinstein was he was hard to work with. In contrast they have Tump is a embodiment of evil and short fingered vulgarian.  Could potentially be useful though for who it lists as frequenting prostitutes/ international prostitutes.

            An example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Spacey, Kevin. Way back in the closet--behind your old sneakers--that's where Kevin's hiding. Likes his men young. Very young. Linked with Colin Farrell, Rupert Graves, Helen Hunt, Bebe Neuwirth, and Bryan Singer.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And this is from back in 2004, notice the connection with Singer!
