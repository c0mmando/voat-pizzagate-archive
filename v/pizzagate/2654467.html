<hr />
<p>Im somewhat hesitant to share my full opinion, but here goes.... I fully support the metoo movement and feel it is very in line with our goals here. Metoo took down pedos kevin spacey, and dan schneider(!!!) Evan rachel wood and others came forward with stories about being raped in Hollywood when they were kids. Weinstein had underage victims.</p>
<p>Yes, we want to see a hell of a lot more come out and more sickos taken down. Yes, metoo has not been centered on pedos in hollywood, but it has not covered up or distracted from it. Its opened the doors. More people are talking about pedowood, more survivors are coming forward, and people are now more open to believing these true horror stories. If it came out all at once, people would dismiss it as crazy.</p>
<p>I think a huge problem here on our forum is the left vs right, lib vs conservative paradigm, and what is very sad about that is that overall the right side is against feminism, and i believe that is poisoning our mission. Please hear me out with an open mind.</p>
<p>I have learned that feminism means equality for women. The media demonized feminism from day one, just like they have demonized pg. Women survivors were ridiculed, as we see sra victims ridiculed, and how many child sexual abuse victims are ridiculed. Rape and abuse and sexual harassment are real and they are rampant. Women, children and men. Furthermore, there is no clear line between girl and woman... Females of all ages are sexually abused, they are traumatized, they are not believed, and all of this needs to stop. Its like if the victims are kids, voaters care, but if they are women, many voaters disbelieve or dont care. What about teens? Preteens? Its happening to all ages.</p>
<p>Just like we say, believe the kids, it is rare for them to lie about these things, they have nothing to gain and everything to lose... That is true for child, teenn, and adult victims. People don\'t want fame from coming out with rape allegations against hollywood bigwigs. They do get some support, but they get tons of ridicule and blame and disbelief, not to mention risking their careers and maybe even their lives. Tptb dont use metoo to cover pedowood. they hate it, cuz we are getting closer, and they are being exposed.</p>
<p>The same systemic powers that dont want is t believe adult survivors are the ones covering up pedowood. Asia argento was one of weinsteins bravest and most vocal survivors. Days after her huge speech at cannes film festival, anthony bourdain seems to have been Suicided. I believe tptb were very scared of all he knew, and that they wanted to punish him and asia as well as send a message to silence other survivors. Bourdain had also spoken about the corruption of hrc.</p>
<p>In addition, and importantly, feminism is the movement that brought ritual abuse to light... Insisting it was real, that child sexual abuse is real, and that the victims must be believed. Male or female, adult or child.</p>
<p>Feminists were the group fighting the false memory syndrome foundation, and all the sick forces pushing their agenda that dissociative identity disorder is not real. In this light, i feel feminists are being betrayed overall by our movement. Yet, i know there are many feminists here on our team, doing amazing work, and whom we respect. Some label themselves such, some dont. some dont due to the anti feminist bias here. But truly, a lot of the people here who say they hate feminists actuslly are feminists. They want equality and safety for women. Believing that feminists are man haters is totally equivalent to believing pg\'ers are loonies who think comet holds a child sex ring in their basement and caused a &quot;madman&quot; to shoot up the place. Dont believe their rhetoric. When you do, they are winning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sexual harassment of women, girls, and teens is rampant and horriifying in its scope and extent, and it connects to a very real fear of the reality of sexual violence, which is an epidemic in our society, just like pedophilia. Hand in hand with pedophilia. Its about domination and control, and its perpetrated by monsters. Many females first enter the workforce as teens, and we need to be against sexual abuse and harassment of them, as well.</p>
<p>Overall, being anti feminist and anti metoo is being anti our agenda to take down this beast we are here fighting.</p>
<p>I also want to point out the reality of men and boys being abused, that these survivors are real and just as traumatized, and that feminism also brought their plight out into the open. Everything metoo is fighting for will only help child and teen victims and save potential victims from horror.</p>
<p>This divisiveness and hatred needs to stop. Some of our best pg\'ers are women, feminists, and/or survivors, whether its abuse from childhood or adulthood or both.</p>
<p>I must add that some of those fighting the good fight with us here are jewish, african American, libertarian, green party, and even liberals. We need to focus on what we are here fighting for. The shills try to divide and separate us in order to weaken us, and too often their method is working.</p>
<p>We are here to take down the child abusers. We have had success and we will continue to. The dam has broken open, and i cant wait to keep watching their donwfalls.</p>
<p>Love and peace to you, my fellow warriors of the light.</p>

              I hold nothing against people for their thoughts unless they are heinous or shills Everyone has a right to their opinion.  I may not like it, but how else are we going to get to the right place on this endeavor, Our Children.  We have to be One Force, not many.  If we are fragmented, Nothing will make a difference.  We must Stand Together if we are to get anywhere.

            Since I was the one who wrote the piece MeToo Movement Exposed. Let me explain my position.
           </p>
           <p>
            I felt I needed to expose Ronan Farrow and how the MeToo movement started. He is not to be trusted and I would hate for someone to reach out to him with an abuse story that involved anyone from their cabal, as they will be exposing that they want to come forward and their life could be in danger.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am just going to stay away from the feminist part, we have very different view points on that, although did my posts in any way attack feminists?
           </p>
           <p>
            The left vs. right? There is corruption on both sides. Nowhere in my posts have I made this about left vs. right, I am willing to expose people from both sides if I find it. Exploring the relationship between Ronan and Hillary was essential as Pizzagate started with her campaign manager John Podesta's e-mails, plus we a found many connections to child trafficking through the people that surround her and her foundation. Hillary is a HUGE part of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <blockquote>

             The shills try to divide and separate us in order to weaken us, and too often their method is working
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Do you think I am a shill? All I am doing is trying to do is inform about the ties and shady agenda behind why MeToo started. We need to know who to trust and who is on our side. Believe it or not the only battle I want with you, is a battle with us fighting together for child victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I can say for the Evan Rachel Wood story is...give us NAMES!
           </p>
           <p>
            MeToo ended up being a good a thing because it did inspire many others to come forward, which took down Kevin Spacey, Bryan Singer etc. but Ronan had nothing to do with that. Do you think Ronan is going to start outing pedos? I don't think so. In fact I know that he has been sitting on a name of someone who molested a 15 year old and hasn't released it. Stay tuned for part four....

            Your welcome.  I say that because I did read all of it. I respect you and your work and know of your posts on FMSF and SRA.  And I commend you for it.  I have changed my outlook on many things since I came on board mainly abortion and on the 2nd Amendment.  Let me  coin a new word.  Humanist.  A humanist is one that wants the same rights and freedoms and safety for every human.  When I first came to voat people were more accepting of other parties, but now I find immediate shutdown and voat downs when someone states their opinion.  It seems to be Trump or nothing now.   I have repeatedly written that I am willing to give him a chance, but others are not willing to give my choices a chance.  It seems to have become a One Lane Highway.  I think that is going to hurt our cause because a United Force is a Stronger Force.  We talk about how our parties have been separated and how they achieve nothing because of it.  Well, that is what has happened here.  They want nothing more than to divide and conquer us.  We can't give them that victory.  I too had an odd feeling at first about the metoo movement but now I also feel that it has benefited us.  Believe me, the sheeple think it is great, they have no clue about it possibly being pushed by pedowood and it's moguls.  And I believe it is sinking in that there is some very serious abuse within the entertainment industry.  Tearing down metoo will only make people more unsure when men or women or children come forward.  It will be akin to the Cry Wolf Story.  Thank You for your post and for speaking about a somewhat touchy subject.  And let me add that I am not going to down voat anyone for their  opinions.&lt;3
