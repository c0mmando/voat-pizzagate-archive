            Jo Cox the murdered English politian was a supporter of the White Helmets. She also worked for Freedom Fund, an anti slavery charity that was part of the Clinton Global Initiative the Global Slavery Index. Bill Clinton himself gave a speech at the launch of Freedom Fund.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jo Cox and her husband also worked as advisors to former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah Brown. Gordon Brown became PM shortly after Maddie McCann went missing and gave the parents his support. But rumours have suggested Gordon Brown was linked to Gerry McCann through his brother Andrew Brown over some medical research regarding the effects of a nuclear power plant. Gordon Brown is Scottish like Gerry and has been accused of being not only a freemason but also an paedophile. Did the British government, led by Brown, protect the McCanns because of these links?
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to Jo Cox, she and her husband also worked for Save The Children and Oxfam. Husband Brendan Cox was forced to leave STC n disgrace after women claimed he was violent and sexually abusive towards them. Jo Cox worked in Belgium for Oxfam at the same time as Roland van Hauwermeiren. Roland was hired by Oxfam despite being embroiled in a sex scandal at a previous charity. Not only that but during his time at Oxfam he was accused again of exploiting vulnerable people for sex and yet was still given the role of heading to Haiti after the earthquakes where he AGAIN paid the local women for sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jo Cox's murder and the trial of her killer Thomas Mair raised questions. What was also suspicious was the behaviour of her family and her husband, who prepared a long emotionless and political statement just a couple of hours after his wife's brutal murder. Her death was shamelessly used to stir up anger and direct it at anyone who voted for Brexit, anyone right wing. Everyone on the Right were told Jo Cox's blood was on their hands.
           </p>
           <p>
            I still don't know what happened or what to believe regarding the death of Jo Cox. But I do know she worked for and around some very suspicious people.

            After the picture of "Dust Boy", a forlorn little kid sitting in an ambulance alone, dust all over his face, which captured people's hearts worldwide. Assad claimed the White Helmets were fakers: Basically dust boy and his sister appeared in photos getting rescued from rubble on three separate occasions. Independent media (read Russian bots) reports confirmed this. This is one of those subjective things, saying this person is the same as that person, but they sure looked alike to me. Also the girl especially had a certain style to her clothing.

            Upvoat!  Thank you for exposing these horrible lies USAID is creating.  They not only are doing this to spread propaganda for whatever purpose, possibly a war with Syria but also to as you say, steal children and organ harvesting.  This must be exposed.

            The poisoned families in Flint Michigan and single mothers cut off the dole in London would be thrilled to know thst resources diverted away from them are instead used to produce fake videos to prop up a vicious proxy war.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are poisoning our children's water and their families as well and the poor of London to spread lies in order to stoke a war in Syria.  This must be exposed.

            Organ harvesting is serious business and big money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently only ISIS harvest men, women and children, mainly children and sell their organs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet ISIS, "moderate rebels" get funding and "non-humanitarian aid" like white helmets from so many nations.
           </p>
           <p>
            18,000 Syrian Children victim to organ harvesting mentioned at United Nations here -

            They've faciliated passages by which to smuggle weaponry and people. Syrian organ trafficking is big bussiness too. Think of all the livers untainted by alcohol in this part of the world.
