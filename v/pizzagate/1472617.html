<p>I found potential Pizza-linking to major media figure Ted Koppel connection to DC players in the 70\'s-80\'s. </p>
<p>I would suspect that once they are in the elite class that\'s associated with Pizza-Hotdogs etc., that is an ongoing thing.</p>
<p>In particular Koppel\'s Pizza related connection to - later found murdered - Washington lobbiest Craig Spence who was the second main figure with Lawrence King in the Franklin Credit Union Pedophile Scandle. Kopple apparently knew Spence VERY well.</p>
<p>&quot;Spence reportedly introduced Koppel to a 15-year-old boy, &quot;</p>

<p>Ted Koppel has a connection in that he was at least aware of Washington Pedophilia and may have knowlege of elite who do consume hotdogs and pizza. That info is out there. Left bloggers &amp; journalists have alluded to it in the past</p>
<p>We know for a fact that one of the main heavy aficionados and consumers of hotdogs and pizza are centered in ALL forms of the media industry and corporate / government .</p>
<p>Q: Does this prove Koppel consumes Pizza?</p>
<p>A: No definitive proof so far from what I uncovered. But it casts a cloud. It shows he was and may still be touching that community. As a Major Journalist it may be unavoidable to not be in contact with the Pedophile Class. I make no claims that he has been a pedophile.  What it shows is he may have seen or been aware of Washington DC and other national players involved in Pizza culture. What it shows is he bears scrutiny and questioning. He should answer for what he may have seen or knows about.</p>
<p>Q: Could Koppel eat Pizza or Hotdogs? </p>
<p>A: Anything is possible with the entire Illuminati Class to include theft, blackmail, kidnapping, rape, torture, murder, and even blood and flesh consumption.</p>
<p>What we know is people involved in this stuff never stop. They are every form of narcissistic psychopath and more. They are addicted to adrenaline, dopamine and other substances.</p>
<p>I am not a power researcher yet. My role, along with millions of others like me around the world, is as a research investigator to feed hopefully relevant data into the pipeline for the top research investigators to compile, examine and form their connection matrices. One small bit of information in the hand of those building cases could be the piece that leads to an avalanche.</p>
<p>I have provided two links provided above &amp; below thus exceeding the one link minimum rule.  The two links appear to independently cross referances this backstory So that helps bolster this.</p>

            Koppel and his wife were reported to be insufferable boors at Washington parties. They said she was worse than he was.
