Based on the videos I\'ve seen covering it, and the eMails and Instagram pages commonly cited, I believe the definitions for many of the codewords that have been given may not be completely accurate. Here is my list of some of the relevant terms and how I believe they should be interpreted/deciphered. The relevance of satanism, spirit cooking, and cannibalism seems to have been largely passed over for definitions of terms which are more closely related to pedophilia and fetishism. Let me know what you think.</p>

              Have you ever read a book as a kid and came across a word you didn't know and tried to deduce it's meaning based on the context in which it was used?

            The whole handkerchief map wording,  and dominos creep me out the most.
           </p>
           <p>
            My interpretation of the handkerchief scenario is possibly the handkerchief has blood, feces, or semen on it, and can be used as a "map" to find the pedo, or child.
