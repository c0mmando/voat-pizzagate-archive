<p>...</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, the Council, in partnership with the Governor’s Office of Youth, Faith and Family, trained more than 2,000 Phoenix Final Four volunteers on key indicators related to identifying victims and connecting them to services, a release states.

<p>The Council, in partnership with the Arizona Broadcasters Association, will also air educational public service announcements during the Final Four.

<p>I also discovered that an anti-trafficking group, End It, put on a protest at the 2013 Final Four in Atlanta by modifying a box truck so that the walls were glass, and then having women sit in the truck and act like sex slaves. The truck was driven through the streets of Atlanta:</p>

            Here's an article from 2015 about human trafficking at the Final Four:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sex trafficking will spike during Final Four, predicts expert"
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             INDIANAPOLIS - As basketball fans make plans to visit the Circle City this weekend, so will people selling underage women for sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sex trafficking is the organized effort to force minors to have sex for a profit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Theresa Hayden, a University of Louisville professor who studies sex trafficking, expects ads for sex to triple this weekend. She said --- will bring in women during a major event like the Final Four to meet a --- demand.
            </p>
            <p>
             "There;s a lot of people who are traveling about and (they believe) part of their fun for the weekend is that they have the right, they're entitled to spend the money if somebody is providing this opportunity for them," explained Hayden.

            Atlanta doesn't even need the "excuse" of the final four to have a terrible human trafficking problem. Its an epidemic there and add to that the final four I am sure its out of control and left out of MSM of course.
