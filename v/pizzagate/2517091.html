<h1>Clinton Friend and Fundraiser Was Active In Sex Cult That Hacked Hillary’s Emails</h1>
<p>Longtime Clinton friend and fundraiser Richard Mays, an Arkansas lawyer, was active with the New York sex cult that reportedly hacked emails sent and received by Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Mays had an extensive videotaped conversation with the cult’s leader Keith Raniere — who has been arrested for sex trafficking alongside his protégé, Smallville actress Allison Mack, and whose cult allegedly branded women with his initials. That interview was part of the “Keith Raniere Conversations” program, available on his website.</p>
<p>Mays reportedly had “intensive classes with Raniere,” whose Nxivm cult was previously called Executive Success Programs.</p>
<p>Mays has long been linked to the Clintons, and Bill Clinton appointed him to the Arkansas Supreme Court. New York magazine once described him as “a Clinton friend and one of Hillary’s top fund-raisers.”</p>
<p>The extraordinary allegations are attributed to Kristen M. Keeffe, who was part of the inner circle that ran NXIVM, a “human development” organization that has been described by one expert as an “extreme cult.” The accusations by Keeffe are contained in a transcript of a telephone conversation that took place last March between Keeffe and Barbara J. Bouchey, a former NXIVM executive board member who is facing computer trespassing charges in Albany that accuse her and three others of improperly accessing the corporation’s website.”
Times-Union passage ends
Interesting. You know what else is interesting?
Charles Hurt reported that in the spring of 2007, “executives and top associates…along with their family members” donated $29,900 to the Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign.
Kirsten Gillibrand has also taken money from the group’s high-profile socialite member, and her father actually worked for the cult.
PageSix reported: “Nxivm’s biggest financial supporter, Seagram heiress Clare Bronfman, contributed $2,400 to Gillibrand’s 2010 special-election campaign, records show.”
PageSix also reported: The lawmaker’s [Gillibrand’s] dad, Doug Rutnik, worked as an attorney for Nxivm for four months in 2004 at a rate of $25,000 per month. “When he wanted to quit, he was falsely sued” on dubious grounds, said one source. “He ended up paying them back the $100,000 he’d been paid and signing a confidentiality agreement.’”
At least one woman from the cult says she was branded with Keith Raniere’s initials. Here is a bizarre video that Keith Raniere made with Allison Mack, where he made her break down in tears.</p>

            <p>
             While your points have been speculated about, they're yet to be poven. Or maybe they have been investigated and proven and the arrests have not been made due to coordination of efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
             These are some provocative thoughts, all of which could be possible--especially the making of snuff films and SRA. Can't believe that if those were going on that there wouldn't be videos for sale.

             It's amazing how much this scum leaked through to such high-profile individuals. Wonder if just a regular run-of-the-mill person could get the attention of such movers and shakers. Seems doubtful. Was knowing Skankles the key? Branson? You know someone was vouching for Raniere for him to get his foot in the door to pitch his lousy brainwashing program.
            </p>

             Wonder how much sex was involved at these ''seminars''? Maybe that was the motivation for attending. Wonder if they served ''pizza''?

            The accusations by Keeffe are contained in a transcript of a telephone conversation is what concerns me. How would that stand up in court? This could be a rug to be pulled by anyone who steps on it. On the other hand, if someone was blackmailed to give political donations there would be additional charges. Oh, what a complicated web they weave. Accountants will figure this out.

             Since this is evolving, there's no way of knowing what and who they have against this scumbag. And remember, Mack is allegedly singing like a canary so there's that.

             As I've stated a hundred times, the big question of why is what looms over this. Why? Why? Why? What was the endgame?

              Good question. Maybe the investigation and arrest where made by those not controlled. And now, with her singing, we will see more and more of the system that is onbvolved with this cult, but it will be covered up from the sheeple. Do the sheeple know about PG and all the facts? They won't about this one either. This may be a psyop for us and only us. 'We are winning!"

              Maybe same endgame and different pawns trying to outdo each other just like mafia guys, Recall that the Clintons shut down Raniere in Arkansas only to have him donate to the campaign. He was on there turf, so he apologized and went to NY in the same area that the Clintons moved as well. I say they are very familiar with each other and under the capo di tutti capi .

               No doubt they were working together. And, yes, he was arrested in Arkansas and paid a fine instead of going to prison where he belonged, so some kind of deal was forged.

                  You mean like confiscated computers? That's what I meant by "accountants will figure this out." My buddy at the CIA said, "if you want to do something illegal, why not just go somewhere where it is legal?" He never did say lawful though, in retrospect.

                   Not a bad line. But as I just posted somewhere else, there was heavy child grooming going on. This was confirmed by a former girlfriend of Raniere who is very vocal. I might post the article if someone hasn't already because it reveals some insider knowledge that I never heard before.

                    I believe you. I just posted that to make sure you knew what the (Blackburn's Law Dictionary) difference is between Legal and Lawful. Most people think it is the same thing, and that could not be further from the truth in many cases.

             I don't know if there's been any substantial proof of Disney. I'd have to plow through my other posts to get the list of names because it did have roots in PedoWood. Allison Mack was a recruiter and tried to entice Emma Watson and Kelly Clarkson.

              Oh, there was child grooming going on ... no doubt. There's an article I just read that confirms it. Maybe I'll post it if someone hasn't already. It talks about all the similarities to Scientology.

                 Alex Jones was not in denial ..when he fired one of his employees when he got too close to the workings of tthe deep state..
Alex Jones is a gatekeeper...
Even when it is the topic of occult law..which even this forum conspicuously ignores...he makes sure he avoids it..that is the one topic he has never touched....it is connected to the Cafr funds ...which he was an activist but then now never touches it..
Gatekeeping is his full time job ..and injecting fear psychosis into the listening public

              Why would they make child size coffins though? It must have been for a sick inside joke to be used as coffe tables. They likely feed them to hogs, or dispose of them some other way. They don't give them funerals.

               Are they registering their deaths ..and creating ledgers or accounts to support their bonds..or transfer them and their fees to some financial entity ..to generate securities ...nowadays and since 2008 there is a new concept of securitisatiin called collateral transformation...where even junk bonds ie below AA rating is rented out to major banks in return for highest grade US securities ..ehich the hedge fund must use to speculate on the stock market
The junk bonds in the hand of banks could be monetised by the FED by the big banks holding it at the FED in return for a low interest loan.. just like they do for mortgage backed securities..
This explains the easy availability of EMI programs in the car and retail segment..
This could be how the undertaker fund their business by transferring the new ledgers created by each death..and these are turned into junk bonds...that is then taken through the collateral transformation service..
One must investigate whether scott cummings still runs these associations and whether that association has some banking relatiin with the bond market..

               When a child or person dies ...does it matter where the application of registration of death is lodged ..
Could they kill a child...and transfer it to oregon ..
..if it is an unregistered child ..the state has no record of it after birth..
When the child  is registered it is property of the state
But when the unregistrred child is dead ...and an application of death is made ..who gets title over the child..
I know the birth certificate creates title over the name ..and the application of live berth creates financial value..
Google : What is namium
Utube : birth certiifcate stock market
Does something similar happen for application of death..
Does the under taker make the application of death..?
Does he get some value like a credit defualt swap event creates value.?
Do the undertakers association have some relation to the stock market via some bond arrangement..
Scott cummings and thrir instagram  group had an obsessiin with death..almost ritual worship..
Follow the money..
Do underwriter assosiciations sell bonds ..
Underwritten by application of death certificate and the fees they generate .. 
Does each application of death certificate create another account just like the application of live berth creates a name which is an account receivable .
Is this why they are called undertakers ..they take under or stand under and transfer the surety of the berth account..
              </p>
              <p>
               Did u know that the slab or stone that sits on a grave is known as a ledger??!!
Who holds or has legal title to the ledger .in return for their fees they receive servicing bonnds on the stock market..when they create more deaths ..more accounts or ledgers are created..for the securitisation of the bonds..just like the housing market mortgage backed securities where sold and betted on..during the last days of the housing matket bubble ..the banks where busy creating accounts for securities ..even fictional ones ...whilst at the same time betting on the collapse of the bonds ie credit default swaps..
              </p>
              <p>
               The tombstone means a ledger :.

               James alefantis was generating a lot of money in short times ..buying properties in washington..
He is a rotshild so must be taught the inner workings of the banking system..
..his obsession with children..he loves children ..his name says so..
Podesta is fishing for teens ..podesta is a top legal consultant ftom george town university..georgetown is a jesuit beehive..also they have experience of the selling and transfer of slaves in their history..
..
Scott cummings heads or is associated with a burial association ..does this burial assocatiin sell bonds or transfers accounts by assignment of these ledgers to some banking entity that sells bonds serviced by fees generated by the burial association

               Unfortunately, you're right. It could be a sick joke, or for shipping children ... which is probably even more perverse. You know, drug the kid up, fit them in there and ship them all over the world.

               How did u associate scott cummings with this pre school network..
              </p>
              <p>
               Do they run old age homes ? Is the next question..
Owing to him running burial associations
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe the death certificatew have value ..like the birth certifcates

             I know. It's got to lead somewhere and Clinton and the foundation are ostensibly where this could end up.

             And did you see the comment at the bottom of the post? Some very astute observer mentioned something about the hacking being a cover story. He wondered if perhaps the NXIVM cult members were given permission to be on her server and drilling for info. He speculates that the codes were given to the cult so they could data mine the correspondence.

               Yes, the Awans. If there were passwords being handed out, the Awans would seem to be involved.

               I didn't have direct proof for the allegation, but they are on my radar if this was part of the scheme.

             Convoluted, yes, but understandable to us. That weird chick who resigned a s Port Authority Ethics Commissioner was probably so worried that some other investigation was going on that she blew her cover. It probably would have been a citation for pot smoking rich kids with lawyers paid away, but NOOO, she had to intervene. Port authority by definition means just that. They allow ships into port. An acquaintance of mine used to know the Port Authority in Jamaica, and even in the Miami Vice days he would slip him a couple bucks to let him get out. Reagan's boys did a lot to stop that, but they were always 5 steps ahead.

              Everything is Rothschild connected. CIA and all spooks serve banking cartel. Politicians serve banking cartel. Politicians and spooks involved with PG. Alefantis is a Rothschild. They are the controllers, don't put the focus on their lackeys. CIA carries out their agendas and zionist run their banks and corporations. Polticians need their money and media. Always focus on the head of the snake.

             Number one question is: what was the purpose of this cult? It makes no sense that all the recruited girls were for Raniere. Not when they had schools for children. I'll bet when we learn that, this'll blow sky high.

              Nobody is looking for children in another country. it makes enough sense, They create the wars, cause chaos, brign the children back to the states where nobody is looking for them. They are helpless in another country. The system gets a farm for their appetite of children.

               It could be seen that way as there are similarities, but it could also be seen as very Jim Jonesesque.

               Jim Jones was a Bay area democratic.

                During the mid and late seventies, both politicians were part of the all-powerful political machine that was ruled and controlled by an ultra-liberal faction of the Democratic Party during the mid and late seventies. This group controlled the Bay Area and demanded unwavering loyalty from anyone who sought political office. George Moscone, Willie Brown, Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi were some of the leaders of this group. Pelosi had become the state Democratic Party chairman for northern California came from the city of San Francisco. However, one name is usually stricken from the record whenever this group is mentioned— Rev. Jim Jones! Yes, the same and very Rev. Jim Jones of Jonestown, Guyana infamy!
