            We have to take a very long hard look at "Christianity" .... which, like many other labels, is often showing itself to be just
the reverse of what we think of as "Christian" behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Church has a 2,000 year history of sexual abuse of children according to Italians who tell us it began on the first day
of the church's existence.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vatican/Catholicism established itself by invasions of nations and imposing the religion on the people.
"Introducing the Cross with the Sword."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vatican/Christianity also invented Capitalism which is fascism ...  A system intended to move the wealth and natural 
resources of other nations from the many to the few.  And it has done this successfully all over the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vatican/RCC engaged in extreme "precedent setting" violence in its "Crusades" and "inquisition" and 
"Burning at the Stake."  Many have seen the catalogue of inventions used to TORTURE victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            This same violence which filled the soil of Europe with blood, was brought to this land to destroy the native
people here -- labeled "pagans ... only fit to be fed to dogs."  Genocide of 112 million native people here 
because they refused to be enslaved.  Same for Africans brought here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vatican/Catholic Church underpins Elite-Patriarchy -- issued the licenses
            <em>
             Manifest Destiny
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             Man's Dominion Over Nature
            </em>
            which gave license to Elites/wealthy to exploit Nature, Natural Resources, Animal-Life ... and even other human beings according 
to various myths of "inferiority" ....  These are the instruments which have produced Global Warming which is a threat to the planet,
all animal life, and humanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vatican is still claiming the "inferiority" of females in not recognizing the full personhood of females as it recognizes the full 
personhood of males.  Vatican continues to bar women from ritual and authority within the Church.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vatican also helped to "catapult" Hitler/Nazis to power as an arm of Elites/wealthy.
            <br/>
            The RCC had already spread vile propaganda against Jews over the Papal States for 1,500 years which attests 
to the RCC church's co-responsibility for the Jewish Holocaust in Germany.
            <br/>
            Hitler, himself, refers to his simply doing the same thing that the RCC has done for 1,500 years in oppressing Jews.
That he was simply going a step further with the final solution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Elites/wealthy in the US and Internationally recruited Hitler and funded the Nazis.  Allen Dulles and Prescott Bush ran front 
companies in the US to collect money for this cause.  Dulles converted US $$$ into gold to be shipped to Germany.
When it became obvious that Hitler/Third Reich would fail, Allen Dulles also moved ex-Nazis out (200,000 of them into the 
US to found the CIA, funneled them into the FBI and other government agencies, and to "hot spots" around the world in
order to ensure the rise of the Fourth Reich which is what we are seeing today.  Two years before the end of the war, 
higher ups in Hitler's military were visiting our Pentagon to make deals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two years before the end of the war, the OSS which served Elites was being morphed into the CIA and operations 
were being drafted to be run out of the CIA  to destroy the US free press, to move ex-Nazis into the US government,
and to ensure that ONLY right wing governments would rise and hold control in nations over which the US had
influence and control at the end of WWII ... Germany, Japan, Italy, France.  In Italy, the US actually resurrected 
the Mafia there in order to ensure Gladio would be carried out as they planned.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vatican was equally involved in moving Nazis out and into the US via their "rat lines."  As well as the GOLD.
           </p>
           <p>
            About 40 years ago it was being rumored that the Vatican/RCC was involved in covert activity against Muslims.
That seemed rather odd as they no longer had ARMIES ...
Some while ago, I came upon comments by John Stockwell, former CIA and CIA whistleblower, whom I had been
aware of as he has been featured on C-span a number of times ....
            <strong>
             What John Stockwell was relating was that the CIA is:  "Catholics in Action."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA/MIC are very closely related -- even more so the CIA has long been responsible for coups on democratic nations ...
and for supporting faked terrorism and fake "up-risings" in nations where the US then responds with "intervention" ... 
Today the US is involved in "illegal wars of aggression all over the world."
NATO is surrounding Russia and on its way to China.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vatican has always fought democracy -- including within its own church, though the beloved Pope John XXIII actually
made the church a democracy with "Vatican II."  Thjs caused an uprising of the right wing in the Vatican ... and at least 
two Popes who succeeded Pope John XXIII were very quickly dead after their elections.  Coincidentally, Pope John XXIII
and the following two Popes were intending to tell Catholics to use their own personal conscience and free will to decide
for themselves whether or not to use birth control.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is the RCC opposed to democracy ... ?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Here's some info on the Vatican and SPAIN and the rise of Fascism there ...

            <p>
             <strong>
              The Vatican Propaganda Machine: The Spanish “Civil War” Lesson
             </strong>
             From George Seldes, the “dean and granddaddy of investigative reporters,” when it comes to issues important to the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, “… there is no free press in America.” Seldes’s extensive study of the Spanish Civil War and the related control of the American press by the Catholic hierarchy is exceedingly instructive for all who are concerned about this freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In 1931, Spain became the Republic of Spain, a liberal democracy that separated church and state, ended State monetary support for the church and adopted the principles of Freedom of Conscience, Freedom of Religion, and Freedom of the Press.
             </strong>
             The Vatican feared for the Church’s very survival in Spain.
             <strong>
              There had been four insurrections since 1835, and it was the Spanish people, the poor workers and poor peasants, who burned the churches because they blamed the hierarchy for having persistently backed the upper class. The latest uprising against the Catholic Church took place throughout the country in July, 1936. One historian described it as “the work of masses of common people, a spontaneous uprising.”
             </strong>
             The Vatican feared that the liberal democracy with its freedoms would spell the end of the Church in Spain.

              The Vatican HATED the U.S. before the fall of the Papal States!!

            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Before the fall of the Papal States in 1870, the Vatican HATED the United States and its Constitution.
             </strong>
             The U.S. was a haven for many of the refugees who fled Europe after the Revolution of 1848. Garibaldi and Gazazzi were welcomed as HEROES by the Protestant U.S. Many in the U.S. supported the liberation of Italy and contributed to its success with soldiers and money.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Vatican NEVER forgave the U.S. for that support to the liberators.

             Thank God we didn't have the 20th Amendment when Lincoln won the election. He needed a lot of time to select patriotic and qualified men to help him save the Union. If the 25th Amendment was in force then there would be no United States today!!

             I'd also add here that if it weren't for VIOLENCE by the Vatican/RCC there would not have ever been a Vatican or Catholic Church.
As democracy has risen in nations -- including Separation of Church &amp; State -- more and more Catholics have felt safe enough to 
leave the church.  The recent decades now of revelations of Catholic priests involved in sexual abuse of children -- and especially
the cover up's by the Pope and other officials of the church have moved even more members away from the church.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The lawsuits and secret pay offs to families who have accused the church of protecting pedophiles resulted in the 
Church selling off parish properties . . .  which in turn has caused members to demand a full accounting of parish assets.
That is an additional threat which the Vatican/RCC remain under.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Here's an interesting quote on religion ...
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             There are things about organized religion which I resent. Christ is revered as the Prince of Peace, but more blood has been shed in His name than any other figure in history. You show me one step forward in the name of religion and I'll show you a hundred retrogressions. Remember, they were men of God who destroyed the educational treasures at Alexandria, who perpetrated the Inquisition in Spain, who burned the witches at Salem. Over 25,000 organized religions flourish on this planet, but the followers of each think all the others are miserably misguided and probably evil as well.

            HE did not accuse anyone of slander. He said there was no proof that the Bishop covered up for the corrupt priest. The corrupt priest was dealt with and no one accused the priest's victims of slander. 
HE did not say the victims were lying about the abuse. He simply said there was zero evidence that the Bishop covered it up. 
Whoever wrote this headline is slandering, libeling and calumnizing the pope.

             Denying the guilt of child abusers is the same as saying the accusers are lying.

             The Catholic Church has been hiding massive amounts of pederasty for years now. This is a PROVEN fact, get off of your high horse and do what you can to fix your Church instead of slandering journalists.

              I hate to say it but many Catholics are in deep denial. Anyone who would support the Pope is not a good person in my books.

              Well, if the truth is not important to you. Believe whatever slander against the pope you like.
