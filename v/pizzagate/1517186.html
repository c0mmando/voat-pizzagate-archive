More Gusifer BS. According to Patti-Paule-Carres, her business is nonclassifiable? </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/sRDte">http://archive.is/sRDte</a></p>
<p>So it\'s &quot;Nonclassifiable Establishments&quot;?!!! But this does show that Joseph (Daniel\'s father) was in on this and actively involved. If you click on his name, it confirms what is said above about Daniel being &quot;J. Daniel and Daniel J.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/4fcBt">http://archive.is/4fcBt</a></p>
<p>But his part in the business, it\'s as shadowy as Paule-Carres. What does &quot;Production Occupations&quot; mean? Especially when the type of business is listed as &quot;Medical&quot;?  
</p>
<p>=========
Another property showed up for a J. Daniel Petruso. It\'s at 517 Fairmont in Winchester, VA </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/jTrzU">http://archive.is/jTrzU</a></p>
<p>When I did a search for that address, a Mary Christine Petruso came up. There\'s a Daniel J. Petruso listed as a possible relative and several other individuals that might family members. I notice that Mr. Petruso usually is listed as J. Daniel Petruso with the &quot;J&quot; first, but this time the J. is after Daniel so it might be that he\'s sometimes listed both ways. I\'m putting down the link to this woman and the possible family family members because it may aid in figuring out if they are involved in this adoption service or not. There could be other businesses that tie in also, but, right now, there\'s absolutely no evidence to link them at this time. </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/VzJMv">http://archive.is/VzJMv</a></p>
<p>The business is called Gusifer, and given its similarity to Guccifer, 2impendingdoom wondered if it was a lead. Is it ever! I posted, but I feel like the information is getting buried, and it’s too important to get buried! Therefore, I\'m putting it into its own post. </p>
<p>2impendngdoom was right!  Here’s what I found. The business isn’t one business – it’s eight. And it’s listed as business services. Here’s the information: </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/eJu1H">http://archive.is/eJu1H</a></p>
<p>It says and I quote: &quot;There are 8 companies that have an address matching 124 Amherst St Winchester, VA 22601.
The companies are Paule Carres Phd Pc Glenn N, Medical Electronic Data Insurance Claims Inc, Shenandoah Family Institute Inc, Sfi Adoption Services LC, Gusifer LLC, Pcs Enterprises LLC, Medic Inc, and Prisma Counseling Services Plc.&quot; 
My eye stopped on: ADOPTION SERVICES?!!!! Really? When you search for Sfi Adoption Services, you get lots of hits. Here are two examples. SFI is listed as a PRIVATE VIRGINIA ADOPTION SERVICE and an INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE ADOPTION AGENCY.  Nope, you can\'t make this shit up! </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/ZNKkx">http://archive.is/ZNKkx</a> <a href="http://archive.is/JGQO3">http://archive.is/JGQO3</a></p>
<p>The scary thing is that they handle medical records AND adoptions. Does this mean they have the ability to change medical records? If they do this is worrisome for obvious reasons. I feel this is a huge lead so dig, dig, dig!</p>
<p>Edit: There\'s even another adoption service at 124 Amherst: Fridays Child Adoption Service. </p>

<p>cbradio has helped us out by compiling a list to look for in checking whether an adoption service/agency is legitimate. This should help enormously in our investigation: </p>
<p>Is his COA accreditayion up to date, consistent history? Also, 1. National Center zfor Families and Children, Maryland, allows volunteers?? 2. Fairdax Families for Kids, mentor programs. 3. DC family and Youth Initiative- host, mentor, adoptions.</p>
<p>The Haiti adopt place across from Comet? Connect to any agencies or people this subverse listed on top?</p>
<p>What attorney is either agency using?</p>
<p>What hospitals are they affiliated as many adopt agency reviews, list that hospitals are utilized for unwanted pregnancies.</p>
<p>There are more govt, state/fed oversight agencies, then I listed. Be back on that.</p>
<p>Fed/state grants?</p>
<p>Any live in VA, DC area to spy or also look at back of weekly papers for ones advertising for pregnant moms/ paid to conceive?</p>
<p>All the missing VA children. How far from those agencies?</p>
<p>Are kids kept at that building or where? Where are they getting the overseas ones?</p>

            is merely a real estate holding company setup for the Paule-Carres in 2005 to allow a shared ownership over the equity of the office building. This is probably when the Paule-Carres allowed a more senior role for their business partner Joseph Daniel Petruso in their various partnerships operating out of this building.

            The name of the company is strange, but it only seems strange because 8 years later a hacker using a different spelling Guccifer caused mayhem in the US government, but without this, would any of us find this name particularly weird? Probably not. Just like

            In a planet of 7 billion+ people, is it weird that a guy in Nicaragua just happens to use these same 7 letters in this order for an online tag where he blogs about aircraft simulators? Also, Paul Smith wouldn't exactly be an uncommon name.

             No, no, no! That's not what that means. I posted this before. What that means is that she reported various addresses for the business, including a home address. Please stop with the disinformation. And is it possible that a guy in Nicaragua uses the name Gusifer and talks to a guy named Paul Smith who happens to be an aviation expert on flying a full plane loads from Newark to Zurich, I'd say it's impossible, but then I'm not paid to debunk and act like an idiot.

             For everyone truly interested in Pizzagate: The MO of these shills are to first contact you and pretend to be some sort of friend. Then they post garbage and try to obfuscate what you're saying. I guess the logic is that this "friendship" (that's developed over the whole thirty seconds it took you to write a DM back to them) is going to prevent you from calling them out.

              That is entirely possible, yes. What I am asking for you to do, is provide a link between the Paule-Carres, and/or their Gusifer LLC, and the Paul Smith affiliated with the Nicaraguan Gusifer blogger, OTHER than the single BIZSTANDING scrambled record which is incorrect when checked against proper State based corporation databases. All I am asking is that you find more solid links before assuming that a Gusifer Nicaragua link with a Paul Smith who commented ONCE on a fight simulation blog, is at all connected with a Virginia based firm related to a real estate holding company simply using the same 7 letters as an identifier (Gusifer; on a planet with 7 billion people).
             </p>
             <p>
              As for assuming that I am not truly interested in Pizzagate or am a shill ... how dare you. I have spent much time here trying to get to the truth, and based on your M.O., you have called anyone who remotely--and even politely--attempts to clarify or correct any of your assumptions, a shill. People who resort to ad hominem attacks in their own defense when even confronted with slight criticisms, are WORSE than shills ... you are a damn disgrace towards the concept of TRUTH. Grow up.

              In reverse, this would mean that anyone who invested time and effort into an investigative lead you have posted, would be unable to criticize it once the lead got to a dead end, otherwise the op would be within their right to label said contributor a shill? Really? Is that where your logic is at?

             <p>
              I didn't bother spending tome here to make friends. I don't need anymore friends. I came here to investigate Pizzagate and get to the TRUTH, no matter where that leads me. I find Comet Ping Pong highly bizarre, and the Podesta's downright disgusting, There is obviously something very wrong with the whole Soros, Clinton Foundation and Frank Giustra enterprise/s, but I'm not going to lead myself along falsely with a conformation bias when 'leads' that looked promising, turn out to be assumptions with thin veneers.

              I don't need your friendship ... I need you to be a better investigator.

            Hi. 
Anyone reading www.charlesortel.com?/ 4 yr investigation of Clinton foundation from both a financials and govt view of their filings and laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            He stresses as I. Read all laws and contracts of govt, find as many filings in ever level of govt and corp and Npo as able. County to federal to abroad.
           </p>
           <p>
            His research has many key terms to dig. Lady IRA, a Saudi university, rejat Gupta man, so much more. That web needs archiving. He may not even be alive. He spent four yes investigating Clinton foundation. Did you know the Clinton's never even had IRS permission to collect monies or do other charities, beyond the bill museum archives and related research? Ahem..
           </p>
           <p>
            2.Boystown is huge, and worldwide;  as is the nun organization in Ireland that had numerous abuse/ dad body cases. Did you know that you can even buy Boystown god/ silver bonds and coins? Google it, archive some companies that are registered to sell them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Forbes, boy town #48 top money make charity under Flanagan on Forbes title. One page article with other fonancials of Boystown listed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two female Haitians,from Bush era wrote a book we hat is selling on google. I posted under the subverse of MR. WEBB that is a top subverse on pizzagate. This book CONNECTS that Haitian deportees have children that are even deperated from parents, relatives, siblings and sent to VIRGINIA, NY, BOYSTOWNS all over USA and more. Pg: 215 of the book. The ten pages that you can read for free on Google HAVE much necessary data. I cannot stress to read this book and Charles or tel website and archive.
           </p>
           <p>
            I cannot stress to look up boystown website and carefully read. They have 12 locations in USA. Va, Dc, Florida, Texas, NY and other COASTal areas, as well as Nebraska. In their website, you can see they go to hundreds of communities to do Community Health Assessments. They also have TWO research hospitals, and see all board and directors on their websites. Boystown is also abroad, in fosters to the research hospitals, India and more
 Simply google India, Boystown and mass shows up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wikipedia Boystown for more links. Wikipedia the nuns organization via Ireland cases to see how they expands worldwide, and to USA. Instead of being shut down, both have expanded into public health care, medical research, refugees, deportees, Mass countries, adopt, fosters, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Key word, used a lot in victims book is SPONSOR families and GROUP FOSTER HOMES (BOYSTOWN). Boystown is also.in Texas, not far from ranch ( scaloa) and not far from victim advocate Budddy, whose home is near abandoned Walmart.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please read my posts under Webb for more details. I'm chasing more infrastructure leads of the webbed networks and their multi industry infrastructures, and have to keep.on a expanded comprehensive vibe, as further digging into specified details too much, takes my comprehensive intuitive vibe off. Ones good at tech, specs, archive, dig deeper on each lead on every name, phrase, etc are needed. Each area is a piece of the puzzle.
           </p>
           <p>
            The victims book, "let Haiti live, unjust us policies on their oldest neighbor, also gives a lot more leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Asylum seekers sent to Guatoma, then routed to Australia, Venezuela, Gustamaloa.
Each Dif type of refugee is ROUTED by Dif DESigned SPECS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Male and female families seperated. Ages, separated. From motels to Dif intake areas. Krane Service Processing, Broward High Security Prison, Boystown in s Miami and more.
Even each motel is key. It is Maas money that motels get from govt. Notice motels all over have Maas USA welfare and out of prison people. Instead of hosing, govt pays WAY HIGH day, week, monthly fees. These motel.owners ( usually asian)/India/Arab) are making millions for these slum motels.
           </p>
           <p>
            In their book, the very deplorable conditions and federal cade 2002, abuses and discriminations are detailed. Even if sent to motel, can't use phones to call relatives or foia lawyers for their case. Can't even get food brought to them, only can wear flip flops given to them and clothes, kids can't even play outside. A motel prison!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Destabilize areas to poverty, war, unsanitary, refugees, dasylum type dangers. Illuminati initiate ( all over Facebook, blogs, uribe to the poor) into child sell, oehan, drug push, other crimes.Build industry parks. ( Monica went to Haiti to look at the Clinton industry park.). Create in group and tribal warfare and hates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Four ROUTE route by secuon of groups. EVEN in the Let Haiti Live book by the victims, a MIAMI area dentist is used to say which boys are minors or not. The older minors are not wanted by boys town, and are sent to Krone, brevard jail, guatamo, research hospitals. Ones are left sick and untreated as packed in jail cells, motel rooms, even elderly AND pregnant, look me cattle industry abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            The book highlights various s entities that intervened and did research, yet might be bad guy  players by now. Miami commissioner board ( Rubio is on that), Women's Rights Group for Refugees. Have been quite a number of federal and appellate cases, and Bush ACTS,  where bush denies fed court proceedings.
           </p>
           <p>
            This book shows HOW many ate involved from bottom to top  in mass govt and corporate contract jobs. Krone, on Facebook, you can find victims of this ongoing. Ecuador people are now having a lot of this, protesting and everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            ICE, dhs, CPs, aalyum interview guards in USA and Guatom and SO many more contracted players.
           </p>
           <p>
            Antone live in south Florida to film things and interview refugee/ deportees at all types of locations and relatives. The relatives are blocked from communicating, and are sent the ratmaze of govt corp calls, attorneys, courts. Mass lawyers are listed on Krone on Facebook, that might be interviewed.

             I cannot stress, all is a route people to various govt corp industries.
I bet Bosnia, Sudan, and Allepo were done to destabilize and route life to different govt and corp sectors. As we were asleep, even bones, blood, organs have been HUGE multi govt multicorp.industries and RESEARCH area in USA and worldwide. I have posted sites on other comments this last week. Even calcium CA bone waste is huge in research for bio- diesal fuels. Www.science direct.com has many researches listed. China, Malaysia, USA, universities. Way more sites of research catalogued. Retsch website even says human bone milled for medical appendages. Retsh is a German company in existence, also.in Nazi times. ( paperclip scientists).
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember Podesta email of a dinner ( maybe in Cali) of discussions on emails of who will bring the meat grinder?/ As IF that is normal dinner plan talks. Go to meat grinder cos and see how even bone mills and bone paste mills are huge products and even portable.
            </p>
            <p>
             Really think that after all the pedo bones found in different cases, they'd bury bones vs make a multi industry marketfir bones? Even animal shelters send the animal dead bodies to multi industries, including North Caoliners, Mr. Houser, and his huge corporation, WWW.Carolina biological supply.co. Dead bodies sell $92 and up, more for pregnant, average adopt price is only $40. Houser like IBM and retsch, connect to holocaust times of research, industries and profit.
            </p>
            <p>
             The more you trace the animal industry models, even labs, shelters, and INDUSTRY research of BONES ( used in pharmaceuticals as a filler, bio- diesal research, chemical cos, food products and more), prison/ Juvie/ social welfare/ CP's/ publication healthcare esp bush to.Obamacare AND us-aid ( us- aid is ALL over wikileaks from Clinton, podesta, dignitary cables),/...the more you can see the multi family infrastructural corp and govt infrastructures and network and multi industries of everything. The new money industries.
            </p>
            <p>
             A must read, the 67 page report that someone sent to Podesta on Podesta and Obama Climate Energy Resource front fraud, done by a top attorney. He also wrote a book, on Simon Schuster, and is on Twitter. Charles ____. You can find by easy google and wikileaks search.
            </p>
            <p>
             A must read to see the climate energy frauds as fronts, but also use with Geote Is website of his four yr investigation on Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both, utilized govt corp conttact and every law, contract mandate of govts at all levels in USA to abroad and every filing done at any govt level.in.USA and abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why do you think that Trump is already digging into the Federal Contract Aquiditiin Handbook? Go to politico article, Dec 22, 2016, $Trumps $440 billion weapon.," I cannot stress, must read and learn all the public health laws, contract laws, and access every filings, victims visit later and such; just like this attorney and George did. The govt elirescabs just LOVE LOVE LOVE that both public and victims do not study these pertinent, nor DOCUMENT any level of govt, corp, Npo staff that violate!!
            </p>
            <p>
             You CANNOT even get investigations going, nor court cases done as will be both thrown out and criminals merely just plead the fifth, like Rick Scott did in that huge Medicaid Medicare hospital scandal!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump will take us more seriouy, if we are documenting all the violations of the state and fed laws and state fed corp violations of GOVT CONTRACTS!!! THATS why politucle article and mass more, DNC, Soros, NY Schneider man are attackingTrump at every level.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not EVEN for the ongoing Veteran Scandal, nor with Bernie Sanders, head of committee; has the FEDERAL Contract AQUISYION handbook and fed law fed corp contract violations been brought up. There is NO winningcases or stopping root corruption without busying these severe federal vilstions, also done on YOUR TAX DOLLARS.
            </p>
            <p>
             ASIDE: IRELAND, IRA, 29 killed in fire, farmers and more find buried weapon stocks, are killed, jailed , abused, threatened.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Ireland. Couple is arrested and routed down mental for reporting a rich, male neighbor that solicited their son for sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             All over: Local females raped, citizens not allowed to speak.up about migrants/ refugees. Projects are unsafe even for EMTs to go too. Sudan organ trade, blackmarkets, and India, Malaysia, China, other African countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Surprised more not look into Logisticare, Providence, Igneus corp. Providence owns both, is ON Obamacare contract. Providence on contract is main corp, mass umbrellas of Providence. EVEN, Florida FBI has a investigation on the fl providence one and director who is listed as on the Obama providence one. Fbi found fraud stocks, shell corps in brazil and the island of Guerne (Sp?) right next to Jersey island that connects quuen and saville major pedo death cases. The female journalist was banned from england for two years, as many others exposing, same events as in Franklin case. Obamacare connects, as is the medicaid medicare public healthcare component. DBi anon was assigned to Clinton foundation, not Obamacare. They most certainly connect, as does bush, as does us- aid, as does multicorps on govt contracts and myulti industries, as does events wiwhen bill was president, as does ever rich and expanded boystown and the nuns group run under the pope!!!

              Also, guarantee corps like Ingredion involved. Fbi annon repeated sibsahara, and CONFERENCES. LOOK at Africa 2009 food summit. Just like bio- diesal includes BONES,Ca, calcium waste; bio material food, ALSO can include ANYTHING..hint hint.
             </p>
             <p>
              You really think elitescabs will not make emerging marlet industries out of anything and everything they can? Yah right.
             </p>
             <p>
              They already have, even with bones, blood, organs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look up how even gas, solar, wind, etc alternative energy corps have court cases with Obama and epa as middleman; as Obama broke his promises to them!! He let those industries die, stocks fall, mass regulations that were not cost effective. Yet, bio- diseals ( bone included), the industry corp govtvresesrch and grants and universities are THRIVING. HINT HINT. Why you think Trump is trying to bring Exxon exec on his team, and DNC is doing all they can to stop it, trying to force tax returns. How ironic, as Clinton foundation, redcross, boystown, nun corp Npo,  and more are allowed to get away with any and everything, AND Obamacare, just like with Bush, medicare/medicaid.
             </p>
             <p>
              Which bring me full circle to Obama Foundation, that clearly needs digging. And do a comparative analysis of these two things: Schneiderman and DNC on Trump Foundation investigations at full throttle on OUR tax dollars and public time, causing even Eric trump to not be allowed to cont to get cancer donations. And Trump as a trademark brand of products, AS Obama sold his trademarked, Obama products from whitehouse and distributors for EIGHT YEARS, and Noone said anything of these two huge conflicts of interest?
             </p>
             <p>
              Aside: Sort s Universisl Commercial Code: Noone has noticed that America was founded on home / farm Biz and most USA does not allow Home box ( mix use) AND county/ state/federal home loans, application, clearly state no home Biz operations, even for veterans or rural homes in buttphrick?/Home business WAS millions of jobs. Look up how black Biz, like barbershops and more, the last shut down by stadiums. Orlando, Miami are one of thousands, that easy google search will show the articles, and how cops and code enforcement storm in. Also, many white grandfathered bizes, lose business via same way, and organic farming in aggro procedures. Aside, how many holistic DTS are ending up strangely dead.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have some victims of the CP's and public healthcare frauds, including in nemt fraud illegal block medical is depopulate, including all ages and infants. ( Dc and Texas infant mortality has made news. Nih, CDC, center rare disease, Harvard school public health has finally had to label it in 2014, publicly as major health disparity/ hralrhcrisis). Once base of all structures done, various victim incidences with the systems can be laced in. They do not want to post on bout. Any that can help me each vr, type their info, and ones that can record, video, but not use their face name, voice and protect sources are needed. Many other victims I have found yo contact, and digging up, we will find more, and need to archive and contact. Yet, ones that protect sources and do not retraumatize are needed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Native, indigenous, on reservations is huge area, also. Mass data, all over internet with CP's stealing kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              Poverty, destabilize to welfare, routing, profit jobs and industries In govt, corps, npos are clearly systemic habit utilized and infrastructures. Documenting any doing violations of govt contract, laws, filing, recorded is KEY.

            It lists a mental health and drug rehab clinic at 124 Amherst street, the site of businesses we investigated earlier this week, directly tired to Tony P. This is a business i hadn't found yet, but add it to the list!

            I wonder if we could start a fund to pull the detailed credit reports for these companies?  I think $800 or so would fund full investigation of at least five of these companies.  It is public information!

             Not a bad idea. Again, someone would have to put their name out there on a fundme and the people donating would also.

              Or fund it through Bitcoin/Ethereum and convert to cash to wash it.  I would suggest a moderator of pizza gate aggregate the funds.  In my opinion this thread deserves some funding...this is all way too coincidental.

               Okay, does anyone else feel strongly this should be funded? If so what specifically should? The business records of Gusifer? Should that be the focus? Or should Friday's Child be included?

            For what it's worth, this could have been a one stop shop.  Many adoption agencies also contract with behavioral health agencies and CPS does the same.  Parents who are adopting need to attend training classes and usually put in 30 hrs. which could have been provided by one of these businesses.  On the other side of the coin they also benefit financially by providing parenting classes if the parents are at risk of losing their child who is in foster care.  So classes are provided to both the prospective adopters and to the bio parents.  Bio parents are also required to take psychological evaluations to be presented at their court hearing along with periodic drug testing.   More often than not these mandated classes for bio parents are just a huge scam to run the clock to the 12 month mark and cover the state's butt for the federal requirement which mandates that the state made reasonable efforts to keep the family intact.  The psychologist's office in this complex could have been providing these services to the adopters and or the  bio parents.

             That's exactly what I was thinking. Especially since two of these "unrelated" businesses were registered on the exact same day. Really? Another coincidence? Doubtful.

            Information from Reddit user:
           </p>
           <p>
            This is serious. I just looked up the business registration of Gusifer, LLC.
Gusifer, LLC has more than 2 known addresses in Winchester VA. The both look residential.. They're both in proximity to almost 30 pizza restaurants. One of them is called 'Italian Touch' The registering agent of Gusifer has over 2 decades of off shoring experience.. I suspect closely related to Haiti. Not sure, I'm still digging. Gonna deep dive through Frederick County records, trying to find an association. Will report back.

             Another good comment:
            </p>
            <p>
             I was talking about Venus in this thread, but check this out, the etymology(origin) of the word Friday:
"Old English Frīgedæg ‘day of Frigga,’ named after the Germanic goddess Frigga, wife of the supreme god Odin and goddess of married love; translation of late Latin Veneris dies ‘day of Venus,’ Frigga being equated with the Roman goddess of love, Venus. Compare with Dutch vrijdag and German Freitag"
But in this context it means either Child Love, Or Loving a Child. The only thing that makes it suspect is that instead of calling it one thing they hide it behind symbolism calling it 'Fridays Child'. So if their hiding the meaning they are hiding something else, imo.

            I think pizzagate is actually a giant organized child "adoption" racket. It is done through the players we all know about and babies are traded like art and other valuables.
           </p>
           <p>
            Traffickers advertise on instagram
           </p>
           <p>
            They meet potential clients at public places like pizza restaurants and elsewhere to "test" them and make them commit a low level crime to prove they are not law enforcement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the new "members" are "in" the club. With some type of username/password to access the network.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's my contribution to this thread: The full list of child adoption agencies that include "SFI Adoption" that the OP references. I think these are good ones to investigate and connect the dots for the network of paid child "adoption" services (aka trafficking?), mostly through Russia.

            Would also explain why James Alefantis became so powerful in DC. He's providing a service to gay men and women who want to buy babies on the black market since the old way in Russia was cut down so much.
           </p>
           <p>
            The new "parents" are vetted at JA's restaurants and art events, then pay for babies through buying some crap art for an outrageous amount and these agencies in VA then certify the health and adoption records illegally for a fee to give the adoption a clean paper trail. It all makes sense now in this context.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that Tony Podesta is connected here is a HUGE smoking gun.

             you're saying that the relation here is the SCC, the state corporate number for medic, inc, is the same as teh SN, the record number on the FBODaily site.  I don't see the connection.  is the record number tied to the vendor number, or is it arbitrary?  a quick look at the four listings today suggests that it's arbitrary, and really means nothing.

              Hey. The for fixing typos.
Could be arbitrary. Buy is a very rare coincidence.
And fact, so nearby, too.
I saw in dailypress that port of VA volume is up 10 % and 29 tons container TEUas up 8 % exec director, Reinhardt fellow.
             </p>
             <p>
              This could be no connection, not even correct ports; but the toaa ship does sail coast down to Caribbean that has that fed number. A govt ship would have it easier to transport cargo, on down low.
             </p>
             <p>
              If no connection between either group, dead end; but as they are so connected on areas, if a connection, would be lucrative.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, Patty has a state bill number, but needs a fed one, too. 
But, don't want to bark anyone up wrong tree, but it is odd. Sorry, not clarify)))

               well - do this - go to the FOB daily site, pick the first five rfqs you find, and log the SN numbers - then go to open corporates and see if they all correspond to companies who look like they could fulfill the orders.

                 Point is that those sn strings only mean something to the fobdaily index,  i think, and have nothing to do with the original rfq...it's just a string.

                  Yes, I'm going to see if connections, but you could be very correct.
I do think that a ship under a different role, could be an easy front. I could be so wrong, but esp after reading the Haitian report/book, really wondering)) I upvoted you, so you know that I def am open to arbitrary. )) and appreciate your input/ looking into..))

            It's fine, right? You come here and you'll find lots of people who think the same way you do. If I bring up the subject and someone gives me resistance, I let it go. I don't even try to convince anyone or anything. Hopefully, through our efforts, we'll either find something, or have a "legitimate" news outlet pick this up and investigate. I keep reminding myself that this is about the children.

            Cont from my last comment on their med code state license SCC number. Three addresses are on it, a po box, amhurst and a Glenn cove...you google SCC number, Virginia and their medical electronic SCC forms come up on first page search. See my comment prior, for direct related data on SCC filing.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, someone found that some filing is under Glenn, yet this state SCC code is under patty and last review with system was due 8/31/2016 but can't find this years..This is the state ( not federal) filing to bill under medicare and medicaid. Each biz requires county licensing, too.

             Yes, I saw the different addresses. Not sure what's going on with that. It could be innocent, in that, she's claiming she works at home on this "business" whatever this "business" is.

              Except, wikileaks states she lives on farm, rural and Glenn Cove, cove is usually suburban type address. But yah, who knows, but most time, medical types never use home address, even for patient safety issues ( esp psych)..Glenn cove is that a home or warehouse, ship port..going try to look..

              Wikipedia the Nancy foster foaa ship that has ability to launch remotely operated vehicles, goes on coast of USA to carribean. I find it odd that patty SCC med bill number is same fed number of govt. Maybe a odd coincidence, but foaa Nancy foster ship, leaves from Charleston sc, a lot and odd match of fed and state license numbers. 
My other comments have more info on this subverse. A navy ship now under foaa, hold mass weight, can.launch remote vehicles would be perfect front to ship in kids.

                Have to see if any connection between those two govt ladies in foaa/atmospheric and patty crew..I could have wrong lead, but its odd, and Patty or Glenn need fed corp and fed medi bill numbers, also. The SCC is her state one. Local biz numbers, too.

                  Under Patty...
There are filings of things under Glenn, with Patty listed as secretary; but often Gusifer Llc not in the filing.
Some things under just Patty.
And I'm finding some of Glen numbers to be same or different filing numbers.
I wrote numbers I'm finding on the subverse here. 
Right now, digging under Glenn. Sorry, it's such a maze..)) Do you know if VOUT allows pic upload from cell phone, for I can't find that option, and the pics would let you see, vs me writing it out))

                  Also saw 120 and 124 Amherst are for sale on Coldwellbankerhomes.com since July 2016.

                  Oh, forgot to tell you. I'm down loading these over 200 page, Virginia OIG for Child Welfare Yearly Reports; and you were asking about some statistics on children. Stats of various things are in these reports, that you might be interested in, even mortality rates/supposed mortality reasons, etc...

            That's what I'm thinking. There's something here. We just have to connect the pieces. Goddamn mainstream news for not being interested.

            I did find another property associated with Gusifer. It was just sold so I'm not sure if they sold it or bought it. I'm thinking sold it? This one. Didn't archive it because it's on multiple real estate listings. Could this be it?

            Operationally, it's clear to me that 3/4/5 are all one unit, and 6/7/8/9 appear to be as well.  11/12/13 also appear to be a single group.
           </p>
           <p>
            10 and 14 are odd men out - I only found David Adams Counseling through google maps:

            note in the above image that google still thinks that friday's child adoption agency is in this building, while all of the filings which may have previously indicated this association have been purged - this is a definite link between the two, if there had been any doubt.
           </p>
           <p>
            and while 14 has an entry in bizapedia, it's not easily corroborated by opencorporates.  interesting to note the registered agent on the bizapedia page though, is Fhc Engineering.  That, I found:

             Great work. The thing is, if these were normal businesses they wouldn't be so hard to find and keep track of. It's not how legitimate businesses do things. And the Tavistock link is pretty shocking. I don't know why I'm surprised, but I am. I did find something about one of businesses PC Enterprises. I guess I'll add it to the original thread. This way all the info is consolidated in one place. Thanks for this!

              well, it's a weak link, and just because it's the name of the road, it doesn't really mean anything (yet) but it was strange to see it pop up.

              get this though - it's part of a private neighborhood called tavistock estates, and if you want to catch google's street view of it, here's the best they can do:

             </p>
             <p>
              it's just down that road to the right.
             </p>
             <p>
              there are two houses for sale in the neighborhood right now:

             <p>
              both were updated this morning, apparently.
             </p>
             <p>
              FHC engineering is associated with Alan Johnston (in the corp link above) and then the 410 Tavistock address is further associated with Shenandoah Home, Incorporated / Paul Rudolph (

               http://archive.is/frcjO)

              ) but that shows an incorporated date of 1977, so i don't expect that it's related.

                so - zillow says the house was sold once, in 2003.  rudolph had it first, i'm sure, sold it to Johnston in '03, and then FHC was formed in '04.

                now the question is why is an engineering firm the registered agent for a counseling group?

            It is. Instead of looking out for the best interests of the child, they turn it into a money-making, get-rich-quick scheme. No telling what criteria they're using, but I doubt they let couples that can't pay the exorbitant fee adopt.

            All of your post is based on words like "possible' and "might be." In other words, you are spreading fake news. Mods, flag this post as we discussed. Mr. Obama is clamping down on you tin foil hatters spreading lies. The next step will be lawsuits and charges against people spreading libel and lies in order to further whatever hair brain theory you think up. Pizzagate is fake news. Grow up. Go back to watching your Scooby Doo shows and pretending that you are a real detective instead of a tin foil hatter living in your parents' basement. Haw haw haw. Pizzagate is false. Chelsea 2020!

             Nothing is fake and we're investigating the businesses that are registered. Are you telling me that everything you see in the WaPo is accurate? They're the ones that should be held accountable for spreading propaganda. This is a forum devoted to investigating Pizzagate, and that's what everyone is doing. You should be more concerned about what adults are doing in a pool with underage children they're not related to and further why they find it entertainment.

            There's that poem that goes something like: "Tuesday's child is full of grace...Friday's Child is loving and giving.." We know that "loving and giving" means something else entirely to these pedo criminals.

            I remember reading early on about an adoption agency in Utah with ties to a couple that worked on the Clinton campaign who had adopted a child, but the real father of the child was disputing the adoption. I will try to find the article again, but it sounded like the agency was scamming adoptive parents out of money and then giving the babies to other "parents". Definitely shady stuff. I think we're going to see a lot about adoption agency pedo ring activity soon.

              There is sooo much to look into, we'll all be researching for months. I remembered the name of the Utah agency this morning: Heart to Heart in Sandy, UT. Their website has the heart within a heart logo (from the known pedo symbols list):

               I know! There's so much here that it's ridiculous and overwhelming. Thanks for helping to look into this. It's massive. The thing about Gusifer is that because of the hacker, it's very difficult to only bring things up about the business. There are fifty million articles that come up about the emails which further obscures things. But Gusifer has supposedly been around for eleven years and the business has left no footprint? How is this possible? I'm trying to come up with a unique way to search for it. I found out something about her other business and maybe it'll trigger something if I post that. I keep adding to the original post so people can see what's been uncovered so we don't keep reinventing the wheel. Thanks again, I'll look through this. Definitely.

            Bear in mind, assume that every piece of evidence presented here is read by fixers involved in this operation. When we shake the right branch, the fixers will most definitely be in contact with any individuals on said branch in order to advise on changes in standard operating procedures.

             I totally agree. It's usually a couple of days before posts appear debunking or floating a theory that covers/explains a new breakthrough. I notice that the pizzagaters on this site just let these shill posts fall right through and disappear. Yeah!!!

            Oh oh, John W Truban! He's also registered at the 124 Amherst St in Winchester, for a company called Physician Business Solutions, and he is also a lawyer, with a practice not far from the Amherst building. I put the links in another comment on this thread somewhere. So I think we should assume all these people are working together. This is not just a case of separate companies having offices in the same building.

             it's worth noting that John W Truban is the registered agent for hundreds of VA corps.  I don't doubt that he's associated with this little cluster, but take a look through some of his other clients.  he is the agent for the winchester county bar association.
            </p>
            <p>
             i've asked it before, do lawyers who act as registered agents have a duty to vet the company they represent, or are they just rubber-stampers, for the most part?  what happens to a registered agent in the case of a lawsuit or criminal finding?
            </p>
            <p>
             (for reference, i asked this when looking through the andrew jon kline connections - he also represents his local bar association)

              Good point - these people who are registered agents for everyone are so annoying and really get in the way of finding out stuff.

            Hi. Yes, they have ability to control, make medical records to some degree. If all children are receiving medical care through the typical public health care systems ( medicaid, medicare if disabled or a disease/ condition). Once medical records are in the system, they are very hard for adults to amend. They only let you add addendum notes, and important to see the medical notes by drs and nurses, for they often, are not correct, can delay care, even less to wrongful mental route, drug accusations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drs often look and give credence to the Dr notes, over everything. Yet, are all kids getting medical, and if they are, are those offices just running it like a village clinic, and are stocked up on supplies like vaccines and not keeping records.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The unhealthy pizzas" always stands out to me. Yet, also, there must be some habitual medical concern of kids with aids, other diseases; unless they go to clients with aids, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            One found that a bunch of the missing kids, esp.in VA area, had no pics. Yet, its quite standard at schools and even a visit yo DTS, dentist that they take a picture, esp if benefiary on public health care as part of intake and state ward kids are also supposed to be put through the lengthynintake, upon arrival.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet, are similar aged kids, gender being double billed in the billing, or something like that. If you look at the monthly CMS bill statements that are mailed, the over billing, upcoding, added billing are very often.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those letters and all the govt websites for healthcare, state to report fraud. When you call, they don't act pleased or helpful, try to route ones to Shine ( Medicare) or to other Dept's.
           </p>
           <p>
            They do not come and help. The recipient, even blind or can't drive is supposed to photocopy and cert mail in, marking what is wrong. Fraud is so easy with Bush and Obamacare.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at Rick Scott, Texas, and he pleaded the fifth like 75 times and is governor of FL now; doing the same and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            With any medicaid HMOs that kids are on or if on stare, straight/open/Sspn special needs; either the directors and other high staff ofvesch dept, state governors, HMO board directors can often be found to be on boards of hospitals, nursing homes, institutions, drug rehab, juvie centers, etc. ( conflict of interest but govt always ignores).
           </p>
           <p>
            Might be able to find out what HMOs that these offices use the most, for they have to literally sign up with HMO they want to work with, including the state options.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drs listed on Dr sites,boften say what insurance they take, or calks to the office can be answers by front secretary or billing Dept. Its typical for a patient or parent to call and see if they take their insurance, prior to appt.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, say at the hospital.institution that Patty's (husband?), the psych is affiliated with; its standard that a hospital institution, refers their in patients to thecdrbor psych that takes their insurance, if have insurance, and by public health law must ,( yet, no public health laws are ever the habit, but..
           </p>
           <p>
            Finding the HMOs he works with, can then search the boards of those hmos or dept directors and such and see what other corp connections there are...
           </p>
           <p>
            And, do any of those bigger ones, or parent corps, connect to Clinton foundation?/As it is public health care, already connects to Mr Big O.
           </p>
           <p>
            From there, whstborher govtbprograms, corps, non profits, religious affiliations in area, USA, Haiti, Africa, etc..connect..how are more children brought in for it clear the typical , historical way to get lost kids through stare ward and orphans are not enough resource of bodies/ kids? And why is demand higher?/
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, as NY good at Wall street, sticks and bonds, tracings?/That is, is all Iveverote, there is a blueprint infrastructure and follow the money and connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            Knowing such, how can it be caught,? Or can it, and safely?
           </p>
           <p>
            Where are kids kept, even standard norm adoption ones? Warehouses around, wards of institutions, basements, false adoptions?
           </p>
           <p>
            The one psych, with family in title, shows a high, brick building and basement level windows. The area buildings, etc, are interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            What drivevroutes to DC and in white vans? Findervkids were known to be at a DC warehouse and a farm. Are they still involved in any way?
           </p>
           <p>
            What addresses, phones, website, mailing address listed for any Dr, nurse, psych, counselor on state medical license web? Same as that office, and by law must be accurate and up to date.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any complaints by peers in medical, whistleblower? There is that infamous female whistleblower for govt big corp in DC, cases or attempts could be on web.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes, decent ones notice things and say something? Any Dr , psych, adiotibe agency, social worker area deaths in last eight or so years?
           </p>
           <p>
            Where would laundry be sent out to, if not on site?
           </p>

             Great suggestions here. The HMO's, yes, find out which ones they use and who's running it. Might give us more of a sense of who's in on this. Thanks for taking the time to write all this out. Tons of good info and ways to dig into this.

             Good observation. Sfi Adoption and Gusifer alone bring up all sorts of weird listings. Especially Gusifer. It's like it doesn't exist, but it does and had office space. Not sure why it doesn't have its own footprint on the web. The only thing that usually doesn't, are things that are deliberately being hidden and suppressed.

            Many adoption agencies do both, they are contracted with the state for foster care children and also do private adoptions.  When doing a private adoption the adoptive parents do pay and the rates vary from 20k-40k depending on the gender and ethnic background if adopting within the US.  Blond haired blue eyed babies are more costly than babies who are not Caucasian.  You can find that right on many of the adoption pages.   When using the same agency and adopting through foster care the adoption is virtually free.  There are sometimes fees up to 2k but normally they are reimbursed.

             It's what we need to know. The way I read this is that these businesses were connected. There was everything in one spot for a seamless adoption. Even a medical records service that can dig into histories, blood type, etc., if need be. One of the things that needs to be looked at is if there's an umbrella company that legally connects them. Or are there counterparts in different states. I just found out through the Virginia Dept of Social Services that Friday's Child is listed at a different address than Amherst, but that may have to do with them moving out of the building. And why they had SFI and Friday's Child isn't really explained either, but VA Social Services does say that Friday's Child is International. Maybe it used to be domestic and now is taking over the int'l adoptions from the canceled Sfi? We have too many questions and need to resolve this. The main thing is that for a business service to be this shadowy it's crazy ridiculous. Even if you specialize, you need to advertise .... somewhere.

            Just to let you all know, I'm updating the original post as I find relevant information. Just found a different address listed for Friday's Child Adoption Services through the Virginia Dept. of Social Services so I've tacked it on: The new address is: New address: Friday's Child Adoption Services, Inc. 90 Whitewood Road Suite 4 CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22901 (703) 200-9099
           </p>

            If we consider all the 8 businesses at this one address, and what they appear to offer, are they not a complete network of what one would need to navigate the adoption/foster care system, legitimately or otherwise? From what I could tell the businesses in the building can provide you with medical professionals, adoption agencies, access to medical data, ability to issue insurance claims, counseling services and an "Institute" where clients could be examined, treated, temporarily housed. Whether any of the businesses are active might be irrelevant. Only one of them (say the "PhD" or counselor) needs to snare the referral and then the PhD in turn can make sure that all the client's subsequent referrals are kept "in the building" so to speak and thereby "disappear" a client out of the Child Protective Services network (or the gov't may be working with this Podesta Virginia ring - I don't dismiss anything).
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know what agencies, medical and legal professionals are needed to navigate through the adoption system so I'd love to hear from those who do in order to decide whether this is worth pursuing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Roughly, here's what I am guessing each of the eight provides or claims to provide:

           <p>
            Patti Paule-Carres (the Podesta cousin) is the name on record for filing for incorporation for a lot of these businesses.
Interesting to note that "Paule-Carres, Phd" and "Shenandoah Family Institute" both filed for incorporation on May 10, 1982

             Nice. Very methodical approach. I don't know what some of these services do either, but isn't that in itself kind of suspicious? When I did the original search for Gusifer, I used keywords that would be expected, namely, Paule-Carres Gusifer LLC. Pretty straightforward and yet nothing came up. NOTHING. Why? Why file for a business service if you don't have a website, aren't listing what you're doing and aren't promoting it. What is the knock three times on the door and only if you know the secret password, we'll let you in? It just seems so bizarre. It was only when I decided to not take no for an answer that I found the stupid business and it wasn't at the home as the registration claimed, but in a building with 7 other business services. Oh, that's the other thing. They were paying for office space and still not advertising it? I'm telling you, for me, this is more than weird. It's as weird as pool time with underage kids, especially when they share building space with international adoption agencies. I almost feel like we should start splitting these businesses up and devote one person to each. If no one is getting anywhere, we'll switch people. This way we can approach these businesses in different ways.

            I would be willing to bet money the guys on the plane that verbally attacked Ivanka got a baby this way....seems they would fit into this scenerio well...just my opinion though, just seems to never end for sure!

             They should be made to pay for Ivanka security and flight now. I would have loved to meet her on a flight, and ask if she had any time to hear citizen issues of corruption, to have trump allow citizen boards, and reinstate home biz RTS across USA in non suburb areas and more.

             These outbursts and defense mechanisms, really are similar to crank metg addicts that are coming down or fearing they won't get their next addictive FIX.
            </p>
            <p>
             AND then the lower class libs that state USA will go down, have they looked at their slum conditions or all the violent crimes that are daily all over, no jobs, crap jobs, etc?/

           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Which begs the question why is someone who specializes in cancer care, stroke care, stress management linked with an adoption site?
           </p>
           <p>
            On another page it states: Daniel Petruso provides Support, In Home Care, Activities to it's customers.

            I searched sfiadopt.org which is listed on the first link above and associated with Daniel Petruso and came up with this:
           </p>
           <p>

            Now the above states It's a Friday's Child Adoption Service and the phone number is 540- 664-6272  and the phone number for his office for stress management etc. is 540- 667-6272.   (The phone number is only 1 number off)

           </p>
           <p>
            It's my understanding that ACSW is a person who has a master's degree in clinical social work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not sure how any of this fits together as he seems to be a jack of all trades with social work, specializing in various ailments, diseases and appears to have a hand in the international adoption market if I'm reading this all correctly.

             archive.org has a few captures of the sfiadopt.org and sfiadopt.us pages - it's worth noting that the images of children used on the early pages match what's on the fridayschild.org pages now - and a quick google search indicates that these are unique to the site, erasing any question that it's the same organization.

             Excellent cybersleuthing!!! This is great and Daniel Petruso moves up to the top of list of people we need to investigate. He's in cancer care, home care, and international adoptions? It makes no sense except that all are lucrative. Sort of reminds me of a JA type in that JA was doing all these things outside the parameters of a restauranteur. Definitely need to dig, dig, dig on this guy, but this is a great start.

            There doesn't have to necessarily be children being adopted OUT of that place, but rather a place that connects people with slaves and creates the falsified adoption paperwork/ID cards ect. I swear, any time I see psychiatrists closely associated w these people I'm thinking mind control and certainly nothing benevolent involving those "adopted" children. 
Most people are walking around this world believing evil comes in the form of people like Jeffrey Dahmer or ISIS, yet the truth is there apparently are a bunch of well connected "normal" people who have depths of depravity only seen by most of us in movies like Hostel.

             I agree. And even a few legit adoptions, creates the FRONT. Black markets are always about fronts. Mafia was always about fronts, from USA or any other country.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, psychs know which ones from vulnerable populations are vulnerable. Major power tyranny, a Dr or psych has over patients and can abuse. The AMA, APA, ACA Codes of Conducts and Ethics on all three, clearly specify and repeat that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can take advantage of vulnerability and know all factors of it, can mental route and psychotropic dose/control/ restraint, drug addict vulnerabilities, family spousee abuse vulnerabilities, poverty vulnerabilies, homeless or crime vulnerabilities, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Control over writing diagnoses and the medical Noyes that drs as a habit, look at first and use, over a patients voice. That has dangerously delayed care and routed patients down mental, a lot with females having heart/stroke attacks. Even is brought up in past by the American Heart and Stroke Associations as anxiety is a symptom more often in females.
            </p>
            <p>
             Has full control of patients fighting for kid custody, for whatever he writes the medical and govt will abide to, as if he is god.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gas access to all medical records. If they look for certain bloodtypes (rh-(, diseases for their "research, he will know and can route them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can over bull, upcode, fraud bill for services not done if the obamacare coding is done well by a good " accountant/wife."
            </p>
            <p>
             Can access their other medical records, criminal, anything, by forge signatures, or have patients unknowingly sign for that on blank forms. I've seen that a lot, even with fed funded Disability Rights in each state, which Disability Rights is a DIRECT arm to DEP.
            </p>
            <p>
             DEP and OIG are supposed to help and protect beneficiary systems, as is Disability Rights. They easy can cover tracks, cover up complaints, know who complained. Was the DEP guy that like a Picture on tweet, found if further connections? DEP and oig go hand in hand to oversight, investigate, charge crimes and violations, protect victims. Disability Rights in each state is their "intake" center. No one ever gets helped by DR, but many have signed the blank consent forms, and have been refused to hand in the release forms if fill them out with what records can be requested.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've seen some leads that serials are often not arrested, but utilized. I found a site, by one, that has a lot of awful.pics and mentions Obama, Clinton, Spielberg, a navy ship, Mckaine and has pics. ( don't know what to think about it, but he also has a YouTube channel and is with high govt officials on the navy ship in sea and doing high tech flight experiments. He calks the navy boat, the hospital).
            </p>
            <p>
             Another lead on serials not arrested, are many in Instagram under satanic/Lucifer that post pics of mass animals and human remains, which it is highly felony, illegal to posses human bones and various animal ones and such high quantity.
            </p>
            <p>
             No arrests, when so easy? I see morticians, cops, security guards, mom of NYPD cops, elite, elite that publicize themselves as satanic/Lucifer/vampires.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ones digging up #catatombs or burning #burnthebodies, #burnthebodiessavetheskulls. All across the nation. A huge one is in Miami, another in LA, and NYC. Clearly, serial killers and made a market niche biz and have tons of elite and populace followers, comments, likes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once you see so many lamps on Instagram, made of skulls and spine, you will lose your appetite for days. But parts are as is, in jars, made into other things, and alcohol tinctures of body fluids.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, I agree with all you wrote and it is a awfully top level dangerous types of people and huge networks. And anything else that can be a business or service and sold, is done.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even though some good NYPD cops, I'm sure the smart bones on this, know they can't trust all theur coworkers. Remember, somevtears back the cop that was selling dead bodies for sex?/Had them all over his laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
             Be cool if good cops, private investigators, FBI, drs, psychs, attorneys, teachers, social workers, and such would help. Many, can merely view the kids and babies and children, and then by law, must mandatecreprt on a special form that is provided for those jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Trump or some good DAs, FBI, judges had a bunch of the mandated report applications by those professionals, and CPS continue to not adhere to law and investigate each report as both welfare check/ location ofpic check--then that is solid, legal violations documented, not by just citizen calls; but by those professionals who must mandate report to keep their state license and adhere to fed laws of their job duties.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any decent psych would immediately state the children and babies in the photo must be mandate reported and are considered missing, endangered as no parents have come forward in livid anger that their kids are all over puvlic web, posted by WHO started the series of events of pedogate in DC, Mr elephantitus!/
            </p>
            <p>
             He is accountable. He chose to take and post thosebpics and let his staff and bands and "artists", do all, under the auspices of his biz that is open to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
             Changing art, the excuse? Ah, a lot of so called art was painted on the wall. He chose to be and advertise as a family friendly biz, not us.
            </p>
            <p>
             He never had his twitter on private as he and staff kept posting that creepy stuff, that even minors could see!!
            </p>
            <p>
             It is not false news the actions in series of events that he and his staff and pals did. It is not even appropriate to have a child view playboy, and they cannot buy as a minor. Sex education starts in middle school, and books, materials, words used and what taught is very strict. Teachers have been fired for going ag the strict guidelines. Movies and shows are rated from g to xxx. R and up movies cannot be sold to minors at stores and Id required. Movies are art, just like his " art," is not appropriate for children at his business establishment.
            </p>
            <p>
             A naked man in a blood bath shot on his business floor, on public twitter.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yes, I fully agree with your comment and fully think the defense mechanisms are what is to be expected from violent type criminals that fear being exposed, that also have an agenda to normalize and minimize this severe deviance, moral decay, anti life.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, a lot of effort and money and manipulating our citizen right laws and internet is being utilized by the elite. Never saw so much effort for even the new Orleans hurricane.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe we should incorporate as a "private club," like the rich always do, to keep ones out that don't follow one rule, concern for child rights and safety and attack, call false news.
            </p>
            <p>
             Private club entities, do have those privileges. It would cost only around $80 bucks to incorporate such in Delaware or another corp friendly state. Member dues, one dollar so all are able to join. Money used for resources, endeavors, equipment needed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Keep the real roaches out. The harrasment is beyond annoying, selfish, creepy and really, ag our rights, including federal Public Trust Violations. We have a right to access public figures, public health care laws, medical, children rights, missing kids, anything on our tax dollars, etc etc.

             Think about it. What does a million put up by craiglists to stop childgate mean?/ I think that it could mean and even be "interpreted" bynones as slactions way more dangerous than a fake psychop actor arriving at a pizza joint and shooting the floor. What a very strange, mafia like "deal," Mr Craigslist is openly suggesting with a million. No elite will care for a measly million, ...get it??? What if he said, I offer a million dollars to whoever stops Planned Parenthood? See what I mean.?..that would be considered a local terror incite threat by Peepee.
            </p>
            <p>
             As we dig deeper, think about this )))
            </p>
            <p>
             With all the teens prostituting on fb, insta, craigslist and the viral videos of ones street fighting by punching in the head; come on Clinton, you said female rights and when they go low, we go high; so go get on all their feeds and tell them its false news that selling their bodies for money is not the only way. Tell the headbeaters that no need to sell fight videos, your bringing jobs to the slums!/ Put your money where your mouth is. ( like Humans crotch). 
Sorry long, but really felt should state such.
And if it bothers any "types," consider this fiction. Consider me an artist.

             fyi, I remember this poem:
             <br/>
             Monday's child is fair of face,
Tuesday's child is full of grace;
Wednesday's child is full of woe,
Thursday's child has far to go;
             <strong>
              Friday's child is loving and giving,
             </strong>
             (just sayin') 
Saturday's child works hard for its living;
But the child that is born on the Sabbath day
yadda yadda...

             Good find. I've been posting on this subverse state to fed numbers found on various registrations and not all match up.
            </p>
            <p>
             And filing is not always with the llc. Some with Glenn, some with patty. Yet, if a LCC, that's supposed to be listed.
            </p>
            <p>
             And some Dr reviews for glen, say llc, and some, sole proprietorship. 
I'm wondering their county filing of business type.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some stuff say that licensing of a registry number not done or past due.

                Poverty, let kids play in yard, let kids walk alone to.park, not use psychotropics or cancer drugs, Justine Pelletier case and more.

               <p>
                Yet, not only has DC CP's, failed to welfare check all photos by pizzaguy that are reported; many kid cases to look up that CP's knew was dangerous, ignored and kid either died or found so severely beaten/starved/locked up.

             Interesting. Well, we know SFI moved out. I wonder if we can track those other businesses. See if they moved as well or were dissolved. I think they like to change names, so maybe they're in another form. We need to get a list of all these business owners to see if they started new businesses and if they're still running in the same circles.

             Someone posted a book, yesterday as a subverse on Haiti in real time reality of what its like for children, as sold as slaves daily.
            </p>
            <p>
             The book also mentioned that 31 rich families run the island. A list of those fams and any Clinton Foundation, us- aid connections could be fruitful.
            </p>
            <p>
             Read the book if you have a chance. Best one ever of the rough reality and how locals are involved in trafficking kids as property.
            </p>
            <p>
             Truly awful. Would be so easy to ship ones out.
            </p>
            <p>
             They prefer the rural kids that are not street smart. Some parents just sell. Others are lied to that food and school will be provided. School costs much money, only few kids get to go to school.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not sure why more locals do not just offer to teach the kids. I would. Books, really aren't needed, just creativity.Not sure why ones bought as slaves, do not adore the kids and let them be as family; but instead the abuse, starvation, sleep on dirt, etc. I would, gosh, to have grateful kids around that so appreciate love, food, learning, family. Book shows, not just individual mental depravity, but also the collective as the daily habitual reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             Makes it even sicker that Chelsea used those donations for her $3 million wedding to another corrupt FAM, that "plays cards."
            </p>
            <p>
             All the donations, even from the public and simply shelters could have been made, tiny homes of sheds/ship containers/yurts and such and home biz as cottage industries and little schools. I can't stress, how clear the elite, npos, govt do not have intent, but agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet, all goes on in USA, but under a different system and guise. A silent holocaust where victims are isolated, called crazy, not believed, fearful of repercussions if advocate further.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, why aren't the abjunct poverty, rural areas just turned into minihimes and small biz, so tourists would visit and economic boost?
            </p>
            <p>
             Its either the one center of Haiti or the rich hotel resorts that income streams are being created.
            </p>
            <p>
             After reading that book, my detest for the local adults that sell, rape, join the tyranny violence just appalls me.I try to keep good faith, but its just not possible for children and animals, so savagely harmed and no sacred to life is evil done by conscious choice to be savage, and is not modern human, but regression to the max, and no excuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sudan and other areas, same way. Poverty does not have to equate to no ethics, choose evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Organizing in unity to demand abroad corporations build mini homes, utilities and let a tourist market be created would allow abjunct poverty and unsanitary disease causing areas to become healthier and thriving.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its clear the elite do not have the intent, but agenda. I found the some sites that illuminati initiate, yesterday, ones in African countries; based by elite in two USA states. They have to sacrifice a blood relative and chickens, and they believe they will get rich. Tons of males, some females, are begging to join, do, and some wrote up their propoganda of joining to help convince others to join. Males are begging, putting their phone numbers down, to be initiated. So sick.
            </p>
            <p>
             One wrote about sacrificing mom, stating that she had been fond and kind to him as a child. What they will do for a hot penny, and as IF they will ever be more than ones to do dirty work and be fall guys.
            </p>
            <p>
             One posts about how he buys stolen stuff. A African female in USA, advertises she initiates to Illuminati, also and has a ritual pic. They think they are so cool. The thought of self proprietorship in ethics, is never considered, just the black markets of evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aside: Question: What IF ever a child or group was found? What to do, who to trust? I think of Harriet Tubman, undergroundRailroad.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think we need a organized effort to have Trump to let us create Citizen Boards at every level, local, state, regional, federal with equal access and status to the politicians and govt Dept's. We are many citizens that are skilled, have solutions, good intent, do care.
            </p>
            <p>
             This exclusion of citizens is a reality. Protesting on the street is not inclusion. Inclusion is able to dress up, sit at the round table and be allowed to speak and be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think a proof of this stuff, plus informed recorded calls to CP's and other Dept's that prove ones failed to adhere to their jobs requirements, laws and contract mandates should be presented to Trump, professionally by as large as a group and signatures on a petition for not just a full, broad investigation at every level and junction, fire, rehire, restructure in transparency the pedogate issue. And NOT in the bs ways that are done with past cases like Bill Clinton, when a black.is shot or dies in cases that are injustice ( some are, some not, but the promised court and investigation by county, state and dept are always a fraud and only done to appease them from rioting).
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump tweeted about black crime, yet not about elite crime and pedo. Yes, all a prib and more probs; but as its children rights and safety and on tax dollars with us so harrased and discriminated by elite, its way past federal Public Trust Violations.
            </p>
            <p>
             "To violate the trust responsibility to citizens, beneficiaries, or even students under govt funding and cause unec stress, duress, burden, impact, costs, harm, etc are Public Trust Violations. Even the election was public trust violations, incited riots, libel/slander of citizens by elite, media, political ones.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are in this reality of they control the nation and world, and its all about serving their gluttony needs. Citizens can ve the worst victims of govt corruption, and have no voice to be heard or justice. The web access is only hope, and ones still can barely be heard, if ever, no matter how much they post.
            </p>
            <p>
             He promised to clean the swamp and it cannot be, unless bottom to top, all that failed to adhere to law in this issue and any are gone and legally dealt with; and Citizen Inclusion Boards are allowed so a democracy/republic (,whatever) is allowed to be the infrastructure for pyramid schematic, clearly creates tyranny, corruption and swamp with govt and big corp.

             Oh, yes!!! Brilliant!!! The families may be adopting for different reasons other than providing a loving home. Excellent point. That also could be found on the medical records, no?

              The app contracts on Fridays Children, reveal ALOT. Adoptees must own a home, certain incomes. Is that not discriminating to good parents of low and middle class?
             </p>
             <p>
              The excessive fees for every step are discriminating, and to me, are like selling a live child. $1095 or $495 etc for an application to be reviewed, $350 for meetups,etc. This is way overinflated for social workers or psychologist hourly pay and medical processing of paperwork.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, the biggest thing. The app for No Corpeal Punishment Contract. Many might miss this, but carefully look at the legal wording. It is no corpeal punishment, UNTIL adoption is fully finalized.
             </p>
             <p>
              Corpeal punishment is specified that includes binding, store kids in small spaces, etc. What a legal.loophole in that No corpeal punishment contract!!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              You all, take a look at it when you can, MAJOR sneaked in, legal loophole!!!

             Fantastic stuff!!! I'm going to copy &amp; paste these in original post so people will know what to check for. As for governors:
            </p>
            <p>
             Terry McAuliffe  Assumed office January 11, 2014
Bob McDonnell In office January 16, 2010 – January 11, 2014 
TIM KAINE!!!!! Assumed office 2006 - 2010
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean, TIM KAINE?!!! There has to be something here. If not this, in Virginia. Why else would HRC have picked him except to reward him for a job well done.

              Ahh..another area to dig. Thx for adding this. Also, notice in Pm desta emails with Patty and crew that these four couple, go way back, even to Knox University in Illinois.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was even wondering homicide, cold cases and such in those areas. I found a female that had been missing since 80s, found in abandoned brick fire pit in that county, mass destroyed skeletal remains.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also saw that Tony Podesta, quite connected to Norman Lear ( Hollywood corps/coca cola/politics) that direct connects to Rob Weiner.
             </p>
             <p>
              Party and husband live on farm in VA. Chicago and Trucker, CA are sites they vacation retreat at and the VA farm. Oddly, a email of part of the couples crew, states drinking from Chicago event to Trucker. Long drive for the elite. Anything to be found if they did do those vacation plans?

              Why does Glenn need supplemental insurance at this late time in age? Is he planning an accident?/ What life and medical insurance are they using under Guccifer (sp?) Corp?/
             </p>
             <p>
              Info under any state insurance regulators as guccifer is a limited liability corp and other data of corps, have to be public or given via public requests. IRS info?

              Thanks for referencing Catherine Hoggle. Of her FB profiles, this one has just one friend who is a bouncer in D.C., as far as I can tell. It would be brilliant if we could connect her with something/someone questionable.

               Yes, that's what I'm hoping. If she was getting counseling, or talking to someone who professed to be a counselor, they could have fed into her paranoia and made her think giving up her children was the only way to save them. Lots of way to work it, but we need proof. Thanks for this.

              Oh wait, if Patty is doing her billing etc, under the LLC limited liability corp, Guccifer, she would HAVE to be on a Oig, HGS , cms contract to do business with medicaid/ medicare, and billing. They have their own billing and coding system in obamacare...)) Sometimes the contracts are called Integrity Reports.
             </p>
             <p>
              Guccifer and Fridays Children..( look at the Star tech episode called that, aliens, savage)..Podesta loves aliens.
             </p>
             <p>
              A lot of public , or even beneficiaries, do not realize that publication c health care is fill of contracts with govt departments and all types of corporation contracts. Its a business.
             </p>
             <p>
              Govt keeps most hospital complainrs/ negligence, not in public transparency. Risk Management is attorneys for hospitals and institutions, but patients told to do complaints through theeir legal Dept's.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hospitals, institutions, drug addict centers, juvie centers, nursing homes, all have to do contracts and yearly reviews, licensing and more. Areas to possible find things. A lot do not know, but sick or disabled infants or kids, often routed to their state or private nursing homes for bed space reasons.
             </p>
             <p>
              Drivers, maintainence, maids, laundry on sites or sent out, kitchen, blue collar construction, electrician, plumbing, etc, could find nice ones who talk and know of odd child transports..)))

              Yes, pregnancy counselling is a legal mandate that adoption centers, abortion clinics, hospitals to last minute birth mothers have to provide and BILL to medicaid, medicare if dual, sometimes direct to dhs, depending if not signed up for insurance/ drug addict.
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh wait, drug addict centers/ teens..wonder the state ones around there, where offices located...))))

                Oh whoa..the one I thought was husband is at the same address and is the PSYCHOLOGIsT listed as office or PSycholigical institution, depending what Dr review site.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, they must be getting kids, teens with mental issues, abuse drug homes, teen addicts. He works with that one institution hospital, I listed. Very easy for him to know what kids, teens care VULNERABLE, bad/neglect/drug abuse homes, moms pregnant, teen moms!!
               </p>
               <p>
                Does VA have a mental Baker type act like NY state, Cali, South Carolina, Florida and other states have? For Dr, nurses, case workers, cops, even teachers can baker act any age to mental routed!!! Very, taken advantage of law!!
               </p>
               <p>
                Sometimes, those states, have some victims or FAM members that comment, BBB review, blog about the abuse in mental route system.
               </p>
               <p>
                Whoa..much power they have over people with all these medical, psych, billing, adopt center, hospital institution affiliations!! Wonder if cops are helping, teachers, too?

                Oh, forgot to say. When I saw the medical billing company, not surprised. Most violations that the OIG of HHS cares to investigate and penalize/charge;  is with billing fraud, so good bookkeeping is a great way to stay unnoticed.
               </p>
               <p>
                Next violations the oig harbors on,  are with ordering unec tests, order tests for patients not needing or even done, and ordering medical equipment not needed or diagnosed for, then procedures.
               </p>
               <p>
                So makes total sense,  medical billing would be included.  Also, Patty linknin, comes up as English and French in top engine search.

                 Oh, yeah, the French thing. I didn't mention that, did I? Seems she owns a duplex apartment in Paris that she rents out. Do you know how much a duplex apartment near the Eiffel Tower and the Bristol goes for? It's worth a fortune! So whatever her business Gusifer is, it pays well.

             114,000 children were awaiting placement in 2005? That's a huge number. 350 doesn't seem a lot in ten years, but is that just within the US? Or only internationally? Why is he working with both adoption agencies? Good find.

             If you can't make an archive the normal way, at least make a screen cap of the page and put a link here to a sli.mg posting of that screen cap.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would do this myself but my skills are fail (page is too big for my screen).  I did, however, save the page to my PC in case it entirely goes poof.

            So seems like a building out of which several psychologists/counsellors run their practices?

            There is also a Shenandoah University nearby, so I'm guessing they share the building with some pretty rich people if they have a University?

             Eugenia and John Demos of this above email are connected by blood to the Podesta family via a Greek connection explained in the above WikiLeaks email. In this email they explain that Evgenia/Eugenia's mother Irene was a sister of John Podesta's grandmother Thomai. This makes Evgenia Kolovou-Demos a

             is the name of the sex-magick cult that Aleister Crowley created, and I have always had a suspicion that the creepy gay network that Alefantis seems to be a part of is an offshoot of the T.O.T.O (Typhonian O.T.O), or the demonic gay Choronzon Club which was founded and nurtured in Chicago, having spun off of a O.T.O affiliated current seeded by Cecil Frederick Russell.

             Yes, you read that correctly: An 'ordination' lineage determined by anal intercourse received from THE BEAST/Master Therion; Aleister Crowley himself through his sexual surrogates. NOTE: Not all O.T.O., spin-offs practice this (so it is said), as there are actually dozens of active competing Thelemic currents claiming to be OTO ... the

             was the most disturbing, and it was anchored in Chicago. It was first solidly founded in 1933 by purely homosexual males. One wonders if Barack Obama and his well known homosexual escapades in Chicago brought about his initiation/ordination perhaps?).

            <p>
             Alefantis had an Instagram post which seems to be straight out of Choronzon Club subculture: Four gay males on it, covered in flowers, and a man with a coiled snake behind him posing in some kind of crown chakra relationship at the bottom, whilst in the background two gay males are kissing under an Egyptian hieroglyphic portal. This image was sourced from an Instagram archive zip file someone posted but it was just the images without the Instagram comments. The image filename within the zip is 11243071_853750404673912_2034871715_n_30538347630_fe4685107b_o_d.jpg ... and the zip file is called jimmycomet_instagram_archive_photos_only_20161220.zip ...

It definitely is in my opinion as it has the rest of the well known images (773 in total, I had to go through every image to find it), but it would be sure nice if someone had screen-captured the comments attached to that particular occult image before he made his account private, especially revealing to see who commented.

It is our understanding that the farm was given to one of the daughters, I believe her name was Matina, another daughter, Sophie was given a dowry (I believe one of the documents sent to you was a dowry agreement, and the house was to be given to my grandmother, Thomai, her sister Irene and brother, Kostas.

My grandmother, Thomai Kokoris, had three children, Mary Podesta (mother of Tony and John Podesta), Evalyne Carres (my mother) and George Kokoris (no living children), all of whom are deceased.

             Thus, Patti Paule-Carres is a close Greek-American relative of the Podesta brothers, not just a business acquaintance. Mary Kokoris' husband was the Italian-American John Podesta, although John and Tony laud their Greek maternal ancestry over their Italian paternal ancestry for some reason. A longstanding relationship perhaps between the Greek Alefantis family and the Paule-Carres is quite possible, considering that the Greek-American ethnic minority is highly networked, like the Jewish community. It is known that Tony Podesta and James Alefantis share a birthday and party at Comet Ping Pong, but it would be revealing if, perhaps, a longstanding relationship were to be found between these families, within perhaps, a Greek fraternity of some sort. An obituary of one Evalyne Carres in the Chicago Tribune January 18th 2008 clarifies some relationships:

             So her name is Patti (Glenn) Paule-Carres -- Dr. Glenn N. Paule-Carres, PH.D., P.C. (Clinical Psychologist in Winchester, Virginia), is the name of her husband; previously Glenn Paule, no doubt married to a feminist of the Hillaryland archetype. It is interesting that the Carres name and the Greek seems to be the dominant family influence in this milieu. The emigrant family is situated in Chicago where the Podesta's were both raised. Knox College seems to be a common link between these people

              Dear Mary, Hope you and the family are well. Since John is no longer with the email address I have for him, would you please forward this "thelema" (favor) to John ? Our internist, of many years, has a 95 year old mother who is in "Love" with President Barack Obama. In a recent visit, we got to talking politics and she mentioned how her mother would want to meet the President. On hearing of our relationship with John, our internist mentioned that her 95 year old mother would even make the extra effort to come to D.C. to meet with the president. Jean Houlihan, our internist, went on to say she would even make a special trip with her mother to D C. to accomplish this if she could not meet him somewhere in the Chicago area. Edie Houlihan, the mother, was a social worker here in Chicago. She reared 6 children, 2 doctors, 2 lawyers, a nurse, and a successful business man. Edie donates to all requests from the Obama's. We know you are inundated with such requests but feel we had to give it a try. It's not something you can make happen but can you suggest an approach the family can take to help their Mom fulfill her "Bucket List"? The attached is a picture of Edie with a Harvard Hat from her Granddaughter, a recent graduate. I am not good at attaching Edie's picture, so I am sending it with a forward from Dr. Jean Houlihan's email to me. Hope you are understanding and will give me a response -- yes or no.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hope all is well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Love, Eugenia &amp; John

             Now, Eugenia and John Demos sent the above strange email to the Podesta's requesting a

             (favor), because one of their long term interns (a Dr. Jean Houlihan M.D., who graduated Rush University in 1989), had a grandmother Edie Houlihan (social worker in Chicago ... of course she would have to be a social worker to be affiliated with the Podesta constellation) who was in

             from Hawai'i. The use of only the words Thelema and Love in this email within double quotes, is highly telling, because Agape/Love and Thelema/Will, in Greek, have the isophephy of 93, which is used by Thelemites to encode dogmatic signatures into their communications

              Well, I'm not sure - the New York branch of People Places is listed as a Foreign Business Corporation, but I don't know how to find out what country it is therefore related to:
              <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/1683243">
               https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/1683243
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              And this is fairly weak, but I found a People AND Places registered to a Mavis and Terence Dunlop, in Northern Ireland, so not really Ireland and not exactly the same name. Looked further into it and looks like it's a husband and wife who run a bed and breakfast out of their country house in Fortwilliam, County Down. Which happens to be a massive property with lots of land. On the UK companies website, that was the only company registered to those two. BUT, a search on opencorporates.com, found a freight company, called Dunlop Freight Services registered to them both also. Can't find much on that company, but looks like it's been dissolved, but started in 1982. Terence Dunlop also appears to have been appointed to the position of District Judge in 2010 and prior to that in 2004, he was given special thanks in a Foreword by Lord Justice Sir Anthony Campbell. So seems like perhaps a rich and influential person? Which automatically makes him suspicious! But the only connection is the name of their business People AND Places is similar to People Places, but they are different businesses.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another thing I found is that their house is about 30 minutes drive from Kincora Boy's Home, which was the centre of a huge child abuse scandal involving members of the British establishment including MPs, judges, lawyers etc. One man accused of Pedophilia and abusing boys at the home was a John Dunlop McKeague, who was 9 years younger than Terence Dunlop (John McKeague was killed in 1982). But I can't find a family connection between them online other than that they both have the name Dunlop and that they come from the same area.
             </p>
             <p>
              More interestingly perhaps, I found that the body of a 9 year old girl, Jennifer Cardy, was found by the road only 6 miles from the Dunlops' country house in 1981. She had been sexually abused. Serial killer and pedophile
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Black_(serial_killer)#Long-distance_driving_employment">
               Robert Black
              </a>
              was eventually convicted of her murder in 2011. (Black died of a heart attack in prison in January of this year, aged 68). He was a van driver, and that fact was part of the circumstantial evidence against him, because the detectives had deduced that the killer was likely to be someone who travelled a lot, because of where Cardy's body had been found: near a major arterial road between Belfast and Dublin, which was a traffic route frequented by long-distance delivery drivers. This seems relevant to the Dunlop freight business.
             </p>
             <p>
              The other interesting thing about the Black case is that his employer was apparently a company called 'Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd,' for whom he drove around delivering posters of celebrities and billboard advertisements to locations all over the UK, Ireland, and Europe. However, I cannot find this company anywhere online - the only places it is mentioned is in articles about Black, stating that he worked for them. This is very odd - even if they dissolved/closed down etc they should still be somewhere in the companies database. This goes along with how strange it is that there is nothing online either about Dunlop Freight services other than their registration details on websites like opencorporates.com. company check.co.uk etc. You'd think they would advertise or there would be reviews or a website or details of what their specific services are, but nothing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Black died of a heart attack in prison in Northern Ireland in January this year (2016). He was 68. Coincidentally, police were only a few weeks away from charging him with another murder, that of missing 13 year old girl Genette Tate, who disappeared while on her paper round in Devon, England, in August 1978. No body or trace of her was ever found. Black had already been ruled out as a suspect decades ago, but for some reason almost 4 decades later Devonshire police decided he must be the one. There has been a citizens' investigation into this case - they have a
              <a href="https://genetteinvestigation.wordpress.com/the-story-click-here/">
               website
              </a>
              and were apparently warned by police to stop their investigation, because they were revealing details about widespread child abuse, including ritual abuse, in that area at that time. (Sound familiar?!!) These investigators provide good evidence that Genette's father, John Tate, was sexually abusing both Genette and her sister Tania. John Tate set up a charity called International Find a Child in 1985, with donations pouring in out of sympathy for him and his lost child.
              <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19850611&amp;id=n-89AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2UgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3185,2275868">
               The charity was investigated
              </a>
              because Tate was basically stealing all the money for himself. Coincidentally, around the same time in the USA, the mother of a missing child set up a similar charity called
              <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/profile/22-2323336">
               Child Find of America Inc
              </a>
              , which was
              <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/21/nyregion/registry-of-missing-children-faces-state-inquiry.html">
               investigated by the NY State Attorney General's office
              </a>
              but ultimately found to be okay, and it is
              <a href="http://childfindofamerica.org">
               still active

              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, there is suspicion that John Tate was part of a huge pedophile network operating in the South West of England, headed by William Goad, who was apparently Britain's most evil and prolific pedophile before Jimmy Savile's crimes were discovered. I hadn't heard of him, and don't remember this furore over the lack of investigation into Goad's associates, even though victims insisted there had been a network of abusers and many of them prominent men in British society. A new investigation was apparently started in the South West into these other pedophiles, but I don't remember this being reported widely -
              <a href="http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/paedophile-ring-linked-britain-s-worst-abuser/story-19790530-detail/story.html">
               here is a report
              </a>
              from the local paper where Goad had lived. Apparently, the lead investigator at the time, who helped get him jailed finally, Shirley Thompson, said:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               There was a sense that Goad was untouchable and protected by people who had “sold their soul to the Devil”.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I also came across
              <a href="https://spidercatweb.blog">
               this website
              </a>
              , which screams, quite rightly WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE?? and appears to have been thoroughly investigating child abuse, pedophile rings, satanic ritual abuse etc, for some time. I think this could be a treasure trove of information perhaps.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ugh and I accidentally stumbled upon yet
              <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2016/s4504361.htm">
               ANOTHER pedophile ring, this time in the Anglican Church in Newcastle, UK
              </a>
              . There is too much - every little lead takes you to so many pedos, it's beginning to feel like pedophiles outnumber the rest of us. Why is this happening?!!
             </p>
             <p>
              This is very long, I got carried away, too much Christmas energy! Maybe I should make it into a post?

               Ah, lot of work you did. Did you notice in various Ireland cases that are coming out, that children were sent to the USA?? And nuns were running a lot of these instituons for boys, girls, babies AND poor females, pregnant or not that many females spent their entire life in slave labours or kept being told to pay the nuns for their child, that were no longer there or dead???
              </p>
              <p>
               The nuns group became larger and now has offices and organizations all over the world and AMERICA.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even the wikipedia states this, and you can connect to the nun organizations, wikipedia page and see how they are now huge and worldwide. Very odd, for mass cases are being exposed in Ireland. It stares that many locals had been aware, or suspicious, but had no idea where to safely say something.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, in Ireland or nearby country, a man gas a blog about parents that reported a rich neighbor had trued to get their minor son to have sex. They reported to authorities and both parents were illegally mental routed. Very litmus case, as is cases of bones in Sweden and elsewhere that get in trouble for speaking up about Islamic migrants, even when rapes to local females are going up sky high.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'll have to refund his blog. He is in London. He has another post on his blog about a mental health art show he went to, after seeing a sign on the street.
              </p>
              <p>
               He took pics of the art, artists, conference by mental health, art therapists that were encouraging satanic art very blatantly.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, Saville was also at the orphan home in Jersey Island, pedo mass bodies found in the fireplace, covered with lime. Horrific case. Saville lied that he had never been there, then pictures came out.
              </p>
              <p>
               A female journalist was literally banned from England for two years, to stop her book on this case in Jersey Island. Jersey does not register pedophiles, either.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Queen, literally made people and media, public apologize to her as queen ignored fact that mass charred bodies of the kids found. Ownership afterward, of that property, afterward is quite odd, also, and has become a lot of odd businesses.

               Tallahassee institution and others, years of complaints and deaths and still keeps operating. Two years ago, a female was falsely routed as had become physically Ill with no med insurance. She died giving birth, as staff kept yelling at her and denied she was pregnant. Her parents have tried to do a case ag the machine, as baby is born very sick and deformed from that horrific illegal abuse during the birth. A mere call to welfare about their daughter needing medical, turned into this nightmare for them.

               I also found out that Miami area was the main trafficking area, also with animals and abuse; but a case this year of a female and male, divorced drs had a teen missing. She lives in Panama and dad had moved to Arizona.
              </p>
              <p>
               The teen was finally found, but a very suspicious case, but a kind citizen that found a very pertinent detail was quickly harrased by the mom and pals. Also, a missing children's group was sponsoring the missing teen on their site. Dontnknow if they are good/ legit, but oddly, only one other case was on their page, and that was very suspicious, also.
              </p>
              <p>
               Details later, if you want. Out of that, the fact that Panama City areas, not far from the capital have become the new, major child trafficking and large amounts of kidnapping.

               Remind me a lot of Virginia area, of many missing children. Seaport areas keep on coming up. And in areas that transverse easy to different states.

               I think the work of the two that found the data for this subverse are on to the specified locality set up of convenience for that region of USA. But, that it intersects across nation and worldwide and various govt to corp infrastructures and us,- aid and more are utilized.

               The Ireland cases were a direct shipping of kids and babies to the USA. Not to just focus on the nuns organization, but the sure did quickly expand worldwide and to the USA, Africa, France and more, under much support, grants and donations.
              </p>
              <p>
               Idk, but to me, that's odd and not a normal response to such the horrific cases to babies, kids, and poor females in such large numbers of horrific multitudes of things done.
              </p>
              <p>
               How the pope cuts down pedogate after all this Ireland stuff is coming out of the woodwork, to me is not a man of god sacred to life that is supposed to set an example. 
Nor the queen and royal family that live free off the taxes of England, as already has enough money to last forever and is one of the top people to own most real estate worldwide.
              </p>
              <p>
               And why are ones supposed to be bowed down to as so great, and never even.just clean their own toilet and make their own meal, as do one party event after another, for its tradition!/ What have they really done to make positive impact that empowers people to.live in independence and thrive?/
              </p>
              <p>
               Why is it supposed to matter that if rich or political.if both, that we are to bow down and be fanatic as if they are a god? It seems no difference than the past centuries, except some modern aspects we have, but the slums are still horrid and worse and spreading all over, including USA and that does make children vulnerable to the welfare system in large amounts.

               How did bill gates get away with giving the aids medicines in Africa andbindia that were known to be unsafe, tainted and expired? Yet, at local health Dept's in lines, poor stand without insurance, and not known to many, bad hepatitis medicine is given that lost fda approval.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why wouldn't ones in high status, money and networks that had deviant cravings, set up their own region model to fit their fancy?

               Epstein did. Similisrities in each case, all conbect , yet each group/ area has their own particular set up. And others will emulate set ups they like.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even with Epstein busted and all that flew there, its called fake news with a tyranny. And his victim is also being intimidated by the attorney, that bigwig one from Harvard.

I know this system, inside and out. And its all corrupt beyond ur dreams, easy as pie to skirt by, arrests go on lil crimes to distract.

             You do? Are there public records so we can see exactly the kind of work they're doing? And as for the two adoption servces, is there a way to get stats for how many adoptions, whether they're domestic or international, etc.? Is there anything else you can suggest to pinpoint whether there's anything fraudulent going on?

              I was going to list a few more oversight agencies with children.
Office Inspector General of HHS is supposed to have a contract with each Dr, facility, corporation that takes Medicaid and Medicare.
             </p>
             <p>
              We need to see if they are licensed corporations, partnership sole proprietorship, npo?, How they are business filed in VA.
             </p>
             <p>
              Are they receiving any state or fed grants, or nonprofit grants or research grants with universities/ Nih/CDC/center rare disease. Maybe research as Clinton and Bill Gates are into that, esp w aids and malaria. Zika?Medicine trials? Or trials with big pharmaceuticals? ( psychotropics or medical).
             </p>
             <p>
              Adoptions are confidential. But if they have had a review by oig, HHS, or other state/fed agencies/Dept's they might have stats on adoption, and some sources of where getting children ( even if not all listed, esp if used as a front).
             </p>
             <p>
              Better business bureau, adoption center reviews, blogs,  could have more about them from the conceiving moms or adopters.
             </p>
             <p>
              Patty has 112 followers on link in, but her listed website, for me, comes up as a domain sale page, which is odd.
             </p>
             <p>
              Each counselor, psych, Dr has to list their legit address, website, mailing box on stare license sites, though. So if she lists any faulty address or website, on the state licensing, that is a fraud. What is her license in, counsel, accounting?.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anything of state, fed, npo,research money to follow, anything under what form she is filed as a business with state, any contracts with oig, HHS, cms and any state/fed, universities, npos, etc? Who does she advertise with, web host, servers?
             </p>
             <p>
              They make SO many related state/fed Dept's, so each one has to be searched.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are also state/ fed grant websites that show where tax dollars go, ( if any of these people are getting grants or donations).
             </p>
             <p>
              Big question: where would available kids be staying.
             </p>
             <p>
              I found a psychologist Glenn N Paul -Carres in Winchester, VA. Is that her husband, relative? Some sites he is listed as a office, another Psychological Institution????
             </p>
             <p>
              I found one medical institution he is affiliated with: Children Sarah C Medical. Trying to see if he is on contract with other institutions, nursing homes, drug centers, hospitals in the area. Also, to look into Children Sarah C medical, with oig, other govt entities, patient reviews, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              A lot of stuff are on websites with state and fed, AND a lot is PDF files with public health care and welfare. I'm waiting for some stuff to download. Adhering to public health care laws and contract, also.
             </p>
             <p>
              Each entity, like HHS, has local, state, regional and federal. On those, esp state, sometimes you can find case listings of Foia requests, esp if a attorney, media, beneficiary ever made a request for more than.one, a whole PDF long list of pages of them can be found on deep searches.
             </p>
             <p>
              In fact, Wonder if the one I found few months back was VA or West VA.
             </p>
             <p>
              So it's on their websites AND by typing govt entity, and various key words on searches that things come up, as its seems purposely hard to find things. But. I have found so much, doing deep searches.
             </p>
             <p>
              If any in area, could find a welfare, teen, addict, homeless, disabled mom that used their services, could open doors. If find someone, besides interview, CAN do confidential foia requests as beneficiaries have that right to access files via calls to any state fed local office, cert mail, emails, calls ( inform record)
             </p>

              Even though individual foia, the requests can show other entities used, other people, etc.and give more of a inside look, drs used, nurses, supplies, lawyers..
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll keep digging and think more. But there is still so much to dig in the welfare, public health care Dept's maze from local, state, regional fed.
             </p>
             <p>
              If any are a medical corporation, they would also have a contract called INTEGRITY report with the oig, and on oig website can see if any yearly reviews or investigations. Yet, I found that oig targets small crimes or good drs that actually DX and treat, and covers up the big crimes.
             </p>
             <p>
              I actually have that on recordings w oig.
             </p>
             <p>
              Finding out what hospitals they use, affiliated with to see patients, be on call.
             </p>
             <p>
              Overseas and international ministries with churches and Jewish foundations, other religions. They are in Haiti, African countries doing visiting ministries, a lot. And a lot of the so called preachers from different countries, are on Facebook. I know a Uganda one with a international.one that is very shady. Not know if connected, but dig up slot when they did not want shipped supplies, only money.
             </p>
             <p>
              These Facebook sites just have tons of kids with no parents, or very sick parents with Aids.
             </p>
             <p>
              But back to local focus, digging up each fed stare entity to see if any paperwork with these medical groups, names are key.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seeing if they are currently licensed with ssre, any violations listed, etc. That can often dig up stiff and open more doors.
             </p>
             <p>
              Welfare and public health care is a RATMAZE. I'd sit for months every night, researching and researching the rat maze and day calls..
             </p>
             <p>
              CMS is medicare and medicaid billing. Each month, beneficiaries get the bill statements sent to them from cms. So cms would have files for kids, even just getting vaccinations. Overseas kids would have to be tested a lot, unless they are sneaking them in, around the legit kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              If any live in area, maybe could see ones transported in. Are they transported on the free, paid transports with Obamacare? If so, that would be using local drivers, local drive companies, and contracted with either Logidticare or MTM.
             </p>
             <p>
              HMOs..are these kids on HMOs like united, care plus, amerigroup ( easy to find what HMOs in eachbregion.on thecweb) OR are they on straight/ special needs medicaid, which uses no HMO. Then state contracts with MTM or logisticare, also.
             </p>
             <p>
              Logidticare databases would have all the rides listed !!! ( BTW)
             </p>
             <p>
              Its easier to dig up on adult beneficiaries vs minors. But its all a rat maze.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, various state quality commusion boards can have grievance/ complaints that are found.
             </p>
             <p>
              The pregnant moms could have had STATE fair hearings with Dept children Family trying to get their rights.
             </p>
             <p>
              Drug centers and mental institutions could be sources for children, too, in the area, ESp with teens and addicts.
             </p>
             <p>
              CDC, nih have different statistics on public healthcare beneficiaries.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry so much, but its a maze, easy for ones to be corrupt in, is the infrastructure..))

                Good find, as Patty link in, website leads to domain sale page.
Very odfld for they clearly can afford domain and host fees.
               </p>
               <p>
                What website does she use for Virginia state license of accounting, or counselor? And all the entities under Gucifer? For by law, must be accurate, up to date for state lieicenses, esp any in medical/psych.
               </p>
               <p>
                Looks like her medical accounting is in house vs for other biz, not advertised.
               </p>
               <p>
                Guccifer must have work insurance. The podesta emails have Patty writing about Glenn needing supplemental life insurance ( why, is he planning on having an accident and supplemental usually means insurance medical exam to be healthy).
               </p>
               <p>
                Basic search of Patty and Medic brought up link in in English and French?? Thought was odd.

               <p>
                Montana's craftsite, what is that? Reminds me of the pizza place where the wife sells and makes those coded greeting cards. Also, I'll never get out of my mind the body parts sold in part, in jars, into lamps, etc on Instagram and etsy that are so highly illegal body parts sales/arts that its clear authorities been ignoring satanic crimes that have turned into niches businesses, all over that connect elite to populace via satanic groups, vampirism, cottage industries.
               </p>
               <p>
                Healthcarebill2005: interesting as public healthcare bills had changes in that year time period with obamacare. Billing and coding have gone through at least, two major overhauls with Obamacare. Even bill, code overhauling is a for profit endeavor for many entities the avg citizen not realize. Govt staff, lobby groups, tech software companies, univ/lobby/npo research grants, printing material &amp; all supplies/software, training, huge fancy conferences they have at resorts. ( even homelessness is a fancy job world for many people and industries, as is prison industrial, animal shelters and where body parts go for sale ( Carolina biologicalsupply, Hauser, gas chambers). 
I'm going to keep digging all your leads and govt/corp related in this subverse, too. I have a lot of oig PDF files, waiting to DL. There is a child oversight under oig umbrella ( oversight dhs, cps, ahca, all welfare of children) that is four letter acronym that is to oversight/endorse laws and contracts (carry some of the contracts, too).
               </p>
               <p>
                I'll write that Oig umbrella acronym for children down soon ( forget one letter of the 4). What is interesting in the consistent ignoring of that oversight in CP's/ child welfare, custody cases; just like the Oig for HHS in public healthcare cases AND VA scandal. Even Bernie who heads Veteran affairs, deletes the core base structure that VA medical is under an oig entity with mass related public health care laws to protect the VA beneficiaries and the related corporate contracts of that medical sphere as a business.
               </p>
               <p>
                For court cases of either corruption or victims justice, without proof of oig not oversight laws and contracts or specified violations at any level of violations done ( local, state, regional, federal), there is no solid case. Prime example, Rick Scott in the huge Texas medicare/medicaid scandal. He simply pleading fifth, seventy five times and able to be governor and move boldly to his next public health care scheme/schematic.
               </p>
               <p>
                Public healthcare law has base components. One is that beneficiaries ( also called stockholders) must be informed of all related changes, to be involved, to be fully informed of all public healthcare law, contracts AND informed at every level; each violation that is done to them. Its never done, even with recipients/advocates that stae the violations on phone/cert letters.
               </p>
               <p>
                Aside: On Friday Family, about 8 forms for adoptees to fill out. One is Corpeal Punishment. Very odd for no corpeal punishment is specified with hit, binding, isolation in closets, etc BUT the contract states that after the adoption is finalized, corpeal.punishment is allowed. VERY trick legal wording on that contract, that loops it in and DOES not limit corpeal to acceptable, that is, binding, etc is not specified out of the corpeal entitlement AFTER the legal adopt finalization!
               </p>
               <p>
                The costs for each application, home visit, gas mileage are very high. Even in animal rescue, its a huge he red flag, the ones or npos that profit off saving life of an animal. At shelter, @$40 for adopting n. With adopt centers and animal rescue npo, donations and grants, plus public health care benefits for kids, pay costs. What are the salaries for these two adoption.places, and one is a foster and other related in that industry ( pregnant mom counseling, etc). Many of those go to hospitals and other institutions. By law, pregnant option counseling must be done to give up child or abort. T
               </p>
               <p>
                They sure are making pretty penny on their adopt process. Be on $500-1995 averages on application review and home checks and around ,l$350 for ongoing home checks.
               </p>
               <p>
                Average social worker/psych costs are fully being overcharged, and fact it is lives of children/animals, in these ethics and laws of either, it is considered wrong to profit on life.
               </p>
               <p>
                Besides pregnant and moms they get babies and children from in multi vulnerable medical/psych/juvie/drug institution industries or off street; where are they getting more babies/infants AND how much do they pay/ or not to get babies/children from any stream of supply?
               </p>
               <p>
                Compare costs of adopt /foster via doing it throw VA state welfare. Can understand more for some walk through conveniences, yet the listed prices are very profit inflated at levels that are selfishly absurd, as these are live children, not cattle.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, have seen how various scams in public health care to any govt program , say like IRS; that ones link to a recent govt bill (Ex : publichealthlaw2004) to try to show legitimacy. Common thing done!
               </p>
               <p>
                Aside( I have three sites that need archive asap, so I can mention on VOUT before erased). It's with initiation with thirld worlders..

            That's another obamacare connection there, and why they need medical billing services; which is standard in medicaid/medicare.. Could also come from us-aid kids to here, or USA/state ward ones. The infrastructure that I've been saying a longggg time. Did my homework, years.
           </p>
           <p>
            The connecting corps to obamacare, Clinton foundation, Obama foundation are key. The blueprint is under medical, welfare, emergency disaster, refugee, poverty, homeless, missing kids, disabled etc..besides kidnapped ones from homes. And question again arises, why are so much more kids as body,,/resources needed? Is it beyond pedo.? ..great work. 
And already one obamacare/Saudi to many countries corp Is igneus. Look up igneus website and front page map shows you.

             well, if planned parenthood was suspected of selling fetus body parts for i think stem cell usage, then it isn't too crazy to think that these monsters are trading babies and kids for the same reason and for organ harvesting in the future. ..
            </p>
            <p>
             Would also explain the "spirit cooking" coverup with blood and cannibalism references.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could it be that the babies &amp; children are being sold and used for stem cells, organs and cannibalism by this monstrous cult?
            </p>

             Sure looks like that from their instagram posts, artists they hang out with and their satanic worshiping friends they associate with.

              Yes, it seems like any business niche is a niche to elite with govt, corp and down to their populace in small biz. Have you seen the body parts sold on Instagram, even lamps made of spine and skull! Horrid memory to have, though!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              I found where Illuminati is initiating one in Sudan, Uganda, Swahili (sp?), other countries, connected direct to two states in USA.
             </p>
             <p>
              The ones getting initiated are told will get rich, have to kill a blood relative, chickens and more. Some initiated, write about it, even.
I need help to archive it as not able to, before I write the links...
             </p>
             <p>
              And, of course they will always be low level initiated fall guys to do dirty work.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some decent, on YouTube, posted children bodies, cut up, dead, for organ harvesting in Sudan. Its awful..Done in same tribe, but tensions between tribes are def utilized by elite to violence and crimes, ones easily manipulated, low ethics.

             Yes it's beyond pedo.  In 1997 Hillary broadened the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) enacted by Walter Mondale and was signed into law by her husband who was President at the time.  Hillary takes credit for this and boasted about it in one of her debates.   Before 1997 states received subsidies from the FED IV-E funding (social security trust fund) and other grants for the cost of foster care.  What Hillary did was gave the states adoption bonuses if and only if they increased their adoptions over the prior year.   No increase = no bonuses.  Presently states not only receive the cost per child which averages 85k per child for the cost of their care (which was already being paid through the Mondale Act). Now under Hillary's plan they also receive from $4500-$10000 per child depending on their age if and only if they exceed the prior years adoptions which the states can spend any way they choose fit.   ALSO under Hillary's plan adoptive parents receive maintenance subsidies until the child reaches 18 or in some states until the age of 21 if the child goes on to higher education.   These maintenance subsidies vary between states and normally equal out to the same that foster parents received and are tax free.  States set their own rates and can be as low as $450 per mo per adopted child to $800+ per mo  (AZ) and higher if the child is medically complex.   On top of that adoptive parents are entitled to a $13400 tax credit per child that can be used to offset taxes due on earned income and they have a period of 6 years to use the credit.  States make millions upon millions of dollars with these bonuses and Texas is the only state that has consistently increased their adoptions since this law went into effect in 1997 without ever missing a year of receiving their bonuses.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are hundreds of FB pages with parents not only in the US but from the UK, AU, Norway, Canada and more who are screaming from the rooftops that their children are being removed from their homes without warrants or justification of any sort yet MSM refuses to cover this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             So to answer your question about "why are kids as body/resources needed?"  The answer is because the states are padding their coffers with the majority of the funding coming from social security.  Medicaid is also paid in full by the FED for foster/adopted children which eases the burden on the states as they no longer have to foot the bill for medical insurance.  It's also the reason why families who are receiving any type of state services in the form of subsidized housing, EBT cards, Medicaid or even if a child has an IEP are the ones who are targeted to have their children removed.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are currently 415000 children in the foster care system and the Casey Foundation has published reports stating that less than 20% of those children were removed for emotional, sexual or physical abuse.  The remaining 80% are removed for "neglect" which more often than not constitutes being poor or the family living within the Federal Poverty Guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's an older article and the bonuses have increased since this article was written.

              Yes, yes on all, and so glad you posted all of this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Add the children in divorce custodynproceedings, too. Just like you said, a lot of web pages of victims; richer, white dads have led the advocacy march and have websites of the bs, never ending, costly, injustice rat maze and intimidations as ones advocate further and boldly , parralel to their legal rights. Native/reservation children, in this, also.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, areas of public health care, prison industry, juvie industry and all welfare/social: there are more bills and corp privatization to these pray grams. Bush privatized the long standing federal NEMT program ( non emergency medical transport for recipients for medical/phaemacy/schoool/work rides. Logidticare and MTM have the contracts. Only 3-4 states, dropped and stayed all local jobs and management, versus the unec and very corrupt for profit middleman corps.
             </p>
             <p>
              Logisticare-Providence-Igneus. This multi one company goes worldwide and connects to all social welfare prison juvie programs. Ones not know, as recipients ignored eight years; that bent rides are often done by fly by night, immigrant and call/staff/drivers. Even physical abuse/sexavlbuse/transport deaths have been covered up, but can find victim, FAM etc statements across web and also complaints/legal cases by legit, local car companies never reimbursed or put out of biz. Even bedbugs, Logisticare searches on webs, bring up a lot, to show how unprofessional. ( lol, www).
             </p>
             <p>
              Every change in law is supposed to be transparent and furnished to recipients and commentary periods. Its never made ada accessible formats, poverty accessible ( many no internet and on very limited cell minute Safe-access phones), and physical meetings not statewide accessible or advertised, or ada ride assistance. Many state/county courts, such as Fl, no longer even give ada rides to courts!/
             </p>
             <p>
              ADA right to grievance, title iv without intimidation/harrasment, hippa violations, refusal to give case records upon multiple requests is often, and fees the poor cannot afford.
             </p>
             <p>
              Switching HMOs on beneficiaries, taking established care away, not even giving the 69-90 day period when state switches, is common. Common HMOs, but there are nation ones and state and county ones: United, care plus, stay well, amerigroup, state open/ straight/special needs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Each HMO and transport corp on the contracts, as is governors. Each complaint supposed to go to governor, oig, medical state boards, and more; hardly do, even upon beneficiary persistent formal documented requests. Innacurate, destroyed complaints are often, and widened beneficiaries/advocates record calls and photocopy cert mailings.
             </p>
             <p>
              State attorneys, also involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes....!! As Alefontitus not cps welfare check and adhere to law, poverty is very often called negligence from very loving homes, or taken for letting kids walk alone, play in their yard alone, not put kids on psychotropics, cancer/drugs, rare disease discriminations ( Justine Pelletier case- mito disease- boston children hospital), and kids taken as states refuse the cheap home medical supplies.

               But, beyond all the very good reasons you wrote; in system to Haiti and other countries; still is a question of why that already huge population of trafficked/ststeward is not large enough supply ....

               That brings to organ harvesting ( Sudan, China and other area utibrs show a lot), labs, research, and I suspect the new coined phrase in the poverty food summit talks 2009 in Africa, bio material food. Ingredion corp is worldwide and also based in subsahara region.

               Hr-5 is one of the Obama bills to bring ones in from welfare, refugee, prison/juvie work program visa in USA. Igneus is one of the main player we corps, with offices also in Saudi. There are obamacare recipients on fed transport nemt program that have video of the immigrant drivers and abuses, no shows, strand, fraud billing always allowed, service dog refusals, aggro driving leading to accidents, esp with beneficiaries that stand up and grievance. One case is in Wiscon voice, dialysis man dies as refused dialysis many times and of course, that logically will cause death. His last repeated statements were, I think they are trying to kill me. That is, depopulation also going on. Widened victims/advocates in obamacare and VA scandal call it phase one FEMA not needing camps, rot, die at homes or at the for profit hospitals, institutions, nursing homes.

               One adopt form is no corpeal.punishment; and specificied of many types, included binding, BUT, then as allows parents to corpeal punish AFTER full adoption goes through. Odd.

             Thanks. Good info. This appears to have everything it needs under one roof. Yes, I am wondering about the funding. and if someone is milking this system. Damn! This is about the kids -- not adults wanting to be powerful! It gets me sick that something as noble as adoption might be being used.

             That's scary. I had a horrifying vision that these poor kids somehow get sent to stay with Uncle Tony. Remember that bedroom with all the toys? Please, dear God, no!

              Did you see that someone posted on here the Virginia  DSS violations found at Fridays Children! Around five violations and only a hand slap!! And VERY ODD violations!!! A very good find. Shows that they are not documenting children correctly, employees or adoptee parents!!
             </p>
             <p>
              A crime check history was not even done on a staff employee, and then was to be done by a January date, was not done till August. The complaint states that the crime check report of that employee will be put in the files of Friday Children, covering up if there were any crime history found! Hope you see it

              . You will be LIVID!

             <p>
              ALSO, you'd think that kids even being around that evil art would be called abuse. Aren't movies rated for a reason and ID must be shown to buy Penthouse...))

              What is this trend/practice/normalization of exposing children to obvious xxx rared violence that is clearly not healthy for child development and their safety...
             </p>
             <p>
              Its clear the deviant desire/wants of deviant adults is their only concern. All about me me me, deviant psycho narcissism. And its called fake news to be concerned of healthy environments for children, when it should be not even an arguement/debate. Its insanity.
             </p>
             <p>
              Psych, social, bio, medical research is ample for ions that healthy environmebtal factors are necessary for healthy and safe child growth and development.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its like all this research, even by Harvard School of Public Health is being utilized, knowingly to cause unhealthy development.

               Absolutely. These children are being deliberately broken. Easier to control, ensures another generation of victims become some (a small group) will become the handlers and manipulators of the new victims. Yes, that was an excellent find.

               Me, too. Gucci, fashion world is in same elite world of connections, industries utilized for resources/manufacturing, using different countries for resources and their slave factories.
              </p>
              <p>
               Which big fashion co makes the purses that the new raging trend are these small ornaments made of leather to look like lil people or faces? The rich are buying these tacky things up like mad, and they cost around $1000 each, and are tiny.
              </p>
              <p>
               I kept wondering if made from infant skin. I don't know why, but they are so ugly, tacky, overpriced and a bizarre huge trend with elite.
              </p>
              <p>
               Have you noticed the huge comeback of leather and furs, and wigs? And all, very overpriced. Many big fashion are connected to animal butchery factories, worldwide. Also, chemicals for dyes and processing materials.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are pictures of poor females and kids that have to touch these dyes in huge vats in horrid conditions in factories and outside, crouched on the dirt. So much of the overpriced fashion had mass evil history attached to it. Many in fashion are gay, tranny, gender fluid. They vacation, resort, yacht in same areas of govt, political, other corp elite. ( nothing ag orientations that do not pedo, harm, beastiality).
              </p>
              <p>
               They even created blogs to talk, brag about ones they have. So we talk about concerns of society and kids, as the elite females/desperate house wives are blog chatting about these tacky purse attachments.

                Cruelty is pretty standard for bourgeois elitists. It infiltrates their ranks throughout the centuries because with wealth and affluence and lots of education, the worst psychopaths among them are able to literally buy respectability in the eyes of the public. The pathetic insecurities that their superficially nice culture of deceit and backstabbing creates in their ranks are normalized and even celebrated. They see it as drama and grand theater, and yet very serious business when their own interests are at stake. They are so rich an indulgent that their lives lack the real sensations of struggle and desperation that most people around the world feel. Many of them see manipulating others as a way to escape the boredom and experience live vicariously. Most of them don't live in a world of petty crimes and violence, so they watch stuff like Law &amp; Order SVU like onlookers at a car crash, but all from the convenience of their living rooms.
               </p>
               <p>
                Others take it so much further. The real psychopaths among them just blend in and take out most of their dark desires on the poor and desperate. The lost, broken, and poorly accounted-for huddled masses yearning not to be preyed upon by the elites. You know, the reason so many people emigrated here in the first place. We can't keep running. We can't keep getting forced on to new frontiers and suffer through austerity so a handful of people can pile their fortunes on top of the suffering of the weak. If we don't have a system that works for We The People, then The People will be expendable.

                 I appreciate your expansion on this. Its so habit, expected. So many in populaces, do not realize, even in the USA the royality of elite for money, status is not about integral traits or a collective healthy nation or intents.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Trump did us a favor. Go look up Politico Article, Trumps $440 billion weapon. One of the very few media articles that address federal contracts, yet acts as if Trump.or citizens could not understand them. Which is baloney, it just takes effort to read the thousands upon thousands of govt papers and related factors to each type. A tool used to keep public not involved and no transparency and harder to access.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Federal Acquisition Regulation book is mentioned and linked. Yah!! For it is not just knowing about fed contracts with corps, or reading the contract; but all the laws to know violations, harms to people, and as article starts to demonstrate ( how to bust corps for violations or the govt staff takes fully documenting violations so contracts can be broken and ones charged).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Rick Scott knew this in his Texas medicare medicaid frauds, as ones did not document violations, nor informing him and requesting he stop/fix, so he pleaded the fifth, *75 times, and simply got away from one large scandal!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, politico article, 10/16/2016, Obamas failure to Sudan's Children. Child soldiers as USA giving Sudan billions and weapons. Decent sudanese that can, post the organ trade children and adults that are found Dead and used.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Appreciate your post. The act of masks and roles is all a show. There is definitely a long term history of elite that continue, where its about the world as their stage.

             Thanks! I was getting nowhere looking for Gusifer when I did a search for something else. The keywords brought up that business site. I was shocked! As for the name, I know! But then this whole thing is messed up.

              It really does just go on and on and on. I still haven't even poked around much with the McCarthy connections that Egalite got me looking into when his/her posts were banned. I was trying to establish the Podesta relatives tree and saw the name Gusifer, it was just too absurd. I am so glad you were able to dig into this, and that you hit gold here, it was more than I was expecting.

               Thank you, so much. And makes sense of all in FAM and close friends is the specificity of their own "ring."
I keep wondering about Podesta kids and their friends /cousins. What are their college/vocational pursuits, their social circles, etc...? Big chance they are also moving toward related endeavors.
              </p>
              <p>
               I saw a article that Jenna Bush went to Ecuador or Brazil, under the auspices of a conference/charity endeavor, but it was about property her FAM was buying, next to two other interesting properties of a big industry and a property owned by Japan.
              </p>
              <p>
               World has conveniently forgot about the Bush daughters, after painted as "party chicks."
              </p>
              <p>
               I posted a list by www.Washington life 2026 Society list in DC. Podesta's, Bush, Clinton, Kennedy's, doctors, Arab Emirate peeps, and much more are on this list. Not only the same people/families of USA elite, but worldwide.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lovely, how elite abroad are also the pony donkey ribbon show of constant, ego recognition for nothing, but never regular citizens that do a lot of advocacy and charity with no support and funding.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, this list gives ALOT of people and corporations they have, most probably connected to all of this.

               I got lucky. Would never even have thought to look for this without you mentioning it. It's crucial for everyone to put down what they find peculiar or important or want to investigate because it might lead to something. Since I didn't read the post, I didn't see the connection, but, yes, if you want to dig into that it might turn up more. What precisely did they say about McCarthy connections?

            I couldn't find SFI Adoption in opencorporates.com so I searched for adoption agencies in Virginia to see if I could find any with a similar name in case there was a typo or something. I came across some other Virginia adoption agencies, one of which is The Datz Foundation, which has several branches throughout the US. It's founder is Mark Eckman, and a search of him led to a news article from 2013 about how Russia put a ban on Americans adopting Russian children, after the death of a 3 year old boy who had been adopted from Russia by an American family.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found this sentence particularly illuminating:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The agitation in Russia against US adoptions has stunned Americans. After all, adoptions are expensive and Russia enjoyed financial benefits stemming from this business. The opinion here is that the losers of this whole conflict are Russian orphans who will not find an American home.

             I believe there was another case that was a driving force. From what I remember, a woman who adopted actually put the Russian child she adopted on a plane -- alone!!! Yes, she sent him back to Russia. And I believe she was a nurse ... or worked in child care. Russian was understandably upset. And this article hints at how much money there is in this. You know what? We don't know if these are tied under a larger umbrella to other adoption agencies. We need to check that out, too. Are there stats available for The Datz Foundation? I'm obsessed with getting stats. We can see if SFI is in that normal range or off the charts. Good stuff. Thanks.

               Yes, the cases involving CPS were mystifying. Couldn't understand why nothing was being done when there was obvious abuse, but now I understand. CPS was told to "stand down" and that's what they did. Other times, kids were yanked from parents and put into foster homes where they were abused. It's a systematic takeover and orchestration means planning by elites who could implement such a plan. No low level person could get this done, but an army of low level people could if given direction.

             That's a GREAT idea! Do you think there would be business complaints? Or reviews? It might be a source of where to post. I wonder if there's a forum where prospective parents go to talk and to get recommendations. It might be a good place to post to see what steps were needed or to get feedback.

              I found a adopt review site that I wrote the website on this subverse. Some of the moms that adopted, left contact info. I did not find reviews of these two specific ones or the one nearby that a subverse found, but surely there must be. BBB, Facebook, review sites, etc.

             Have no idea, but this looks suspicious as hell give what the pizzagate investigation centers on. I mean, in one place, you have everything you need and it all seems to be under one corporation. At least that's how it's listed.

            Things are starting to make terrible sense now. The russian ban on US adoptions a few years ago seemed very odd, and was spun a lot of crazy ways. Yet no one bothered to mention why the russians would do such a drastic move. No one in the main stream bothered to ask questions. The most obvious answer would be a crack down on human trafficking, as organized crime will make money off of anything.

             I think pizzagate is actually a giant organized child "adoption" racket. It is done through the players we all know about and babies are traded like art and other valuables.

              What are Podesta daughters doing or studying and where? 
On Podesta emails with this group, Podesta was asked if some girl can have his private email. I found she was on the Obama Field team long group. One of their webpages speaks of a four week paid vacation, great med insurance, and how each have high chance to work with Obama in office.

               They need to have conflict with Russia so that can be discredited  when they release the copies of hacker Guccifers Hillary server emails from before they were "wiped with a cloth" AKA bleachbit. The narrative is supposed to be Russia is just out to get Hillary so we aren't supposed to trust them.

               We have gone to war for far less. I do think it is a bit of a stretch to say "war" real fast
              </p>
              <p>
               No i think the main reason why they are afraid of the russians, is because they have a good intelligence gathering operation. As we have seen from the wikileaks, the establishment is technologically retarded. Podesta shared his passwords over emails with interns.
              </p>
              <p>
               So the scenario here is that they need to discredit russia as much as possible, because they have made too many mistakes over the last few years to keep them covered up. Suddenly their political enemies are now in office, and anyone not caught in the scandal has the potential to rise in power real fast.

               I'm going to have to disagree, I remember this news and while it makes deductive (or is it inductive?) sense to say that's why the Russians did it, it was a little different than that.  First, Russians have human trafficking as well (not saying this to distract), even if it isn't as nefarious as baby fucking and eating, it still isn't great.  Two, the reason they did this was that there were lots of people in the US, especially wealthy people who were wanting to adopt white children.  If you are familiar with what happened with Native American children in the US, this can have a huge impact on culture.  I just don't think it is the case that what you say is why the Russians stopped adoption, I think its just to keep the ethnic Russians in Russia.

             Apparently this is a common conspiracy theory among Russians, that Americans steal their babies. For example someone who traveled to eastern Russia told me the passport control fot Americans is tight and he  remarked to the security guy  he explained that in retrosprct revealing cultural tidbit. At the the time i figurd it was absurd propaganda to explain away the depopulation problrms of their own alcoholic making

              There are UN #NGO groups (Haven, Findhorn, Esalen) linked to Tavist0ck, the clinton foundation through ARK - and they are all part of the centers gathering.org -- point is they have a program going called "kitezh" which is a russian orphanage and "youth exchange" that I think is a thinly veiled cover for trafficking.

              I wonder about organ trade in this, too; for in Sudan and elsewhetebits awful. Utube has a lot of videos on it. Each of these countries in desolate are also victimizing, pretingnon their own. Very inhumane. Interesting how any type of life's matter movement, ignores the most vulnerable and many prey on their own or ones from a different tribe.

               Whether it does, I don't know, but it could. Why not? They have medical facilities on site. Self-contained and who knows what they do. Especially Paule-Carres. Did you see what I added to the original post? Her part in this business is listed as "Unclassifiable Establishments"?!!! I mean, WTH does that even mean? I can imagine trying to open a business and giving that explanation for it.

                I've seen that in some areas.
               </p>
               <p>
                Instagram/etsy: animal/human body part sales/ black market trade has turned into onlinee stores. Sold as is, in jars, spine/skull made into lamps, skulls for cover entire wall, body fluids sold in tinctured wine jars.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sellers, mass followers, connect populace to elite society. I wrote hash tags of some on other posts.
               </p>
               <p>
                Organ trade. YouTube videos in Sudan from victim families/concern decent tribesmen.
               </p>
               <p>
                And 2009 Food Summit Africa/research/ new corp/ govt used term: Bio material food. That has a very broad, yet unspecified definition. One related, huge, ww corp, Ingredion. Their website front page has a lot. Cookie alert if go further. ( Obamacare corps in public health care, also use cookies, trace ISP ( read Teems of Use/ Privacy before ever go psst first page)).
               </p>
               <p>
                Bioanthro cultural question: Do families of long term satanic rituals /cannabilism feed their children these materials, and do ones desire the profit and convenience of these product ingredients in prepared foods/drinks/hotspices  to be sold at stores?
A. How big a market, viable industry?
B. Review normalization of satanism/pedo in school, govt rituals (Alaska), and psychological movement that is normalizing as a mental ( w no regards to conscious choice and anti life harm vs labelled correctly as pedo group serial killers) veiled under guise of religion and mental.

                  I too have noticed that many powerful dems don't look quite right.  They look haggardly and worn out and have misaligned facial features.  I'm not referring to "beauty" or lack there of because that's in the eye of the beholder.  there's something just creepy about them.  I've never publicly proclaimed this because it seems hateful as if I'm criticizing their beauty- but that's not it.  There's something creepy, and they don't look healthy.  Some look downright evil.

                  Again, this only pertains to SOME.  But many are high up on the totem pole.  Here's a few off the top of my head

                   Lol, don't feel bad, its not a beauty thing; but things are off, even from a movement therapy vantage point and osteopathic alignments of musculature, features. 
Skin has a odd tone, texture, light even hits it differently.
Energy is off, heavy, hits a creepy vibe. 
Eyes..dif direction, piercing, lids not equal open.
A lot of Abromo pics are edited, glossed up. A video of her in France, prior to museum, shows a lot more age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What is inside really can start to effect outside. One could dare a supermodel, know their inner traits and they become very unnatractive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So, don't feel bad for being aware, as it is not your intent to be rude, but picking up factors..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Good list..)) 
We are always supposed to trust our gut instincts..))
Aside, abromos Serbia/childhood history. I haven't seen much, have you?
You should see early Podesta. Its a lot like early Hillary. 
Somewhere, I saw, one Podesta might have done a job stint at a pig butcher factory. I don't know if its true, but if so, odd from the money he came from.

                   <p>
                    I searched podesta pig farm and yes, he most certainly worked on a pig farm and talks about butchering the pig in much detail here.  The dude is creepy- really creepy.  The article mentions his angry alter ego called "skippy".  Maybe he was abused as a child too so has 2 personalities??

                    <p>
                     Hi. Thanks! I thought I saw it somewhere, and I thought about how many serials have animal torture history, get jobs in various industries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Makes me think of something else. YouTube and Netflix had a bunch of shows on the history of nurse, psych, drs that would even murder at the hospitals, and hospitals would cover it up; even though was happening a lot in baby sections of the hospitals. USA and abroad, long history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     John Podesta seems to hang with three other couple a lot, most from Knox, with his wife Mary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Who is Tony and wife, closet social pals with. On wikipedia, I read up that he worked politically with a old famous actor that bought Hollywood forms, then sold his for mass coca cola stock. That one guy worked closely with Rob Weiner (Stand By Me).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Boy, are these Podesta's connected. Makes me wonder what Podesta kids are studying, doing, and their social circles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     On Washingtonlist.com 2016 Socialites, has a long list that includes Podesta, Clinton, Bushes, Kennedy, Scalia and so much more; even from Arab Emirates and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You might want to see that list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I find it interesting that Podesta's always were known for dinners, multi generational. What did they serve? I don't think abused, I think raised in that "culture to abuse and expected elite entitlement."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I'd expect from old neighbors, classmates, girlfriends, jobs and such; some might have info and hope they come out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Sometimes their are two alters for the public charming one is the rile play/ masks, and if group affiliated with ones like them, don't have to exert effort to hide it. Hence, his inner circles with wife would be interesting. Think Ted Bundy. Yet, I do know that Ted Bundy mom was raped from grandfather, from the brother who told someone and the town they live in, many know that info not put in news.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Some fams do not abuse each, but raise in this culture of creepy, have each others backs, hide crimes for each as it benefits them all to cover for each and each can be their deviant traits around each; without having to exert effort to play there public personas/roles/masks. ( usually known as "charming," in public; yet dating/spouses/kids might be abused and see the real creepy).
They could have been abused, but I think its like Chelsea, raised where this elite gluttony/control is the habit of expectations. 
I wonder if he got that job to learn butchering for a reason.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But, I did find on utube, a Rockefeller female, that speaks out, was abused on the Camelot_ Project show. Don't know what to think of it, but possible unexpected ally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Hope your having good week. Look forward d to see whatever you find. )) ..and will watch the video you linked. Thx for posting it!!

               Read the no corpeal punishment contract on Friday Babies. Very legally, loops in no corpeal, UNTIL final adoptive process done. Look at the definings on corporeal too, lock up small places, binding.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look at the contracts, eight applications on site. Must own home, and more. Clearly, elite only adoptions. Site also mentions children via overseas, so not just white USA or black.kids. App forms to answer, reveal more of that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wondering what is on their other adopt biz, that also includes foster.

So some state/fed under Glen, Patty, or the llc corp Guccifer. Would that not even mess up accounting? Even if Patty is listed as secretary under Glens filings, the llc is not on a lot of them to show the business relation to the corp and why their did offices would be under same filings, vs different. A medical billing is usually under same Dr office, or contracted to dog name and Patty's is a dif name from his psych practice.

                       Hey. I'll have to get back to you on a summary for I've been digging since last night and my brain and phone on overload. Lol
I have around seven pics uploaded out of 671 screenshots since last night, and hope I can upload as needed on VOUT with no trouble shoot issues.

                         Yes. I stayed up late, and researched bones. Found that bones are huge in multi ulondustries and research. 
Retsch, azo site, size reduction of human bones and bioceramics. German co.

                        <p>
                         Politico articles:
12/22/16: Trumps $440 billion weapon article. Focus on anything about federal grants, as CPs, public health care and more are all full of contracts violated. Links to a necessary read, Federal Regulation Acquisition book. Of course, reporter acts as if citizens or Trump could never figure out contracts, but it only takes effort to read that most with decent IQ can learn.A lot to read on all contracts, laws, related factors to contracts but I have done it for years, and it starts to get very easy to know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         What's also important about the article, for its an area I stress, document document all fed violations and advocate specifically to each on contracts to fully document they allow violate and coverup, or not possible to.punish them. Rick Scott ex in Texas medicare medicaid fraud is a huge ex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Its why I stress, calling CPS and inform record. Document is key of failures and violations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Also, Politico article, 10/22/16 Obama Failure to Sudan's Children and child soldiers vs billions from.USA and weapon supply.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Fbianon mentions subsahara a lot. Organ trade is huge in Sudan, warring tribes, easy to manipulate. Organ trade victims on YouTube by decent ones in Sudan, pleading for help.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Then, I need someone to archive areas that I found illuminati initiating in multi African countries. ( initiate in to do dirty work/fall guys as promise desperate the money and usually the desperate that already chose aggro/ violence/black markets. Sacrifice of blood relative and chickens required. Boy, mass desperado, even.posting their phone numbers, begging to join like losers vs demand corps build utilities and build up hygiene function villages of small biz to market to tourist economy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Always never the obvious and efficient and independent paths to thrive in dignity and non violence. The propoganda is blatant in the areas I need to find someone to archive.

                         But yah, burnt out. TBH, I already was before this all popped. It gets to a point that running on soul and heart, as transmute the neg emotions of appalling circumstances into fuel to research and advocate.

                         Its like Disney and Epcot are sets. Behind scenes and underground tunnels is inner workings vs the facade.

                         I found breaks, even short, the subconscious mind brings organization , comprehension, pieces together and leads.

                        <p>
                         I keep dreaming of bunion cubes. Know it sounds odd, but dreams very vivid and persistent, so looked into bones and found so much. I listed some, but found more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I'd fare better if lived by a techie partner. I'm too left brain dominant. I uploaded some pics with the site you said, but uploading is going slow and adding .PDF (?) Still did not work to upload on voat for me. I need to see if can archive, but tech limits on a cell and memory is very limited. I'll upload PDF then have to erase, after glean the data and cell works slow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I'm still processing the VA stuff I found and others, to see where to go on it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         And also, have strong urge to look into codes that Asange dropped. If he is fully legit, don't want to leave him hanging. Bothers me.

                          You just ahve to upload to that site and then when you post it to voat add the .pdf and it will allow people to open the image in the thread rather than an outside link.

NPI: 187150361
 Med license number: 0810001007
Taxonomy: 103TA0400X
Lists also not just clinical psych/but substance abuse disorder/addictions.
Trying to find all hospitals, institutions, drug addict clinics he might be contracted with. Saw one, I listed earlier. 
The oig yearly reports for Virginia child protective,  list what state agencies to route baby, child, teen patients and parents with problems.
So far, no Dr review sites are listing all his medical institution affiliations or what HMOs he uses. A patient could call, but trying to find. He is accepting new patients, lol.
On ratend.com a male patient wrote a review that the Dr CARRES is not sending papers for a pain procedure to another medical center. Patient leaves his phone and birthdate, from 2012. Dr. Poss, VA Brain and Spine Institute is Dr that patient was begging to have med reports sent for a procedure.

                 Of course, it's speculation. It's all speculation until something is proven, and nothing has. This is really helpful. Especially the first name. Thanks.

               Ah..you just reminded me, CP's court records, esp ones with crimes (satani,). I had found a long compiled list, think I wrote about it, one or two weeks ago.
              </p>
              <p>
               I saw on adoption agency review sites, not only bad reviews, but some carrying moms left phone numbers or emails. I found a lady on fb that wrote to a radio lady that is covering pgate that her child died in CPs.
              </p>
              <p>
               Finding those moms and more could lead to a lot info.

                The saddest site before PizzaGate:
                <a href="http://medicalkidnap.com/">
                 http://medicalkidnap.com/
                </a>
                They are also now censored, so the worst has been whitewashed.

            Just browsing the catholic charities :( My mom had to give up a sister of mine, I don't know her, she was adopted out through a Catholic Charities place though. It makes me sick to think people are thinking, ok Adoption is the RIGHT thing to do..someone can't have a baby. A GOOD family will get my child. So many people adopt out to these Catholic ones alone. Fuck. I think this is it. Wonder how long it's been going on??? My sister was born in the late 60's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope this saves children now though...sorry to post twice in your thread, but this lead here totally makes sense. Trump had best make this right. It's hard to contain myself much longer...being civil and all. (read civil disobedience on the car ride to the in-laws, and this is how revolutions start)

            Please incoming leaders reading here, spies, don't be inept..We love our country and the children are the country's future. Like my rights, I'll go to the mat for children's rights. How heated IS the atmosphere, how heated will they let it get?

             No need for unrest. We have laws on the books, we just need a leader strong enough to let our justice system do the work of clearing out all these aberrations. They are just in it for the money and power, and to get those commodities, they glorify evil. Protect our children. They are the most vulnerable, precious commodity. Now let's dig!!!!

              I trust in them mostly, even though I have seen the justice system needs work.

              I already see one of those adoption lawyers is married to a chief judge. This could be why our justice system is a damn mess. We probably will need to make sure that we hold those elected to those promises.

                 Put him on the list. We need to find out ... no get conclusive evidence that they're all working in concert. I think the stats from both adoption agencies are crucial. Find out how many children were placed in Virginia and domestically and how many overseas adoptions took place, and if these figures are in line with what's happening in other adoption services. Since it's private adoptions,  don't know if more than this would be reported and publicly available. Not sure even these will be, but we have to try.

                  This is precisely what we need for a RICO probable cause. If one of the lower level players is engaging in otherwise legitimate activities but the funds are being used for illicit activity, everyone in connection to the activity is fair game for indictment, as far as I understand the legal language of RICO.
