<p>Here is a documentary called Just Melvin, Just Evil <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY4eHaiVK9s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY4eHaiVK9s</a> 
The documentary was done by a victim of the family, which is why it is portrayed in a strange light. Almost all the daughters that were molested by this monster, went to see him in the hospital. This is real, this is how the abuse works and to those criticizing how anyone deals with sexual abuse/assault &amp; trauma...why they keep in touch, why they don\'t do anything, all I have to say is...you likely have never been sexually abused &amp; simply have no idea what it does to a person.</p>
<p>In all the documentaries I\'ve watched, I find the pedophiles lack remorse. I\'d say most are likely psychopathic or sociopathic. This pedophile, Melvin, is accused of killing a woman. </p>
<p>This next documentary is one is from male victim\'s perspective: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoOzqebOU1k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoOzqebOU1k</a> </p>
<p>In this one you hear the abuse stories from men, in such a honest self-aware manner. There is one man who said, as a boy he was jealous, at the time, when the teacher started raping another boy as he no longer felt special. These types of things are the most damaging, in my opinion, and the shame that follows from having those ideas as a kid. These men are so strong for making the documentary. Highly recommended.</p>',

               Oh my, that's really sad. So (((they))) were finally successful. What a shame.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's a pity that all the info he had on his site is gone.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some things I thought to be really important. E.g. that John DeCamp, who wrote about the Franklin scandal, most likely served as a gatekeeper, and was implicated as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, he pointed out that (((Warren Buffett))) was part of the pedophile perps crew in Nebraska, which was important, since Buffett always manages to stay under the radar.
              </p>
              <p>
               He wrote that in the British Hampstead case most likely all adults involved were fishy (the mother and her new partner, too), while the children were legit, which confirmed my gut feeling when watching interviews with the mother and her partner.
              </p>
              <p>
               And so much more...
              </p>
              <p>
               Hope his site can be still accessed by searching archive.org though.
