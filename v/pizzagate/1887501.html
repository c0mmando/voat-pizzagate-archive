             A DS agent was called off a case against US Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman over claims that he solicited prostitutes, including minors.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            “The agent began his investigation and had determined that the ambassador routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,” says the memo.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The ambassador’s protective detail and the embassy’s surveillance detection team . . . were well aware of the behavior.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy ordered the investigation ceased, and the ambassador remains in place, according to the memo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gutman was a big Democratic donor before taking the post, having raised $500,000 for President Obama’s 2008 campaign and helping finance his inaugural.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             At least seven agents in Clinton’s security detail hired prostitutes while traveling with her in various countries, including Russia and Colombia.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Investigators called the use of prostitutes by Clinton’s security agents “endemic.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The liaisons with prostitutes allegedly occurred in the same hotel where Clinton slept, according to sources familiar with the incident.
