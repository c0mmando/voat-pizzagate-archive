            This sounds like the description of a bad horror movie.  Putting it all together, what you have written is sounding more like some crazy Steven King plot with a very sick twist.  Also, there is an epidemic of abuse going on in the UK. Do people have their heads up their bums?  They are maybe as doped and asleep as people here as well.  It seems this Dearman has some real explaining to do.  Now.

            Why don't you explain why the kids were full of fresh cuts and bruises when they were examined by the doctor when the hadn't seen their father for three months
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh right, you can't because then you would have to admit that Abraham Christie beat and tortured.those kids to make them say the things they did (which they admitted was the true story after the police investigated some of their claims and found them to be bullshit), and all the while the mother stood by and let him do that to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or what about his past history of violence against his own children and hospitalizing his wife.  Or the child porn found on his phone.  Or that it was found he had drugged the kids.  Or that the boy is now deaf in one ear because he punched him so hard there.
           </p>
           <p>
            But you never want to talk about those things do you?

               None of your obfuscation obscured from the fact a paediatrician confirmed sexual abuse FROM THEIR FATHER.
Nor the fact Ricky Dearman has NON-MOLESTATION ORDERS for ABUSING THE CHILDREN'S MOTHER IN FRONT OF THEM.  Which he admitted on the BBC.

                No, if you actually read the doctor's report and also what happened afterwards with her peers, you will see they did not agree with her findings, however you want to spin it in his favour.  And yet again you refuse to answer how those kids got their fresh cuts and bruises.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anybody can take out a non-molestation order with no proof of anything and it means nothing as you well know.  How about you tell people how social services were called in because the mother locked the children out on the balcony in their nightwear with no food or water?  Ot what about when they would eat food out of the bins at school or steal from the other children because they were so hungry?
               </p>
               <p>
                People like you are almost as bad as the abusers themselves because you facilitate them instead of facing reality.  Abraham Christie tortured the children to make them say those things and all the real proof shows that.  You just live in his fantasy land where everyone in Hampstead is a satanic child abuser and the more ridiculous his story is, the more you believe it.  You need help.

                No she didn't.  Why don't you explain why her peers pulled her up on using a technique that was discredited 25 years earlier because it was not proof of abuse and she had to change her original diagnosis?
               </p>
               <p>
                And again, please explain how the kids had FRESH cuts and bruises on them when they hadn't been in touch with their father for three months and spent all their recent weeks in Morocco with AC and the mother?
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, why are they both on the run?  They know the police can't touch AC for the abuse he inflicted upon the children in Morrocco because it occurred in another country, but they can do him for the child porn found on his phone.
               </p>
               <p>
                So please, change the subject again, come up with more bs accustations against me and ignore these important questions yet again.  You only show yourself up as either a) the real abuser of the children or b) someone who supports him.

                        .No, It is you who are the one that is either a child abuser or a supporter and facilitator of one because you always ignore the documented real abuse done to the children.  Explain it to everyone here how they got those cuts and bruises otherwise.

                 Let's consider the fact the church at the centre of this, allowed an |art| snuff band to perform there with choir boys singing Charles Manson Lyrics.

                   I would prefer a criminal trial took place in a criminal court, where the accused were examined for identifying marks to confirm or quash the children's allegations, since tattoos aren't easily gotten rid off at short notice.  In a criminal court with a jury of public peers to cast judgement over the facts of the case.  Do you think that's unreasonable?

                    So why not show up at the court and stop running away and come out of hiding?  Afraid they will arrest you for the child porn found on your phone?

                     You are insane.  You know fine well Ricky Dearman told Alissa to put porn on the phone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Care to explain why even in the retraction video, Alissa admitted to looking at hardcore pornography with a friend, daughter of the BBC member, when that little girl was never questioned herself for follow up?  Is it normal for 6 year olds to have access to hardcore pornography?  Is that the liberal attitude of most parents at the BBC is it?  We know it certainly is in MADA VALE studios isn't it?

                  In short, one sick fuck named Abraham Christie (who beat his own kids, hospitalized his ex-wife and has a string of convictions for violence, fraud, firearms and drugs), latched on to a Russian mother with two kids for a few months and managed to beat and torture them into telling a fantastical story about how their father was head of a satanic pedo ring at a Hampstead school and local church, where the only person who was not in on it was the mother.  She stood by and let him beat the kids btw.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He took them to Morocco where he was able to torture them without being arrested in the UK for it and he filmed them saying what he wanted them to say.  He took the kids to a releative who was a policeman when they came back to the UK, who was so disturbed by the way he treated them, he reported it to the police.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They interviewed the kids, checked some of their story and drove them around trying to find the places they mentioned and when they confronted them that none of it existed, the kids broke down and said he had made them say it and that they hated him.  The medical exams (it was done twice) prove that the kids were physically abused in the last few weeks.but the doctor used an outdated and discredited technique to examine the children's genitals.  None of her peers agreed with her findings (which were based on the children telling her what Abraham had told them to say).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He and the mother did a runner out of the back and over the rooftops when the police came to see them (what mother wouldn't stay for the sake of her children) and his phone was found in the house which contained child porn, though it is not known if this was of the children or of other children.  The children are now much happier in care and wish to go back to their mother, but not while he is in her life.  This is always ignored by his supporters.  They have some contact with their real father, who they say did nothing to them and it was all made up by AC.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Since then, Ac and their mother have remained on the run and have occasional spurts of posting crap on internet forums under various aliases, where they never answer the hard questions like the ones I brought up, instead accusing anyone that questions them of being someone they have issues with (for questioning their version with real facts).

                   Wow.  I am flummoxed. Mouth Agape.  I have seen that short video of a guy sitting in a chair and questioning a child and the child says it all occurred in Morocco.  He insinuates it is all made up.  That is what it is all about, the trying to make the children seem like liars.  The children wanting to return to a Mother that took off and made a run on the rooftops with that pervert is very sad.  They need more help.  It seems everyone in this story needs serious help or time in the slammer.  STAT.

                    The mother allowed AC to beat and torture her own children in front of her and then she ran away with him rather than turn up for the court appearances for her own kids.  She chose him over them and continues to spout his paranoid and insane story rather than leave him and try and get her kids back.  But he has plenty of free drugs to console her with so that's ok isn't it?  It's very clear where her loyalties lie - with a child abuser she only knew for a few months before the kids were taken away.
