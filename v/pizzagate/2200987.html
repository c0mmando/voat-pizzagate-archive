            AwanContra is the other piece. Pakistan ISI (Muslim Brotherhood) was used as foreign operatives to manage rat lines and move trafficking operations. Infiltrated, stole secrets and sold them.

             The way you describe it is so simple yet these are not the articles written.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's like reading the submissions posted on Voat about PedoWood and then looking to see where the proof is. Even after the Weinstein scandal, we have no children involved, only a chorus of, "ME, TOO!" Really, these women were all raped by HW and were in a town where it was used as blackmail and they were forced to be involved in prostitution rings (this according to Kaya Jones)?!!!! Using skank Alyssa Milano effectively diluted the entire story. And did you notice that since The Cannibal Queen stated the POTUS admitted to "SEXUAL ASSAULT", that the mainstream media is now using this terminology with impunity? Saw MSN stick it in a story about Harvey Weinstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since Trump never admitted to "sexual assault", and was speaking about celebrity and the perks of being  celebrity, I don't see how grabbing a body part with the consent of the owner of said body part is assault. Like Affleck with the journalist he held on his lap. He kept squeezing her and telling her how firm her breasts were, but she says it was nothing. If she says it was nothing, it was nothing! That's how attraction works.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't know why what they're saying isn't slander, but I'm getting extremely discouraged. Uber so.

              Trump never got their consent.  That was the whole point.  He explicitly said.
"I don’t even wait."

             <p>
              As regarding the scandal in Hollywood a few of instances were actresses underage.  Laura Dern among them.  That came out today.

              Scientology has been completely revealed here in Voat. L.Ron Hubbard was a Thelma occultist involved in Babylon Working rituals with Jack Parsons (NASA) to bring about the anti-Christ.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have posted at length about this. Hubbard was a CIA operative. Scientology is a CIA blackmail scheme and mass mind control.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hubbard estate  in Washington DC has been directly linked Alefantis, Moony Cult, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Scientoligists do not speak because the program is based on confession of all flaws or sins with the reward that you will rise to the top of enlightenment.
             </p>
             <p>
              They start this out young and use blackmail. They record all coversatiin and confessions on tape and videotape. Stars are rewarded with better roles. Many like Cruise are brainwashed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hubbard was involved in MK Ultra.
             </p>
             <p>
              If they want out the church of Scientology will threaten them as well as leak blackmail information.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sounds like an intelligence operation right because it?

               No one will touch it. Not even when Leah Rimini is trying to tell people what's going on, but then she's positioned as a whacko who's nuts.

                No one will touch it because their lives could/would be in immediate danger.
               </p>
               <p>
                That was the point if you realize 
Scientology is a mass brain washing experiment to control Hollywood by forces within the the US.
               </p>
               <p>
                For instance. In John Podesta own emails he discusses the replacement of SCOTUS Justice Scalia for HRC. This is before Scalia actually dies. Think about that.
               </p>
               <p>
                Who was the person she was going to nominate. A very powerful person who was defending Scientology leader D. Miscaravich. Think about the serious and deadly consequences of that.
               </p>
               <p>
                One of the most powerful and influential men in the world who at the time had been inside the Obama Whitehouse and taking over the Clinton Campaign was discussing on his email the impending death "by natural causes" of sitting Supreme Court Justice of the US with the man who had been fighting on behalf of Scientology to dismiss any lawsuit or action in Federal Court against them viciously.
               </p>
               <p>
                Leah Remini is a hero for taking a stand and beginning to crack open the window at great peril if you have read her books or watched documentary. Sounds like you have and feel the same.
               </p>
               <p>
                She came out in public right away on her own television show which it seems like helped protect her. They may have miscalculated her and thought they could beat her down as crazy. Didn't work and she has the goods on everyone.
               </p>
               <p>
                Still the incredible danger she was in was obvious. The fact that HRC who was scheduled to be president was going to replace SCOTUS with a known cult (Intel blackmail scheme) is frightening. Truely.

                 I agree with what you're saying, but you're missing my point. I fully know why people are reluctant to out this cult. It's the same reason people won't out the PedoWood cult. But is there a strategy to out them? That's the point.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We're being outstrategized. Did anyone see that ridiculous, "ME, TOO" coming? And it's started by Alyssa Milano who is tantamount to a hamster on the wheel. No way she could have thought it up. So the HRC/Pedosta think tank does, the MK Ultra controlled slut Milano tweets it and dilutes what's going on. They also start sneaking in Trump "ADMITTED TO SEXUAL ASSAULT." No, he did not, and that statement is going unchallenged!
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm frustrated about being outstrategized and outmaneuvered. I know full well that if provable cases that lead to actual names being released starts happening, we'll get the momentum back and put things in perspective.

                  I agree they are attempting to outstrategize. They did this with a vengeance throughout election. How did that work out for them. Not well. They have complete control of Hollywood, media, social media algorithm's and Sensoring power, all the money, endorsements, etc.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They did not expect the insatiable appetite for freedom of expression, of choice, individuality vs Community. The surge in technology their greatest assets but also their potential downfall as human beings began to fight back against AI &amp; algorythims. Think about that people adapted against the matrix and began to innovate to beat the machine assimilated and changes stradegies on places like twitter faster than they could keep up. That has to have them in panic. That breaks mind control and proves their vulnerability. We have to snatch it now. Like in the #MeToo campaign. That was highjacked yesterday intentionally. Pizzagate researchers took it back and flipped it on them by attaching pedophile stories to it of Hollywood, of Alefantis Instagram pictures with children, Joe Biden groping children went viral in #MeToo.

                  I am discouraged as well but we have to grab their tactics and fight back.

                   Agree with this wholeheartedly. They're amping up the strategy and Soros filled the war chest, but taking their tactics means being on the defensive. We need a strategy! Not just play off of their strategy!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We have some phenomenal people, and really, you're wrong about their strategy during the election. It would have worked except for Assange ... and Comey. Have no idea what got into him to do what he did, but I give The Devil his due.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Of course, when I say Assange, there's the mysterious person who leaked those emaiils. Our best guess was Seth Rich and he paid with his life IF it was him. And Rich's death I want solved. I'm hoping that an avenue to solve his murder will come about in the Awan trial, I still hope so, but the strategy would have worked. Oh, and I give Trump major props, too. They definitely underestimated him. They tried to ruin his chances when he and The Kenyan got into duking it out over birth certificates, but it only made Trump more popular. So there were mistakes ... the biggest one seems to be in hiring Seth Rich.
