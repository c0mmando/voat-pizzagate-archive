            Texe Marrs interviews Dr. Henry Makow on Illuminati.  The You Tube is still up although it isn't the book about Cathy O'Brien. "Eight times a year they practice human sacrificing." He refers to his website that is now scrubbed. The audio is in detail although not about Cathy O'Brien.

            Too bad the HenryMakow.com is down. He had quite a few articles, well-written and informative and spot on about Cathy O'Brien.

            Mark Philips helped Cathy O'Brien recover her memories. Some question how he got the 'codes' to access her multiple personalities and think he's CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brice Taylor said she spent a lot of time and money with O'Brien/Philips, only to have Philips ultimately pronounce that her recovered memories were B.S.
           </p>
           <p>
            Taylor claims the center of child trafficking in the U.S. is Las Vegas, Philips says Muskegon, MI, I recall. Taylor claims she was abused by Henry Kissinger, Philips says he has no reports of HK as an abuser.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shaela Miller apparently talked to Mark Philips after a speech and eventually became convinced she was also a mind-control victim. Her family has put out YouTube videos saying this is not so.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before all of this the original mind control victim was Candy Jones, in the book The Control of Candy Jones. She was a famous model married to a radio host, I believe, who suddenly realized she had multiple personalities and believed her alters had been programmed by spy agencies.

            If you click on the online book above, the first few pages are a foreword from Mark Phillips.  Keep clicking through and you will see some photos, business cards, letters written, etc.  She documented it very carefully and has continued to speak out although she was never taken seriously by the powers that be. In fact, true to form, they debunked it almost immediately saying Mark (the guy credited with rescuing her) is suspect, trying to make money, etc. and that Cathy is not credible. When I was first trying to find the paper book, I remember reading (and I can't remember where) that all first printing copies had been mysteriously bought and removed from all shelves, which made it difficult to get her story out.

            I've tried to keep an open mind, but I don't believe Cathy &amp; Mark. I think if her story was true, they would be dead. To believe her, I have to believe that Ronald Reagan had sex with her. I don't believe it.

            "Cathy O'Brien and her handler Mark Phillips have apparently kidnapped a young girl named Shaela Miller and are mind controlling her."

           <p>
            They now have a young woman who lives with them who claims she is a victim of child abuse and mind control. Her sisters put a video together to refute their sister's claims. I believe the woman has been manipulated by Cathy and Mark. She has been living with them for over 8 years now. She is 27 years old. Not a healthy relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the woman's sisters. There are also others who have said the couple have taken advantage of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there's plenty of PizzaGate related current events that can be investigated and tied to crimes that can be proven. I think we should be investigating the current connections.

             The problem is that if you believe there is high level pedo networking going on the accounts are all too plausible, but they seem so over the top to the average person.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Personally besides the issues with Phillips, I don't like all the exact quotes of cheesy dialog. Also these accounts don't fit the model of networked child abuse revealed in the UK and Belgium. In those countries innocent victims are easy to find; I imagine the pedos would get more kicks debauching a completely innocent victim than someone groomed for it since a baby who doesn't even remember the abuse due to compartmentalized personality. Just my opinions I'm sharing; not trying to convince you all.)

            I have read Cathy's book. It is a very difficult read because she is very detailed about her horrific abuse and the abusers. Her ability to remember details is a result of the mind control/programming she experienced since a young age and throughout her abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found a summary of Cathy's book, which I think is quite accurate. If you don't want to read the book, the link below will give you an overview. However, to truly understand what this woman (and her child) experienced over their lifetime, the book is much more detailed.

            This is a partial list of some of her abusers from the above link:

            Freemasons, police, a priest, Satanists
           </p>
           <p>
            Guy VanderJagt (from above link:  "On one occasion, both he [Guy VanderJagt] and Ford brutally raped her in an horrific threesome backstage at a political parade; they then took the stage in front of the crowd which included all of Cathy's schoolmates to present her with a US flag which only moments previously they had inserted into her rectum."
           </p>

           </p>

            If anyone doesn't want to read the book or doesn't have the time, this woman has several of her talks on YouTube and she provides a lot of info on her experience. It's fascinating, but there are also claims that her husband, who is ex-CIA, is her handler and controlling what she releases. Who knows!

            I read her book. She explains it was to be a report to congress. Had she known then she'd make it a book she said she would have made the report leas graphic. But she was to write it up for them exactly how she remembered it all.  Congress knows all about this. I'd say there's more of them than the good guys.

             I would be nice if you pointed out relevant parts instead of just dumping and entire book on us and expecting us to see what you see.

              She has done YT videos where she opens up about a lot of the stuff, but of course the book will be all inclusive.  I hate the ebooks. I like regular printed books.  I will wait and buy it.  I just watched the one with her and Roseanne Barr.  Amazing.
