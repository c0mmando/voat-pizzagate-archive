           So it's 3am on a Saturday night. Seeming as though I have nothing to do and since I've just recently got into the pizza gate community, I decided to call Comet ping pong, just for shits and giggles. Their website says they're open late, so i figured I'd call them, just to see if anyone would answer. Well, sure enough I get an answer.

           Surprisingly, they were pretty chill dudes who just seemed to be really frustrated and bothered with the amount of unwanted harassment from people looking into the investigation.

            They don't close before 11pm, at least not when bands are playing. At least when there is live music, the show doesn't even end until 2am much of the time.

            Well, someone posted the Facebook profiles of the Comet staff the other day. As far as I could tell, they seem like the typical lefty denizens of DC. A number of them had children of their own, and seemed to treat them well. Now, one would think that if your place of work was just a front company for a criminal ring, you might know about it. That's not necessarily the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagine setting up a front company pizza place that really just existed a distribution point for heroin. Are you going to hire a bunch of people you know are addicts, and tell them it's a front company? Hell no. They'd be in the back room all day, every day.. people getting dropped off at hospitals every week. Maybe they'd shamble out once in a while and freak customers out. Instead, you hire normal people, and get maybe one or two trusted guys to handle deliveries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same thing here. If you have 20 kids in a basement.. do you expect a bunch of pedophile and sadist staff to be up topside working for $15 an hour when they could be downstairs with their hearts desire? No, you hire normal people and never show them the secret basement. Otherwise, when people walk in, they'll be greeted by deranged blood soaked people, and that sure as hell isn't good cover for the operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm all for doxxing as part of the investigation, but we shouldn't be harassing people until we at least have solid evidence that they, as individuals, did something wrong. Also, perhaps wait for their circle of people to be investigated as well. We tipped these people off, and hard. Do you think there's any incriminating evidence left at Comet Ping Pong at this point? If people threatened innocent staff - that's not good either. I mean, I don't want to take the witch hunt out of the witch hunt, but can we at least figure out who the witches are before burning them?

            Here's a quote from someone who says he used to work there: "It is a pedophile ring. I am sorry; not everyone there is complicit but the men behind the scenes are."

            The people you were talking to may know absolutely nothing particularly if they were hired fairly recently. There may even be considerable turn over among the staff, so that only those with a continuous history of employment there may be in the picture.

             If they're there that late after hours they know SOMETHING. And GLP is hilariously paranoid I miss it. I think the AMA is bullshit though he didn't release any tangible evidence, no smoking gun just wanted to say he worked there put himself in danger and that's about it...i personally would of never said anything
