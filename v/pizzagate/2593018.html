<p>If you want to understand why CNN is so biased against Trump and other Republicans, it’s helpful to know that their staff is made up of various people who have very real connections to the world of politics.
Even the daughter of former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett works for the network.
Jarrett has long wanted to work in television news, </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Who is Valerie Jarrett (or VJ as #Qanon refers to her)? Why did Governor Rendell from PA, aka &quot;Fast Eddie&quot;, have his staff member solicit VJ\'s help with 60 &quot;orphans&quot; from Haiti? We know from the WL post these kids were allegedly orphans before the earthquake...#wikileaks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are the &quot;2 women&quot; from Pittsburgh affiliated with the Catholic Church? We know that per the NY Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/americas/24orphans.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/americas/24orphans.html</a> …, the Hatian envoy to the US refused to approve the request to remove the children from Haiti as they were not in the adoption pipeline. #Qanon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heck, even American Child Protection Services asked questions that should\'ve raised major red flags as to why Eddie Rendell flew down to Haiti to &quot;give assurances&quot; the kids would be okay...once again, the 2 American women are mentioned, but not by name...#Qanon #wikileaks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And of course, guess who shows up to &quot;help&quot; with the process...The Red Cross...those who follow #Qanon know that the Red Cross is a slush fund for VJ and Hussein; unfortunately, the RC, per Q\'s posts, is involved in much more that will come to light, including trafficking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Times article mentions the two American women...A screenshot of Jamie McMutrie\'s Twitter page...last post was 2014...https://twitter.com/jamiemcmutrie?lang=en … ; Their non-profit, Hatian Families First, Twitter page...  <a href="https://twitter.com/HaitianFam1st">https://twitter.com/HaitianFam1st</a>   #Qanon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am in no way implying these 2 women did anything nefarious, but I do think questions should be addressed to them in relation to the whereabouts of 12 of the children who whisked out of Haiti by Rendell and why Valerie Jarrett was involved to ensure they made it out...#Qanon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at all the names enlisted to help get these orphans to the US...knowing all that we know now about the Red Cross, VJ, Rendell, HRC, I want to know what happened to the orphans? where are they now? #Qanon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the 2 American women decline interviews a year later? what is it that is bubbling under the surface that they refused discuss? Some of the children were adopted, but the process is so confusing....  <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2011/01/12/Fallout-felt-from-airlift-of-Haitian-orphans/stories/201101120262">http://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2011/01/12/Fallout-felt-from-airlift-of-Haitian-orphans/stories/201101120262</a> …   #Qanon</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>9...some of these kids could\'ve easily slipped through the cracks of the system and been placed with traffickers such as was the case with many of the 1500 immigrant kids...this story harkens back to Laura Silsby\'s attempted kidnapping of Hatian orphans in early 2010..#Qanon</p>
<ol>
<li>My original question was &quot;Who is Valerie Jarrett&quot;....she was Hussein\'s handler in my opinion...she was and is undoubtedly involved in a lot of the coverups of his administration, and the fact that Rendell reached out to her is telling...#Qanon</li>
</ol>
<p>‏</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thanks to WL and #Qanon, connections are being made as to how the elites obtained orphans from Haiti...Q\'s post talks about the Clinton connection and RC connection...Now we know VJ was always ready to step in if there were obstacles re transporting orphans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its interesting how all the players #Qanon exposes re human trafficking were involved in making sure these orphans made it out of Haiti, and of course, the mother hen at the top was Valerie Jarrett...END</p>

Think young Jarrett might have access to people and sites not avail to others?
I think she put her there to communicate w/ DeepStaters......

            Jarrett worked as a private practice attorney prior to joining the news network, according to her CNN bio page. She has some experience with her beat, having defended “companies and individuals in government investigations brought by the Justice Department,” as well as other government agencies. She does not, however, appear to have any journalism experience. Her last publishing stint came while she attended Harvard Law School.

            Must be nice.  She does not, however, appear to have any journalism experience.  Well, par for the course and they need someone to be another Little Puppet at CNN.

            Q has brought Haiti up multiple times and figures prominently in the tweet thread. I will give this the "QAnon Storm Watch" flair.

             Whats wrong Vindicator is your Q cash flow dwindling since Q got exposed? Traffic to your merchandise sites and donations bottomed out?
            </p>
            <p>
             I am pointing at you because I do  not think you are dumb enough to still believe it. Since I don't think you are dumb enough to believe the Q jive anymore I have to wonder why you persist in pushing this scam.

              why the fuck is there this kind of politics here? who gives a shit if V believes Q? I don't follow Q much but I don't mind seeing the posts either. if nothing else it gets people looking into shit instead of bitching about nothing like you seem to be doing.

               Because its been proven to be a damn scam hands down. The Q frauds are bilking honest people out of their damn money thats why. Politics has nothing to do with it, but integrity and character have everything to do with it. Not to mention that obviously a lot of people in the forum don't like for the forum to be affiliated with fraud because it weakens the cause. If you had kept up with Q you would know that, so maybe you should not yap about shit you are clueless about.

                maybe you should donate your time and contribute where you can instead of bitching about what people are talking about. I stay off facebook to avoid immature gossip shit and you fucks keep bringing it here. if Q is a scam then submit a well written post containing what you know, by all means share your thoughts on relevant matters, but do so intelligently and stop attacking people who share different views than you.

              gives no fucks what anybody but him thinks and he is demonstrating that clearly. That Q sticky has 29 votes on one side and 23 on the other at this moment.
              <strong>
               So he is telling 44.2% of the people that voted that they are only "brigaders" and they are his to "mine salt from." His words, not mine.
              </strong>
              And at the time he told all those that disagree with him they were just brigaders to be mined for salt there were more down votes than up votes. He clearly gives no fucks what anybody else thinks but himself.
