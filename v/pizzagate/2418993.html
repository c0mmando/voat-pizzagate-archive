            This is highly disturbing.  The pedo-elite/globalists are in the middle of a full blown assault on both the 1st and 2nd amendments.  I'm not going to lie down and take this.  That much I can assure you.

            There is a false argument going on. The question isn't whether the Florida shooting was "Real" or not. It obviously was real. The real question is, whether Cruz was programmed to carry out the shooting, and by whom. Knowing what I know, and I know ALOT, there are groups operating at a very high level which includes doctors who do carry out programming which can only be described as MK Ultra type programming, which includes drugging the victim and electro-shock 'therapy' to do certain things. How do I know this??????? They tried to do the same exact thing to me. It didn't work on me for a number of reasons, but I can easily see how a foster child like Cruz was ripe for their pickings. I think we need to start researching how many of the mass shooters at schools were victims of similar programming.

            That said, it's obvious the perpetrators agenda is gun control and taking away American's constitutional rights. They will continue to take advantage of their media stranglehold to push the pro gun control narrative every time this happens, and obviously this will not be the last if they are allowed to continue to take advantage of vulnerable kids and program them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, it's very troubling the censorship Americans face at the hands of American companies like YouTube and google, but honestly, what did you all expect when over 70% of the internet traffic is controlled by a few corporations? Just like the television media.

             There is nothing obvious about the Florida event being a real shooting. I haven't seen a single piece of convincing evidence (e.g. imagery from CCTV) that this was anything other than a hoax. It is also not obvious that the purpose of the hoax (or false flag for the sake of argument) was gun control. Every time there is an event of this sort, gun sales increase. If you were a gun manufacturer you might be quite happy to see events of this occurring on a semi-regular basis. It may be that the real purpose was to make ordinary people feel unsafe, to get them (even more) used to a regulated world of barbed wire, metal detectors and armed guards. It's a bit of a fantasy that the American citizenry is ever going to be disarmed. For the elites to exert greater control disarmament hardly needs to happen. Owning an assault rifle doesn't mean you are not a slave.

            As scummy as I think David Seaman is, I wouldn't call for him or anyone's banning on YouTube. This is crazy. I guess Alex Jones wasn't exaggerating about him about to be banned by YouTube.

             Anything on Reddit is a total censorship, left leaning liberal orgy. They are not the Reddit they used to be years ago.

            Soviet style censorship is taking place right now in America. Differing views from that of the "establishment" are either being eliminated or shadow-banned. Truth seekers and those wishing to have a conversation regarding the activities of government / corporate controllers are being shut down and shut TF Up.

               This is all coming from the left and the big tech companies which are extreme left (relative to this country at least).

             Out of everything that is happening with youtube and florida, hitlery should be in jail, along with her husband and podesta.  Youtube has created another distraction from what is going on behind the scenes with these sick depraved satanic mofos.  They should be hung from the highest rafter.  I imagine a world where all people, including libtards actually get and understand what the clinton's and podesta have been doing for decades.  They would be tar and feathered and dragged through the streets and then......well, you finish the fantasy.

              I completely agree with you. Social media has such a large and participatory audience that it has put a definite crimp even at the U.S. Postal Service level. E-mails far outnumber snail mail. We have a God given right to free speech anywhere in America and in cyber-space ! We've been led down the primrose path and are headed towards Soviet Style persecution if we don't get the monolithic companies like google and facebook in line with what most Americans believe to be critical to freedom and that is free speech.

            There has been a little youtube massacre going on. Titus Frost has a couple of videos about it. So does Nathan at Lift The Veil channel.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Just checked and Titus Frost is now terminated too. He did a lot of pizzagate videos too. This is his backup channel that is still up. It has different content which is why it is not banned, yet. His videos about the mass bannings are not on this channel though. Titus Frost is also on Steemit.

            I was permanently banned from you tube for COMMENTING on vaccine safety and especially for commenting on and documenting that Trump's wall needed to be UNDERGROUND to stop drug and human trafficking through tunnels under the border.

             I was permanently banned from YouTube for spamming David Seaman's Channel. I don't blame them, I got carried away. Luckily, YouTube accounts are easy to make. Makes me sad David Seaman is banned, now I can't spam his channel anymore :(
