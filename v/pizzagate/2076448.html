<blockquote>
<p>Ex-BBC News correspondent Liz MacKean has died after suffering a stroke.</p>
<p>MacKean, 52, worked for the corporation for more than 20 years but left in 2013 amid a row over the decision to shelve her investigation for Newsnight about disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile.</p>
<p>She began her career at BBC Hereford and Worcester, before presenting on Breakfast and reporting from Northern Ireland and Scotland.</p>
<p>MacKean went on to work on Channel 4\'s Dispatches programme.</p>
<p>BBC director of news James Harding paid tribute to MacKean, saying she had earned a reputation as a &quot;remarkably tenacious and resourceful reporter&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In Northern Ireland, she won the trust of all sides and produced some of the most insightful and hard-hitting reporting of the conflict,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was as an investigative reporter that she really shone, shining a light on issues from the dumping of toxic waste off the African coast to Jimmy Savile, the story for which she is probably best known.&quot;</p>
<p>The mother-of-two studied at Manchester University and gained a post-graduate diploma in broadcast journalism before joining the BBC.</p>
<p>MacKean\'s story about the child abuse committed by Jimmy Savile was dropped by Newsnight in 2011. But the investigation with producer Meirion Jones was later recognised by the London Press Club with a scoop of the year award.</p>

            But why 5-6 years later? After the story was pulled/unveiled. Unless there was evidence that she was going to release some previously unknown information related to PG/Saville - I don't get why she would have been UKilled off this late in the game?

             If you read the article closely it says they "shelved" her investigation. She was looking into more. They told her stop. I'm guessing she dudbt stop or maybe she did then started investigating again after pizzagate broke here in America??

             Very likely that she would have continued her research and investigation ....
and either had new details to add or more discovery to report.
            </p>
            <p>
             She would have continued fighting the censorship of the story on Saville and
whatever else she knew about it and worldwide pedophilia -- what we can pretty
much call "Rule by MKULTRA/Monarch."

              Source? Or just an assumption? It seemed like she had moved on... but, it would be incredible to find out otherwise.

               A summing up of who Liz Mac Kean was --
              </p>
              <p>
               A journalist who had higher ethics than the BBC and resigned to protest the censorship of her story on Saville.
              </p>
              <p>
               And those who worked with her made that clear ....
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                "remarkably tenacious and resourceful reporter".
               </p>
               <p>
                "In Northern Ireland, she won the trust of all sides and produced some of the most insightful and hard-hitting reporting of the conflict," he said.
               </p>
               <p>
                "It was as an investigative reporter that she really shone, shining a light on issues from the dumping of toxic waste off the African coast to Jimmy Savile, the story for which she is probably best known."&gt;
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Also --
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                'I was very unhappy the story didn't run because I felt
                <strong>
                 we had spoken to people who collectively deserved to be heard and they weren't heard
                </strong>
                and I thought that that was a failure.'
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 The reporter also added that she felt 'responsible' towards the victims and felt she had let them down
                </strong>
                .
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               The Saville story serves as one of the guideposts for international pedo-gate, or maybe even one of the cornerstones . . . but no one begins with the Saville story and then ends their research/investigation there.

             If you read the article closely it says they "shelved" her investigation.  She was looking into more.  They told her stop.  I'm guessing she dudbt stop or maybe she did then started investigating again after pizzagate broke here in America??

            The Londonistan Hutton inquiry also closed the Dr David Kelly medical reports for 70 years, he was a weapons expert who said Iraq didn't have WMDs, at a time when the Bush dynasty wanted invasion he was also a key member of the inspection team visiting the USSR and former Soviet states on several occasions. People like Richard Clarke added to the 'conspiracy' behind journalists like Michael Hastings, saying the crash is "consistent with a car cyber attack".

             Absolutely.  Just thought we should look into it.

             The guy in Florida with a bag over his head and a note that said no foul play etc - that's VERY suspicious.

             I'm hoping some Brits can find some more details surrounding her death in case it's quite suspicious like that guys.

              Unfortunately, the overwhelming rise of the right wing which can only rise on violence, assassination, intimidation, threats, stolen elections, right wing propaganda .... points to the likelihood that murder is has regularly being used and will continue to be used by them.
             </p>
             <p>
              As we've seen even from Obama's attacks on journalism in his effort to be able to label them "terrorists" all of our corrupted governments are moving towards wider secrecy.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Hutton Inquiry (see above@Chippy Tubes) closed the Dr. David Kelly Inquiry for 70 years.
But recall that LBJ first tried to entirely prevent an investigation/inquiry into the death of JFK and 
then was forced to set up the Warren Commission (which was well fixed) and then closed the records 
and documents of the investigation for 75 years!
             </p>
             <p>
              It is only corruption of our government officials which permits this to happen.
             </p>
             <p>
              AND, there are still people trying to deny that the Royals were involved in setting up the assassination of Princess Diana for her work in trying to end the use of landmines.
Basically, her work for Peace in the world.
A very dangerous activity, indeed!!

            No. It was a while ago. I was just reading up on yet another "conspiracy theory" that the Deep State has Gas Lighted into obscurity.

            Yep, fucking Dick Chenney tried to steal 6 nuke tipped cruise missiles. And get this, make sure you're sitting down:

            ONLY 5 WERE RETURNED TO MINOT AFB. ONE IS STILL MISSING.

            And tomorrow is August 21st. That's the day of the "Black Hole Sun" eclipse. It's also a Satanic high holiday. And I'm starting to freak out just mentioning it.

             White hats are on high alert regarding nukes on the eclipse.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I made that post a week ago about "going dark to make some preparations", I meant spreading warnings everywhere about eclipse false flags. Hopefully, it pays off tommorrow.

             A lot of spooky posts on 4chan about Tomm.  I wasn't freaking out about it until some guy posted on 4chan that bloody satanic sacrifices or rituals by the one world order would be going on all day Tomm in Wyoming on some mountain - forgot the name.  Maybe Casper mountain?? Something about demons being able to break through for the rapture to begin.  I didn't take him seriously until at the end of his post he said if you don't believe me check my digits.  His thread digit ended in 666!  4chan automatically assigns you a thread number.  There's no way to control it.  Maybe he's a computer wizard or he works for 4chan etc but I was totally spooked by his post when I saw his digits

              Most likely he's CIA and 4chan is a limited hangout. It would make sense for them to do a head fake to some place in Wyomming and then light off a nuke somewhere else.

              Who knows. All I know for sure is Dick Chenney is the Spawn of Satan. He probably doesn't even have a heart anymore. He's kept alive by pure unadulterated evil.

            These people are all fucking psychotic and will kill anyone who gets the goods on them. Just yesterday I was reading up on how Dick Chenney may have orchestrated that "accidental" transfer of 6 nuke tipped cruise missiles from Minot AFB to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few non-psychotic Air Force brass got suspicious and started digging. Yada yada yada Air Force personnel at Minot AFB started having lethal work "accidents" like it was going out of style:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              All died within 7 days of each other in 'accidents'

            The "Lime" implies a drink and "cide" being killed. Poisoned by a drink is what the English would do. It's cleaner than something you'd see in Arkansas from a bunch of red neck Nazis masquerading as Democrats.

             ...  at least one Broken Arrow is floating around out there from the Minot incident, I'm certain of it.  I suspect it is the nuke that North Korea will 'drop' on Guam.  Guam is an ideal location for a trip wire isolated single nuke attack.

              My money is on these psychotic mother fuckers putting a nuke in a shipping container on a container ship. The reason is the USS Fitz and the USS John McCain have both been accidentally "rammed" by a container ship and a tanker. The first could have been a coinkydink the second in the same year is TPTB doing a little foreshadowing so the public buys the story when it actually happens.

                Limeycide sounds better this morning. I see your point. The "Lime" implies a drink and "cide" being killed. Poisoned by a drink is what the English would do. It's cleaner than something you'd see in Arkansas from a bunch of red neck Nazis masquerading as Democrats.

                Bee tee dubs the expression "Limey" is in reference to a compulsory British Naval beverage called Grog which was

                 water, rum and lime juice.

                The purpose was to get the common sailor to get a daily does of Vitamin C. It's hard to maintain a robust fighting force if your sailors don't have the teeth to eat what little they had to eat as it is.

                 Thank you for pointing out just "why" Europeans started looking for some place to go, other than Europe.  Too much population, too little usable land to farm, no food, and most in Europe knew something had to give if they wanted to survive.  So, when the SJWs start screaming about the white man taking over the New World, they need to realize it was going to happen, sooner or later.  A starving mass from a large continent that could not sustain it, is going to go on a search, basically for food.  And, if they think this whole land mass we are sitting on was going to remain unpopulated and unused, they are idiots.  Plus the food was horrible and tasteless-thus, the search for spices and condiments began in the 1600's.  I do wonder, though, what is taught in high schools and colleges about just what di happen to start the western migration.  Are they teaching that everyone who got on a ship to the New World were filthy, horrible plunderers and wanted to destroy this "untouched" land mass? (I am referencing the Antifa manifesto that someone was able to get their hands on, where they talk about "White Privilege" and how they want to destroy all that is good and important about this country.)  But, I digress-thank you for reminding me about all my history classes and the fascinating info about how we came to be the USA. (Hunger, Food, Spices, basically)

             Wow.  I completely missed this story.  It's disgusting how they kill off so many people.  I can't understand how they live with themselves.  I wonder what Megan McCain knows.  It's hard watching her on Fox and not wondering about whether or not she's an idiot or if she just pretends not to know, or if she knows but doesn't care.  I always wonder what the family members know

              They can easily live with themselves because psychopaths don't feel guilt, empathy, love, or shame. They feel as bad about killing someone who is inconvenient to them as most people feel about swatting a mosquito.

               They aren't Psychopaths though. Dick Cheney is a classic Malignant Narcissist upto and including the typical traits like abuse and heart disease.

                 Completely wrong - this falsehood about Psychopaths being Narcissistic came about because researchers like Hare mixed up people who were Narcissistic/ Sociopaths with Psychopathy and thought that Psychopaths falsely considered themselves superior because they are almost totally logical and have no respect for Human hierarchical systems. Psychopaths are only Narcissistic if its a means to an end, but its never an end in itself unlike Narc/Sociopaths.
