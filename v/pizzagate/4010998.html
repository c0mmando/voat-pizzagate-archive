            Horrible that such a thing exists, but the backlash is heartening. Especially enjoyed reading Brother Bob's words

            He says
           </p>
           <p>
            "Good afternoon folks! Thank you for all being there to make your voice heard against the pedo party and child trafficking and abuse!
           </p>
           <p>
            When I used to go on vacation and if someone asked where are you from? Then I proudly said Holland!
           </p>
           <p>
            But that pride is slowly disappearing! How can you be proud of a country where a political party can be founded where making pedophilia legal is one of the positions? How can you be proud of a country where there is no investigation into large-scale ritual abuse? How can you be proud of a country where the minister of justice saw no reason at first to ban a pedo handbook? This same minister who imposes insane fines and measures on the people for corona, but then ignores it himself! How can you be proud of a country where a large-scale pedo network consisting of high-ranking employees of the judiciary has been covered up for years?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this the Netherlands we want to live in? This trend has been set in motion since the 70s! In 1978, as a VVD Member of Parliament, Ed Nijpels wanted to legalize sex between adults and children by removing the age limit of 16 from the criminal code.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Liberal was also of the opinion that serious consideration had to be given to even the 12-year limit being dropped. On TV, Minister Brongersma of the PVDA and openly pedophile promoted normalizing sex with children!
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dutch constitutional state is nowadays rather selective in its legal protection. All kinds of injured groups are allowed to obtain their rights with full media attention and support from the government, but they seem to fail completely in wanting to protect the really without any doubt the most vulnerable in our society, namely our children '
           </p>
           <p>
            We are ruled by pedos, but we are also the number 1 export country for child pornography! Two-thirds of all child pornography worldwide comes from the Netherlands! Where's the outrage? Where is Robert M's hard drive? Where are the parliamentary questions?
           </p>
           <p>
            How could this have happened? Where were the provos? Where were the nozems? Where were the hippies? And where was the normal Dutchman to speak out against these sick pedophile power-hungry people?
           </p>
           <p>
            At school I was taught that these youth movements were rebelling against the establishment! Well we saw that! Or is it the left liberal hippies who traditionally see no harm in sex with children because of their peace and love views? Make love not war, well I say no more!
           </p>
           <p>
            Every year 250.000 children disappear in Europe! That's one child every two minutes! In the Netherlands, 2000 children disappear per year, not to mention the children who disappear from asylum seekers' centers or children who are not registered. Or the pregnant women who disappear from the radar!
           </p>
           <p>
            We live in a time where all information can be found on the internet! We will no longer be fooled! We are here today for the children and against the pedos! And that we can be proud of the country where we live! "
           </p>
           <p>
            Well said, Bob. 👍
