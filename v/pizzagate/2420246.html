            There is no reason to uproot a mango tree in the Carribean to save it. Mango trees grow wild very fast and people harvest from them along the roads. So the tidbit from the message sounds completely useless... or incredibly disconnected. Like people going to a grossly underserved area and saying: "These people obviously all need fitbits, let's fundraise to get these people fitbits."

            Hi, what are doing is called anomaly hunting.   You don't have full information about this operation, and based on the limited information you have, you're looking for things that "don't add up." This not really a valid way to find things out.  Basically, you're starting off with position that something is wrong, and then you use the anamolies to justify the conclusion that you started out with.

           <p>
            This is a great example.  Why would you think they are growing mangos at Caracol?  You have some text from a from an email that refers back to previous conversations we weren't part of.
           </p>
           <p>
            Caracol Park was never about growing mangoes.

           <p>
            This is not a fact.  This exists.  It existed before BlackIvy existed.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not slave wages.  It's the minimum wage in Ghana.  It's half of the average wages in the country.

            If you really want to find the out the facts, read The Truck That Went By.  It's by AP's long time Haiti Reporter.   You can also read the GAO reports

             They specifically say they are moving two mango trees from Caracol Park to Caracol housing. What are you even talking about? The context is in the email.

              You completely miss my point.  There's a minimum wage in Ghana.  It's set by the government.  It has nothing to do with Cheryl Mills.  It exists.
             </p>
             <p>
              And the two website you linked are based in New York and the UK.  Might be why they are surprised by what Ghana's minimum wage is.  Even the Kenya journalist doesn't seem to know that Ghana's minimum wage is not from off Kenya's minimum wage.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you would have no development in countries because wages are poor, ten of millions in China and India would not never have gotten out of poverty.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the controversies at Caracol Park before Caracol Park was built was they they were taking fertile land away from farmers.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               On the first anniversary of the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake, in a sleepy corner of northeast Haiti far from the disaster zone, the Haitian government began the process of evicting 366 farmers from a large, fertile tract of land to clear the way for a new industrial park.
The farmers did not understand why the authorities wanted to replace productive agricultural land with factories in a rural country that had trouble feeding itself. But, promised compensation, they did not protest a strange twist of fate that left them displaced by an earthquake that had not affected them.
...
Residents reclaimed the land from the sisal and sugar cane plantations in 1986, after the dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fell from power. They divided it into hundreds of small farms, many paying yearly rent to the government and some others squatting.
...
But it was the Haitian government that had selected the site, the development bank said, after an American consulting firm, scouting northern locations, included it among the top three options. The government-owned Caracol site was considered to have the best soil and water resources, which was also why it made good farmland
...
The Haitian government paid the farmers for the harvest they lost and promised them alternative land elsewhere. All the farmers interviewed said they were frustrated being idle and had already burned through the cash.

              This is the backdrop for the Mills email, they only had to move two mango trees, i.e. there was less disruption than I thought.   You seem to think there is supposed to be a mango plantation at Caracol.  You might be the only one who thinks that.

               You might be in the wrong subverse, if you aren't able to at least imagine why a State Department tied company, who works with South Korea (whose president is a known cult member) might be able to use inductrial parks next to ports for nefarious purposes. Especially... since the thread was deleted mere minutes after it was created. But I'll bite, since you still seem to be missing some information.

               BlackIvy produced a Power Point presentation to present to potential investors. This is the document where they were focused on the low minimum wage to help Sae A in the textile industry. They've been muscling into port towns and cutting red tape with governments and do you imagine that they aren't going to use their State Department influence to keep Ghana "competitive"? So, yes, "pushing" for a competitive minimum wage in this context is unethical, at the very least.

               You are suggesting the earthquake? or a storm? caused damage to mango trees and they were "threatened", so they moved them from the industrial park, which was cleared and then built upon, to the housing they built, which I still don't see on the map.

              <p>
               I think these emails are old enough that if you could point me to the housing complex, then I could just look for myself on any number of satellite images and find the trees.

                Here's a fundamental disagreement we have.  Mills pushed for nothing.  She is not talking about lowering wages.  She has zero effect on what the minimum wage in Ghana is.  At the time of her presentation it was 7 Ghanaian cedis a day.  It's now 8.   She had influence on it being 7 and no influence on it being 8.

            May I, however ask you to self-delete and repost, please?
           </p>

            Unfortunately, headlines can't be edited on Voat, and the headline is a bit unclear when it comes to point out
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Why you decided to revisit 'mango trees' (I know why, but other users, especially newbies, may not)
2) What the relation to pizzagate is
           </p>

            (Please see our rules in sidebar, rule 3, when on mobile, please switch to desktop view.)
           </p>
           <p>
            And, while you're at it, could you please add two or three sentences what exactly the 'mango code' is (or might be), and how the Clintons might be implied, so that the relevance for pizzagate is shown? Thank you! (Please see rule 1 in sidebar.)
           </p>
           <p>
            You can save the source of your post by clicking 'edit', then just copypaste it to a new submission sheet. I'll leave the post up for twenty minutes, so that you can save your source. (It's 6:20 East Coast Time now.)
           </p>
           <p>
            After that, I will unfortunately have to delete it, and ask you to edit and repost.

           <p>
            Again, excellent post, please repost with new title and some intro!
