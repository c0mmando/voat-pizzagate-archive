<p>&quot;I got one piece of evidence you might like. We do KNOW the hospital was George Washington University Hospital. I was approached a week ago by a woman who...I dont know to describe her...she\'s actually very afraid for her life...I\'m not sure why...but shes afraid to get involved in this. She is a federal contractor in the health arena....and its Geroge Washington hospital. She\'s actually conducting a bit of her own investigation trying to find out who these doctors were who worked on Seth. But thats a group who does not want to talk and right now thats all we know.&quot;</p>
<p>My god...how is this even an investigative team? They are claiming truth based on something an anonymous woman SAID? Where is the proof? Its careless to even go out and publicly state something like that so bold and say he KNOWs its GWU hospital, simply cuz a woman who fears her life said so? If he had proof, he would have shared it, but nothing other than her word.</p>
<p>So lets take a look at something. If you look up directions from Flagler St where he died....Medstar Hospital is 3 minutes away and has a Trauma Center. Someone could literally have just walked him over there, thats how close medstar is. <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/directions/from/us/district-of-columbia/washington/20001-1613/2134-flagler-pl-nw-38.919040,-77.013750/to/us/district-of-columbia/medstar-washington-hospital-center-355373924">https://www.mapquest.com/directions/from/us/district-of-columbia/washington/20001-1613/2134-flagler-pl-nw-38.919040,-77.013750/to/us/district-of-columbia/medstar-washington-hospital-center-355373924</a>  We know they can treat gun shot wounds cuz they flew Scalise there of all places. </p>
<p>Howard University Hospital is also 3 mins away and walking distance, but while they do have an emergency room, they don\'t have a trauma center that could have operated on Seth. </p>
<p>George Washington Hospital is 12 mins away. <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/directions/from/us/district-of-columbia/washington/20001-1613/2134-flagler-pl-nw-38.919040,-77.013750/to/us/district-of-columbia/george-washington-university-hospital-278508732">https://www.mapquest.com/directions/from/us/district-of-columbia/washington/20001-1613/2134-flagler-pl-nw-38.919040,-77.013750/to/us/district-of-columbia/george-washington-university-hospital-278508732</a></p>
<p>Why would they pass up MedStar Health, who is superb enough to fly in a congressman who was shot, and drive seth for almost ten more minutes to a further hospital? I mean surely Medstar wasn\'t jam packed with emergency operations at around 4:30am. Wouldn\'t it make most sense to take him to the closest hospital that can treat the patient who had just been shot multiple times? Or were paramedics just wanting to take a scenic route? This just does not make any sense. Especially considering all the ties people have discovered with Medstar and Podesta with Jack Sava, Bonnie Levin, and Jen Palmieriri\'s sister. So why is this investigator stating he &quot;Knows&quot; the hospital...but provides no proof. Is he part of the problem and trying to take attention away from Medstar? I woudn\'t doubt it after seeing this same Lobbyist is also claiming Seth Rich\'s murder was linked to Russian operatives. <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/238926113-story">http://www.fox5dc.com/news/238926113-story</a></p>
<p>Something aint smelling right here. Just cant imagine making a decision to take a gun shot victim in critical condition to not the nearest hospital to treat him at, but one almost ten minutes away. Pretty ballsy for them to do that to someone in need of an immediate operation. While I do appreciate profiling projects suing for more info on Seth Rich...I am just shocked at how he can go on a press conference and confirm its GWU Hospital, based on some woman who told him so a few days ago. He calls it &quot;Evidence&quot; too. Not sure I can trust reporting from a guy that careless, especially one who is a top D.C. Lobbyist.</p>',

            Nobody, NOBODY in any hospital is going to come out publicly, with their names and talk about Seth Rich.
Why? Because all hospitals, doctors, nurses, IT workers, etc that work in healthcare are bound to very strict HIPPA laws, and anyone talking about Seth Rich will not only lose his / her job, but he / she will probably be sued,
           </p>
           <p>
            Get it?
So, NO, don't be surprised if you don't have any names attached to anonymous hospital leaks regarding Seth RIch,
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody is that stupid to risk their job over it.

           </p>
           <p>
            NOBODY in any hospital is going to do any "investigation", because accessing Seth Rich's medical records without permission or just cause, will be flagged, fired,  fined. and will never work in healhcare again.
           </p>
           <p>
            This story is complete and total BS.
No doctor, nurse, or healtcare worker is going to risk the entire careers and livelihood, and break HIPPA laws to play detective.

               Holy crap...I just watched it. At the 14:45 mark or so, when Webb is saying its odd no one will say which hospital...Wheeler flat out says "Oh its Medstar. Oh yeah..its medstar". Webb asks if he can confirm he went to medstar and he again said "Yeah". Wow...that settles it. Which is odd that Jack Burkman the guy leading the profiling project, went live to say he has new evidence and confirmed Seth went to GWU Hospital which is almost 10 mins further from medstar. His proof, was that a lady told him so. If he was such a great investigator and so thorough, then how did he not know that about Wheeler confirming it, and taking some ladys word he said he met a week ago?

                Honestly, I think the whole Seth Rich story is probably a school play like Sandy Hook.

            Okay, I'm completely out of step with y'all. I don't know why you're coming down on this man so hard. He's saying in no uncertain terms, "THAT THE POLICE ARE BLOCKING AN INVESTIGATION AND WTHHOLDING EVIDENCE FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON AND THAT IT'S OUT OF LINE WITH OTHER INVESTIGATIONS"!!! THAT'S HUGE!!!! HUGE!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess it's because someone that we can identify is finally stepping forward and naming the hospital? That's why you're blasting him? Because he's disagreeing with some jerk who posted ANONYMOUSLY on some website, and y'all are angry because you believed this ANONYMOUS POSTER and don't want to shift gears because we all went crazy and collected evidence on MedStar?!!!! Hey, admit it ... WE WERE WRONG! We have to stop this nonsense. If this guy confirmed it's GWU Hospital, it's most likely GWU hospital! Then we're tearing apart that assertion because it's an ANONYMOUS WOMAN when when it was an ANONYMOUS MAN that posted the disinfo? And it's isn't an ANONYMOUS WOMAN. HE knows the woman ... he's not giving out her name because SHE'S IN FEAR FOR HER LIFE!!!! Another huge admission.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop bashing him and see if you can connect new dots! It's ridiculous to go with believing some jackshit poster who knows medical lingo over someone conducting an investigatioin! Plus he's filing suit for the ballistics report/medical examination,etc. You think it's not going to have the medical hospital on the examination report? He'd only have to say he was mistaken if and when he does get his hands on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Y'all are being helped and going crazy at someone trying to help. I can't see anything except that he's helping. At this point, I'm tending to believe it was GW where he was taken. I know there was TONS of discussion at the time that SR should have been taken there, but now since a douchebag poster said MedStar, we're going to all believe that instead of listening to this new evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay .... all right ... I'm keeping my mind open and not trashing this guy. I thought the guy that posted the original crap was shady, but if you think the man who uses his correct name, holds a press conference, and actually says the police are acting very unusually and that SR was killed by A HIT MAN, you're dismissing.

              It doesn't matter! You can't assign motives without knowing more. He's helped ENORMOUSLY and people are trashing him? His group concluded the homicide was NOT a botched robbery, that the police are acting very strangely, that not releasing the medical report defies logic, and that a contractor FEARS FOR HER LIFE! He's put that on record. Further, he's making his name known, standing and answering questions ... and making himself available. So instead of getting mad AT THE ANONYMOUS POSTER WHO LIED ABOUT RICH BEING BROUGHT TO MEDSTAR, we take our anger out on this guy?
             </p>
             <p>
              If we want to be taken seriously, we need to be accountable for our actions. And trashing MedStar and Dr. Sava was done because we took someone at their word. Now here comes someone that might be offering the truth, and we're dismissing it because why? There's no reason. Again, I remind you that before that JOKER came forward, everyoone on Voat assumed Rich was taken to GW. It was only AFTER the disinfo hit that MedStar came onto our radar and everyone changed their minds.

             He said he met her last week and she feared for her life and was afraid to even go to him. Then right after he says she's conducting her own investigation? Whynifnshe is already fearing her life?
            </p>
            <p>
             while I appreciate his efforts in helping shed light on the case, it's very suspect for him to do a year long investigation and then come out and say he "knows" it's George Washington university hospital because a lady told him so. He even admitted the doctors aren't talking. So he is literally taking some woman's word on it and provides no proof. Add that to the fact that medstar is walking distance from where he got shot and GWU hospital is over ten mins away. Why would they pass up a prestigious hospital with a trauma center like medstar which was the closest available hospital capable of helping Seth and instead driving ten mins down to another hospital opposite direction? Your willing to throw everything away about medstar just because a woman told this man so a week ago and despite him providing no proof and admitting doctors weren't talking? lol.

              The same reason we're all doing this! If you're not scared of these people, then you're not taking the allegations seriously. And it makes perfect sense to me ... and should to you. What you're leaving out of your explanation is that THIS WOMAN IS NOT ANONYMOUS TO HIM. That's what you're leaving out. The asshole that pretended to work at MedStar is anonymous TO EVERYONE! This woman isn't. He knows her. And anyone who knows anything about the ambulance system knows that people are not brought to the closest hospital ... they're just not. Yeah, if one is five minutes and the other is three and a half hours, they'll go with the five minute one. Then there's the construction and dead ends caused by it. Do you think Google mapping really takes that into account? Even if the route were clear, it's not an outrageous decision to bring him to GWU ... it just isn't. Hence, before that nutjob showed up posting bogus claims, Voat users assumed he was brought to GWU and were SHOCKED when he was brought to MedStar.

There's nothing so far to contradict what this man has to say, and he's fighting for us in getting those reports released! We should be talking about how to support him, and not trash him because he went to college.

               You said..."Let's get our heads out of our asses and at least see if this is true.There's nothing so far to contradict what this man has to say, and he's fighting for us in getting those reports released!"
              </p>
              <p>
               You do realize that there has been nothing that contradicts the Medstar workers info either right?
              </p>
              <p>
               Add that to the fact that Medstar is within walking distance, has an amazing surgeon in Sava, who he and is wife has connections to Podesta, a man who could quite possibly have a role in the death of Seth, and add in the other connections to Podesta at Medstar, like Bonnie Levin who is assistant Vice president of Pharmacy Services, the girl who drove 3 kids for JP's entertainment in the hot tub, and Palmieris sister who is a nurse there. When Medstar immediately kicks out Alicia Powe from WND for asking Seth Rich questions and escorting her to her car and asking her to never return...it all just to me sounds quite more possible than Mr. Jack Burkman "New Evidence" which was that a lady told him so. So until Burkman can provide atleast something better that the Medstar stuff...I ain't buying it from the DC Lobbyist. And its sad that despite some of the connections to Podesta and Clinton to workers at Medstar, especially the Director of the department Seth would have been taken to and the fact that its WALKING DISTANCE..and though you nor anyone has been able to disprove the Medstar theory...you called it "Disinfo" and said the OP "WHO LIED ABOUT RICH BEING BROUGHT TO MEDSTAR" is an "Asshole that pretended to work at Medstar" and you went on to call him a "Nutjob" and a "Joker"
              </p>
              <p>
               If you re-read my post, I actually said I appreciate him bringing light to the situation. I didn't attack him the way you did the guy you can't disprove. Regardless if the lobbyist is giving disinfo, he is shedding light on the Seth Rich case and for that I am happy cuz this case needs to go mainstream. But for you to go and call the Medstar theory which has not been disproven, has the right people involved if Seth were to have been taken out at a hospital, was walking distance from site of shooting...and call it "disinfo" without explaining at all how it has been disproven or explained how that is such an unreasonable theory, is counterproductive. But please, by all means, follow the hard evidence that a lady told Burkman it was GWU and let us know what you find.

                Okay, this is downright ridiculous. The story you posted contradicted the MedStar worker. This guy says Seth Rich was taken to GWU. That is a contradiction.

               <p>
                Done. Believe what you want and I am glad you're happy about the light being shed on this case. I hope to hell he gets that damned medical report, etc.

                 You said "There's nothing so far to contradict what this man has to say"...I assume by that statement you mean that nothing thus far disproves this man's theory. Which is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I said "You do realize that there has been nothing that contradicts the Medstar workers info either right?" As in, nothing has disproven the medstar theory either. Which is also true.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A man telling us that a women knows Seth went to GWU does not mean the Medstar theory is no longer valid. All it means is that there is another possibility. But when you look at what has been discovered with Medstar and the fact it was walking distance from where he was shot...to me atleast...has more weight than what we know about GWU...which is that someone claims they saw him there.
                </p>
                <p>
                 At last, we finally agree on something. I hope he gets that medical report as well, but with all the corruptness in our gov, I shouldn't get my hopes up.

                  So she said he died there. Is that the same as being initially brought there? It would be really squirrelly if he were transferred. I'm not saying he was, I'm just trying to investigate here. This is not an attack on you or anyone else. I just want to get to the truth ... same as everyone else.

                  Again, it's someone putting his name out there and submitting to a question and answer session. Anonymous posters .... not so much. Do you have a link to him saying that? I seem to recall he did say that ... or was alleged to have said it.

            something is definitely not right here. I know its not the most popular theory but everything that I'm reading keeps coming back to the most logical conclusion is that his death was faked.

            Just adding this theory for further consideration: Burkman genuinely believes he has been told information that is correct, but the mystery woman is the one that has been pushed forward to provide the disinformation.

             I've been pondering that thought as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             But for him to interrupt the man speaking to say he has new evidence and then when the reporter asked if it was confirmed, all he said was a lady told him? I mean, how does that confirm anything. Right after he said none of the doctors are talking there...so then how is he so positive. Just hard to imagine an investigator putting together a report such as he did, then going and saying "Oh I know who did it and can confirm it cuz some lady told me." Just a little harder for me to believe that cuz I can't imagine he would go live with something that important, all based off something a lady told him a week ago and with doctors not talking? How has he been able to confirm anything then without anyone talking?
            </p>
            <p>
             Appreciate the different angle though.

            Rich didnt know he had been shot?  B.s.
No mention of the bruises on his body in the report.
Listed his sexual preference as "straight" vs heterosexual.   Not written by college students.

              This is an excellent question! Research why it was listed as "straight" and why so important. Details will catch the lies.

              The anon that had us looking at the Mayor Ginther photo made it sound like there is a lot more to this.
we figured out names and where, and the links to orphans and child rescues, but i just know there is more to it.
its like a shiver under the skin...and im still digging,  not stopping yet. His name was Seth Rich, and he didn't deserve this.

             I agree. Its definitely a red flag, which if they are part of the problem and looking to provide disinfo...then why are they also suing for more Seth info? That part throws me off.

              Yeah, so while The profiling project is collecting information on a year old possible homicide, He gets 'approached' (1 week ago) by surprise surprise, a mystery lady - "afraid for her life and doesn't want to get involved", but has involved herself conducting her own investigation. Well WTF .... I mean that whole scenario he laid out sure does sound like legit billy wank. Bad bad script writing, Pure BS disrupt, divide, deceive ... / imo.

               Haha. Thanks for pointing that part out about her not wanting to involve herself, but then him saying later she is conducting her own investigation. Why would she try investigating the doctors who worked on Seth if she was even afraid to go to him and feared for her life. Like I said, smells like BS.

            I have been saying this from the very beginning.  MedStar MedStar MedStar.  It is a no brainer.  Heeeeellllllloooooo????? Why would you take anyone with a gunshot wound to an ordinary ER hospital when you can go to one with a trauma center. DUH.

             Exactly...or in the case of Jack Burkmans new "Evidence"...a woman telling him it was George Washington University Hospital....which happens to be almost 10 extra mins away than a perfectly capable hospital in Medstar. Makes absolutely no sense. Huuuge red flag for me.

                  I'm actually reading through the report now.  Before finishing, consider how fast Hannity was pulled off the air when he started talking about the SR story.  Some facts surrounding the story are off limits for the public eye IMO...but the MSM needs something to show they aren't ignoring the most recent buzz about the case, because for the moment that would look suspect.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Brad Bauman has been called "a professional Democratic crisis public-relations consultant who has frequently criticized President Trump."  No surprise there, send in a crisis management guy, it WAS during the election year and PR is key, especially for someone like Hillary.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Bauman is the former Executive Director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In that capacity, Bauman oversaw the legislative, communications and political operations for the second largest caucus in Congress. Prior to that, Brad served as Communications Director for various members of Congress and numerous targeted Congressional campaigns Brad was named a Rising Star in American Politics by Campaigns and Elections Magazine in 2004."  Right, send one of the best to manage the crisis coverage.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So all that didn't prevent the public's concern about the DNC having a possible motive to kill SR if indeed, he was a source for WikiLeaks.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And like a gift of Manna from the PR heavens, the Profiling Project drifts down with such an air of investigative lingo.  But this work also stems from a crisis management company.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Selig Multi Media, Inc. is the parent company of Profiling Project and also owns PR News Channel (PP and PRCN together serve as a training ground for up coming PR grads).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  From Oct 4 2016:  "Comments from crisis management expert Glenn Selig were featured in this week’s “Us Weekly” cover story on the bombshell breakup of Hollywood’s power couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “I am very proud to have been called by “Us Weekly” to offer my expert crisis management opinion on the public relations impact of this public breakup on the careers of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie,” says Mr. Selig.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  With a circulation of over 2 million, “Us Weekly” is an influential weekly celebrity and entertainment magazine based in New York City.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Mr. Selig is the strategist-in-chief at the global public relations firm, The Publicity Agency. He is an award-winning former TV news anchor and investigative reporter who enjoyed a successful 20-year career in news before starting The Publicity Agency (TPA) in early 2007.  Mr. Selig and The Agency have been involved with some of the biggest crisis management PR cases in the U.S. and many notable, national and international publicity campaigns."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Why continuing input of  Expert Crisis Management for a murder investigation about the 'failed street robbery at 4:30 am" (rhetorical question).  We had round one, Bauman, a loyal MSM, and the  NeoCon supporting Burkman's involvement with his "reward" money, but now also we have the Selig Multi Media Inc. involvement, again with Burkman.

                  "Effective crisis management handles the threats sequentially. ....As a process, crisis management is not just one thing.  Crisis management can be divided into three phases:  (1) pre-crisis, (2) crisis response, and (3) post-crisis.  ...Ultimately, crisis management is designed to protect an organization and its stakeholders from threats and/or reduce the impact felt by threats."

                   There is always so much on here, and I mean to get back to reading, but am distracted as usual.  Thanks for reminding me to finish the report.  If they have hired a crisis control co.  there seems to be more to this than they are letting on.  As we well know.  You have and are doing really great research on this and I thank you for that. Unless people are use to doing research they don't know how long it can take.
