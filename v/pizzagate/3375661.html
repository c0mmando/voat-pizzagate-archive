<p>Another thing I remember but can\'t find right now was a YT video talking about &quot;The Ants Cult&quot; or something like that when a person over heard their neighbors baby monitor while they where trying to setup their own. Apparently they heard the neighbors systematically abusing there kids. They where reported to the police and the kids where saved but apparently one was supposedly actually an adult. Apparently that was some where in Europe though so it wasn\'t the FBI involved but just seemed to be weird and slightly similar. The last one I can\'t find the vid anymore but it was on the series &quot;The Stuff They Don\'t want you to Know&quot; on YT. </p>
<p>Anyways my point is I\'m wondering if once these kids actually escape these trafficking rings do they immediately go to cops, then the FBI takes over? Or is this some crazy coincidence? I don\'t know but the fact that multiple kids come forward and possibly tried to expose pedophile rings and immediately get fucked over seems fishy. Do you guys think they where making it up? </p>
<p>Related to pizzagate and pedogate cause they where trafficking kids possibly and also <a href="https://voat.co/u/vindicator">@vindicator</a> is a faggot.</p>',
