             APLE (Action Pour les Enfants) is the main pedo protection NGO currently operating in Cambodia. Their donor list is currently "down for maintenance" online but what i was able to find out tangentially is that the Soros groups fund them, Microsoft Seattle is a major donor as is Terre Des Hommes our of the Netherlands. The last organization is another child protection NGO which has come under fire in Ethiopia for having a convicted pedophile run their NGO orphanage - Terre Des Hommes pedophilia (

             On February 7, 2008, WMR reported: "WMR has learned that pre-teen child trafficking and prostitution is now rampant in Cambodia and that the trafficking is known and abetted by French and U.S. intelligence agencies operating out of the French and American embassies in Phnom Penh. A recent visit by
             <strong>
              FBI director Robert Mueller
             </strong>
             to Phnom Penh that coincided with the opening of an FBI office in the Cambodian capital stressed Cambodia's cooperation in the 'war on terror.' Child trafficking was not discussed. In fact, Mueller's Cambodian counterpart, Hok Lundy, the chief of the Cambodian National Police, has been accused of involvement in human trafficking, including children. Lundy was granted a visa by the US Department of State to visit Washington despite having been refused previous visas due to the trafficking charges against him.

             On November 9, General Hok Lundy, the Cambodian police chief cited in our November 4 report, was killed in a helicopter crash in Svay Rieng province in the country's southeast. The pilot, co-pilot, and a Cambodian army general were also killed in the crash.

            From Wikipedia: "Human Rights Watch described Hok Lundy as "represent(ing) the absolute worst that Cambodia has to offer", and said that "aside from his boss, Prime Minister Hun Sen, there is hardly anyone in Cambodia who has shown more contempt for the rule of law than Hok Lundy"[7]"

             APLE, fights trafficking. On the face of it, APLE went after the Russian paedophile. Behind the scenes they are doing the trafficking; aiding and abetting the pedophiles. The director of Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) has since been charged by police after sexually assaulting at least nine residents at an orphanage he ran in 2013 and 2014.

             Philippe Broaly, a former judge from Lyon, was arrested last week and accused of sexually abusing seven boys aged between 12 and 19. Broaly is the president of Enfants du Cambodge, an NGO which partners Cambodian children with donors in France. But Broaly was also the president of the Ecole Francaise de Sihanoukville.

             Veha Long, 32, Cambodian founder and director of the Underprivileged Children School in the northwestern tourist hub of Siem Reap province, was arrested for trafficking at least four teenage students. He was accused of asking the teenagers living at his home to give sex to foreign donors.
