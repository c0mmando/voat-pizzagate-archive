             Not only will it get worse, but removing postings to fustrate and burn out citizen investigators is how it can get this bad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Censorship and the ease of removing information under the guise of red tape is the oldest trick in the book.

            Well, to start off, there seems to be different accounts about how the Little Babies were found.

           </p>
           <p>
            Found by construction workers
           </p>
           <p>
            So what IS the story?  There also seems to be a goofy backstory about the guy taking over the funeral home to help people that can't pay for funerals.  Hmm.  What in the world kind of horrid biz could be going on here if the Cobras are involved?  That answer could help solve this.  I think there is something really much more nefarious going on here.  Someone is hiding what was really going on there.  Did he take money from women that wanted to bury their still born babies and he just didn't bury them?  Idk, but this whole story is making me sick.

             I'm not skilled at this investigating thing, but I got an eye for what seems connected. If the mods remove this, it's no hard feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm wondering if the Cobra's are connected, due to that issue. Taking money and not burying the bodies. Maybe the trafficked girls having kids and needed a place to deal with the babies? They can't just bury them without state knowledge. Having plots, etc.......so storing them in the ceiling was likely temporary and something happened, like the Cobra member getting caught, so there was no rush.

              You can bet they have Satanic Ties.  This gang is evil, the way I figure it they found out what they need to do to make more money and going beyond the norm.  If MS 13 is passing them up you can bet they want to get in the game too.  They love Recognition and being known as the Most Evil.   There was a case in Chicago about a woman that was looking for her daughter for weeks, the whole family was.  She called hospitals, pd, she called the morgue many times and they swore she was not there.  Well, there was a big stink because they found bodies piled up in the morgue for weeks, maybe months and the heads were going to roll. The woman found out her daughter was one of those bodies.  She lost it in front of the morgue and lunged at the Big Shot and they grabbed her and put her in jail. So now she has a mugshot.  They treated her daughter like a piece of garbage.  You can bet there is a lot of this going on all over the country.  I found out that story while researching organ harvesting.  At that point, how do we know, when their bodies are so emaciated, that their organs are not missing.  Think about it. Do you really think we will be told what condition those babies were in?  I think not.

               Phone records and bank records are the only real way to figure out if anyone in that funeral home has connections with known Cobra members OR city/state/federal officials.

               Some trails can never be swept away completely, but it takes people like the FBI to actually gain access to the needed info and a willingness to do their jobs.

                You are so right.  And.  They will definitely not reveal information like that, if it exists.  Can you imagine?  OOPH!  Yeah really no one would pay attention except us.  I can't even think whar would grab someone's attention anymore.

                 There was a time when the untouchables were incorruptible. A time I would like to see happen again, during my lifetime. Realistically, they are seen as the untrustables by much of society. The FBI have the knowledge, power, authority, and resources to go after damn near anyone on earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Think back to the Boston Marathon bombing..............how long did it take the FBI to find cell phone data, giving them images of the two they seen from security cameras in the vicinity? It took them not long at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                 LE in general can solve so many more cases if they wanted to. There is no real money to be made by finding lost children. They would rather hand out traffic tickets, than to spend time finding out easily gathered information. Most from social media.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Check a missing kids social media. Most times, they will find the kid was speaking to the abductor or to one of their friends about someone new they met. Cell phone and bank records show all the proof they could ever need to find most abductors. ALL phones GPS would say if you was in the vicinity of the missing child's location, at the time they went missing. Bank records show when and where money is added or withdrawn, or spent. This all builds a huge picture of what state of mind you're in and possible motives due to deviations from previous spending habits. Also, if you got a large sum of money from someone, it leads back to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The FBI is not filled with ignorant people. Just seems to be seeded with compliant lapdogs that won't risk their careers to do their jobs and help children that ain't their own..........This isn't every agent, of course, but seems to be far too many. How many busts are just taking down government competition or solely for public relations image?

                  This is the problem.  The ones at the top or heads of depts. in large cities they are the ones that say what goes.  There are many that want to do the right thing but are controlled by their bosses.  We have the technology, I know that.  I am not up on all of it of course, but I too believe that what you say is possible.  They have much more than we even know, if they can spy on us then we know if they wanted to find them they really could.

            It may just be the result of lazy nogs.  Remember that guy whose job it was to cremate people and instead he tossed them in a swamp nearby because that was somehow easier?  He ended up giving the family cinder block dust instead of the remains of their loved ones.

              sister sub, many Pizzagaters go there and read posts. There aren't any strict rules like there are here (posts don't have to show an elite connection f.i.), and it's great for posting the more speculative stuff. I also post there often.

              As I see it, ES advocates for fact-based research into elite pedophilia and human trafficking. I generally appreciate his posts. If heâ€™s using two or three alt accounts, as has been alledged, I agree that would be problematic. But thereâ€™s no way his alledged few alt accounts are responsible for the tons of down-votes of QAnon related posts. The number of ES alt account is vastly overrated  (this dawned on me when I myself was accused of being one of them).

              I like you Vin, youâ€™re well-meaning, I donâ€™t believe your embracing Q implies youâ€™re deliberately trying to derail the investigation. You just have blindspots. As we all do. I, for my part, do hope to be proven wrong re. Q.
