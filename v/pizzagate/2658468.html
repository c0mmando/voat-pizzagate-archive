             "HOW DAVID ASIMOV, THE BIGGEST CHILD PORN PROCESSOR IN CALIFORNIA SKATED AWAY FROM FEDERAL PRISON WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS"
            </p>
            <p>
             David Asimov, of Living Oak Court, Bennett Ridge, Santa Rosa, the son of
the late science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, was sentenced on March 28, 2001 to
 six months' home detention with electronic monitoring and three years federal
 probation for possessing child pornography.  U.S. District Court Judge Maxine
 M. Chesney sentenced Asimov after reviewing a series of sealed psychiatric
 reports, one of which was ordered by the court.  Asimov who was charged with
 four federal counts of possession of child pornography with each count
 carrying a five year sentence, pled guilty to two counts in a plea bargain
 deal.  There was no forfeiture of any of Asimov's assets in this case,
 despite his owning a home in Santa Rosa purchased in 1996 for $375,000, and
 despite his receiving $3,000 per month from his father's estate.
 How did Asimov, who possessed one of the largest stashes of (child) pornography in
 California, skate away from federal prison?  A look at the players yields the
 answer."
            </p>
            <p>
             ""There were thousands of disks, thousands of videos," said Sonoma County
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Deputy District Attorney Gary Medvigy, who personally referred to Asimov's
home as a "processing center" for child pornography. "Anything imaginable
regarding sex between human beings and human beings, or human beings and
animals, was there. Whatever your imagination can conjure up, he had it. It
was like walking into a TV studio"  Santa Rosa police seized scores of
computer disks and approximately 4,000 videocassettes from Asimov's home,
and
approximately 1,000 of those videos contained child pornography."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             "&gt;In addition to the videotapes and computer disks recovered, police
reportedly
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              found video cameras, several VCRs, and a costly table-top scanner to create
computer images. "He had a whole lot of editing and mass production
capabilities," Santa Rosa Police officer Zamudio said. "We were greeted by
thousands of tapes, disks, periodicals, and commercial videos with covers
showing child pornography. We spent two days collecting, packaging, and
transporting all the items.""
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             "&gt;Deputy District Attorney Medvigy stated about the dismissal, "We had hoped
to

              show that it was not just for his personal viewing pleasure.''
U.S. Attorney MUELLER delivered a sweet plea bargain to Asimov."

              Another CP factory for the elite. and the LA Mafia possibly David G and Bronfman. Wonder what happens to all those collections.  There could be hours and hours of viewing for years and years for the LAPD.

             Pornography as a Secret Weapon
By Lasha Darkmoon -May 6, 2014
            </p>
            <p>
             "Pornography is deployed today as a psyop or mind weapon: to pacify, control, brutalize, and ultimately enslave the masses.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We corrupt in order to rule.”
— Italian Freemason Giuseppe Mazzini
            </p>
            <p>
             "How do you take a nation of free and independent citizens and turn them into slaves? How do you do this slowly and imperceptibly, without violence, and with the willing participation of the slaves-to-be?
            </p>
            <p>
             The answer is simple. You corrupt them, undermine them, deprave them, demoralize them, until they have acquired all the characteristics of slaves."
            </p>
            <p>
             "As the sorceress Circe, with a wave of her magic wand, turned the followers of Ulysses into grunting swine, you can wield your weapon of mass hypnosis, the media, over a nation and transform its citizens into willing slaves.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can learn to roboticize man and turn him into a living machine. This is power. This is what it must feel like to be God — or the Devil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is there a secret weapon or “magic wand” for turning men into swine? Yes, there is. Sex is a secret weapon, a magic wand, that turns men into swine."
