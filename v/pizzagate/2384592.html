<p>&quot;Blahyi has said he led his troops naked except for shoes and a gun. He believed that his nakedness was a source of protection from bullets.[8] Blahyi now claims he would regularly sacrifice a victim before battle, saying, &quot;Usually it was a small child, someone whose fresh blood would satisfy the devil.&quot;[1]</p>
<p>He explained to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: &quot;Sometimes I would enter under the water where children were playing. I would dive under the water, grab one, carry him under and break his neck. Sometimes I\'d cause accidents. Sometimes I\'d just slaughter them.&quot;[9] In January 2008 Blahyi confessed to taking part in human sacrifices which &quot;included the killing of an innocent child and plucking out the heart, which was divided into pieces for us to eat.&quot;[10]</p>
<p>Blahyi claimed to a South African Star reporter that he &quot;met Satan regularly and talked to him&quot; and that from age of 11 to 25 he took part in monthly human sacrifices.[11] In his account of a typical battle Blahyi claimed, &quot;So, before leading my troops into battle, we would get drunk and drugged up, sacrifice a local teenager, drink the blood, then strip down to our shoes and go into battle wearing colorful wigs and carrying imaginary purses we\'d looted from civilians. We\'d slaughter anyone we saw, chop their heads off and use them as soccer balls. We were nude, fearless, drunk yet strategic. We killed hundreds of people--so many I lost count.&quot;[12]</p>
<p>Blahyi also purported that during this period he had &quot;magical powers that made him invisible&quot; and a &quot;special power&quot; to capture a town singlehandedly, then call in his troops afterwards to &quot;clean up&quot;.[13] Some of Blahyi\'s soldiers--often boys in their early teens and younger--would enter battle naked; others would wear women\'s clothes.[1] In June 2006 Blahyi published his autobiography that included pictures of him fighting with a rifle, wearing nothing but sneakers.[14]</p>
<p>During the First Liberian Civil War he led a mercenary unit, many of whom were child soldiers, which was known as the Butt Naked Brigade.[3] They were funded by Roosevelt Johnson and fought alongside the ULIMO militia against militias led by Charles Taylor and Prince Yormie Johnson. ULIMO was loyal to Samuel Doe, who was captured and executed—personally—by Johnson. Taylor eventually took control of the country.</p>
<p>His &quot;conversion to Christianity&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blahyi\'s rampage ended in 1996, when the civil war in Liberia was coming to a close. He states his conversion was bolstered by a church in Liberia where a Bishop Kun Kun is pastor. They claimed to have heard from God to fast 54 days for his deliverance. After the fast they claim God gave them spiritual powers to infiltrate his coven in the city of Liberia and preach to him. Shortly after, he had a theophany in which Jesus Christ appeared to him as a blinding light, spoke to him as a son, and told him that he would die unless he repented his sins.[3]</p>
<p>In 1997 Blahyi traveled to the Buduburam refugee camp in Ghana. It was at the camp, he recounts, that he made confession for his sins at a church and &quot;had his life saved&quot;.[15] When he goes out to preach now, he says he sometimes encounters relatives of his victims. &quot;I feel very bad, so bad&quot;, he said, but he insists it was satanic powers that possessed him in the past and he cannot be held responsible.[9] He has since expressed willingness to be tried for war crimes at the Hague.[3]</p>
<p>Blahyi is now the President of the End Time Train Evangelistic Ministries Inc., with headquarters in Liberia. He is married to Pastor Mrs. Josie and has four children: Michaela, Joshua Milton Jr., Janice[4] Marva and Jackie MaryBeth. For a few years he was estranged from his family and hiding in Ghana, due to his fear of reprisals from his victims and/or their relatives.[3]</p>
<p>In 2004 Liberian-American director Gerald Barclay traveled to Buduburam to shoot a documentary which included interviews with Blahyi.[16] In January 2008 Blahyi returned to Liberia from Ghana and claimed before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia that between approximately 1980 and 1996 he and his men were responsible for the deaths of more than 20,000 people.[17]</p>
<p>Although the TRC accepted that figure, Norris Tweah, the Information Minister of Liberia, has since disputed that Blahyi was responsible for that many deaths.[3] Blahyi was the subject of a 2010 documentary film: True Stories: The Redemption of General Butt Naked[18] by the Sundance Institute, produced and directed by Eric Strauss and Daniele Anastasion.</p>
<p>On October 2016 Blahyi appealed to donors to donate half a million dollars to his Journeys Against Violence NGO which trains child soldiers and drug addicts in farming and construction.[19]&quot;</p>
<p>They use him as aa figure of inspiration and someone wise to look up to. A child murderer. Since he converted to Christianity. All the atrocities and randomly murdering children as sacrifices to Satan were forgiven and the man now is rich and lives a life of luxary and travels the world telling his &quot;redemption&quot; story. Under his and other clansa sick urban myth came that if you rape an infant your aids will get cured and the baby will get it instead. Not kidding. It\'s called &quot;The Virgin Cleansing Myth&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_cleansing_myth">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_cleansing_myth</a></p>
<p>His documentary is called &quot;&quot;The Redemption of General Butt Naked&quot;&quot; He says he personally led the effort to rape and murder children across Africa and make an army of child soldiers and child prostitutes for the Militia.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_XtoU3j55A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_XtoU3j55A</a></p>
<p>This monster was one of the people who kidnapped thousands of children and made his army kidnap thousands of children to be forced to fight to the death during the Liberia Civil War. Untold thousands of children\'s condemned to fight to the death during a civil war. Regular child sacrifices daily of any kid unlucky to be kidnapped by his clan.</p>
<p>So why is a child murdering rapist warlord who commited mass rape and genocide allowed to have redemption? Why do the media say his story is &quot;inspirational&quot; and he has turned good and all is redeemed? Why is a child murderer and rapist become famous from his &quot;redemption?&quot; A generation of kids died horrible deaths because of him and people like him.</p>

            You guys lack context. Do you know why you know what he did? Because he was the only one of the generals to come forward. He dodged assassins for several years because t free confessed. He gave a full account of his crimes to the Truth and Reconciliation commission. He plead for mercy, but he submitted to their judgement. He stands against the child traffickers, murderers and rapists. He has been one, and has done abominable things. He received death threats and worse from the other actors - who did the same evil shit that he did.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was also raised in it. He started out with human sacrifice at age 11. Everyone told him it was his duty.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have met him in person. You're hating someone who is on your side. Someone who did evil shit, and has more than one submitted. But, you also lack context on Liberia.

            I dont care how shitty his childhood was , nothing but satanic possesion could cause a human being to act like this. He should be tried for crimes against humanity and hung ! If he's forgiven by God good for him but he needs to answer for what he did before his "conversion". Id be happy to send him to his reward ! Whats that saying , "Everyone wants heaven, but nobody wants dead."

             Yeah, I think that he would agree with the first part. He was almost certainly possessed. He was raised in his village, he came from the priest bloodline. The priest (bush devil, or bush doctor) of their village has died.   His father was unsuitable due to being educated,  because the elders rejected education, because their tribal spirit didn't like it. (much of the Liberian traditional religion is the same in that way.)
            </p>
            <p>
             His father was married, but the woman wasn't suitable, so they required him to impregnate a properly uneducated village woman. They had to drug him to get it to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             From the time Joshua could speak, he was told that every meal, every toy, his clothes, his bed - everything - was a gift from their tribal deity.
            </p>
            <p>
             When he was eleven, he was taken into the jungle the the "oracle" of their village to meet this deity. He was super excited. He claims that he could see it, and it looked repulsive and terrifying but he wasn't afraid, because this was the being that has given him everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             That was the first time he had to kill a human, and do all the sacrifice stuff. He describes making covenants with the demon. It warned him repeatedly to stay away from Christians. I think you misunderstand. He wasn't evil because he was mistreated and abused. He was evil because everyone in his life told him that was good, important, noble. He knew it was wrong, but you don't know about Africa. They obey their elders.
            </p>
            <p>
             I cannot imagine who you think is suitable to judge him. He is not in Goverment. He is not in power.. He has spent multiple years living in rags. He has made whatever restitution he can to his victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             He quit before the ceasefire during the first Civil War, having had a religious experience.  He wasn't forced from power, he wasn't losing, he wasn't captured. He presented himself at the commission some eight?  years later. He answered to the people who took over the lawful leadership of his country. This is the representative government of his victims, partisans and people. Who is more suited to judge his actions?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             , when did we start looking for Goverment? He did unspeakably awful things, made blood covenants with demons, raped, pillaged and murdered, as he was taught.
            </p>
            <p>
             You should visit Africa sometime. It is fucking surreal. But, don't talk to me about dispensing violence and punishment. He wasn't caught by whistle blowers. His crimes were not covered up by rogue FBI agents. He had no leverage, no power, only the truth that everyone "knew" but no one else told.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe you should spend your hate on the other generals who lied at the end of the war? Those protected by the corrupt? Those driven out of power by the actions of the people who ended the war? This is the most appalling thing for me about everyone's opinion on Joshua. You all act like you have the righteous cause to condemn this man, because you know because he confessed every single horrible thing he did. But none of these internet Champions has any words for all the generals who did the same things and went before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and lied, and were not pardoned. There certainly are some unrepentant, bad war criminals in Liberia. But everyone fixates on the guy that told the truth. Is that what we want for pizzagate? For everyone to lie about it and if anybody tells the truth that person will be killed? Because that's what's happening right now.

              He should be tried for crimes against humanity in the Hague or wherever such war crimes are tried. If God has forgiven him thats fine, but he still has to face the consequences of his past actions. "The devil made me do it" is not a defense. If he is found guilty he should be hung, which btw is far more merciful than how he treated his victims.

            Don't you doubt that MrPing Pong and his clients are doing anything different. Killary is said to suffer from Kuru. Skippy and his Fat Tony are cannibals - make no mistake about it.

            If he really has chosen to serve God, he would seek righteousness, justice; and take responsibility for his actions, even if it means death. Jesus submitted to earthly authorities, at the cost of his life; proving his service, loyalty and obedience to God irreproachably. My gut says that the General still serves satan, in the same capacity, recruiting. Rememeber: 2 Corinthians 11:14 And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps disguising himself as an angel of light.

              Yeaaaah. Doesn’t sound like justice to me. Sounds like political pandering. One does not kill and rape thousands and get “pardoned”. That was just for show. If he expressed a desire to appear before a world court and be tried for war crimes, then that speaks to his sincerity, but actions speak louder than words. In the end, I am railing against the failings of Satan’s system, so I shouldn’t be surprised.

               Are you suggesting that forgiveness is Satan's system?

               A sixteen year Civil War which had a one year cool down right in the middle. What finally stopped the bloodshed were the women of the country walking into the streets naked and telling the soldiers to kill them first. They ashamed the armies into laying down their guns. Then the women took power, and the first job of every Liberian man became "don't kill anyone".
              </p>
              <p>
               Infrastructure was gone, destroyed by their own hands. Some of the rebel leaders had ripped the copper out of the walls. The copper was sold to scrappers to buy ammunition. Houses which used to be beautiful, modern and rather western, were suddenly almost huts again.
              </p>
              <p>
               What is more, I had several people talk with me about political history. Joshua was not novel, every president since the beginning of the country has had such a religious adviser. Joshua said that children are kidnapped during every election for human sacrifice by Bush devils and oracles.

               It isn't only him. Again, the only reason anyone knows is because of his Public confession. I don't know how rich he is, but he considers himself wealthy because he has a family.
              </p>
              <p>
               You shouldn't quote the man who found his identity in the statement "the disciple whom Jesus loved", while declaring confessions politically expedient. As far as I know, no one else in Liberian history has given such a confession. It is so horrible that many have suggested he lied.

                I’m not sure how to respond. I find a lot of virtue in what you have written here. I must admit, my only knowledge of this story comes from here. The only real judge is God, who is the only one who can look into people’s hearts. If I were the general, I would be very thankful for any measure of mercy recieved. I also think that it is fair to have doubts. He shouldn’t be surprised if people are skeptical. That is certainly fair.

I cannot find the words to speak of what this man has done.  He will have to explain to God what in the world the reason is, that he so badly treated those that God put in his care.  May all those Children   find the Love and Peace they deserve.  Amen.

             God needs to explain why he lets this happen.  Don't tell me it is because of the wonderful gift of free will.  We let our children have a certain amount of free will but we don't let our children kill.  We  lock up fellow humans when they abuse their free will or even execute them to protect the innocent.  But God stands by and allows the carnage to continue.

              If you carry this to the logical conclusion, then you're appealing for universal human extinction. We're all descended from rapists, theives, murderers, and those who profitted from or collaborated with the same.

              I just gave an answer to someone in a different post regarding pedophiles.  I think it also applies here, for this is also heinous.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only answer I have ever come up with is that they must have had a horrible childhood of the same horrid acts. Here it is:  I often wonder what was done to these people that committed such heinous acts, that has been my deduction. People are not born a pedophile. It is learned and develops over time. You do not just wake up one day, and you commit these acts. They are done to you repeatedly and brutally. I feel that they are creating these people en mass in order to achieve their agenda.

             The Civil War in their country is over, yet no one who personally led the charge and committed atrocities on thousands of children, sacrificing and torturing and raping children to death and forcing them to fight in wars should become an inspirational figure. He still has access and it's sick.

              I know about child soldiers, but I had no idea there was an army of children who were forced to fight naked, and that there was an army leader who was into satanic sacrifices, but then, the latter shouldn't be a surpise when you think of it.

              Many people in Africa are into Voodoo and similar belief systems, and many still believe in witches, in fact there are still witch hunts, and 'witches' will get killed, so will albino children, and
              <em>
               (graphic)
              </em>
              their flash will be eaten and made to 'medicine'. Horrible.

              (May I make a suggestion? This post is excellent, but maybe some people might be grateful if there was a 'NSFW' at the top - so they will know that some stomach turning stuff will follow. Thank you!)

               My understanding was that it was only General Butt Naked who actually fought naked. The children would usually wear dresses (probably stolen from the women they had killed).

                No, many of them were naked :/ "Some of Blahyi's soldiers--often boys in their early teens and younger--would enter battle naked; others would wear women's clothes.[1] In June 2006 Blahyi published his autobiography that included pictures of him fighting with a rifle, wearing nothing but sneakers" During this warlords reign child rape and death and human sacrifice happened en masse daily.
