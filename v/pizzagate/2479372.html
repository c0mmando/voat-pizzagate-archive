            I am getting so tired of listening to the victim mentality. The police and politicians are part of the problem. People should take matters into their own hands women should always carry spray, or concealed carry in the US. And kids should be taught to stop accommodating abusers and learn repelling technics. Its the only way forward!

             I was much closer to the Hampstead case than your podcast broadcaster.  The simple answer that the children's stepfather was responsible for a case that had the British intelligence services swarming all over it was/is nonsensical. The podcaster left out many, many elements of the story.  Starting with the 'British banker' who picked up his bride in Russia in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whether you believe the story or not, one thing it started to expose to Joe Public is how child trafficking works.  If you believe that this case was a psyop, then the question is, why? One thing for sure, this was not an ordinary 'divorce gone bad' situation.

              Thank you. There are some creeps on Twitter who were specifically writing to me to try to convince me that the whole story was fake also. As though I am supposed to be able to vet criminal cases in another country from the internet. Give me a break. I believe them though.

            I'm sure the rapists were behind the "women lie about rape" movement(s).  We're gonna be unpacking history for decades to come.
           </p>
           <p>
            Won't that be some shit? Hollywood will be replaced by indie historical docudramas based on story lines re truth coming out for the unforeseeable future.   An entire new media, medium, mindset could supplant the shit that Hollywood pumps out.  All of their evil will be counteracted by history-based entertainment.

            Michael Seed is accused of being 'Basil the Ghost', the only burglar who evaded capture following the notorious £25million raid over the Easter weekend of 2015.He was arrested on Tuesday at a run-down council flat less than two miles from Hatton Garden vault with what is alleged to be property from the burglary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police say they found a large amount of jewellery, precious stones and gold ingots.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seed's aunt Kathleen Seed last night questioned whether he was involved in the raid. She told The Times: 'The idea of him being a safebreaker is outlandish.'

            This raises a lot of questions. Is he really the mastermind of the Heist or is this another case of them pinning a crime on an innocent person and another cover up to save the elites.  All arrested, now.  No need for further investigations or discussion.

             <p>
              The ringleader of the £14million Hatton Garden heist reportedly found pictures of a Tory MP abusing children 45 years ago and left them for the police to discover.
             </p>
             <p>
              Following the raid, the Government at the time allegedly banned the media from reporting on the burglary for 'national security' reasons, due to fears raunchy photos of the late Princess Margaret had been found in one of the safety deposit boxes.
             </p>
             <p>
              The latest accusations come at when historic high profile child sex abuse allegations are being investigated.
             </p>
             <p>
              Labour peer Lord Janner died before he was due to face trial and Liberal Democrat MP Cyril Smith passed away before it was revealed he was a paedophile.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has been made aware of the latest claims and in November last year Judge Goddard said it will consider 'allegations of cover-up and conspiracy'.

              There is a movie called The Bank that depicts the so called heist. In reality security services faked the robbery as a cover to steal the Princess Michael photos from the blackmailer (Michael X) not Malcolm. His death warrant was signed by the Queen and he was executed in the West Indies.

              This was a huge cover up of elites and royals or who knows else of committing heinous acts against children.  Possibly the photos of P. Margaret where either her committing them or photos of her being defiled by someone.  Also, possibly the photos would point fingers at Lord Mountbatten who was also spared before his death.  This smacks of Watergate, which some say was a huge cover up of the same kind.  Children are being raped and murdered for their sexual perverted cravings and they are getting off Scot Free.

             <p>
              The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has been made aware of the latest claims and in November last year Judge Goddard said it will consider 'allegations of cover-up and conspiracy'.   THIS is another put off  and scuttling of charges.  Will Consider?  WTH is that suppose to mean?  Another Pass For The Elites.

             The only women I know of who are lying about rape charges are the ones being paid to do so against political people. Aside from that, women have nothing to gain from lying about rape. Even leaving a non raping abuser is extremely dangerous without being around someone vicious enough to become a rapist. Speaking out is rare and most women aren't believed, so the only reason to speak out is if a certain amount of fear has been removed from the situation.

              Both seem mental Ill so maybe that's another angle to consider- mentally unstable women who make up stories for attention, sympathy, or whatever.

               OK, well I guess a mentally ill person could make up a rape charge, but at the same time, being a victim of rape can be traumatic and the abuser will call you mentally ill to cover up the crime. Vicious and slippery slopes we have there. I do not know anything about mattress girl and I've only heard of Lena Dunham but I don't know much about her besides that she's apparently not a very nice girl.
