<p><a href="http://www.newslogue.com/debate/675/KimHolleman">When You Think the VA Night March Looks Staged and You Find Out There is a Company That Specializes In Exactly That</a></p>
<p>There is this quote about &quot;secrecy&quot; inside it at the top. This is the owner of the company speaking about what his company does:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Right now, we’re still kind of this secret weapon,” Adam says. “We have the element of surprise.</p>
<p>Yeah, you might’ve heard about political candidates paying to bring some extra bodies into their campaign events, <strong>but it’s beyond the realm of most people’s imagination that crowds are being deployed in other ways. Nobody is skeptical of crowds.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I\'m seeing this relate to pizzagate because from the start, the entire campaign was like one big psy op. Hillary\'s campaign had several, dozens if not more instances of complete fakery including seat fillers, faked campaign supporters, photo shopped rally attendees, etc. Wikileaks is what broke the veil and let us know their criminality. So what if we are getting a peak at their crisis actor/false flag/social engineering apparatus, which is meant to infiltrate any social situation and turn it to their advantage? Are &quot;PR&quot; type companies like this part of their social engineering of pizzagate? Is this the literal company that hires actual crisis actors? </p>
<p>Did they hire Edgar Madisson Welch, the &quot;Pizzagate Shooter&quot;? Is that too far fetched? If we believe he was a hired component to muddy the water of what pizzagate is, then it\'s logical there is a company or group that manages that and finds people. To me it\'s reasonable the Podesta would do the &quot;wet work&quot; on his own insider people, while stuff out in big groups would be outsourced...</p>
<p>Is this how all of the PSYOPS are taking place? If this company exists, do more?</p>',

            Had the same vibe. Those are neo-Nazis? Hell, no. They posed in every shot. And the ANTIFA crowd? Bad actors. Every single one. The toppling of the statue. Pure staged theater.

              Just as Trump is exposing alt left - Soros doubles down and stages hoax in Barcellona - check out the crisis actors there - the worst acting I have ever seen (of course no footage of the car hitting anything - and of course it's Isis)

            This is truly ludicrous.  The various groups that made up this march have a long, long history prior to this month.
Check out the Unite the Right Hashtag on Twitter and see how big this is.  One guy who got injured has 40,000 tweets over who knows how many years.  He has 185,000 followers.

              who got the torches?    What a mind puzzler that is.   Anyone have Amazon prime?  They have them cheaper than Home Depot or Lowes
             </p>
             <p>
              Who thought that up?   Dunno? Maybe the Nazi who attended that school and held torchlit rally in May in that same park by that same statue?  He seems like a good candidate.

              I have it on good word that there were only 3 arrests, and I believe one included the driver.  Had they arrested the rioters, the arrest record would be public and their backstopping would fall apart in two seconds.

              Anyone can Google 'charlotte car crash', click on 'images, and see this was staged like other 'event's.
Most glaring is the picture of the black guy, sitting stop the hood of a black Tundra, with the damaged Charger alongside.
Same black guy is in now-iconic photo of being airborne behind Charger after supposedly being hit.
Same shirt, pants, and orange/red belt.
In addition, there are videos of Charger slowly approaching crowd and others with car racing towards it at high speed.
Tundra pickup truck is in some pics, and absent in others.
Staged crisis, clearly.

            "trump is making you a good bit of money right now"? where to begin... first it is "YOU'RE" not "YOUR" laughing. But what I am laughing at YOUR incredibly simplistic , almost charmingly childlike understanding of long term investment and "market performance" as it relates to "making a good deal of money". Day by day I grown more convinced VOAT is populated by teens on their parent's IP.

            Charlottesville also had a few obvious hallmarks of psy-op bullshit. They are ramping up the heat. They only do this when they must. They have been perfectly content to lie in the shadows and tug the threads until now. Like, if you watch the video you will see that surely they were prepared to engage in violence. Half the people on both sides were wearing like improvised body armor. And the public records were reported to have show that these demonstrations were signed off on at nearly the same time. Why would they create this shit show on purpose? Incompetence? Highly likely but I've grown suspicious of anything that even remotely implies coincidence these days. And the speed and ferocity with which the media got ahold of this and started tossing it to and fro. They are trying to cripple his office by putting him on constant defense while he is in isolation. I believe it is totally pizzagate related in that they are blocking public vision of important investigations and events that target high priority individuals and players. I think shits going to get uglier and uglier this fall. Buckle up.

              I seem to have heard or read something about these guys with the torches trying to replicate protests that happened in ... Iceland, Norway, ??? Can't seem to remember the source at the moment. Anyway, there was a lot of chatter this morning about those guys. How they were paid actors. Perhaps, there was a youtube video as well. One of the actors came forward and talked about it. - I'm at work, don't have the time to look now, but if I you get a chance try and check that out. It may still be floating around the topic page.

               And just as Trump has exposed Alt left - the deep state doubles down and stages another hoax attack in Barcellona (watch - yet again, no footage of a van hitting anything despite every tourist holding an iphone) Everything leads to pizzagate - expect more distractions.

            Since you're on the topic of Virginia being a set up, I ran across this yesterday. Canadian crisis actors needed for Colorado, in November. Looks like the commie kids are getting shut down for this gig.

             Whoa. Hmm Mark the calendar for those dates. Makes me wonder if it's so heinous American citizens wouldn't even do it but they needed American looking people ergo Canada OR if it's illegal so let's get outsiders to do it. Shady as shit.

            You can't fathom that people just like fucking with you for sport because you're such pathetic ignorant losers? I do this because it is FUN!

             And to answer your question about Virginia and southern white supremacists, no. I have some idiots in my family and they don't look like these dudes straight out of mormonville. These guys were the cleanest straight laced white supremacists I've ever seen.

               LMAO! You dont even realize that not only are they not actors THEY ARENT NAZIS OR SUPREMACISTS!

               They dont want to subsidize huge Mexican families while whites dont even have replacement level birthrates.  Its kind of a big deal when women dont have kids, because old folks die regardless.
              </p>
              <p>
               IF SOMEONE WANTS TO LIVE IN A HISPANIC SOCIETY GO ANYWHERE SOUTHWARD.  SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO LIVE IN A WHITE SOCIETY WILL BE OUT OF LUCK SOON. NEITHER POSITION REQUIRES ANY JUSTIFICATION WHATSOEVER.

                 LOL  so not wanting to live in a hispanic society, since im not hispanic, is racism.

                 Do you even realize YOURE THE RACIST for saying whites somehow lack something and VITALLY NEED OTHER RACES? Whats the deal with that, Kike McShill? Does Japan need diversity, Shill Silverstein??

                  You are calling me racist you are a joke. Good bye now. You get no time or justification because you attack any color, or religion you personally do not accept. Grow up step up your game. Post real facts in small letters about investigating child sex trafficking. Name names, identify people not as a group but do the hard work of locating actual evidence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Simply blaming segments of populations will not work and does nothing but harm here.

                  Edit: and I can hold those above opinions and still see your point of low birth rates leading to a collapse of a culture. I agree and always have. I also agree this is being intentionally done.

                That's what may be so interesting, the fact that they did NOT have tattoos and look so crazy. White lash needs to be considered. I have relatives that would have gladly joined them. No tattoos on any of them. That I can see. They're sick of it all.

                  There are people on here that are seriously confused about their "white guilt." They may stay confused until it's too late. I have Dutch friends in South Africa who weep for their homeland and family every day. A helpful read, for some, would be Slouching Towards Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline, by Robert Bork ... people should have a look-see what he went through for being white.

                   Well whites being murdered and in squalid camps is definitely newsworthy but it wouldnt push the Jews' agenda so fuck em right. Plus they wanted to live separate from the ones murdering them, so theyre racists who probably deserve it

                    Yep, I'm afraid this is their thinking. I'll shut-up and go to bed, but there was a great documentary (that of course I can't find anywhere now) that explained so well how integration destroyed black communities and their businesses and how many were bitter about the whole thing. Funny how confused people can get. Utopian dreams, dream on.

            We have been had.

            The crisis actors thing is another PSYOP on us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead, what we are seeing is sophisticated CGI.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ever notice the footage is always terrible?

            Notice that the scene does not match up?

            Naval Intelligence has been using this video realism technology for a long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember the first time they used it to the masses... remember the Japan Tsunami?
           </p>
           <p>
            We were shown scary fear porn on how the tsunami wiped out towns.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it was merely a movie.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, here is Japan rubbing it in our faces to "build awareness".

            Yes. That too was a media hoax - all created out of high-level, military software.

           <p>
            Folks. There are no crisis actors advertised in Craigslist. The globalists are fucking with us.

             I've seen the ads in my city on Craigslist. Said bus transportation, water, non-alcoholic drinks, and snacks were included, payment in cash. Also check out the recent issues of Backstage West which many West Coast actors subscribe to. States pay for PR from "CrowdsOnDemand" is $20 hr. Says it's an LA based co. Actors know not to ask too many questions if they want the gig and that confidentiality agreements are now the norm everywhere.

              No need to place ads on Craigslist, pay people, and risk that someone might talk.

              All they have to do is make a quick movie. And that is exactly what they do. They have been doing this since the Japanese Tsunami.

            Wonder what kind of gig happened on November 14 &amp; 15 2015 that the guy on Facebook is ranting about. Wish he'd spill the beans since he's so pissed.

            You know something else that doesn't sit right. So we have cook at a hot dog joint traveling cross country to attend a protest? Cole White lives in Berkeley but yet went all the way to Charlottesville show his support for the white nationalist movement? Highly suspect.

            The giveaway is when you compare the C'Ville "Nazis" and "Klansmen" to real rallies.  Do some image searching.  Helen Keller could see the difference.  Those were not real "Nazis" or "Klansmen".

            Great find. It was obviously staged from the beginning. This is literally like watching all the crisis actors fighting each other with Soros footing the bill and FBI &amp; CIA helping out with their paid players aka David Duke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obvious stand down order from Gov. Macaulliffe who is under FBI investigation, along with FBI deputy director McCabe who took $700,000 from HRC best -buddy Gov MacAulliffe while in charge of HRC email investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who is also under investigation by the House Judiciary for harassment of a top female special agent in counterterroism who got backing and support from the US military...General Flynn &amp; others.
           </p>
           <p>
            McCabe did not recuse himself over Flynn eventhough he is a hostile witness.

             David Duke is an actor agent, the way he spoke about 'fulfiling Trump's promise' sounded too scripted. And here is a conundrum, how or why a self proclaimed anti semite who claims that the entire media is run by zionist jews be given air time on CNN, NBC, CBS by the very same networks that supposed to shut him down?! Because it is much more than what it seems on the surface. David Duke is playing a role as is Alex Jones (who has invited David on his show last year) Actor agents &amp; crisis actors is the name of the game. I am sure Trump knows that, that is why he refered to '....on all sides!'

              thanks for adding that in. Will FBI Director Wray force McCabe to step aside from anything in Virginia?
             </p>
             <p>
              That is the test. McCabe &amp; Governor Macaulliffe are both under investigation and DOJ must demand McCabe be recused.

               Right now too many Obama holdovers in DOJ.  The Deep State is making it far too hard for Trump to get his peoplein place.  My understanding is they are denying security clearances to his hires.  If not pedos or compromised in some way they have s. no control over them so they won't give them clearances.  Kelly needs to take a blow torch to clear all these bastards.

             OMG such excellent points, all. Indeed it was an obvious stand down. And the permitted group was LED to the antifa group, right when everyone was filming, etc. It was managed. So someone was orchestrating both groups potentially from higher up. And not sure if you know, but it was Soros' birthday yesterday!

              This is completely set-up. They forced the removal of the statue to sell it for repetitions. That was the set-up. The Vice-Mayor has sent out horrible racist, bigoted, sexist tweets that are to disgusting to print as a member of New Black Panthers.

              George Soros completely funds BLM. He is the puppet master. The unitetheright group was required to get a permit and did. You can disagree and do but the principle of free speech is essential for democracy....we die without it. That is what North Korea is where the government even decides what your haircut will be.
             </p>

              Once they were in the park Soros anti-fa and BLM came stomping down the streets with bats and pipes.

              David Duke is a paid informant and he plays bait. There is a stand down order until absolute chaos and violence is everywhere.

              David Duke is then paraded out to the cameras to say President Trumps name as many times as possible. He gets his secret paycheck and goes home.

            Yes they have been using seat fillers, so why not protests.   I have this first hand from delegates for Bernie at Philly Conv.  They knew they were hired just from how it happened.  They walked out but on TV the seats were filled.  They are beyond disgusting.  I don't think there is a word bad enough for these people.

             As I stated above not only have I seen their ads on Craigslist in my city beginning way back when Trump was 1st running for POTUS (as have many friends in their cities across the US,) but I recall the interviews with some of the college student aged protesters standing in the street in AZ carrying signs obviously made by a professional. When asked exactly why they were there the young woman said she needed the $$$ for college and it just was another temporary gig. She couldn't answer a single question about politics whatsoever. She then pointed to her boyfriend who was equally clueless. She then said he got paid more $$ as he was much taller and bigger and could help to organize the group. She admitted those that got arrested received even more $$$ but that she had an exam coming up she couldn't miss.

             Since crisis actors have spawned the uses have always seemed shady. According to the article nobody is willing to admit to their use, either. The owner can only site one event. It reeks of government sanction.

             The left is trying to cause a race/civil war to justify everything they've been saying.  It won't be long until a gay or black or Mexican gets dragged to death behind a truck or something similar.

             C'Ville was real, I disagree with the whole thing being CGI.  IMO, both sides were/are the same side - paid agitators on the "right" and the left; Heather Heyer isn't real and didn't die; and VSP is suppressing info on the helo crash.  It is being investigated as suspicious.

             I honestly feel that we are witnessing the complete falsification of reality for political purposes for sure including pizzagate. false flags and now you can't even say pizzagate, without people thinking "shooter". And when you mention the empty convention and the seat fillers, people think you're crazy. I agree, they are beyond disgusting.

              Sadly a lot of those very dispossessed Bernie supporters/delegates do not realize that they are being duped and they are only focused on the "nazi sympathizers" anti Trump stuff (and often for good reason) and don't give any credence to ANFIFA as and/or pro Nazi  groups being funded and the whole thing a coordinated psyop (even if real ppl are authentically and organically attending) and meant to divide us. It's not that they couldn't be enlightened though with enough proof. They were put therough the ringer in Philly.

              I have friends that went with me to Philly and they swore they would leave the Dem party and now they are out there marching in the Resistance.  I refuse to attend any of these orchestrated events.  I also have friends that are in the middle and really don't know what to believe.  I have faith in them and believe that eventually something will happen to wake them up.  We have to have hope. We and those that are waking up with us, are all this country has.

                Possibly.  And a way to cause even more hatred and separation among us.  As if there is not enough already.  Everyone stay aware and awake of what they are trying to achieve. We should not let them do it.
