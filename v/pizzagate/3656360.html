            Trump is an ultra-Zionist. Q = no accountability + plausible deniability.

            I don't know what army of shills is providing the WWG1WGA crap comments on that article but I can guarantee these foot-soldiers are ultimately paid from our own tax dollars.

            Trump has not investigated the Podesta brothers. He has not investigated HIllary. He is an incompetent businessman who has been bailed out by (((International Bankers))) so often that they now own him. They have also been working behind the scenes to bail out Jared Kushner. They think this transsexual (if there really
            <em>
             is
            </em>
            such a thing) is the new Mochiach (Messiah). Podesta Brothers are as rotten as they come. Stop waiting for Trump/Q to do something constructive. The hammer will
            <em>
             never
            </em>
            fall.

            Trump gives Israel billions. Trump moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem. Trump gave Israel the Golan Heights.
           </p>

            Israel is the single most racist state on the planet. They will kick you out of their country for being black whether you are Jewish or not. Israel has walls that the US is paying for. Meanwhile, Israeli Zionists are replacing European descendants with Africans using forced migration.
