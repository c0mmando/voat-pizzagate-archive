<p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Yesterday, during the BBC coverage of the wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle a spokesperson from the <strong>Terrence Higgins Trust (an HIV charity)</strong> said that after the honeymoon, that charity will be the first official engagement for the couple.  So I had a look and entered a rabbit warren which took me through a number of voat pizzagate posts on the biotech industry, the Clintons, Dyncorp, Tavistock and all subjects to do with vulnerable children. I need to split this huge topic into a number of posts.  So, I\'m starting with a recent BBC article which mentions the type of charities that Markle will be fronting, and therefore providing the PR and good optics.</p>
<p>The articles states that she was speaking at the <strong>Foundling Museum</strong>.. and there I will start.. We have a number of posts already about that place as it relates to child services in the UK, CORAM, Tavistock connections and even the Hampstead case. Also – Thomas Foundling was a suspected paedophile. <em>Onwards...</em></p>

<p>The prince and Ms Markle will carry out their first official engagement together in Nottingham on Friday.
They will go on a walkabout and visit the Nottingham Contemporary which is hosting a Terrence Higgins Trust World Aids Day charity fair, and Nottingham Academy to meet head teachers.
Their spokesman said Ms Markle would not be continuing her work on gender with the United Nations or with other organisations, and instead would start new charity work as a full-time royal.
She is to become the fourth patron of the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2461290">Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry</a>.
Speaking during a visit to the <strong>Foundling Museum</strong> in London on Tuesday, the Duchess of Cambridge said both she and Prince William hoped the couple &quot;enjoy this happy moment&quot;. </p>

<p>The Foundling Hospital in London, England was founded in 1739 by the philanthropic sea captain Thomas Coram. It was a children\'s home established for the &quot;education and maintenance of exposed and deserted young children.&quot; </p>
<p>In Hogarth’s Hidden Parts, Bernd Krysmanski aims to turn the idea of the “good” Hogarth on its head. The author questions Hogarth’s moralizing agendas, his socially engaged and reformist identities, and argues instead that he was a “bawdy hedonist,” a malicious blasphemer, possibly even a pedophile. </p>

<p>The Thomas Coram Foundation for Children is a large children\'s charity in London which uses the working name Coram (formerly Coram Family).[1]
It is one of England\'s oldest children\'s charities, established by royal charter in 1739 as the Foundling Hospital.</p>
<p>Coram offers support for separating parents, parents of adolescents, young parents, and parents of particular faith or ethnic groups. They offer particular support in Camden through their Parents Centre and Camden Futures (in collaboration with other agencies). 
They also run the Family Drug and Alcohol Court in collaboration with the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust. This team supports families going through care proceedings at the Central Family Court. </p>

            This above my pay grade but....I can tell looking in her eyes she's been broken.  Possibly drugged.  Eyes glazed.  This whole marriage is oddly timed and from the info laid out here - Branson, JKR, Tavistock, etc. - super suspicious.  [that photo or Zero and Branson on a boat gives me the creeps.

              Can you elaborate a bit more on that? I still can’t really understand it all, why he would be allowed to marry her in the first place. The wedding seemed odd to me, the guests, the people conducting and serenading the ceremony. Everything just seemed way off for a royal type wedding. Markles Mom was there but no other family, no other real relatives or friends other than her acting coworkers. I will never forget reading over a year ago that she had a daughter about 9 years old and then that vanished and never heard about it again.

               Never heard about a daughter. Many, many sensible explanations for this arranged marriage. It would take me hours to list all of them. GLP, DataLounge, Beard Club, has a lot of info.

               Well, it was the perfect globalist wedding, wasn't it? After 2,5 years of refugees flooding Britain and mainland Europe, a statement to push mixed couples. Read today's
               <em>
                Guardian
               </em>
               , and you know what they're up to.
              </p>
              <p>
               And they tried to ban homeless people from Windsor (the town) even months before the wedding. Which is also a typically globalist take on politics: Take care of everybody else, but not of local people who might need help.

                The triple-parentheses are to recognize Jewish individuals.  I have told you this before, so what is your motivation to continue misusing them to dilute their meaning?

               <p>
                What conclusion can you draw from the entirely Jewish-run industries of entertainment and advertising pushing race-mixing for over 80 years?
               </p>
               <p>
                What do you make of the most prominent Jewish advocacy groups recently complaining that "globalist" is an anti-Semitic slur?

            </p>
            <p>
             Hopefully, once all of the hubbub over their engagement dies down, the couple will have time to relax abroad together.
             <strong>
              Maybe they could even indulge in a deep dish pizza—Prince Harry announced he’s a fan of the meal during his recent trip to Chicago.

             First of all, MM wanted to raise her public profile both to get more &amp; better acting gigs, draw attention to her blog &amp; sponsors, and for social (dating) connections. So she hired a PR firm which connects celebs to organizations wanting star power and mutual pap attention. It's the norm in Hollywood.

             Next. Soho House provided food for the wedding after-parties. They specialize in "Dirty Burgers" and they have a fried chicken and pizza chain. The owner of the British Soho House had a hand in arranging the introduction of the Royal Pair. No they didn't serve fried chicken LOL but dozens and dozens of pizzas were delivered, as well as burgers.

              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jones_
             </a>
             (Global_CEO,_Havas)
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In 2009, Jones co-founded youth forum One Young World, called "arguably the most forward-looking and comprehensive piece of corporate social responsibility ever attempted"[12] by Marketing Week. In 2011,
              <strong>
               Jones' work with One Young World was recognised by the Clinton Global Initiative.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              In Who Cares Wins, Jones defines the Social Business Idea as the overlap between what a company is good at ("a genuine and credible role for the brand or business"), and what consumers or customers are looking for ("real issues that consumers care about"). He lists as examples M·A·C's Viva Glam cosmetics partnering with Lady Gaga to raise money and awareness for HIV;[17] Levi's Water&lt;Less jeans line, produced with lower water usage;[18] Marks &amp; Spencer "Plan A" environmental commitment;[19] Nike "Better World";[20] Pepsi Refresh Project,[21] and more.

            I've linked Podesta with the biotech industry in Geneva here:

           <p>
            Since we know that the Podesta's have some kind of family connection to Swizerland and seem to have some kind of base in Lausanne, I thought I'd do a search for his name with that of Bertarelli, and here comes a wikileaks email:

             The second change is that we have just heard that unfortunately Mr. Bertarelli had a family matter come up, and although he was looking forward to the dinner he won't be able to join you after all. Instead, Bertarelli Foundation Director Mark Bolland will join you. Appended here is Mr. Bolland's biography:

            <p>
             A chemisty graduate, Mark started his career in the media at the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, where he was head of research and adviser to the organisation's Director-General. In 1992 he was appointed as the first ever Director of the UK's Press Complaints Commission.

              In 1996 he became Deputy Private Secretary to HRH The Prince of Wales, with responsibility for media relations and the Prince's interests in healthcare, the environment, and architecture.
             </strong>
             Having served in the position for six years, he left in 2002 to establish his own consultancy business, which provided communications advice to businesses, individuals and charities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since 2008 he has been a Trustee of both The Helen Hamlyn Trust and its educational initiative "Open Futures". He is also a Trustee of the David Ross Foundation and the David Ross Education Trust, which sponsors a number of school Academies in the United Kingdom.

             , did you ever come across a male US scientist (biotechnology) who has a double name, the first one being 'Wyss'? I can't seem to remember his second name, he popped up in a thread here recently.

             Wondered whether he is related to Hansjorg Wyss.
