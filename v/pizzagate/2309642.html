<blockquote>
<p>“Cholera is an infection of choice for those unfortunately slated for organ harvesting. Cholera doesn’t really harm the organs, but allow them to pull the plug when they claim the child is at death’s door.” — Pah abe</p>
<p>Haiti Occupied: The International Horrors Metered out on the Helpless 
The UN soldier are proxies for the US war in Haiti. Seven months after the earthquake, they imported the cholera bacteria. The US has used bioweapons and tested chemical weapons on its own people. Haiti present an even easier target for its nefarious biowafare activities. In fact, both Russian and Venezuelan officials claimed, immediately after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, that it was geoengineered by the US.  The Russian Northern Fleets in the area at the time of the Haiti earthquake, reportedly said the Haiti earthquake was caused by “a flawed US Navy ‘earthquake weapons’ test before the weapons could be utilized against Iran.”</p>
<p>The Laboratory: Haitians call the CIA, US intelligence, their Duopoly, UN/NGOs and the Deep State (BIS) banksters, the “Laboratory.”</p>
<p>Haiti has a long history of being the Guinea Pigs for US Laboratory tests. Haitians have been the victims of their organ trafficking, child sex rings, prostitution, foul vaccines, rape, forced pregnancies, free trade zone import quota frauds, deaths quads, drug smuggling, money laundering, gun trafficking, human trafficking and humanitarian frauds in Haiti. The Laboratory (Deep State) conducts false flag operations to destabilize and test the public reactions, experiment and refine their attack weapons.</p>
<p>“It’s far worse than (Èzili) depicted Sarah….the inhumane slaughtering of her people in the hands of DynCorp Organ, LTD, UN ‘Peacekeepers’, and the trained gangs that rained terror upon the populace to keep them in line.”</p>
<p>Are folks ready to understand this? To understand that rape is a tool of war, and the mind trauma, disfunction and sexual orientation confusion and insecurities this particular abuse brings, especially when practiced on innocent children and babies, are a US-Euro colonial tool of war, dependency, domination and mass destruction. Sexual programing is a traditionally tool used to break the strongest Blacks among us and to feed the elites’ bloodlust, literally and figuratively as agents of genocides.</p>
<p>Besides, biological toxins such as UN-imported cholera in Haiti, rape, psychological abuse and dislocation are a form of warfare that has destroyed Black families and colonized communities since the era of the TransAtlantic Trade and Arab Slave trades. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This stood out to me. We have talked here in the past and wondered why black people seem to be the biggest targets. The following makes sense...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Melanin-rich organs are superior in value and highly valued by the vampire elites. They believe themselves superior but need Black bodies to feed their for-profit prison industrial complex and eternal wars to continue worldwide for the systemic genocide against Black and brown communities, where the Neanderthugs get a steady stream of melanin-infused organs for harvesting.</p>
<p>Pah abe confirms melanin-infused organs are superior products by telling us that the bi-racial babies in Haiti are harvested by the wealthy billionaires to be used as body parts. He postulates the Rothchild/Rockerfeller clans need their blood in these donor children so their bodies don’t reject the organs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That\'s something we can look into.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of you will remember, I noted that a reliable source informed us, back in 2010, at the outset of the cholera outbreak that USAID’s first “relief” dollars for the cholera victims went to buy 200,000 body bags!</p>
<p>You may also recall, the incident, when the doctors at Mirebalais we questioned about why the bodies of those who were said to die of cholera were not returned to the families of the cholera victims for at least a funeral? We were suspiciously stonewalled. Then finally told it was because they were getting properly buried by the doctors and staff, in body bags to avoid further contamination of the earth. And when we said why can’t the grieving families attend those funerals or “disposal” activities. No answer. </p>
<p>A great portion of human trafficking happens at oil rigs, at the over 1000 US military basis around the world, and on the high seas for the pleasures of sick oligarchs and their servants who use the women and children and sometimes, discard the bodies at sea. The UN is teeming with pedophiles.</p>
<p>Haiti orphanage Hoax:
The Haiti orphanage system, like the US foster-care system, are places where defenseless children are sitting ducks for molesters and all sorts of predators. The pedophiles hide at Haiti orphanages, which are little more than private fund raising instruments for the enrichment of the owners. It’s not about the welfare of the children, but making a living off the misfortunes of abandoned children.</p>
<p>The Jesuits and Vatican in Haiti: 
The Jesuits and Catholic Church own more land in Haiti than any other entity except for the Haitian government. There’s no doubt their schools, properties and Order of Malta affiliated orphanages and guest houses in Haiti are a hotbed for pedophilia and traumatizing Haiti children not just through their fake history as do-gooders but through rape and sexual molestation. </p>
<p>Haiti is also one of the richest countries in oil, iridium, gold, copper and has mountains after mountains of the most rare earth metals in the world. Although strategically denied by the US-Euro diplomats and over thirty thousand NGOs masturbating on Black pain in Haiti, Èzili’s HLLN regularly details Haiti Riches, way before US client president and prime minister, Michel Martelly and Jean Max Bellerive admitted our wealth while letting the Clintons make us international beggars with fake quake relief.</p>
<p>American Universities that set up shop there do live experiments on children after infecting them with a host of diseases, particularly cholera, then purposely treat the children with vaccines and all sort of trial drugs. After they the experimental children die or are killed, they don’t even return the bodies to the naïve and unsuspecting mothers who just want their children healed from diseases that they infected the kids with in the first place. Worse, they don’t return the bodies to the mothers but sent them in ice bags to the US for study and dissection. Cholera is an infection of choice for those.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is just beyond my comprehension. These poor kids. It\'s just unbelievable...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Elites such the David Rockefeller impregnate women to harvest organs later out of their own offspring they keep in certain orphanages for securing body parts that will surely not reject their donor bodies when they come back to kill or take out selected organs. A virtual new race of biracial children are now being raised in Haiti for that very purpose of organ harvesting for parents who will never see the children except when the child organs are placed in the parents bodies in their latter years of old age or when in need of new liver or other organ.</p>

            Organ harvesting is very much a part of human trafficking, and human trafficking is very much a part of the abuse of children by the elites.
            <br/>
            But this does not mean organ harvesting
            <em>
             by itself
            </em>
            is relevant to the core pizzagate topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of these things are connected, related and observable in the same locations, but using that kind of reasoning is to equate paint huffing to crack cocaine.

            My rule of thumb has been to disallow posts about organ trafficking unless there is a strong tie to pizzagate suspects, because we have defined pizzagate as about elite child sex trafficking/abuse.  Perhaps this should have been allowed, given the tie to Haiti.  I do remember hesitating before removing it.

           <p>
            (By the way, I have repeatedly suggested that those researching possible organ trafficking create a sub devoted to that, but they refuse to do so.  You would think that if they really care about that subject, they would have done so long ago.  It really makes me suspect the goal (for at least some of them) is to slide

            <p>
             To my mind, PG has grown a bit broader where the direct links are concerned.  A LOT coming out about Clintions and their connections to Haiti, but I DID look at OP's link, and something seemed not quite right.  I'm especially suspicious of his using ESOTERICshade as a support in his whining.

               but I DID look at OP's link, and something seemed not quite right. I'm especially suspicious of his using ESOTERICshade as a support in his whining.

              My suspicion is they are shills trying to derail the sub with disinfo and distraction.  I try not to let it affect my moderating though.

             Usually there should be a reason posted in the deletion comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Messaging the mod directly is often ignored due to many, many, many posters pestering the mod about the delete without making any attempt to actually address the reason for deletion.
            </p>
            <p>
             The post itself has potential but a lot of work is needed to move it from speculation to evident fact

              I never asked for it to be pinned or looked at as fact. I simply made a post and MF deleted it. Kevdude said to repost it so I did.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only reason I am still saying anything is because Crensch suddenly acts like he’s suspicious of me. I’ve been here daily for over a year and have never even talked to the guy. He thinks I’m a man. Anyone here that knows me even a little bit knows that I’m not a guy. That shows that I’ve never even been on Crensch’ radar.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would just like crensch and Millenial_Falcon to be professional. I’ve never made complaints or started anything with you guys. The only reason Crensch is trying to trash me now is because this is the first time I stood up to Millenial Falcon.

            probably got deleted because,  if you're correct, we now have a trail to follow.Find where cholera outbreaks are, find who is gathering the bodies ,viola you have the traffickers. Millions in Yemen are suffering an outbreak now.Great post !

            I think there was a cholera outbreak in Hondoras after a hurricane a few years before Haiti. If I have time I'll dig into this - I'm thinking it might correspond in timing to the sacrifice a chicken to moloch email.

              I told you this place was compromised didn't I? Threads about bullshit are allowed. This thread you just posted is the most relevant pizzagate thread that has been posted in days. And it got deleted? Threads about Q busting George Soros are allowed to stay. But this very relevant thread got deleted. This is why I say, if I keep pointing this shit out, they will ban me. This sub is a place to drown pizzagate in bullshit. This thread getting deleted proves it.

                 Srayzie, there are dozens of claims here that have no support provided. MF should have cited Rule 2, rather than Rule 1. If you want to post this, you need to track down supporting links for all the major claims that the original author doesn't provide linked support for.

            I don't think we need to 'racialize' the theory, even if it's what the elites believe. Many of the FBIs FOIA releases on Huma and Hillary show regular aid workers and gov observers citing anxiety re: makeshift cholera clinics set up days after the earthquake. It's yet another angle and while the Laura Silsby case is very important, seeing the biowarfare angle is neceassary to understanding how profound human exploitation is in Haiti.

             It's not meant to be a racist theory. When all those girls went missing in DC, people were wondering if that's a trend. Some have wondered if there is something to that.

              He's talking about the source you stupid bitch.  Did you even vet it at all?!  She's a DINDU!  How do you feel about your fellow white women getting raped by blacks to the tune of 35,000 per year?  How many whites rape black women a year?  Some years it is less than the margin of error -- i.e. STATISTICALLY ZERO!

                How do you feel about your fellow white women getting raped by blacks to the tune of 35,000 per year? How many whites rape black women a year?

               I know what a lot of Muslims do to their women and so do you. But anyways. 🙄 What does any of that have to do with this story?
              </p>
              <p>
               Nothing. Distraction. Go shower or something. Do something productive.

                  Wouldn't it mean I hate a fraction of myself? Or maybe I'm an adult and accept facts as they are.  We hate ORGANIZED JEWRY not individuals per se.  This jew I love for example

                   Who is WE? I can't believe you said this because I've argued with you for months telling you that each person is an individual but you lump everyone into groups. I even said this yesterday. Now you say "Not individuals"? Did I teach you something? 😮 Oh damn. I think you learned something.

                    Jews should be expelled.  Not every Jew is guilty. Sucks for them. Not my problem. Oh wait it is cuz I'd be expelled too possibly.  That doesn't change a thing; sucks for me possibly.  Luckily the earth is big.
