            Personally, I think you're giving them too much credit. It's my opinion that the long-game has been played by the DNC and their billionaire backers. By that I mean that they are paving the way for a female president, probably even two. Obviously, for quite some time, this has been Hillary Clinton's predetermined destiny, and despite failing twice, to me at least, all the signs are there for a third shot. All these protests and marches are all signs of the groundwork being laid. They're pushing the narrative that she took on in more recent years (you know, when she miraculously flip-flopped on big issues and then they became central) because it will appeal to three large voting groups; females, non-Whites, and the LGBTQXYZ community. That narrative is being pushed so hard right now that if the election was held next week, I think they would win it. Putting myself in the shoes of the scumbag elites, paving the way for Hillary not only ensures her victory but I think you'd almost guarantee a future Chelsea victory in doing that as well. Just think about it, a nominee that has BOTH parents as past presidents? The stupid masses would eat that up.

            I think the Podesta emails were genuine hacks and he did not want them out there, we learned A LOT of things from those emails. I think Weiner was genuinely led by his, well, Weiner. I think they will both probably end up having to fall on the sword, whether they like it or not. The idea, as I see it, is to keep Hillary as 'marketable' as possible. She will likely come out of all of this smelling of Roses*

             Disagree with your take on public sentiment. One thing I heard loud and clear at the beginning of the campaign was that people wanted  "no more Bushes, and no more Clintons." From the beginning it was Bernie and Trump, at least after Jeb Bush had such a bad showing. Then, when the history of the Clintons became more widely known, she couldn't get a crowd. By 2020, they will all be in jail, and Chelsea with them.

              At the beginning of the campaign I would agree, but what you are seeing now and have been for the last few months (post-election) is an attempt to build Hillary into some kind of untouchable deity.

            "his own way of covering his ass".........No. You're reading too much into this. They're all going down. It looks like John Podesta's vertical velocity was the first to go negative. Many many many will follow in short order.

             Odd that Podesta keeps emphasizing that it was the Russians who hacked his emails, when he was a paid lobbyist for them. Where are the Russian emails? Why were the emails deleted during the abduction of that girl? Did he know the emails were going to be easily hacked and cleaned up some of them?
