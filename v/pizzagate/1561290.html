<p>Many people probably remember this email in the wikileaks from Peter Mattingly to Georgetown Law faculty &amp; staff, it was one of the most blatant among all of the emails:

<p>&quot;Georgetown Law Faculty and Staff,</p>
<p>My parents are visiting this weekend, and I need to sell my enormous collection of beanie babies! I\'ve approximately 480 little creatures of joy, and I\'m selling each one for $20.00. You must buy all 480, though. It is a collection (not an auction)... They are very respectful and amicable with one another, and they are (for the most part) cat and dog friendly. Some are sassier than others, naturally.</p>
<p>Please let me know! My parents can\'t find out.</p>
<p>Peter Mattingly
x9599&quot;</p>
<p>So, I think at this point it\'s obvious to us he\'s not talking about actual Beanie babies. But the fact that he\'s sending out a message this openly (of course with plausible deniability) to the whole staff makes me really think about what is going on in this Jesuit university at the heart of Washington D.C. John Podesta is a visiting lecturer at Georgetown Law department....</p>
<p>So, I was researching Pizzagate in general and came up with the Finders cult. This extremely interesting investigation report: <a href="http://tedgunderson.info/index_htm_files/US%20Customs%20Service%20Report%20of%20Investigation%20FINDERS.pdf">http://tedgunderson.info/index_htm_files/US%20Customs%20Service%20Report%20of%20Investigation%20FINDERS.pdf</a> </p>
<p>describes in detail that the Finders cult was indeed practicing child trafficking at 3918/20 West Street in Washington DC, in extreme proximity to the Georgetown University, basically one block away. The investigation was declared &quot;internal CIA matters&quot; and stopped. </p>
<p>All of this just a few miles from Comet Ping Pong...</p>
<p>I think someone should create a map of Washington D.C. which would show all of these connections. There are some pretty good ones, pointing out all the pedo-symbols in company logos close to Comet Ping Pong, this post has revealed many: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1484616">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1484616</a> </p>
<p>Also there\'s animal sacrifice going on at Rock creek park: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/goats-chickens-pigeons-found-with-throats-slashed-in-rock-creek-park/2014/03/26/c49fed2c-b4e7-11e3-8020-b2d790b3c9e1_story.html?utm_term=.6f84ff7f1fa7">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/goats-chickens-pigeons-found-with-throats-slashed-in-rock-creek-park/2014/03/26/c49fed2c-b4e7-11e3-8020-b2d790b3c9e1_story.html?utm_term=.6f84ff7f1fa7</a></p>
<p>This map is also very interesting: 
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/IfaGj3.png">https://i.sli.mg/IfaGj3.png</a></p>
<p>So, eventually we need to make like an interactive super-map which shows all the connections, like here\'s the Haitian refugee place, and this is the email that relates to that and so on and so on.. If people could clearly see all these connections, they would believe, but it\'s very difficult just giving information in a linear fashion...</p>',
