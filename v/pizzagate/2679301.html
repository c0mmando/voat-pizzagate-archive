total cover-up by the media</p>
<p>The Chinese government has admitted that hundreds of thousands more doses of children’s vaccines are faulty, bringing the total number of vaccines known to be defective there to nearly one million.
The State Council of China announced that another batch of vaccines for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) that were produced by the firm Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, were considered “substandard.” Most of the doses were sold to authorities in the Shandong province in northeastern China, and some have already been given to children.</p>
<p>The latest batch of 247k vaccines joins the 253k defective DPT vaccines from the same company that were discovered last November, along with more than 400k produced by a different company.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese government has done its best to prevent people from talking about the crisis, Chinese social media is still full of conversation about the topic. There have also been reports that the company used expired ingredients and altered testing records.</p>
<p>“Officials have reportedly restricted news coverage and censors have swiftly scrubbed away widely shared essays and posts criticizing the government or spreading bad news. Even news reports from state-owned publications,  have been taken down.”</p>
<p>Some Changsheng Biotechnology personnel have already been arrested in connection with the problem. Chairwoman Gao Junfang, who is also known as the “Vaccine Queen” and considered one of China’s wealthiest women, is among the 18 people who have been arrested so far. The mayor of the drug manufacturer’s home city, Changchun, has also been arrested, along with the deputy governor of the Jilin province .</p>
<p>Where is the media outrage?
It’s not just the Chinese government that is trying to keep the scandal quiet; many American mainstream news outlets are also ignoring the situation or keeping their coverage to a minimum, which isn’t surprising given their general reluctance to report on anything that could cast the vaccine industry in a negative light.</p>
<p>Chinese parents had already lost a great degree of confidence in the government after a scandal a few years ago in which children were disabled and even killed by vaccines that were ruined after they had been transported and stored improperly. This latest incident won’t do much to restore their faith.</p>
<p>vaccines are not only are proving to be inefficient at protecting children against killer diseases but they have in fact been shown to be responsible for killing our kids on mass.
 Elite satanic pedophiles who rule the world are trying to kill everyone through vaccines and chemtrails so that they can sexually abuse and eat children without anyone “pestering” them.  That’s why they are all about abortion, depopulation, contaminating our food supply, the chemtrails, the vaccines.</p>

            UPVoat and thank you for bringing this to the forefront and to our attention.  We have had posts about experimentation on Bland and Brown people for decades and children as well.  Keep your children away from vaccines if at all possible.  Watch the vid for that's what it talks about. Experimentation.  They are using our children and us as lab rats.

             https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-08-21-chinese-government-arrests-wealthy-vaccine-queen-who-has-poisoned-one-million-children-with-faulty-vaccines.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            (Natural News) Gao Junfang, known as China’s “Vaccine Queen,” once one of that country’s wealthiest citizens, was recently arrested along with 17 other high-level officials of the vaccine manufacturing company Changsheng Biotechnology. The company produced not one, but two batches of substandard vaccines and then circulated them to close to half a million Chinese children. According to the South China Morning Post, hundreds of thousands of Changsheng’s combination diphtheria, polio and typhoid (DPT) vaccines were found to be ineffective, while the test records for its rabies vaccine were confirmed to have been fabricated. The once booming company is now facing financial ruin.
           </p>
           <p>
            About three quarters of the affected children have been given some form of treatment, according to the Chinese government, while plans have been put in place to do the same for the remaining kids. Unfortunately, the government cannot be relied upon to supply all the facts of the case, as it has been trying its best to keep a lid on the story, restricting and censoring news coverage of the events, and treating whistleblowers as “troublemakers” rather than heroes.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the age of social media, however, it has proved impossible for officials to totally contain the story or hide the multiple posts from angry parents who have no idea whether their children may also have been given these dangerous vaccines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nonetheless, at least the Chinese government has arrested these vaccine fraudsters, unlike the Big Pharma vaccine tycoons who get away with killing and injuring innocent children on a daily basis in the United States.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gao’s rise from humble origins to billionaire tycoon was formerly the stuff of legend, but now accusations are swirling that she gained control of the company by cheating workers out of their stock holdings and engaged in other shady business practices, including bribery of public officials. Gao’s 18.1 percent stake in Changsheng Biotechnology was frozen by Chinese officials last week.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, government officials, the mainstream media and the medical community would be quick to point out that vaccines are subjected to strict testing and safety standards in the United States, and as such, there can be no comparison with China’s Vaccine Queen and Big Pharma executives in this country. If that is true, however, then why has the U.S. government paid out over U.S.$3 billion to vaccine-injured families since 1986?
           </p>
           <p>
            As previously noted by Natural News, the manufacture of vaccines is at best an imperfect science, and life-changing, deadly side effects are far more common than most parents realize or are told.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please read the article.  Filled with Information.  Also listen to the short video telling about vaccinations.  It's not pretty.

            What is so horrible about this is that the DPT vaccine was one of the earliest tried and true vaccines like the Sabin sugar cube polio vaccine of the 1960s. How did they screw this up?  At least the Chinese government prosecutes the corporate criminals which is more than what the US govt does.

            North and West China is the most likely to stage a revolt situation. Not sure if I like Terry Branstad as the current ambassador as he is matrimonially Ashkenazi, and Branstad is a member of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. He received the honor of "Knight Commander of the Court of Honor" in 2015. He also knew the current Leader of China from 1985? The photo of him and Justin Trudeau creeps me out as well.

            Vaccine industry scares me. Infallibility cult. Never OK to ask questions. Asking what's in this &amp; who made it means you're "anti-vax"  Which isn't accurate at all. Asking questions means I hate science and am too superstitious to be trusted to think for myself. 
Also frightened because how closely related  vaccines are to "family planning" &amp; medical castration in underdeveloped countries.

             I agree.  I will not be vaccinated.  I can't even remember when I received the last one.  Maybe 30 yrs. ago.  They will have to kidnap me and hold me down.  My friend got shingles even though she got the shingle vaccine.  Took her over a year to get over it and she still had lasting effects.  I hope she never gets another one.  We finally got rid of it by putting her on a new eating regimen.  No more inflammation.  But yes, it is baloney that you do not get the disease from the vaccine, just like the flu.  What a runaround.
