            She's right about a lot. They (traffickers) use people like no other. They are practically gods of manipulation. People are used to cover up what they do and the perpetrating victims (I call them that because they are victims unwittingly committing crimes because of how they are so insanely manipulated) never know it. Once you know it, she's right, they are easy to spot. It's tragic. There are many types of cover these traffickers use. I feel like that is a no duh statement, however, it really can't be overstated. I believe her. She only corroborates tactics used and patterns noticed in my own experience. That said, I don't trust her. She seems like bait to me and she already admitted to failing to see their manipulation several times (as all their victims do - 10 years out and I am still discovering and processing how I was manipulated).The best lies and traps are full of truth. I wouldn't be surprised if there are some people designated to keeping an eye on us all here to always be 10 steps ahead.

            What really shocks me though... is how I came to believe in God after getting away. I was one of the last people who would believe and yet here I am ... and much to my surprise, here are so many of you fighting this and also believing in God. It feels crazy that where I find the truth, I find God. No matter how many steps ahead they are, where there is God there is truth and where there is truth there is God. This they can't truly defeat or silence and that gives me strength they can't take away from me.

             I don't doubt that many of the people she names (like Biden, Epstein etc.) have indeed been involved in nefarious activities, but I feel it is adamant to vet stories thoroughly.

              Thanks a lot!!! Yes, I am distrustful of almost all info and I guess because I could relate to some of her story I got real curious.  Doesn't mean she is lying maybe more like F.B. who I have spoken to and some of her story doesn't add up but then pother parts do. I think that trip to Mexico with Biden, the flight records, could be checked out. She said she used her real name as when travelling to other countries we (not spies but normal people) have to use their real name. But thanks a lot! I won't deny I have been tricked before. When someone losses a child it is traumatic, I should know although my children are still alive ( except likely ritual abuse victims)

              Don't disagree...crowd-sourcing speeds that up. So many victims are marginalized (see the kid that purportedly was raped by Bill C on a yacht and the lady that chased that down...Jenny Moore) and re-victimized by TPTB that want them to all conveniently go away. I'm sure that laundry list of Epstein's group are supper happy that the one source to bring it all down is dead (supposedly).

             ^ There's some scattering of dates in the timeline that are a bit off. However, you'd have to have a lot of time on your hands to drop tweets (stand up a site), do some interviews and such...her pined tweet at the top lists known s&amp; unknowns. Former Senator Vitter, Prince Andrew, Epstein (McCain, Alex Baldwin, S Miller...correct me if I'm wrong but these names aren't passed around).
            </p>
            <p>
             * She was a student at Catholic Uni's studying design\architecture when (according to her) she answered an ad in DC City Paper (now defunct) and that ad was for Jeane Palfrey's (DC Madam) Pamala Martin Escort.Svcs...the op than ran for almost 15 years until the IRS picked up leads that lead to that op then other Feds got involved.
             <em>
              Connection to Epstein
             </em>
             Palfrey's submitted a motion that essentially placed the Feds as part\parcel of the operation, that is, in her defense she claimed IC\Feds used her op as a "honeypot". Its not inconceivable at all given that we all know...the Feds don't give a shit, or some powerful black-hat Feds don't give a shit b\c if they did Epstein would be alive in supermax and the vids (chain-of-custody) would not be missing ect...ect...
             <em>
              Ms Collins said she was trafficked, drugged and handled a for a long time.
              <em>
               17 years
              </em>
              That's something that raises a red flag but...
             </em>
             Her dates are off in a few places &amp; doesn't come across as extremely astute (no prob there..seems she's had a hard life since this began). The DC Madem honeypot is discussed in various blog posts. I have yet to find any source linking Epstein's name to Palfrey...but it's not inconceivable that his operation, the escort service, was ~leveraged~ both a foreign and homegrown IC blackmail operation. * I do think this person will need protection or go underground if in fact this is legit (or corroborated) ....you get close to the fire and you disappear or are suicide as we've seen time and time again. * Anyway...see if you guys can identify any dependencies. She does mention that her daughter was trafficked as well (to some pedo's); she died of drug overdose. Interesting vector about her daughter escaping a CCP placed facility (where she was abused\raped) in Halethorpe, MD (now closed)..*Also interesting is the claim that she was trafficked by murdered Fed Asst Atty Johnathan Luna in 2003? His body was dumped in north of Lancaster PA near Euphrata...unsolved.

               There were a lot of relevant VOATs that made some pretty good observations to your post 7 mo ago, 1) she's def got some issues 2) don't dismiss the trauma of victims or potentials by their cover (disorganized thoughts, randomness 3) her family life looks very dysfunctional...
              </p>
              <p>
               I looked at the time line to and tried to track exactly when the mentions started to drop mentions of Epstein...it's all within the last year for someone who had Twitter presence for a long time at least..IT wouldn't shock me though one bit to see Epstein's operation co-opting prostitution rings especially in the DC blast zone...in fact, the DC Madam mentioned is a perfect cover. Its interested that the lawyer repping her, the madam, was under gag order to not put out the 125 numbers of agencies and businesses associated with the black book (phone records of the madam)...diff story.

                Epstein may have been connected to tother trafficking rings and pimps we don't know about yet.
               </p>
               <p>
                Like many other researchers, I just doubt her personal story.
               </p>
               <p>
                A dead giveaway for me is her claim that she is the only legit Epstein victim that has come forward, and that she has been attacking the real Epstein victims. That doesn't make any sense, and is simply wrong,
               </p>
               <p>
                considering how much we know from court documents.
               </p>
               <p>
                Smells of having an agenda tbh. Someone in the backround might pay her to attack the Epstein victims.

                 Right....there are prob many Epstein victims walking around (if they aren't silenced or paid off); that's a disingenuous approach; she did post a screenshot of her Escort Ad and named the MD dude's firm who put it together. I would say that some kind of corroborating material, like some physical attributes ect, about the famous Johns ect might support some claims. It is odd that she mentions the former (and murdered) Fed Atty for DOJ as someone who engaged for svcs...

            Haven't heard of this person before and the possible connection to Epstein is interesting. I think you would get more traction if you mentioned that in your headline along with her name, but you can only edit those for the first ten minutes after submission. If you decide to remove and resubmit with a better title, that is perfectly okay.
