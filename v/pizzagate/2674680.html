            This shit is the real deal. Trust me...Frank Olsen CIA style murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface. Elevator shafts, stair wells, unscreened windows and bridges will serve. Bridge falls into water are not reliable. In simple cases a private meeting with the subject may be arranged at a properly-cased location. The act may be executed by sudden, vigorous [excised] of the ankles, tipping the subject over the edge. If the assassin immediately sets up an outcry, playing the "horrified wit ness", no alibi or surreptitious withdrawal is necessary. In chase cases it will usually be necessary to stun or drug the subject before dropping him. Care is required to insure that no wound or condition not attributable to the fall is discernible after death.
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Security guy gets a call, shortly after Marcus enters the motel. Find this corrupt shithole guys !!!
2) Family gets no nothing except a clock 
3) They found some sort of drug in his blood
4) Screams not on the roof but inside the motel 
5) Autopsy...nah not in this case 
 And many more...BS
           </p>
           <p>
            That was a set up...one of the real ones...and it started before his journey to Berlin. He had stuff at his grandmothers house, witnesse saw Marcus with 3 other man carrying everything away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Marcus was a math bitcoin computer nerd who made a million with his talent...and he made them angry or got them on their cheeks.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what we learn...throw every electronic devices away when you going face to face bc they own this business.
           </p>
           <p>
            RIP Marcus Wipperfürth... Rorschach would be proud

             The set up theory sounds very possible to me.
Security guys name seems to be Mr. Weiss or Weiß (according to the mother)
Plus notice how the security cam stops right after Marcus leaves and Mr. Weiss jumps behind the desk.
            </p>
            <p>
             He probably went after the documents of Marcus but they wouldnt leave that in.

            No one should tell when they are about to expose information.   Just do it.  So sorry for the Mother's loss and that we lost such a Sincere Warrior.  What drove him to Berlin I wonder.  Of all places in the world.

              Best thing you can do to in case of anything. Dead mans switches, tell people you would never commit suicide, and I'm been a little paranoid as of late and even had a few users telling me all of these things to stay anonymous due to researching some heavy topics.  I trusted a few people with my actual identity to check up in case of anything and if need be would use both my Facebook, YouTube, and Voat to get a message from myself across.

              Yep, it is - and IIRC, one shoe is a Mason signature as well. Remember the 'terrorist' attack on London Bridge last year? Where they sent helicopters with 'London Freemasons' painted on them? (Freemasons had donated them.)
             </p>
             <p>
              There was a pic of an injured guy who had lost one shoe on IIRC.

               The Masonic Shoe (as explained on a Masonic website):

              </p>
              <p>
               "The best explanation of the Masonic Shoe is that it is "symbolic of a physical confirmation of a spoken deed or act”..."The deed or act mentioned in this passage is meant to signify both the confirming of a contract, as well as the commitment to carry out the terms and conditions of that contract without fail."

            About half way through the footage that security guy in the suit circles around Marcus then leans on the counter staring at him, nods at someone (guy behind the desk serving Marcus?) as if to say "that's him alright", then pulls out his phone and makes a call. He definitely knows what happened to Marcus. Eerie stuff

             He also moves out of the way of the security camera to make the call, then returns into view as soon as he's off the phone.
