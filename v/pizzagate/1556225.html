            I had multiple exchanges on social media today. People just want to believe what they want. It's maddening. Confirmation bias. Even down to "yeah ok it might be fake but i still believe Russians are hacking him" I mean, WTF, are u not angry at the media and CIA trying to manipulate you with complete lies on a daily / weekly basis? Don't you know you only hate the Russians because you've been fed all this bull.
           </p>
           <p>
            But they don't know and won't know because it's more comfortable to be ignorant and hide behind a mask of moral superiority. It's cosy to believe a slick news studio over some random on twitter with a weird blog

            On the local Tampa  morning show they were discussing  whether it was really that bad what he did, not one of these morons actually questioned  whether it was true or not,fucking idiots may they be fucked in the ass by a HIV ridden merman.

            People are falling for it though. I run a twitter account dedicated to mostly Arsenal and soccer in general and the amount of people I have had to call out for posting about this subject, retweeting discredible scumbag journalists is unreal. My fingers are burnt out from typing. More than anything it has shown me the levels of stupidity on my twitter feed, every single person i actually attempted to correct and tell them what really is happening literally hid behind a rock with emojis and refused to discuss it further. Every single one. We have a bigger job on our hands than i thought, I thought we as a species were smarter than this but our brians have literally been fried. Im no bias, i was very open to believing theae claims about Trump untill it was 100% obvious bullshit after 5 minutes of digging

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A former British intelligence officer now working for a private security-and-investigations firm produced the dossier of unverified allegations about President-elect Donald Trump’s activities and connections in Russia, people familiar with the matter say.
            </p>
            <p>
             Christopher Steele, a director of London-based Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd., prepared the dossier, the people said. The document alleges that the Kremlin colluded with Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and claims that Russian officials have compromising evidence of Mr. Trump’s behavior that could be used to blackmail him. Mr. Trump has dismissed the contents of the dossier as false and Russia has denied the claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Steele, 52 years old, is one of two directors of the firm, along with Christopher Burrows, 58.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Burrows, reached at his home outside London on Wednesday, said he wouldn’t “confirm or deny” that Orbis had produced the report. A neighbor of Mr. Steele’s said Mr. Steele said he would be away for a few days. In previous weeks Mr. Steele has declined repeated requests for interviews through an intermediary, who said the subject was “too hot.”

            Someone from 4ch@n actually came on the Jeff Kuhner talk show just now and gave the inside baseball. His name was Tom and he says the group is talking to a lawyer and they're not going to let this drop. Probably for their own protection, I would think.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was part of the group who created the original story. Apparently Rick Wilson's son writes ludicrous stories about this kind of stuff for his own pleasure, I guess. So the piss story was made to annoy Wilson about the kind of material his son writes. Purely a joke. And what initially started as a joke made it up the chain of command with Wilson to Evan McMullin who I think passed it on to McCain and McCain passed it on to the Intel agencies and media.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA ADDED STUFF about Russia which was NOT in the original story (which is probably why they're talking to a lawyer.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously all the news media is involved but this is going to become a much bigger story than it is even now and I would not be surprised if McCain was forced to resign and Tapper is fired. Please excuse any typos as it's hard to get this on a mobile.

             Why would you delete this thread, other than limiting exposure? You do recognise that Trump and his team are our only hope that something gets done about this bullshit, right? That and this connects to pizzagate because the people reporting PG is fake news, are caught reporting fake news.
            </p>
            <p>
             You also didn't leave a mod tagged explanation on why you deleted the thread, in the thread. If we have to follow the rules, so do you.

              has indeed made a mistake not disclosing the reason for removal in a comment at the time of removal. I can see he has since fixed that problem, although his comment is still not distinguished. I totally agree that mods need to follow their rules as much as other users are expected to follow theirs, so Valkore, please don't forget the explanatory comment as well as distinguishing it in the future.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, I believe he was right to remove this post under rule 1, and I would have done the same.
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               /v/pizzagate
              </a>
              is an investigative subverse, and your post doesn't add anything relevant or of value to the investigation itself. It is more of a general discussion of an indirectly relevant topic that, while may be important to discuss, is always a better fit for
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               /v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              as the main investigative sub is already very diluted as is, which is why we have rule 1 in the first place.

              We're trying to improve our communication, and I apologize if you have indeed contacted us and you haven't received a reply. We have a lot to do as the majority of new submissions violates rules, and also new mods are added to the team continuously. We're still a young team and we're admittedly not optimally organized yet. Please bear with us.

               The rule states that it must be relevant to pizzagate, not that it has to be a new lead in the investigation. I understand you have to protect your non vocal friend, but to claim this doesn't have anything to do with pizzagate is obsurd. You guys are not here to decide what topics we will discuss, so quit playing China and censoring shit that IS relevant to pizzagate.

              <p>
               It's not you who should be apologizing, it's the ones who flat out ignore people. I'm not looking for an apology though, I want this shit to change and I just want you guys to know.. We see you and shit is being documented.

                 Pizzagate is "the investigation". It doesn't say "it has to be a piece/lead or further the investigation". It says it has to relate to pizzagate (the investigation). Quit spinning it to mean something it doesn't. This was big news.

                 Throw one of the biggest stories of the week in pizzagatewhatever hahaha sounds like a good way for mods to make stuff, almost, disappear. I say almost because 324 people out of the 10,298 will still see it.

                  This is my last attempt at explaining, if it's not successful, I give up. The practice will stay the standard practice nonetheless, and submissions like this will be redirected to other subs in the future.

                  This is what this submission is about (directly quoting the title):
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   The MSM write off Pizzagate as "fake news" but call Trump pissgate story real.
                  </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now, let's assume that tomorrow the MSM starts spreading that Tom Hanks is, in fact, a shapeshifting reptile. Am I then rightfully submitting the following post to
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                   /v/pizzagate
                  </a>
                  ?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   The MSM write off Pizzagate as "fake news" but call Hanks reptile story real.
                  </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The only relevance of Pizzagate in OP's post is that it's the benchmark of comparison. Just because I mention Pizzagate in my post, it doesn't automatically make it relevant to the investigation. The definition and rules have been crafted well enough to eliminate that loophole.

                   Now Trump is as relevant to pizzagate as Tom Hanks? LOL
Forget that people have accused him of being involved, through Epstein? 
Forget that he and his admin are the only hope at getting pizzagate exposed/prosecuted through the DOJ? This was good news for pizzagate because it shows he isn't compromised by this document and so far he isn't a sexual deviant.

              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Phobos_Mothership">
               @Phobos_Mothership
              </a>
              and when I questioned it, I was ignored. I then tagged
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Millennial_Falcon">
               @Millennial_Falcon
              </a>
              about it and was ignored again. Should I start a thread about this to get something done? Or will it just get deleted? Save and archive I guess.

            Wouldn't you think the 4chan guy would be afraid the story would never break out on the news and the CIA investigating Russia could have used that info and compromise Trump? Could he get jail time?

            what if its all one big plot to ultimately discredit channers. scenario: they go in and plant a fake convo early on about how they are feeding some fake story to wilson. fastforward a few months, story breaks and people freak. then the convo thread is brought up again and the narrative that "4chan created the hoax" is being fed to the public. now what happens? they lose all credibility and general public thinks 4chan, voat, are all a bunch of liars and any talk on the boards of pizzagate, etc can also not be taken seriously. bc they are just making up a bunch of fake news stories. ----- what do you think? can anyone vouch for the guy saying he fed wilson the fake story?

            It's not us. That's what it's being called. Pissgate/Pizzagate... is the similarity a coincidence?

            There's a troubling similarity with pizzagate in the mistaken identity of Michael Cohen, like with DOJ Andrew Klein. Fake news only becomes a problem if we let it and allow ourselves to be misled. How to avoid it? Don't assume things to be true. Demand proof.

            I know. It just pisses me off. I have some guy on Twitter who keeps sending me messages to check out #pissgate and said he hopes I enjoy my president that likes to fuck his daughter and grab pussy. I wasted all this time explaining Hillary's corruption and Pizzagate. Gave him links and pictures and it goes over his head and he says he can't believe so many people are this gullible.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are the informed ones! We do our own research! We don't just listen and read MSM but do our research. These people are so blind and mind controlled and I'm so sick of being called a conspiracy theorist! The media has used this Russia hacking crap to take attention away from the actual corruption that was exposed! That should be the focus. Why aren't more people not freaking out over that and demanding answers?!
           </p>
           <p>
            I swear, it's not good for me to watch the news sometimes. I purposely didn't even watch the Meagan Kelly interview with James Alefantis. I knew My blood would start boiling. I get pissed and nobody in my life cares or wants to hear about the truth and they hate politics. My 15 year old started getting into it during the election and is wanting to know more. Other than that, the only place I have to vent and have like minded people is online. People who just want to live blindly just irritate me so bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry for the venting! I'm just so thankful to have good people like you all that care enough about these poor children and take time out of your lives to try to bring these people down. I'm proud of us for being good people. 🙌🏻

            A big huge thank you to 4chan.  And to the MSM who fell for it, they are not journalists, they cannot think for themselves. They are victims in that they are willing to destroy their credibility and careers rather than recognize that someone took a piss on them. Really, it is sad and shows how completely brainwashed (or culpable) these people are. And sadder, is that they think we are stupid enough to fall for their bait, when in fact 4chan laid the trap. Its hilarious but also so pathetic.

               Well? What is your position then? You have asked for why I consider it Relevent for being discussed and investigated , compared to the Pissgate proper fake news? How do you feel on the subject?

                 Well. I can see you are either a little retarded, or you are just a person who has difficulties dealing with there own pedophilia . Or you are directly involved . If you have looked at the circumstantial evidence and feel that there is no reason to be concerned that children are at risk .  There is no point discussing with you . When you disregard the evidence I presented to you . Which is not even conclusive , the sheer weight of supporting evidence ,would be impossible to write out in a post.
What is your position on the subject?

                  You gave me your version of events. If you believe that a pedo ring is in operation and children are in danger or getting killed and you haven't gone to the police with your evidence, you're as bad as any of the pedos you say are involved.

What d'ya mean 'I gave you my version of events?' I think it is starting to become clear what person we are dealing with . You haven't got a clue have you. We are doing everything we can for the justice for these kids , you can guarantee we won't give up either..

               Look at all the circumstantial evidence and you tell me that there is nothing there to warrant an investigation? Plus the fact look at how easily the Main Stream Media have run with this allegation . But regarding Pizzagate ,which had far more solid reasons to run with the story . They call it 'Fake News' and behave like the most decently behaved people ever. Since when have Media not run with money making stories ,even when the facts have not been verified? Then you have John Podesta ewho has been publicly called a Child Abuser. And he has not tried to sue anyone. If someone accused me of this crime , I would be making sure my name would be cleared right away. Is John Podesta not bothered that people consider him a child abuser?

                 So are you telling me you have looked at the evidence. And you are quite happy with things? Do you have friends like these? That might be where we are differing . Are you desensitised? 
 .What do you not feel is valid in reference to carrying out an investigation. What areas have you looked at and decided' Wow that's perfectly Normal everyday behaviour , that I and my friends get upto?!' 
I mean, if it is a case of 'you have looked at all the pizzagate material and decided 'Thats normal behaviour' Then that is what is our difference is . I do find a Person who makes sexual comments about children on facebook/instagram posts odd, and when you combine the sort of Bands 'Majestic Ape's Heavy Breathing' That perform at Comet Pizza . That create video's and music which has images of BDSM mixed with Children. And The free disgusion of 'Are you a Pedo etc etc . These are the freaks who talk about how they killed there new born baby cos of the inoises it was making. These are the freaks which discuss with the audiance that the manager has a taste in children and little boys, and comments that everyone has there preferences . 
Then you have James Alefantis's Ping Pong Pizza place that encourages children to the place ,despite it being full of Adult imagery on the walls, Pieces of Art in the Bathroom which say's 'Shut up and Fuck'. Very healthy child enviroment. Along with the signage related to his Pizzaria's being Officially recognises symbols that underground Pedo Rings use to communicate without general populace being savvy too. 
The list of reasons that cry out 'An official Investigation should be carried out.
Along with the fact that you find that the Mainstream Media ,have suddenly become saints and decided 'No Story here' lol We ought not make money from this !? I mean WTF since when have the press stopped running stories ,even if the facts were not as yet on the table? 
And how about our two lovely Brothers Tony and John Podesta who just love to collect pedophile related Artwork of Kim Noble and plenty of other names within that area of disgustting imagery . We are all waiting for the brothers Grimm to come and sue all the people who have Libelled and slandered the Child Abusing Nonces . Not a peep heard from them ? FFS If someone publicly stated that I was a child abusing Pedo , I would be wanting to clear my name! Just like any other right minded person. But no, they are quite happy for these claims to go unpunished . Because they don't want the truth being exposed.
Pizzagate is sadly real even though it is something so foul and beyond imagining ,the fact is it is being swept under the rug.
Just like the Franklin cover uo
Just like The Haut de la Garande

             Let's play that game for a minute. Do I want kiddie diddlers or a guy that pays prostitutes to piss.... I'll take the pisser. I hope he pulls the pizzagate card now. Especially on McCain and Lindsay Graham.

             Pizzagate is based on verified Podesta and DNC emails, with evidence being also posted on the FBI vault. There is no debate over the "carelessness" of using an unsecured personal server for state biz or having p@ssword for security (by an expert). the content of the emails is original source material and shows proof of wrongdoing in regards to knowingly funding terrorists at the very least.

            There is a great opportunity here for all Voaters to use this debacle by the MSM as a conversation starter with PG skeptics. My jaw hit the floor when I heard it last night and I immediately knew CNN had been trawled. The Ministry of Information is really off it's game !!

This is a total bluff, an absolute fabrication, complete nonsense,he Kremlin does not collect compromising information.

                truth be told, I haven't an idea and haven't searched either...I see it phrased a lot, totally thought it had something to do with pepe or something. But, I do agree with you on repenting. Too damn late. I believe people like us don't have a specific narrative to push in order to collect our paychecks. We do this out of the pure feeling of "it's right, it's right to investigate, and report truth no matter how harsh"

            It gives me hope that Trump may not be a Rothschild puppet -- controlled opposition -- which has been my worry from the start. I used to bash Trump. If he tackles pizzagate, which I'm sure he knows is real, he will be my new hero.

            The MSM have completely blown all remaining credibility. The have fallen for a 4chan hoax. Read this thread and linked tweets for an explanation on how it happened.

             4chan started this based on a post in November?  References to this were already in print in  October. Harry Reid had already asked the FBI about this.

             November is too late for this.   What's the earliest mention on 4chan?

              Been reading the 4chan guys are scared and have spoken to a lawyer. They think they may have to protect themselves by coming forward and tells big their story. What scared them was the CIA Added lots of embellishing details which they didn't provide.
             </p>
             <p>
              It makes sense to me. CIA are the worst enemy in the world to have. Best to come forward and explain everything start to finish. Then there is no reason to suicide them if they've nothing left to hide; their deaths, as they are now public, would cast more light on the CIA

              Nope! The ultimate sleeper patriot. Even his reality tv career was grooming his image, ingraining  on the minds of Americans, creating a massive twitter following, and cultivating a winner image, the guy who fires or hires. He's been planning this for many years, despite the media pretending it's a whim. When he saw the madness of Hillary, I guess he felt he had no choice. People also dismiss his intelligence; he's genius level. My only concern is his greatest strength could be his weakness; he has a massive ego and can be too brittle with criticism. He's not perfect but nobody else could have pulled this off

               He's true blue, loves America, and Roger Stone says he's fearless. Yes, providentially he's been raised up for this moment. Trump from an old Playboy interview: "Life is what you do while you're waiting to die. You know, it is all a rather sad situation.
We're here and we live our 60, 70, or 80 years and we’re gone. You win, you win, and in the end, it doesn't mean a hell of a lot. But it is something to do—to keep you interested." He knew his time to run was about to expire.

               Not just Gary Webb, but Phillip Marshall.  He was an ex-pilot for the CIA that wrote a couple 9/11 books and was investigating a lead at a airplane boneyard/graveyard for retired planes in Az. He heard the real planes that were supposed to hit the towers were there.  Soon after that the police said he killed his children and dog before committing suicide. His computer and all his notes on his new book were missing.  The whole scene was extremely suspicious but was never investigated.

              I am really shocked they fell for this (CIA and MSM). It is so outrageous that it sets a perfect pretext for Trump to go in with CIA reform, and bring the MSM under control (allowing them to be held liable and sued for fake news etc)

               No. MSM shouldn't be under control of any government. And if you want to accuse someone of fake news, which is MSM's bullshit narrative, you've already lost the game.

                No we should accuse people of fake news. We cannot refuse to play their word games. They create narratives and tropes and force them on us. If we igore, they win. We need to hijack their words and use them against them. FakeNews has been such a massive success for us - to the extent the WaPo and others want to retire the word because Its almost exclusively used to describe the MSM. Use it! Fake news now means lying MSM

                 Who says MSM under control of government? They should have checks and balances. As it stands the fourth estate has become the single biggest branch of government; consider the manipulation and lies . At the very least they should be able to be sued for lies .its not persecution: they simply must be able to stand over a story before publishing it. They've pulled shit this year that no media would ever do in the past. "I was raped by Trump 27 years ago" "can u prove it?" "No" "did u report to the police!or complaint to anyone?" "No" "ok we will run it as nausea for weeks, and it will be picked up by every single media outlet and blasted throughout tv and social media for months" wtf

                Agreed, it's a slippery slope to try to control what is real vs what is fake news.  IMO make it as free and open as possible.  Let people make their own minds up as to what is real and fake.  With the internet, you can get to the truth pretty quickly.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think overall the term "fake news" will be used against the MSM far more than against the more obscure alt-right media.  They will regret inventing that term and strategy as it will be used against them.  They often forget that no one trusts them and their approval ratings are horrendous.

                <p>
                 When it comes to "holding media accountable" and being able to "sue" them, I am vehemently opposed to Trump.  It is IMPERATIVE to a free society that the media remain untouchable by political elites.  The government should have NO DOMAIN over the media.  PERIOD.  EVER.
                 <br/>
                 Because although you may love what Trump has to do and say, REMEMBER in 4 or 8 years someone YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH will be in the White House.  Do you want THEM to have control of the media?  Because they will in your scenario.

                   That's the perfect example actually.  The press has to be free to make their stupid outlandish claims, because there will never be an objective way to determine what is "outlandish".  Someone always has an agenda and when those people are in control, they will mold the press to their agenda.  Therefore the only logical solution is to have complete freedom of speech and information.  Even fake news must be allowed.

                  The current media is 100% committed feeding you propaganda and lies.  There is nothing objective about it.

                4 chan created it - look at this chain:

               <p>
                I think a lot of the media backed off it or were quite tentative reporting. ALL OF THEM new it was very iffy for publication, SOME OF THEM knew it was bogus. But the Far Left nutjobs reported in desperation it would stick. Massive mistake.
               </p>
               <p>
                Personally i think that the good guys in the CIA leaked it to the press HOPING they would fall for it.  Its clear they had this via McMullin / McCain. Its a double bluff.
               </p>
               <p>
                I refuse to believe the CIA bigwigs who hate Trump would leak this actually thinking it wouldn't backfire massively and discredit them.  It took Twittersphere a few hours to uncover the whole sordid chain back to 4Chan, so surely the CIA could have figured out the story would only damage them.

                Thats my theory, could be wrong, but don't think so.

                 The thing is, these people we're dealing with think that they are on some other level of intelligence to everyone else - they think they are like the next stage in evolution or something, when clearly they aren't. So they consistently underestimate the Internet citizenry, and they also consistently do dumb stuff.

                  You know if it was a planned 'leak', numerous people would have had to have a chat about it before doing it.  These people are top intel... maybe you are right. But i find it easier to believe my theory.
