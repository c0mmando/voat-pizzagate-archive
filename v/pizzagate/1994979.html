            We all need to be standing up for this guy. He's fighting overwhelming odds in tackling The Pedo.Cannibal Elite! Let's be proud! We elected that guy ... the one doing the right thing!

             I agree 100%@quantokitty!  It is a rare man who will put up with such a barrage of muck being hurled at him, for doing the right thing. 
 ESPECIALLY when he is a multi-millionaire who has such a great family and quality of life, he could have ignored any social unjust and no one would have blamed him.  BUT he loves his country, loves his veterans, and believed he could make a change. God bless and keep President Donald Trump and the people around him safe!  Name another person who could have stood up to these DemonRats and fake Republicans? - I wish we had a Donald Trump as a Prime Minister here in UK. You are all lucky to have him. IMO - Amazing:

              You get it and I applaud you for being wide awake and understanding exactly what is going on. I truly admire him for doing this, and the fact he isn't perfect, and knew what he was getting into, makes this all the more miraculous.

               Yes, probably the only person who would not let them get under his skin, though they try daily.  His goals are on the people and America. From his vantage point of rubbing shoulders with most of these 'elites', he probably knows all those sick things they're into and is glad to be in a position to do something about it.  I have said it before, but worth saying again, I think his stance on no alcohol/drugs and especially his OCD regarding germs has served him well, to keep him from participating, and his Christian upbringing under Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.  Loved when he debunked the fake 'Russian Dossier' by saying at the end, people who know me and know my 'thing' with cleanliness know I would never be involved in such a disgusting thing.

                Absolutely. The Dems only needed to get their Cannibal Queen elected to seal the deal and destroy the US. He was the only one of the Republican candidates that stood a chance of beating her. The press did everything they could to prevent it. Thank the Good Lord for that email leak. Whether it was Seth Riich or someone else, I am eternally grateful for letting some of us peek behind the scenes and see what was really going on. after reading those emails I would never vote for Killary and her One Hemispheric Government.

                 I only 'woke up' April 2016 when I came across Mark Taylors Prophecy about Donald Trump. I have never had the USA on my mind in my life, but when I saw the thumbnail it looked interesting, so I listened. Wow, that started me on a whole different path, I had been concerned about child abuse here in UK since the Jimmy Savile case and this seemed to be intertwined. I began to check the internet and came across this enormous community of truthseekers.  Of course, my grown up children think I am easily fooled and manipulated by the internet, as they are the younger generation and we oldies don't understand the www!  I have never been more discerning in my life.  I pray for the President and that all these heinous acts are exposed publicly, not for the sensationalism of it but for the sake of the children being safe and saved from it.  I wish people here in UK could see past the 'news' but I don't blame them for thinking we are 'crazy'....who would believe that there is a whole government elite that engage in such vile practices as human trafficking/paedophilia/even cannibalism and murder? The normal person on the street cannot comprehend it or do not want to face/believe it. - I just pray that more people open their eyes and minds and get behind us as it is only going to be the 'average Joes' coming together as a force that will make a big enough voice for something to be done.  Thank God for Pres.Trump and A.G. Sessions, (love how he swats Joe Bidens hand away from touching his grand-daughter, priceless) they know exactly whats going on!  Watch this space, things are accelerating they are not going to be able to stop the tsunami coming their way.

               Virginia Giuffre claims she was “recruited”(?) to work for Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell while Giuffre was working as a towel girl at Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort
              </p>
              <p>
               Also Epstein’s mansion and Trump’s Mar-a-Lago are only 10 minutes from each other

               I don't know about him pimping out his daughter, but in researching Epstein I came across a politico article discussing allegations against Trump by a girl recruited as a sex slave for Epsteins parties in NY.

               Hey Blacksmith21 good discernment, I reckon this DonkeyHole is a waste of our time.  Lets just ignore him/her/it is not worth our valuable time!  He gets paid to do this stuff, we don't, so the more attentions we give the more Soros gives him.......lets not help these sorry cretins.  :) keep up the good work Blacksmith21

              These bills have broad bipartisan support and are part of trend of raising consciousness about trafficking from at least 2013.
             </p>
             <p>
              The president didn't come up with these bills, they already passed the house on a voice vote.  He's responding to the house.

               Yes is Kaine just too creepy?  Not much said about him.  He could have become Pres. if she keeled over. We also have to worry about Pence now. I think he was a trade off for something. Pedo material imo.

              So far what I've read from the bills is that they'll train department of labor employees to spot trafficking, give the department of labor a prosecutor for this, and allow local law enforcement the power to hire specialist.  Oh and cross country law enforcement information.
