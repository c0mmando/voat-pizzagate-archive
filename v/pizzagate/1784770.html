           Some of Scotland’s most prestigious private schools, including the alma maters of the Prince of Wales and Tony Blair, are to be investigated as part of a national child abuse inquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
           The figure includes more than 60 residential care establishments, including Barnado's and institutions run by religious orders and local authorities.

            Thanks. I share your frustration, The worst feeling is when something is so good and so bad, we need the best of both worlds (pun intended) to help spread public awareness.

            I hear that brother, this is why we need to take back government and make it local again - for as long as centralized power exists so will rampant pedophilia, These people, unfortunately, do not have our best interest at heart.

            They really are. Smacks of establishment cover up.

            Thank you so much for the post!  A great resource for digging in regards for some of the (historical) research I'm working on (but I am busy all week so will get back to it next week).
           </p>
           <p>
            Every time a life long pedo like Sir James Wilson Vincent "Jimmy" Savile, Sir Cyril Smith or Sir Clement Freud die (because that's when the offenses are finally let out of the bag), we know there are pedos in their closest circle of friends, and who presumably helped cover up their crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every time someone like Christopher Kloman gets sent to prison, we know there are at a minimum, pedo enablers, somewhere within his circle of influence.

             I cannot even imagine where i would be today in life were it not for the dedicated truthers who have shown me the real world from the one i was swindled into believing as a young man. We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty, charm, and adventure. There is no end to the adventures we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open. You don't need to thank me, my work is dedicated to all you's who have inspired me, you know who you are.

              Definitely I'd like to read them...
             </p>
             <p>
              I have a theory about some of the roots of the world epidemic of Globalist Pedophilia agenda.  I'm not the first to have it, because I run across similar sentiment in some articles I've read recently (can't list them offhand but I have them).  Basically it's the intersection of the British Intelligence with pedophiles, entomologists, and the occult (of course the "entertainment" industry goes without saying). LOL!
             </p>
             <p>
              Consider the ideal covert agent, no real ties to family, happy to travel the world preying on children.  Such a person is happy to do the government's bidding because they indulge his "preferences" in exchange for intel.  All the while he has total access and immunity to commit whatever crimes against children he may find satisfying.  Having a profession, such as being an entomologists, or a 'schtick' such as being an eccentric occult figure, made traveling the world ideal at that time (mid to late 1800s to early 1900s), traveling under the guise of science or the guise of "studying world religions".  There's a lot of support for this theory IMO.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I had to guess how a similar dynamic works out today, it would involve intel agencies from many countries, and would involve people who are on the board of many International 'Charities', that provides a reason to be anywhere in the world to 'help' people.  Of if they are not be directly on the board, they may be able to travel under the cover of attending conferences for any number of 'causes'...SJ and Globalism, Orphanages, Helping Developing Countries, Globalization of Healthcare...today the sky's the limit.

            How do they go about investigating these institutions? Do they put out a shingle and see who comes forward? I can't imagine any of the places actually kept records that would implicate them. Really, how do they go about investigating? I am quite curious.

             Child sexual abuse in the United Kingdom has been reported in the country throughout its history. However, well-publicised cases in recent years have involved popular entertainers, politicians, military personnel, and other officials. Around 23,000 cases were identified during 2012/2013 - I think Jimmy Saville was the turning point and what followed was the domino effect. Hope i helped.

              I think there are enough in high places to keep things under wraps for too long. Its only when there's a death or somebody new comes in who isn't involved that it actually finally comes out.
