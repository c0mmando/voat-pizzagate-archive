            Hardly, what do you do with the bodies of a fuck load of kids? You cut them up and sell them to the chinese, organ harvesting is a hundred billion dollar industry and could explain how obamas bought himself a house in Dubai and why hill itch has 1.8bn in a Saudi bank account. man I wish I could downvoat you

            This was one of the first things discussed in the early day's,,, it's the hawain connection. David Flintstone etc. and probably linked to the hawain hot dog stand. There's was a shed of info about it on 4chan. surprised it's not already been discussed here. This post led to the other one about the house in florida. The one that was the only house on the street with bars on the windows and a crapped out van in the drive with what looked like bags of [childrens?] clothse in the driveway. I even remember someone spotted men waiting out front in their cars... not gonna dig for the old info now but was surprised that that wasn't the place someone went vigilante on first cuz it looked sketch as fk!! The fact that this is only coming out onto voat now makes me think we really do need a wiki on this stuff... this post led to finding 'itchie Gross' [aka Ritchie Gross] who sold pizza spice packets and who's linked in profile had the Epstein's Plane wing as his linkedin profile.. I actually looked at his profile before it went private....
           </p>
           <p>
            yeah,, pizzagate needs a wiki badly!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            if no one's done it by tomorrow i might dig out the archives of the 4chan threads in the start if I can and collate the info....

            In April 2016 Reddit user u/throwawaywtfwila located a concrete slab emanating 30 wiki signals.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             These buildings are about 150-250 feet away. I built them with my boss on concrete pads that were laid by seemingly normal contractors, but the footprint had been prepared and leveled by very shady tongan contractors before I arrived. Supposedly, before i arrived on site they demoed a warehouse where the big building stands and pulled out HUGE liquid tanks that would have left a very large open space in the ground after removal.
Also, very curiously a municipal storm drain running adjacent to the building had been removed during the site prep and another one installed on the opposite property line, and the new one was significantly larger than the old one. The old one was too small for a person to go into, but the new one is about the size of a door.
If you look at Google maps, you can see the old storm drain on the property line between 577 and 567 pakala st, honolulu 96825
I reckon that if you wanted to excavate an access to the space mentioned above, an old storm drain would be a good way to do it.
Also, i noticed a truck making multiple late night trips for many days removing lots of busted up new looking concrete from the neighbors city trash bins. The property i lived on and that neighbors property are lease holds held by the same person (not my old boss).
Ive also recently connected my old boss to ebay accounts selling "faulty hard drives" and "faulty" electronics for strange prices. The buyer feedback is very bizarrely enthusiastic and there are lots of disturbing mentions of "very happy kids" and "no fakes"
I think i stumbled on a possible human trafficking and child p*** ring.
What do you think?

            Because it occurred so long prior to the Pizzagate emails I didn't make the connection until someone posted today about Obama being in Hawaii for the next two weeks.

             The next three months are going to be rougher internally than in Beijing. Between 7th and 1600, no fun. Hope you're doing ok. I'm dreaming about your hotdog stand in Hawaii...
