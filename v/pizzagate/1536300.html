            There is a biography type movie on Amazon prime about him called "Underground: The Julian Assange Story". It discusses his childhood in the cult and his early life escaping the cult. It's pretty good.

            I completely understand why he is doing this. There is nothing worse than being abused and no one helping, no one to stand up for you. I  know the helplessness these children feel to some extent.  If even half of what this investigation has exposed is real, it's horrific. I believe most of it's true.  It's awful thinking no one cares. I'm sure there are many following this investigation who have been abused and really really wanted someone just to care. To care enough to do something.

             His mother had a boyfriend who was in The Family cult and she lived in the vicinity and was at least party involved with it for a period, going to meetings and hanging around it socially.  The cult aided the now ex-boyfriend in terror stalking her as she moved again and again for years, either for his or its purposes.  There was a period in Assange's boyhood where he would have been available to the cult and he is possbily pictured with the main group of blond cult kids as a boy.  He would have been the right age to be accessed, drugged, raped and alters created for the period of a year or two.  He might have recieved special training or been a focused autodidect genius programmer in part as a kid because of his cult mind training and its effects.

              possibly pictured my arse. I have thoroughly checked out this false story, weeks ago. 
The day JA and his mother learned of the shady stalker boyfriend's cult connection from a PI, was the day JA told the guy to FO out of their lives, and he did.. JA's own words.
 GET YA FACTS RIGHT MUPPET. Oh that's right, Pizaagate loons are allergic to facts.

             A Google search seems to suggest he indeed had extensive contact with a cult during his youth. If it's been "debunked" surely you have some evidence for it.

            I have more info, but I don't have the links now.  I was interested in Assange when he made his big splash.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cult used heavy psychotropic drugs to mind control kids, experiment with mind control.  Had a lot of educated doctors, nurses and psychologist types in it - people with access to drugs through local hospital/s where they worked.  The woman who ran it was truly creepy and did something so that all her "children" (she had 10-20 "special ones") always had white blond hair.  Yes, like Assange.  They were all kept tightly watched and kept on a very controlled wakeup/chores/classes/meal/sleep routine in some kind of upstairs "nursery" where they were educated by the cult members in a particuar way - their idea was to created controlled genius minds or something along those lines, some of the cult members were pedos and rape was used to traumatize under psychotropic drugs and also the pedos in the group no doubt had access to what they wanted at other times.  There is at least one female survivor that has gone on the record about the practices of this cult.  Surviving members of this group of children said they might have been well educated in one field, but knew little about regular life and whole fields of knowledge, like geography for example.  These children were poorly nourished and abused verbally and physically as well.  There is an account about how they would hide from child protective service type visits which were infrequent anyway, but they were well schooled in avoiding detection.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 30 addresses when he was a kid was all about his mother trying to hide from and escape the cult.  She got involved with it through a musician/con man that was in it, it was in the vicinity of where they lived in rural  Australia when Assange was young. She never was totally in it as in living at the main compound, and she ran for years with her kids and since the cult had moles in government every time they found a place and she would work, they'd tip off the cult through payrole slips or some other official documents, and the cult would show up again and they'd be off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, as Assange was a teen and into early twenties his life centered around his first (and only) wife.  He married young and was apparently trying to get his wife away from the/a cult.  By this time he was a prodigy coder and he at one point spent many months holed up with his young wife and I think first child in a rented small house.  Somehow he lost all of this, probably the wife returned to the cult with their baby, and he now spent a considerable time in and out of mental hospitals.  He finally emerged and worked with Australian law enforcement to bust pedophiles and the cult and I think he made a deal with them to possiby try to get his kid at least away from the cult. The Family was eventually busted by Australian law enforcement in an international effort because I believe the main woman had taken refuge in the US.  Anyway, Assange went through major custody battles with his mother's support and I suspect a  lot of that was to get his kid away from pedos, drugs and mind control situations that his ex was helpless to stop. The kind of stuff he did with law enforcement was creating databases, coding programs to compare and share data, that kind of thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point Assange's official biography more or less can kick in and you can follow his career from when he was busted for hacking and started to make deals and work with law enforcement -The Assange of the Official Story, but the part of his life from young childhood to early twenties has always had huge gaps in it and strange shadings of cults, government intel, a tragic marriage, periods in mental institutions, isolation and apparently genius level hacking and coding abilities that were supposedly autodidactic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assange is a fascinating character, and though I have long had suspicions regarding who, what and if he was controlled, it seems that in the later period of his life Wikileaks has ultimately served the people.  I wonder if he doesn't have at least an alter personality or two, but really with Assange there are so many things we will probably never know.
           </p>
           <p>
            I researched all this a few years ago and was going to put it online, but ultimately I decided against it.  Everything I've talked about is available from the internet and various articles and biographies on Assange.  I've got the basic outline sort of filled in, but this is what I remember off the top of my head so apologies if something is out of order or whatever.  Perhaps this will spur others to look into Assange's decidedly strange early life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: I'm not entirely sure Assange was actually married, but if not it was like a marriage and they pretended it was to rent a place, etc.  He did fight difficult custody battles over his first child.  That kid is alive and has given a couple of interviews, but mostly Assange was not in his life.

            I remembered recently having seen some big threads on reddit years ago, and some blogs, about WWASP programs and various cults that parents would send their """troubled""" kids to, some people were referring to these so called "teen escort services" that would effectively kidnap kids at the behest of the parents. A lot of surivor stories confirmed the same thing, that they would be forcibly taken to "boarding schools" or "ranches" where they were tortured and almost always with a religious theme. A lot of the pizzagate stuff reminds me of this a lot, and much like pizzagate I remember there was a very strong effort to keep this stuff covered up, like silencing victims and the MSM of course completely ignoring it even when so many murders were being uncovered at these places. It's unreal how widespread it is and yet how unknown it is to the general public. The whole escort thing is effectively legal kidnapping, and given the parent involvement (and how parents are often involved in elite pedophile rings) it seems like there's a lot of paralllels there. Reminds me of the claims about some of the Dutroux style rings having parents giving up their children to be abused. And much like the Dutroux affair this kind of thing is protected at the highest levels.

            Not sure why this matters. Children don't get to decide what cults and or churches they're in. Adult Assange is pretty normal. Aside from his extraordinary commitment to truth and justice and willingness to sacrifice his own comfort and safety.

             It's interesting to me because it could be part of the reason Assange is so motivated in this fight against the global elites which he must know are doing this child trafficking.  It doesn't necessarily help the investigation, unless there's a potential connection between this cult and whatever Podestas are doing.

                   He hasn't signed with his PGP key in 2 months. His .onion chat room has been dead for the same amount of time. He is never shown in the same frame as any of the interviewers. WL twitter made consecutive spelling errors to craft a message: "help him". The block chain recently erupted with anomalously high peaks of transactions. Many transactions were put up with very large transaction rewards for "no apparent reason".  His face morphed in the previous interview.

                   I think that it is very likely that the intelligence community is trying to keep Wikileaks alive as a giant honeypot for potential leakers. It's too late. We got the memo. They fuck little kids. They kill our children. They rape our land. They are not Americans. They are going to die. I, in addition to many others, will likely be devoting our lives to the cause. We were awoken. This is an irreversible transformation that will spread like a cancer through our perverted society. It will edit the fabric of our collective societal consciousness.

            Am I the only one who finds it suspicious that a movie is conveniently being made about this cult around the same time Assange, a victim of said cult, leaks the information that lead to pizzagate?

            It seems like there may be powerful forces responsible for sparking the pizzagate investigation; Doesn't anyone wonder who they are?

             I think it's been pretty well publicized that it is a faction of the FBI that staged a "countercoup" against forces traitorous to the US, at least concerning pizzagate and Wikileaks.
