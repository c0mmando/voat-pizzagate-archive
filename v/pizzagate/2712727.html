<p><strong>Exposing the CIA “Deep Cover Agent” Network in the US</strong></p>
<p>In the 1980s, one of the CIA officers who came out of the woodwork to speak to Valentine was “Larry.” Larry was a former Marine who was recruited into the CIA during the Vietnam War. After Vietnam, Larry was set up by the CIA’s Central Cover Staff to be a “deep cover agent”. He was set up with a fake life and job history, and was assigned to the Philippines, where for 10 years he worked at management-level positions at American corporations all over the Philippines, all the while secretly reporting back to the CIA. These corporations include General Motors, Visa Card, and Westinghouse, and they all knowingly provided cover to this CIA agent.
On top of this, “Larry” actually managed to get himself elected to the Philippines as a legislator, all the while still being a CIA deep cover agent. Apparently, this was a bridge too far for the US State Department, so Larry was “whisked” out of the Philippines, his CIA assignment there ended. </p>
<p>In reward for his years of service in the Philippines, the CIA rewarded Larry, as a kind of cushy “retirement job” by making <strong>him the manager of the “Four Ways” Restaurant, a super-exclusive restaurant at DuPont Circle in DC</strong>. Larry invited Doug Valentine to meet at the restaurant, where he described what happened:</p>
<p>“This restaurant was the fanciest place I had ever been in my life. It was a place where striped pants State Department officials, foreign dignitaries and business tycoons met to make deals…each lavishly appointed room had its own dining table and waiter. </p>
<p>I was directed to a leather booth in the wood-paneled basement barroom, where Larry casually explained that each room was bugged by the CIA.</p>
<p>As we were talking, a group of well-dressed young men and women, chaperoned by an older man, took the booth next to us. The rest of the barroom was empty. They ordered drinks but remained silent and alert as Larry explained the ins and outs of his CIA experience to me.</p>
<p>At one point, Larry nodded to the older man at the next booth, then informed me that <strong>the young people listening to our conversation were [CIA] junior officer trainees from Langley</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Larry told me that the CIA manages a parallel society where deep-cover agents like him, as well as retired CIA officers and their agents, are provided with comfortable employment in their retirement years, or when they otherwise need sanctuary and recompense for their services</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of these agents […] are folded into this parallel universe as managers of the local Ford dealership, or proprietors of a Chinese restaurant, or in hundreds of other jobs held in abeyance by cooperating businesses.”</p>
<p>Doug Valentine sums up this CIA-run “deep cover” network as “…the hidden geography of Top-Secret America, a subculture of highly trained operators with a dangerous set of skills that can be called upon at any moment. The one thing they have in common is that they are entirely dependent on the war criminals running the CIA.”</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to PG/Elite Pedophilia Investigations</strong></p>
<p>According to a number of sources, the CIA appears to have its tentacles extended into the horrifying world of child trafficking and pedophilia blackmail operations. Nick Bryant and Henry Vinson documented in their book “DC Madam,” the story of Craig Spence, who was allegedly running a sexual blackmail operation involved underage children out of a mansion in the upscale DC suburb of Kalorama. Craig Spence apparently told people he worked for the CIA. Also John DeCamp in his “Franklin Cover-Up” book, discusses CIA involvement in sexual blackmail operations targeting DC politicians. Furthermore, for people who don’t know about “The Finders” Case, the Finders were a bizarre satanic-type cult that was publicly exposed (briefly) in the ‘80s, that had operations in DC, including a warehouse that appeared to operate as a child trafficking hub where photos were found of naked children being ritualistically abused. Worth pointing out that the supposed leader of the “Finders” was a man named Marion Pettie. An article in US News Report stated that Marion Pettie’s wife worked for the CIA, and his son worked for Air America, a well-known CIA front company that was heavily involved in smuggling huge amounts of heroin during the Vietnam War as part of CIA-sanctioned drug trafficking operations.</p>
<p>Considering all these connections, Doug Valentine’s information about the CIA’s network of “deep cover agents” in businesses across the US, raises some big questions in regard to PG-and Franklin Scandal-related research. <strong>As crazy as it may be to think, is it possible that Larry King himself has been tucked away into this very network</strong>? Clearly, King was given a cushy job in his older “retirement” years at a car dealership run by a man with a curious history that extends right back to Omaha. Honestly, this seems to fit right in with the network of “front” jobs described by Agent “Larry.” <strong>Could Thomas Moorehead be somehow beholden to the Agency for his enormous success, or an intelligence operative of sorts himself?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes specifically to PG-centered research, to be clear, Valentine never indicated that the Four Ways Restaurant where he met the agent was involved in anything related to child abuse. However, Valentine’s information, at a minimum, gives evidence that the CIA does in fact operate restaurants in DC as fronts, and bugs the rooms. Also, definitely have to point out that the Four Ways restaurant, when it was open in the ‘80s, was located in the Fraser Mansion, which is at 1701 20th St NW, at DuPont Circle in DC. Guess what’s going on there now? <strong>The Church of Scientology owns the Fraser Mansion, and uses it as their “National Affairs” office</strong>. Can’t help thinking of Greta Van Susteran, a well-known Scientologist, who as an attorney reportedly played a major role in covering up Craig Spence’s child trafficking operations in DC in the early 90s (please see my previous posts about Van Susteran here and here).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I’d encourage folks to look more into Doug Valentine’s research into the CIA. I have never heard of him researching into PG-related topics, but I think the knowledge he provides about the reality of how the CIA operates, can be very valuable in this community. The very idea that this “deep cover agent” network Valentine exposes, could possibly function as a way of hiding “in plain sight” one of the worst child abusers imaginable, is obviously horrifying. However, knowledge is always power, and the more we can do to expose the specific machinations through which this evil network operates, clearly the better.  Good luck with the digging everyone, take care and stay safe!</p>',
