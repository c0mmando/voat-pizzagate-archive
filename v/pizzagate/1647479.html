            latamericanvagabond is a shill site. Running ads to make money, peddling crap snake oil, and covered with satanist symbols all over the page. FAIL. Maybe has some good info, I don't know because as soon as I saw the ads, begging for "donations", and satanist symbols all over the site, I was done.

             Clearly you have an agenda, and lying only makes it more obvious, as all it takes is for an individual to actually LOOK at the page:
             <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/">
              http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/
             </a>
             , to clearly see that you are making this up. I do not agree with everything they say, but out of all the alt media sites, they have by far the least amount of ads, actually only 2 on the homepage if I count correctly, and a grand total of ZERO "satanist" symbols, outside of articles discussing such topics, which are few and far between. Really a lazy effort brother. And begging for donations? are you referring to Patreon? Well that is how they operate moron, they are openly "people-funded." Feel free to continue trusting media organizations who get their funding from hyper-politicized groups and clear agenda-driven motivations, that will sure keep you "informed." You are the mindless cattle that keep this ship moving toward totalitarianism, you should be proud of your stupidity, as you clearly support that direction. And you will likely laugh off any discussion of a creeping loss of rights, and smugly dismiss it, because its not like it ever happened in history... oh wait.. Your game is weak.

            I agree with this synopsis 100%. The Alefantis Instagrams and the entertainment he employs at his pizza place point towards a culture of pedophilia and violence towards children and big names known to frequent Comet Ping Pong have shown that they weren't involved with the pizza joint by accident with their own embrace of the culture of sexual violence towards children and other forms of evil that are demonstrated by the art work they hang on their walls and other works by the artists that they favor..
