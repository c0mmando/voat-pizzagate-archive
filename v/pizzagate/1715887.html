<p>Going through the emails it seems on the 2nd of March 2016 both of the brothers were in New York.

<p>On the 3rd of March 2016 Tony sends John an email suggesting a dinner reservation of 815 at Marta\'s. He gives the location and says its just around the corner which means both brothers are in the neighbourhood. </p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55930">No need for pizza</a></p>
<p>Although looking at <a href="https://hillaryspeeches.com/speech-archive/2016-2/march-2016/">HillarySpeeches.com</a> there were no events on the 3rd March in New York. Despite this John says he has no need for pizza as he\'s too busy preparing for Michigan event.</p>
<p>The email was replied to by John at 6:40pm. Giving him 1 hour 35 minutes before the reservation time. John however, despite being in the area, is far too busy even with more than an hour an half notice. John doesn\'t even ask for Tony to find a later booking. Now this is the life of a busy man. For the next 5 or so hours until he perhaps goes to sleep, he is completely busy.</p>
<p>The oddest part of this exchange is Tony offers to bring a pizza home for John. Why do these fancy foodie, super rich people even entertain the idea of having reheated take away pizza? Manhattan to Washington is no 10 minute journey. John has already stated he\'s leaving for Michigan the next day. In fact there is events going on in Michigan until the 6th of March. Does that mean John isn\'t getting back home to Washington until the 7th? </p>
<p>4 day old take away pizza all the way from New York to Washington. This is what these foodies eat? These emails all sound like innocent talk about restaurants and yet the plans and the phrases and the times and everything are just bizarre.</p>',

            used in this context perhaps 815 is not 8:15 PM

           <p>
            by first moving the time to the end "Subject: Re: dinner at Marta 815" then rereading the title. It seems that grammatically the type of dinner is an 815

             Does he? I looked up Podesta homes and could only find Washington addresses.
            </p>
            <p>
             So Tony has a New York apartment. He emails John about meeting up for dinner at Marta's. John says he's too busy for pizza because of Michigan. Tony says okay see you at home. Meaning Tony will cancel the Marta reservation and see John back at the apartment.
            </p>
            <p>
             So Tony Podesta refers to his New York apartment as home. Is there any proof of this apartment?
