            I posted about the twitter Trump made about investigation Pelosi and it was deleted. 
The claim was that the part I wrote in the second part of the discussion about Brock's campaign against Trump was not connected to "Pizzagate?"
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I did explain how it was related:
in the body of the message.

           </p>
           <p>
            Today was a good day for Pizzagate since Trump fought back against the people who are afraid of getting caught in their crimes and who are trying to take him down.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Schumer and Pelosi were both today. The one about Pelosi state that right after they are finished investigation Schumer they will move on to Pelosi.
           </p>
           <p>
            I spent a lot of time writing and connecting the events of today to Pizzagate investigation. And I am reporting this deletion to where ever I can since I feel it is an injustice.
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed the other post about Pelosi also seems to be missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            How could information about David Brock and his campaign against Trump, not be connected to "Pizzagate? "
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the mod who deleted this should explain that.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Trump now says when done with Shumer demands Pelosi be investigated.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://imgur.com/KtV1HTQ">
              http://imgur.com/KtV1HTQ
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             How does this have to do with Pizzagate?
            </p>
            <p>
             Both Pelosi and Shumer are implicated in open source investigation of pedophilia networks.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Trump is now fighting back against the Controlled Mass Media perpetrators and spin doctors who are attempting to set the stage for a Coup against him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The giant Cabal of networked criminals want to bring Trump down [at the very least]. Many are calling for his assassination; And are pretty unreasonable about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             They amount of vitriol seems out of proportion.
            </p>
            <p>
             So we here at VOAT have speculated that their fierce hatred and virulent attack against a President who has done nothing worse [and some things better ; i.e. pedo arrests , Amber Alerts back on, Cancelled TTP] than those they've loved and promoted for 50 years or more ,, We have speculated that such hatred is motivated from self - interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think one can appraise the good President Trump ha's done (and might continue to do in the future) by the level of Massive and malevolent Hatred directed against him by the usual suspects [i.e. "The Establishment"].
            </p>
            <p>
             In other words, The criminal cabal, extant, fear Trump will bring down their Gigantic "Octopus" network and arrest them; or at least some of them; Their party and their plans would then be over; the future - whatever that may be to them, [but it's certainly not good for us] would then be different from what they've obviously planned for so many years on end.. Boo Hoo.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, that's the motive for the blatant hate campaign &amp; blanket of Propaganda against Trump, both here in the U.S. and in the Nation - States abroad, which are also controlled by the identical #NWO "One World" bullshit-artists, frauds , criminals, future- fantasy delusional psychos.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Motive for the desperation against Trump Admin. is obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
             The planned attacks are also detailed in Mr. David Brock's playbook sporting a Blue Cover: "Democracy Matters : Strategic Plan for Action"
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.is/l6MSP">
              https://archive.is/l6MSP
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is a recent VOAT thread on the "Plan Blue" directly connected to Mr. D. Brock and his minions.
            </p>
            <p>
             David Brock' "ShareBlue" a Clusterfuck of Interconnected Special Interests
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1682342">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1682342
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             David Brock is a leading archtect of the [seditious] design against President Trump; And Mr. Brock is connected to "Pizzagate" investigation both because he was chief of the armies of trolls and paid disinfo operators who messed with the mostly Trump-favorable researchers last Summer, who were investigating the criminality exposed by the leaked Clinton emails..
            </p>
            <p>
             And because of his likely continued close association with the owner of the notorious Pizza Dive for children in D.C.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Tweets against Trump seem to focus on his spelling and his weight.. Is that all they got? Too much late night Stupid TV turn their brains to mush?

             The mod did not make it clear to me why my post about Trump's tweet saying he was demanding an investigation of Pelosi was not "sourced" properly and/or was not related to Pizzagate? Never got a good answer on that. Still waiting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway this is my clarification as to how those things are related, since in my first attempt I was obviously unclear to some. And I provide citations relating to the mods request that I elaborate on the suspicions / implications around both Schmer and Polosi as "Persons of Interest" in the Pedo / Pizzagate investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did source it . It was a twitter post and I provided a screen shot. How can you say I did not source it?
            </p>
            <p>
             Did you read it? Tell me why you think it doesn't relate to Pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             I explain here how the "Clinton / Podesta" emails were leaked in particular to defeat Clinton. My source is Dr. Steven P.
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1498628">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498628
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Therefore everyone in the Pizzagate open source investigation has been waiting for Trump to fight back against the petty attacks / lies against him and his Cabinet so he can get to work "draining the swamp"
            </p>
            <p>
             If they take Trump down , he will not be able to get arrest warrants, trials and perpetrators put away, child trafficking stopped and all the things we are tying to do.

I can't be required to do excessive spoon feeding in every post. I assume people are somewhat familiar with what has been going on. Why should I re-capitulate? There is a search function.

              Was that detail the total problem? .. Should I get an archive of it? 
OOPs Archive seems down. That's why I took a screen shot. It's a form of archive.

              It wasn't clear. You still haven't explained why the Trump Tweet saying he's going after Pelosi has nothing to do with Pizzagate; at least to the point where I can understand it. This one about Trump's tweet regarding Schumer omits any explanation, is just a link, but is taken on face as being related to Pizzagate.

            So I just had a submission deleted for rule #1. It was a link to worldcorpo and two new music files being uploaded a few days ago. How is that not related to pizzagate but this is? I get Schumer is supposed to be involved but wasn't worldcorpo supposed to be involved as well? Just scratching my head at it. Anyone care to enlighten me?

             I expect it will be deleted eventually too. Maybe we should start mentioning David Seaman, and then they won't delete the post. Like this: "I wonder if that's why Seaman is "missing." It's because he is busy helping Trump investigate Schumer.

             Post it again and add - This is directly related to Pizzagate because.... the community has been actively researching Worldcorp and their videos which may be leaks by alphabets to investigators.

             Strange these days that some meta posts get through the net and others are deleted.  I think it depends which mod is on watch. It's easy to get a post to stick when you know how - just don't forget to say how it's PG related - if it's a link.

              I'm not going to bother. People will go look now because they'll see my post and will do a better job than I am willing to do. Quite frankly I have pizzagate fatigue. It seems like it's turned into a circle jerk here for the most part. I'm losing faith.

            Who is this William LeGate character trolling Trump. He's fucking 22 years old. Kid hasn't learned to think for himself beyond what nonsense he learned during his "education." I may have been a smart ass as a 20 something but never so self important and brainwashed as to think that talking to someone three times my age and experience was justified. Even if I disagreed with the individual. I'm only thirty-five but the kids ten years younger than I am are socially inept and brainwashed to such an extent I don't know if logical thinking and reasonable debate will even be a thing in the next ten years.

            So I just read that Arnold Schwarzenegger quit Celebrity Apprentice as a protest of Trump. There MUST be a connection with him to pizzagate. You know damn well there is going to be one found. Well, get on it autists. I'm unfortunately at work and lack the skills.

            Extend this investigation to include Anthony Weiner and the other members of the Knights of Pythias linked with the corruption in Racine, Wisconsin. We need Trump to follow through on his promises to Drain the Swamp of criminal corruption.

             can you please stop mentioning Racine, WI in literally every post you make. we heard you the first 20 times, but you have yet to provide ANY evidence whatsoever for the claim. making one post and asking for help in investigating is fine, but what you are doing looks mighty like either a distraction tactic, disinformation, or (possibly) extreme laziness on your part. If you provide any evidence for your claims (that actually connects Racine, WI to anything pizzagate/pedogate related), I'll retract what I said.

              Not going to stop until the feds do their job, convene a grand jury, produce indictments and make the connections to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. There is plenty of evidence, and way too much to post here. There is not one photo or link that can summarize this. It is extremely deep and complex. If you truly want to help and are not a paid shill, start by reading all of the comments and you will start to figure it out. It is a very complicated network that needs to be fully investigated. It is very real, and is very connected to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. This is not a dead end like so many others on here are pushing. This is a sure thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              You do realize that Racine is Paul Ryan's district and next to where both Reince Priebus and Scott Walker are from.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is a different route than others are taking, but leads to the same end result. In fact, it is a better strategy than most others on here. More information is being organized for the people who are too lazy to investigate it themselves.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even in this post alone - you can't figure out the connections between Chuck Schumer, Anthony Weiner, Knights of Pythias and Racine? Do you know what Agenda 2030 is?
             </p>
             <p>
              if you need the simple version, start with the RICO case about downtown Racine, the Talking Racine videos, and look up Racine Exposed and News the JT Can't Use. Google Racine Corruption. Look at the Dennis Troha case. Look at the pedo cases. Then look into the Zika Virus, the vaccine programs, the mafia ties, the trafficking, the infant mortality rates, the dialysis development deals, the extortion and embezzlement claims and more. When time allows, a full post will be submitted.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the perfect test for Trump and Sessions to see if they will really drain the swamp, and it is a weak link that will start a domino effect on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             Wow, the democratic party might really fall apart. What an obvious strategy. They keep accusing Trump of basically what they are doing. Now he just held up the mirror. If they get the Republicans on board, they might be able to calm the CIA down some.

             This, combined with plenty of child trafficking leo activity, tweets form folks like James Woods and Katrina Pierson, Mike Flynn's comments, etc, seems like things are progressing. He has to do controlled demolition on this so we don't end up in civil war and so the public and media cannot interpret or promulgate a false narrative.

            Honestly, every single tweet by Trump you get the exact same 6 or 7 verified accounts (Never heard of them before) leaving nothing but hatefull comments. Every single time. It really really grinds my gears, within seconds these guys can get up to a thousand likes. Are they paid trolls? No one could be that persistent surely. It's been going on for months

             Today i tweeted to this guy

             </a>
             and he answered my tweet, but it didn't show in my notifications. After sending him a couple of tweets more, "someone" tried to log in my google account from the USA, and im from Europe. LOL.

              Both sides are the same. Trump is part of it. The entire dichotomy is an illusion. They are preparing to precipitate WWIII with the goal of purging the Levant (except Israel) using our military, and ending any attempt by Russia to intervene with genocide (they are already at 2 million). Listen to Trump talk about 9/11. He is independent on the things that he is permitted to be independent in. More than half of his appointees are Ashkenazim Jews. Most of those are bankers.

                Always said trump was a good actor. He really acts like he cares but he's just a pawn. They are going to credit him with "cleaning up the world" but make no mistake, he is just playing his role. The deep state is throwing us a bone with trump. Was even predicted in the Illuminati card game in '95. "Enough is Enough" is his headline.

             Why would you want this deleted? It is obvious through reason that if Schumer is looked into, lots of pizzagate ties will arise. I don't even have to link to that as Schumer's connection has been so well documented here, it should be common knowledge.

              Eh, no good reason. I was just mad the mods deleted my former post which questioned if they got the name "Fetus" from the phrase "feed us." So just look over me, I took a nap and feel a lot different now.

              Schumer is highly relevant to the pizzagate investigation. A call by Trump to investigate him on Russian ties is a wink and a nod to us.
