<p>This is connected to Pizzagatecbecause the same people who abuse and torture kid napped children, do the same to their own as part of their satanic believe system .
And now they found another creative way to cover their tracks by diagnosing these kids with FSM.
David Shurter points out that every founding member (except 1) were all accused of sexual abuse by their own children.

&quot;The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1992[1] by Pamela and Peter Freyd, after their adult daughter Professor Jennifer Freyd accused Peter Freyd of sexual abuse when she was a child.[2] The FMSF describes its purpose as the examination of the concept of false memory syndrome and recovered memory therapy and advocacy on behalf of individuals believed to be falsely accused of child sexual abuse[3] with a focus on preventing future incidents, helping individuals and reconciling families affected by FMS, publicizing information about FMS, sponsoring research on it and attempting to discover methods to distinguish a true or false allegation of abuse.&quot;</p>

&quot;It was in this climate that Dylan Farrow’s story first got its hearing. It was in this climate that the expert panel headed by Dr John M Leventhal found Dylan’s story to be contradictory and ultimately false. As reported by the New York Times, Leventhal revealed that the team:</p>
<p>had two hypotheses: one, that these were statements made by an emotionally disturbed child and then became fixed in her mind. And the other hypothesis was that she was coached or influenced by her mother. We did not come to a firm conclusion. We think that it was probably a combination.&quot;</p>

            Pathetic. Governments around the world are subverted by pedos. Well, the Matrix continues to collapse for those who see what this world really is. And that is why they make movies about all this stuff. So you think it is just something from the movies and can't be possible in real life. Nobody said taking the red pill would be pleasant.

            Socially accepted is not the same as Social dogma. AKA Socialist dogma which is propagated by courts with the power to punish citizens into compliance.
The compliance begins from mob vigilantes that are backed up by Judicial over reach.
Homosexuality is a mental disorder on a human evolution scale. It's even worse for a struggling society and is historically how Nations collapse.

           <p>
            I remember reading a news article in the 90's that had a superior attitude about sexual abuse survivors recovering memories, chalking them up to "false memory syndrome."
           </p>
           <p>
            The claim I best remember from the article is that children who survived the concentration camps during the Holocaust never forgot the trauma they went through, so it just didn't make sense for sexual abuse victims to forget their abuse, either.
           </p>
           <p>
            But that claim was ridiculous, given all the differences between the two situations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Children in concentration camp were constantly confronted with what they were going through. It was openly happening and they couldn't escape it. Child abusers make the abuse secret, a hidden part of the child's life. The abuser and the child live double lives, one "normal," and one abusive.
           </p>
           <p>
            The abused child also doesn't have the same support of others going through the same thing. In many cases, the child is simply abused alone. But if not, then the abused children usually aren't old enough to think to seek support from each other until years later.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet I know from my own experience of having had some regular sexual abuse as a child that I didn't remember until I was an adult, the abuse was important enough to stay with you, as it was stressful, but was simply neglected out of your mind by you not thinking about it. To begin to think about abuse, though, brings that part of your life right back.

             yesterday, should've posted to pizzagatewhatever but I'm on mobile. I printed that out because it's donations to Hillary for America, 2016. Certain folks, like a guy last name Wright, donated over $3k It stood out because most didn't donate over a couple hundred.
            </p>
            <p>
             In any case it'll be good for cross reference, because I noted many many psychiatric treatment places, one was 'spiritual psychology" which caught my interest last night before sleep grabbed me. Community centers, tons of attorneys and businesses I'd never seen before (like one pizza joint named 2 guys pizza and ribs). It's such a large list, I'm still going through the A's sect. I found it randomly whilst family researching on Google, which surprised me. Perhaps Kek works in mysterious ways like that.

            FMSF is run by pedos. I hate them. The leader of the Satanic Temple is a fan of these guys. They lie and say Dissociative  Identity  Disorder is fake, that its controversial, that ritual abuse is a hoax, and that there is no such thing as repressed memories. I actually had a crazy FMSF discovery  last night. I will try to post about it later.  the overwhelming majority of therapists do not buy their bullshit. If you find one who does, be very suspicious.

             Oh please post your FMSF discovery.  I would love to read about it.  They are fighting so hard to counteract the confessions of past  experiences of those that were so wrongly abused in so many ways.

            Yes, and there are foundations like that all over the world. I stumbled across
            <a href="https://www.false-memory.de/">
             the german version of false memory foundation
            </a>
            in my own researches. 
At the bottom it says: "False Memory Deutschland unterstützt alle Maßnahmen gegen sexuellen Missbrauch und schützt in keinem Falle Straftäter!" in red color.
           </p>
           <p>
            This means: "Fals Memory Germany supports any legal actions against sexual abuse and in no way saves the predators."
           </p>
           <p>
            But this is, in fact, what they do. They have been very succesfully pushing their agenda in our country. They attack the credibility of the victims and they educate psychologists to not believe in the victims storys. The thing is: 
They have a true substance to their idea, because in the psychologic field it's known that we can't trust our memorys. But these people take it much too far and clearly are having an agenda, because they confirm
            <em>
             every single victim
            </em>
            unreliable and try to claim that no victim can be trust. Very dangerous work!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            In Germany they manipulate the research of multiple personalitys … it's bad!!! I am working with some psychologists against their works. Please raise the awarness in every country!

              I believe the Germans taught the Victorious Yankees all about this in the late forties. The OSS/CIA also used Stazi deflectors, of which was epidemic at first. And continued after the Wall was built.
They are the same coin with one being the winner.

              I don't know, but it was founded out of another foundation in 2012. Prior to that they were called "Verein Schulterschluss bei Sektenbetroffenheit e. V." which means something like "solidarity with cult consternation". A strange name and they had a very spongy claim of their work. Seems to me like maybe they connected internationally in 2012?!

            There are the same folks that forced any psychiatrist who supported the theories of multiple personality syndrom into obscurity.  Following the satanic panic of the 80s, there was a number of Dr.s who started finding patients who seems to have multiple levels of personilities and even preprogrammed personailities.  There was a post about it here awhile ago which featured the Dr. Who discussed it in public either in transcript or audio.  There is even a website which lists all the folks they went after still up.

             Yeah it is not a coincidence is it?  Jews are being used as the first line of the control network.  All the seriously illegal or hot topics will be run by Jews.  They only trust the Goyim to run things on the outer edges.

            Damn. Great post. I'd never heard of this organization. This organization is one we really need to explore. They are a large part of the victim blaming problem. He abused his daughter, she spoke up, so he started a false memory organization. So fucked. These are ppl discrediting victims. Start digging!!!!!!!!!!

             This was posted few weeks ago and I think I read that this "mental health issue" was used thereon by many therapists to diagnose child satanic abuse claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Imagine being told by a medical professional who you have built up the courage to confide in tell you it's all in your head. Truly heartbreaking.
            </p>
            <p>
             I find it somewhat hard to believe therapists hearing the same story over and over didn't question this. However we will never know if they suicided themselves for asking questions?

              Believe it or not, most "Mental Health" professionals got into the field because of personal demons.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about that for a minuet.

              This is why in the seventies most legitimate psychologist classified homosexuals as vulnerable and very easy to exploit. AKA, mentally deficient. Which is why suicides among gays is epidemic.
