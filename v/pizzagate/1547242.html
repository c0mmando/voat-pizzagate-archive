<p>I\'m not surprised many adult survivors of ritual abuse do not come forward.  The trauma would be deep and their psyche completely fragmented.</p>
<p>This is her blog: <a href="http://www.beyondthephysicalrealm.com/">http://www.beyondthephysicalrealm.com/</a> and these are some excerpts:</p>
<p><em>I think I feel guilty that I never told anyone about the children....but now...in my adult mind I know that I was incapable of telling anyone about the children...especially if I couldn\'t even remember the details of what was being done to me past the night itself</em>
<em>The man looked at me and smiled, then motioned for me to come over to him and sit on his lap. I didn\'t know this man and didn\'t want to go to him. I looked to my instructor for her direction. Yes, she wanted me to go to the man. I felt obliged to obey. I got up out of my chair and walked the few steps to the man and reluctantly climbed onto his lap. I was everything but relaxed. The man wanted me to be affectionate with him...to &quot;give him some sugar&quot;. I didn\'t like him and I didn\'t like him touching me</em></p>
<p><em>I could tell that both the man and my instructor were becoming very displeased with me. Apparently they considered my coldness toward the man as inappropriate behavior. Their displeasure of me felt like rejection, like I was bad, that there was something wrong with me for not wanting to be close to that man, yet something about it didn\'t feel right at all.
My instructor called another little girl over. She appeared to be about my age, maybe slightly older. She was wearing a little blue dress. Her golden blonde hair was braided into two &quot;pig tails&quot; that hung one on each side of her head, touching her chest just below her shoulders. Her full skirt, fluffed up by petticoats swayed as she walked, giving her the appearance of little girl innocence with feminine allure. She was there to demonstrate how it\'s done, how I was supposed to behave</em></p>
<p><em>She gladly hopped up onto the man\'s lap eager to show me how much more advanced she was than I. She became the aggressor while the man sat back to enjoy. First it was kissing on the lips. Then more passionate kissing. I had never seen anything like that even with adults. All the while I watched, my instructor kept telling me that what I was watching was good and normal behavior between grown men and little girls like myself. It still didn\'t seem right to me</em></p>
<p><em>One more child was brought in to show me &quot;how normal&quot; it was for children to do sexual things with grown men. This child was a dark haired little boy wearing a white oxford shirt, partially tucked into his navy blue pants. He looked much like the boys I knew who went to Catholic schools. He was scared</em></p>
<p><em>Reluctantly he boarded the man\'s lap, as the little girl slid off to receive her praises for a job well done</em></p>
<p><em>I have come to realize that there are many more people like myself, who are suffering from the affects of Satanic ritual abuse and trauma based mind control...and there are far too few people with the necessary qualifications to help</em></p>
<p><em>I am a former &quot;Illuminist&quot; born and raised in the Luciferian organization responsible for implementing the plan for the NWO which is also Satan’s plan to instal his chosen one in global rule under the pretense of ushering in an era of global peace and spiritual harmony</em></p>
<p>Another survivor: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcxdQ0RJ4O0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcxdQ0RJ4O0</a> talks about Japan and man-made tsunamis.

<p>Here is Vicki Polen, another survivor:</p>
<p>&quot;Polin told Oprah that she witnessed babies sacrificed and consumed for the &quot;power&quot; this gave. These babies are bred within the extended family for this purpose.  She said she was raped several times, and elsewhere says she had five abortions due to intercourse with her father&quot;

            I believe them. I had blocked abuse memories, not exactly ritual abuse, but when the memories came back, I had to learn about how the brain protects itself.

            I have read and watched some testimonies by victims. It really made me sick. If you only watch one you could dismiss it as crazy talk. But once you watched and read a bunch of them you will see similarities. Truly sickening shit.
