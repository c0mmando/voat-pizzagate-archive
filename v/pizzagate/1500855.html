<p>On the one hand, FBIanon seemed to trust Comey.

He also said that most of the FBI supports Trump and is trustworthy.</p>
<p>Here\'s the wrinkle: George Webb - who is 100 steps ahead of any other citizen journalist in investigating Clinton Foundation corruption in terms of bribes, oil, and arms sales - clearly thinks that Comey is compromised. He explains how Comey has a decades-long career of letting Clinton and associates off the hook, just barely, over and over again. This goes back to the 80s. Comey also banks at HSBC, which is the central banking contact for most major Clinton Foundation people. And Comey has made millions from major CF donors like Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>This is what is interesting to me: I think George Webb is probably right. If Comey is compromised, that perfectly explains why he let Clinton off the hook, publicly, twice - first for the email server and second for Weiner\'s laptop. I think everyone in this forum is pretty convinced that there was damning material on both of those devices, and yet Comey basically defied the rest of the FBI by letting Hillary off the hook.</p>
<p>And yet FBIanon didn\'t seem to realize this. Or at least, he didn\'t say it publicly. Perhaps he was willing to say some things in public, but he didn\'t want to go so far as to actually point out Comey, FBI Director, as a suspect. How the fuck does the FBI investigate its own Director? (FBIanon <em>did</em> say that the entire government is corrupt, but he also said that Comey and himself were not invited to the Hillary FBI interrogation.)</p>
<p>FBIanon also said that Comey will probably resign soon, and that still hasn\'t happened. Perhaps FBIanon was wrong about Comey, and Comey will not resign, because he wants to be in a position to let himself and the CF off the hook, maybe compromise the investigation or destroy evidence. It\'s not clear how FBIanon could miss this point, though, because Comey\'s decades-long history with Clintons, CF donors, HSBC, and Lockheed Martin are public record. And, after Comey first announced letting Hillary off the hook (the first time, if not earlier), the rest of the FBI should have immediately starting asking why Comey did that?</p>
<p>If Comey is compromised, it will be interesting to see what happens. Trump has appointed a new Attorney General, but the FBI has a longer term, by statute, and so Trump cannot (easily?) replace Comey, at least it would be bad press optically.</p>

            The law that she is charged with doesn't require intent to prosecute. It doesn't matter if you intend to mishandle classified info, just that you mishandle it. Also that's clearly bullshit since she deleted emails. How can he say she had no intent when she covered it up. Also simply having a email server shows intent. How is it possible to have your own email server and not have intent, that's just not possible, having the email server proves intent.

            Comey knows what's going on. His hands are tied. He cannot prosecute he isn't justice department. He can provide evidence and suggest prosecution. I think he tried and wanted to prosecute. The tells are in the interview. He couldn't. He got pressured. Now whether her is part of the problem or more part of the solution I am not sure, but my gut tells me he wanted to prosecute. When you watch the interviews it's like he cannot stand that he has to say this.

            His hands are tied. Too many people are involved. After seeing how blown wide open this shit is and the media basically being used as an Elitist Narrative Beacon, I have no doubt in my mind that there is nothing he could do anyway. His only hand is that maybe by chance he could inform the public and give the country a heads up that the world was about to end and why.

             Agreed that Comey's hands are tied, especially when Obama is in charge, since he can just pardon the culprits and this will all be buried and forgotten. That is why he sneakily announced the CF &amp; server probe a few days before the election. By doing so he eroded more of HRC's trustworthiness and helped elect DJT. With DJT, an outsider, in charge, their secret club is vulnerable and can therefore be taken care of, without the risk of someone avoiding prosecution. (IMHO)

            I suppose Comey got an offer he couldn't refuse years ago. Now perhaps the offer is off the table, and he can do a deal, with the new guys. His job would be to decide not to pursue investigations, that might cause a drop in profits. He could pursue any opposition. Who's business would then fall to the remaining operators . Just like the war against drugs it keeps the prices high.

            Comey has no resume of investigation experience. He's a hedge fund guy - political appointee, so his role in this is political, not investigative or justice oriented.
It therefore remains a question of who his loyalties lie closer with, and will have no bearing on the merits of the evidence
  (of which I'm sure the FBI already has 10x whatever this community can show the public)

            It stands to reason that if Comey was "in bed" with Hillary - that he wouldn't have reopened it the second time. At the time part of me thought that Comey was covering his ass somehow.

            George Webb needs to be watched with his where is Eric Braverman series? This guy is in the know regarding the other side of this international crime syndicate. The arms for money for oil trafficking. This part exsposes the "red line to Rat line" plans to topple the Quadaffi regime for Hilary and her cronies to steal billions if not more from Quadiffi and run a mass global arms supply system using Libya as the alleged stage operations that not only received weapons including stinger ground to air missles and other they assisted with Turkey to get weapons and operatives in Syria to topple that goverment!  Think of the major players here that the formed KKR such as General Patreus, Henry Kissinger and his lackeys, the CFR I guess the death of over 300,000 Syrian people and alleged gas attack which has now been challenged by Russia at the UN as the CIA are implicated in engaging in the False Flag to escalate tension and support for war against Russia and the Russians provided evidence and I believe evidence that it was not the Russians or the Assad Regime but rebels supplied the sarin gas attacks who were working for the US government CIA.  If you can get out of search engines like google or programs like facebook who are nothing more than US intelligence with fun features. Trust me everything you say on Facebook, your phone conversations are listened to, spying by the NSA as shown through wilikeaks.

             George Webb is must watch. It's fun to slowly watch him build the entire picture of Soros and nation toppling that FBIanon predicted seven months, without even getting into the child trafficking.

            When Comey decided to reopen the investigation just days before the election, I think something definitely got to him. Threats in his life or his family's life I imagine. They didn't have time to literally go through all those Clinton emails before he came back &amp; said - nope, nothing to see here.  I think he wants nothing more than to stick it to Clinton, but he's gonna need a whole lot of backing from others higher up. Not to mention protection.

             If you watch George Webb videos, you will realized that Comey has a decades long history of letting off the Clintons and their associates. I think he doesn't want to arrest/convict them at all.
