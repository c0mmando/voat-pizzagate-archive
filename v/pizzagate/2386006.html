            Am concerned similarly for the owner of YOU ARE FREE TV channel on YouTube!!  Her last video was Feb. 2nd and &gt;nothing&lt; since!  Very unlike her as far as I can determine. She was an almost-every-day videographer on the whole mess going on in the U.S., and was in constant communication with her viewers.  Mentioned she was also posting on Steem-it regularly.  But have NOT seen anything from her in SIX days (since Feb. 2nd) on YouTube...
           </p>
           <p>
            Video (link follows) on Jan. 28th was titled: "#NOONEISSAFE: 1/28 Q Warns FREE PRESS of Present Cabal Threat."

            I hope to God she has not become a Deep State statistic --- but don't know how to find out more... or who can contact her to verify she's OK!

             Yes I felt the same, espeically as this is heating up now, you would think she would be on top of it.  I think she mentioned going for a hike for a few days, but not 100% sure on that.  Why would you take a break when the lot is coming out.  Shes been trying to expose for over 20 years she said in one video.  Hope to hear her again soon!

             <p>
              Believe she'd mentioned "going for a hike" but don't recall there was a timeframe attached to that... She has been so diligent in getting her videos out whenever there was new Q drops... and even in between depending on what else was surfacing... Her reliable nature is why I am worried -- this is very unlike her as far as I can recall.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am really concerned about her... but don't know what else I can do to find out more.

             HOW CAN WE CHECK HE IS OKAY??
            </em>
            I have followed and comment many times on his channel. I sent him a few pm to ask why he is not posting ... no answer ....  I did not know what to do.   NB:  He was being targeted by Maria Marshall a British 'Artist' AND the BBC did a JamesAlefantis/Ricky Dearman style programme about him discrediting her and saying she was using her sons as disgusting 'art'.  -  I actually reported her 'artwork' to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children AND the police here in the UK for the Art where her son, about 4 years old, is smoking a cigarette and her 'pos art' where the pedophile in the video is paying for 'using' her 13/14 year old son, then is shot in the head -  I swear that if you slow down the video enough you see the actual bullet.  I reported it saying I think it is an actual snuff film.  OF COURSE I got NO REPLY! -  PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO IN BRACKETS WHERE HE EXPLAINS HOW HOW THEY ARE ACCUSING HIM:

            - ART? Maria Marshall uses her 2 young sons as her 'artwork' ) (Shockingly I did get a reply from both when I reported the WorldCorps video though!)  -  I really hope he is okay!!!!!  His latest videos were on Corey Feldman and his fakery.

            This is what I've spent over an hour plastering on stolen hashes at Twitter to every santaclara news agency o could find. I'd say some body has to have seen the video...and  Missing means missing to me regardless,  so my understanding is I MISS HIM. And I do he's a good guy. Twitter storm anyway on his behalf or on behalf of children all good. I found yweets on santa Clara sheriff to be particularly brutal in other people's complaining about them. Hmm. I hope this guy pops up.

            Twitter campain the people of santa Clara. 
Sherriff Da Everyday people maybe we'll find him. Total loss of public trust there, ol Sherrif. Gang stalkers or citizen protectors? Which citizens? Very concerned, I love this guy, he has such a brotherly sound.

             I was wondering about him too.......hopefully he is just taking a break, but one would think he would've said so.  Who knows, but praying he's ok. You just never know these days.

              Worrying doesn't help. It's possible something bad happened but there are a lot of other reasons why he might be gone. It could be poor health (mental or physical), maybe a new job or baby, away for work or vacation, illness or death in the family, could of given up on it not producing results he wanted, found a new girlfriend or fun game, ended up in jail....or a ton of other possibilities I haven't thought of.

             Yup.  This an incredibly dark topic we have all spent so much time researching. While we are likely all turning red in face waiting for REAL justice it is also important to remain balanced.  This quote explains my thoughts on this perfectly....

             This. One of the more popular channels for this subject, A Call For An Uprising, took a 2-3 month break because all the research into MKUltra, The Finders, Satanic Ritual Abuse, Masonry, etc. left him in a completely burned-out state. Same thing could have happened to this guy. At least that's what I hope is going on.

               I literally listen to his stuff on a daily basis during my lunch break at work. Alex Jones' Bohemian Grove doc, early Mark Dice, and
               <em>
                A Call for an Uprising
               </em>
               are the three sources that helped me to wake up more than anything else. Of those three, I still only trust
               <em>
                A Call for an Uprising
               </em>
               , as the other two have completely sold out.

               the first one i posted has a pretty bad echo. he has been removed from youtube before so its easier to hear him on podcasts. but unlike call for an uprising, he doesn't focus on pizzagate and he doesn't make videos, just audio "rants" or sermons.

              Indeed. And there is also a big difference between someone being 'missing' and someone just not posting content or being on social media.

               Don't get me wrong, in this particular community, sudden radio silence CAN be an indicator that something has happened, but PG folks tend to immediately start calling cries of "MURDERED" as soon as someone doesn't post for a few months. It may be news to some, but the majority of these guys don't have monetized videos, and therefore probably have lives and day jobs outside of just cranking out PG videos for YouTube.

                If I had a YouTube Chan and decided to take a break, knowing the community and its concerns for safety etc I’d let them know in advance. Seems like common sense. So unless this guy is a moron, lost his mind, or wants to manipulate his viewers, I’d say it’s cause for concern.

                 That is a very good point, you'd think he'd know his audience a bit more. Maybe there
                 <em>
                  is
                 </em>
                 something going on.

                I get what you're saying, no one is calling murdered, just concerned for his safety, since the high profiled people he has reported on ie: 1) Maria Marshall, has the backing of the BBC and some of her 'artwork' is sponsored by Podesta (and the Washington Post wanted him to contact them -  listen to his video I posted above) plus Bill Clinton was the subject of one of her art pieces. 2) Calling out Corey Feldman and 3) Sheriff’s Deputies Fired After Party Of Lieutenant Incest Rapist - IMO he has made himself a high target calling out these Demons!

                 Yeah the guy definitely was making a habit out of calling out powerful, potentially dangerous people, or at the very least, people who

                 </em>

              If a brilliant man produces an engine that runs solely on water, but passes away before being able to mass produce it, the engine should be lost forever? The internet exists to borrow the knowledge of others. I'm not saying give the man no credit, but to let his work die is worse.

               For fucks sakes, he's not dead. Your argument is invalid because the situation doesn't even exist.

               If YOU devoted your life to making an engine that runs solely on water, but decided to take a nap for a little while, so then I snuck in your garage and stole it... then I should get the money and credit for it? Be realistic.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, we already have a system for the dead man too. If he hadn't patented and published his work then it's a secret and left to his family to benefit from. If that man had a patent then it's part of his estate and it goes to his heirs to handle until X amount of years when it will then be public knowledge for all.

                You think these videos are allowed to gain profits on YouTube? You think I'm interested in financial gains? I don't even want to do this, I'm suggesting someone else do it. And if they make money while spreading valuable info, who cares? Nothing matters more than the quick dissemination of truth. If jewtube pulls his videos and nobody does anything, you'd prefer that? Well, looks like that'll be the way things go. Enjoy your sought-after future.

                 Taking someone else property without their permission and using it on your own channel isn't "borrowing". It doesn't matter what reason you try to come up with to explain your actions. He didn't give you permission now did he. No different than a nigger "borrowing" your bike.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you hate jewtube so much why are you so concerned with getting it on your/someones channel. Move off the platform m8.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Archive it and then spread that instead like a white man instead of "borrowing" it like a nigger on your own channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But keep trying to justify nigger stealing.

                       lmao, hilarious coming from the guy who downvoted every single one of my comments.

                       I haven't downvoted anything from you. Looks like someone else thinks you needed the dv.

                      <p>
                       You really shouldn't resort to childish name calling and personal attacks because you don't have a good answer to continue our debate m8.
