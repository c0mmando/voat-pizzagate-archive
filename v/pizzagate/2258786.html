            It might be Hiz, Inc. doing business as Besta Pizza.  They're both at the same address.

            Also they are the same ones that own the top floors of Mandalay Bay and also connects to Bill Gates.  Check the Search Bar there are quite a few about Besta Pizza.

            It could be because the business is listed under a different name.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, you'd have to know the business license number. If you did a search for that, you'd see the name it was originally licensed under. Is there a search for dba?!!! The business registration has to be visible in any place conducting business.  They give you copies of it to post when you register it.

            Look at Besta Pizza's first yelp review (4.0 star rating 7/15/2006
            <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/besta-pizza-washington?sort_by=date_asc">

            </a>
            ).  It's by this dude "Nelson Abramson".  He lists a blog on his yelp profile (

             http://neltor.blogspot.com/2006/07/i-might-as-well.html)
            </a>
            ).  His first blog post was created on 7/18/2006 (3 days after Besta Pizza's first Yelp review of his) which read:
           </p>
           <pre><code>The reasons why I haven't had a blog before:
I have no attention span
I don't see a huge reason to have a blog
I prefer to hear myself speak, rather than type
Who would read it anyway?

But hey. I'm a member of the information super society. 1337 4ever.

            What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  We all say retarded/creative shit but really?  So many weird details the further you look...maybe it's nothing, but it's an odd statement at an odd time with an odd pizza business that is apparently (now) unlicensed.

              http://misdialing.blogspot.com/
             </a>
             that he dedicates to misdials/emails he's received?  Interesting that he would be getting this awkward calls/emails...I never receive weird things like this and that's a lot for a basic-seeming guy.  Did he not know that his yelp review was seen as a CP flag by some?  Is that what happened?
