It is owned by Scholastic Corporation, the world\'s largest publisher and distributor of children\'s books and print and digital educational materials for pre-K to grade 12. We all know by now what the word &quot;chicken&quot; is a code word for. It was founded by Barry Cunningham, who formerly worked for Penguin Books and Bloomsbury, discovered Harry Potter and worked with Roald Dahl. Don\'t know much about him, but Scholastic once had Allen Dulles (creator of the CIA and former director) on as an advisor, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Family_of_Secrets/vGtWWgLaPTAC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=scholastic%20magazine">according to Family of Secrets by Russ Baker</a>.

Chicken House has published some creepy books targeted at kids and young adults, including:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bunker_Diary">The Bunker Diary</a>: &quot;Teenager Linus Weems wakes up in an underground bunker (having been drugged with chloroform and kidnapped by a stranger). Linus is originally from a wealthy family, but since the death of his mother and subsequent arguments with his father, he had run away from school and been living on the streets. It was there that the stranger was able to kidnap Linus, by posing as a blind man needing assistance. As Linus adjusts to his new surroundings, he finds that the bunker has a kitchen, bathroom and six small bedrooms, but there are also cameras and microphones so that \'the man upstairs\' (as Linus calls the kidnapper) can watch his every move.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_(Christopher_novel)">Stolen</a>: &quot;Whilst at a Bangkok airport, 16-year-old Gemma is kidnapped by 24-year-old Tyler “Ty” MacFarlane from a coffee shop after he drugs her coffee. He smuggles her away on a plane to Australia and takes her to the middle of the desert, expecting her to fall in love with him. Gemma disapproves of Ty, but after an incident she develops a soft corner for him. Ty has a nightmare about his past and shouts and screams until Gemma gets up and consoles him. Still Gemma has not entirely forgiven Ty and tries to escape by taking his vehicle but does not succeed as the truck gets stuck in the desert. Ty rescues her and takes care of her until her burns have healed. Now Gemma has started to think of Ty in a good way and Ty is happy with that. Ty wants her to realize the importance and beauty of nature which was the main reason he built this house in the middle of the desert. For this purpose he paints his entire outhouse and himself with colors that resemble nature. And this does it. That day Ty and Gemma fall asleep outside the house, on the sand itself. Gemma has now started falling for Ty. The next day Ty leaves to collect snakes as their venom is essential for the anti-venom that he is preparing. He leaves a note for Gemma about his whereabouts and Gemma goes in search of Ty behind the house near the water reserve and there a snake bites her. Ty takes Gemma to the mine site/civilization for her treatment after the anti-venom that he had preserved is out of date. Gemma asked Ty to stay with her in the hospital. He is arrested and whilst receiving treatment for her ordeal she is told that any feelings she had for Ty were due to the Stockholm syndrome.&quot;</p>',

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Carole and Michael Middleton founded Party Pieces in 1987 and have 40 staff. But they have reportedly laid off three members of staff over anxieties ahead ..
            </p>
            <p>
             The company began when the family returned to the UK from Jordan, where Mr Middleton had been managing an international air station for British Airways... In May of 1984, the Middleton family moved to Amman, Jordan for Michael’s job. There, the Telegraph explained, Carol took her extended maternity leave from British Airways to spend time with her two girls. …
            </p>
            <p>
             As Town&amp;Country explained, in 1987 Carole left the travel industry behind and founded her company Party Pieces, which started as a small mail order party supply and decoration company. Now that company is estimated to be worth more than $50 million.

             That is the only intelligence tie I’ve found and only that source, which is a reliable one. If anyone else can find intelligence ties, I think there’s something there. They have pretty substantial “educational resources” that “teach” about the CIA.
