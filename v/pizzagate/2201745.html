            The heath thing ....though I've no doubt it's true....is a diversion....in the UK "historical child abuse" is a way to avoid the fact that nothing has changed and it is still happening

            Wilfred Brambell was prosecuted for soliciting young boys and buggery of the same in a London gents public lavatory.  This really famous actor never worked again after that.  Bill Maloney of Pie and Mash films has done some sterling documentaries on Haut de la Garenne and was responsible for bringing the sexual predilections of Heath as well as his link to Saville at Jersey into the public consciousness.  Before demolishing the home, it was subjected to a massive forensic examination where children's skulls were unearthed, but that the press later described as 'coconut shells' (yeah, buried in a cellar; I ask you!).  One politician had his career upended and his life destroyed by trying to bring all of this to light.  But all in all, this post offers nothing new.

            As  much as they want to hide the horrors committed at Haut de la Garenne,  the children will haunt that island until justice is served.  Jimmy S. and Heath visited there many times, even though Saville denied it, and then they found a picture of him there when the yacht of Heath was docked at Jersey Island.  If you have never read up on the story, please do.  I once watched a video about it  that was very sad and sorrowful but it told of what was found in the Orphanage.  They are trying to tear the Orphanage down, to erase memories and evidence.  There are ways to get DNA now.  Heath's DNA could be found on clothes buried in the place or on bones.  Yes.  the little bones of children.  This must not die.

              Witness tampering is very easy if they are children.
The Court legally stole the children from their mother, the only one who tried to fight a corrupt system.

            David Icke had called out Ted Heath as a serial child killer decades ago. Only last year did the victims come forward(30 of them!) Pedo-brotherhood and their minions has been trying to kill the investigation for most of last year. It won't go away. This is a paradigm shattering truth that would change public's perception of the world around them!

His mother had been receiving death threats. After his death a key was found in the club the key was for a garage owned by Gerard Pinon; inside the garage was found a car belonging to Demanet. Pinon is accused by Dutroux along with his ex-wife, of murdering Weinstein. Demanet was the State prosecutor in Mons. One of Taminiau’s feet was recovered from a canal.

                . The date rape drug Rohypnol was found in his respirator. No autopsy was carried out on his body. Rophynol was used by Dutroux to drug the girls.
Bruno Tagliafero – Died 05/11/95 – A scrap metal dealer from the southern Belgian town of Kumieé, who, according to his doctor’s report, died of a heart attack at the tender age of 30. He was contracted to demolish the car in which Julie and Melissa are thought to have been abducted and was prepared to talk. His wife campaigned for over a year to exhume his body. Samples were sent to America. The results state that his corpse had enough cyanide to kill over 100 men.
Belgian authorities since claimed that dead bodies generate cyanide and refused to re-open the case. No scientific evidence was presented to support this fanciful explanation.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              It is surely no coincidence that so many of these prospective witnesses died just before they were willing to testify. In the context of child-sex trafficking, arms supply and underworld/Establishment protectionism, these appear to be little more than assassinations as part of the standard protocol which ensure the core networks remain undisturbed. How much we get to hear about breaches of integrity within the networks depends on the severity of the accident and to what extent media editors are co-opted by their own self-censoring beliefs as well as outside threats.
