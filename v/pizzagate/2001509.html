<p>Scalia, the Illuminati, the Jesuits and the Vatican</p>
<p>the connection to the Illuminati which was founded by the Jesuit Johann Adam Weishaupt, which leads us to
 Judge Scalia and Bohemian Grove and child sex abuse; into the heart of the Vatican itself, and what is more
, the Mocking Bird Murdoch Media propaganda machine.Thrown into this mix is the prospect of WWIII</p>
<p>CIA mercenaries and Knights of Malta supporting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and the Orthodox Christian 
Church in Eastern Europe and Russia terrorized by a combination of Ukrainian Nazis funded by Jewish 
Zionists and supported by Muslim Brotherhood insurgents to wipe them off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>keeping in mind that the Vatican is the biggest pedophile all boys club on the planet, that the Illuminati 
was founded by a Jesuit, and that the P2 lodge is one of the most powerful Illuminati Lodges and Mafia
 central:
1. “Their goal is the same as other plutocrats – unbridled power – except they use the influence of the 
Catholic Church and its worldwide network of institutions exempt from both taxes and financial reporting
 requirements to advance rightwing parties and governments.” </p>
<p>By 2016 Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier of Durban South Africa was appointed by Pope Francis as a Cardinal 
Member of the newly established Council for Economic Affairs. He participated in the cardinal conclave that
 elected both Ratzinger, a known Nazi sympathizer with links to child sex abuse and the papal conclave that elected Bergoglio who has a cloud hanging over has head for presumed support of the fascist regime in Argentina.</p>
<p>Also of  concern is that along with DiNardo and  Norberto Rivera Carrera  “As with so many of the pope’s other appointments, three of the cardinals have “words and deeds regarding clergy sex crimes and cover ups” which are
 “deeply troubling.”</p>
<ol>
<li>” “Supernumeraries” are married and live independently but are still required to make large contributions and 
send their children to Opus Dei schools if available. At all levels, the names of the lay members are secret unless
 self-disclosed. Opus Dei also has an order of publicly identified priests and prelates.”</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the men in government, the military , the law courts with people like Scalia and banking. The newly named Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA) which replaces the Institute for Religious
 Works was overseen and took advice from none other than Peter Sutherland of Goldman Sachs, a long time
 consultant of the Vatican. Keep in mind that it was Goldman Sachs that played a major role in the economic
 meltdown in Greece, a predominately Orthodox Christian country which should raise eyebrows!</p>
<ol>
<li>“Robert Hutchison, a financial journalist, traces the growth of Opus Dei financial power “by all
 available means” – deception, dirty tricks, even “physical muscle” like poisonings which mimic heart attacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>4. “It’s widely known that Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas belong
 to Opus Dei – and that Chief Justice John Roberts may also be a member,”</p>
<ol>
<li>“These organizations will support whichever Republican candidate has the best chance of winning regardless
 of his religious affiliation. That’s why the endorsement by five former U.S. ambassadors to the Vatican of 
Mitt Romney</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1984 Reagan gave the Vatican permission for an ambassador whereas formally they were only represented by an apostolic delegate. And think about last year, the Pope addressing the US Congress for the first time.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Days before Pope Bergoglio appointed Pell  “G8” group of cardinals who would advise the pope on “governing the Church,” Pell attended a “Gala Dinner” celebrating the Melbourne-based Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) an “ultraconservative think tank.” Rupert Murdoch was guest of honor and Abbott the keynote speaker. (Murdoch was awarded a papal knighthood by Pope John Paul II for “promoting the interests of society, the Church and the Holy See.”</li>
</ol>
<p>So, Mocking Bird Murdoch Media is sanctioned by the Vatican and Murdoch has a “knighthood”no less for
 propaganda and disinformation. What is more, as of 29th February 2016 his pal,  George Pell, ” is being called 
on to give evidence about his time in the Ballarat and Melbourne diocese… During his time there, several 
paedophile priests were operating, including at St Alipius school in Ballarat where children were subject to
 abuse from Gerald Ridsdale, Australia’s most prolific 
paedophile who described himself as “out of control” at a hearing last year.”</p>

            . You are right over the target. Remember Pope Francis was not just the new Pope he was placed in power with Obama's help. Francis is a NAZI sympathizer at the very least. He provided protection of NAZI war criminals sent to Argentina. He also is the first Jesuit Pope....This was all planned ahead of time. Look up his real name Bergolio. He has numerous charges against him in the Intetnstional Court of Justice which have witness testimony to his involvement if child rape &amp; sacrifice. CRdinal Pell is his closest advisor and in charge of Papal money and banking. Pope Francis called him to the Holy See in Vatican City after leaks came out of his horrific child sexual assaults then placed him at the top of the finances. Granting him absolute immunity and protection from the horrific crimes committed against young children.,,even ones who were deaf &amp; mute so they could not scream for help.

            for another wonderful report. This is amazing, especially tying the Vatican together with Murdoch and Scalia and Reagan and Romney, not to mention Obama allowing the Bergoglio to address Congress. Ratzinger, imo has been suspected to have Nazi connections for quite some time. Pell had to travel back to Australia to defend himself for charges of pedophilia and others close to the Pope were just arrested among others for taking part in a gay orgy in an apt. owned by Ratzinger. It does not get anymore disgusting than this, but as usual we know it always can.
