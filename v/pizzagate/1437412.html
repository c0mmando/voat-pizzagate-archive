            Yes he lobbies for state and federal "eraser button" or "right to be forgotten" laws. Look into the California laws for children privacy rights where it passed. I don't like the idea that the Feds or state officials could force companies to purge info on minors leaving no trace that they existed. I didn't find anything solid however so I am not calling this guy a suspect. He clearly is kissing Pedostas ass all the time and has no insider knowledge of "walnut sauce"
