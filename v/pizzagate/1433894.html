            He cares so much about kids then why did he not do anything about the kids being shot down in Chicago? Or all of this crazy women hammering their pregnant stomachs to get back at boy friends? We do have an epidemic on our hands with the kids.

            whats with the kid face in the back ground? Hopefully nothing Skolnik is a hard core liberal and an activist if anything we can find out side of PIZZAGATE who the players are on the left. But if you read his head line he is a proud member of #Obama and kids.

            Obama was playing ping pong at Comet with a boy, I need to take a break from this rabbit hole I hope that is ending to no where.

            You can dig pretty deep on this issue my info does not prove anything but all of these people run in circles. The elites, they run in the same circles and in the same area, politics and Holly Wood.

            Tom Colicchios wifes Twitter, she is all up into the elections too . So far they are elitists that raise money for their political agenda I don't know what they do behind close doors but their a couple of rich assholes who support another rich asshole (Hillary) who pretends to care for the middle class during their fancy dinners, their press covered weddings I never heard of these fucking people.
           </p>
           <p>
            That alone pisses me off these privileged elites saying they " care".

            This doesn't prove anything but the NYT writes about their wedding I don't know who the hell these people are except they run in the rich elite circles and must have ties for their wedding to be covered.

            Tom used to own a bar called Craft still searching. What gets me is all of these one percent protesters who wanted Hillary to win. Look at these fucking people. They are loaded . Mary Kays books seem harmless she is just another liberal. Frequency of Souls is not about witch craft its about family one reader on amazon was mad and felt mislead about the title .
That video of hers is to me, stupid,trying to hard to seem all artsy and hip,.

           <p>
            Tom Colicchio is married to Lori Silver a film maker whose films I have never heard of. They are filthy rich though filthy. So far thats all Ive seen but still reading .
