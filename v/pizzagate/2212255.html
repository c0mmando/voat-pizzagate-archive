<p>In this clip from 21/10/17 a woman reports having been approached in a supermarket by an Indian/Pakistani looking man asking her about celebrating Halloween and that she should save her daughter from the devil - accompanied by an Indian/Pakistani woman; she feels they pinpointed her daughter and that she prevented them from acting only by reporting the suspicious behaviour to staff but that another woman was also approached in the same store’s parking lot:</p>

            Also, keep an eye open when you see U-Haul/Ryder trucks.  Especially at truck stops, gas stations or rest stops close to major freeways.  We witnessed something a few weeks ago that confirmed every suspicion we had, this is how they are transporting kids.

            Allow people to speak how they want! Whenever you try to shut someone down for how they talk I find it totally distracting. Glockandfucking load!!! So rich! I was delighted and laughed. Thank you God of chaos thank you we are so bitter and so alone if only to rescue children. It's  not too intellectual,  people   have emotions. High Numbers of  Critical Missing in Michigan and Oregon.... Truly disturbing, at this point when "spreading" this information it won't be possible to down vote all the woke "radicalized" so to speak. These are not bedtime stories to go to sleep by.

            Thank you for posting this, OP. I would like to clarify that in the UK, people described as "Asian"  are usually from the Pakistan/India region.  In the US, people described as "Asian" are generally from the Far East, or countries such as China, Korea, and Japan.  Since this story is about vanishings in the USA, I think it's important to point out the difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point in the clip about a woman who was nearly abducted, the perpetrator was described as "Pakistani" or perhaps Indian.

           </p>
           <p>
            In the UK, this very same person would likely be described as "Asian".  I am not trying to foment racism in any way, but I think when we are trying to protect our children, details matter.  The reason the whole Rotherham situation got so out of control is because all of the perpetrators were of Pakistani origin, and the people who should have been reporting the incidents were so afraid of being labeled "racist" that they just chose to look the other way, and it was at the expense of the children.  Even the penalties the people in the "grooming" ring received were very slight, probably for the same reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you say to an American the person who tried to abduct a child was Asian, and if the news reported the description of the abductor as Asian-appearing (and that's a BIG if), people would be looking for someone of Chinese or Korean descent, not Pakistani.  In the US, Pakistani is considered "Middle Eastern".  I don't mean to nit-pick here, nor cast suspicion on anyone who appears to be of Middle Eastern descent, but I think it's an important distinction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, the most important point is to always be aware of your surroundings, and anything that may seem strange or out of place.

             .  In my opinion every U.S. citizen who is qualified to lawfulluy carry shpuld be carrying 24-7, everywhere it's legal.  Me and mine?  Twenty four seven.  And our home us like Fort Fucken Knox, with alarms and cameras to boot.  So I encourage all y'all with clean backgrounds to contact yoyr local NRA branch, meet those goid people, get yourselves licensed to carry, and then, FFS, carry 24-7.  They don't call me "Second Amendment" For nothing.

             I pity the poor homeless vet (Pakistanis are vets too) that comes up to you in a lot and has their face shot off.  You are just waiting to use your new toy.  You will be sitting in jail.  The vet or homeless mother will be dead.  Think about it.  We have to be smart when using  weapons.  embrace hell embrace the cruel?  I am telling this to you for your own good and safety.  Cool down please.
