<strong>Wayne Williams:</strong> The \'Atlanta Child Murderer\', Wayne Williams was convicted of the murders of 2 men, but was blamed for the murders of over 20 others, mostly boys and young men, supposedly between the years 1979 - 1981. One of the most controversial aspects of the case is the actual number of victims, as many appeared to have been arbitrarily omitted from the authorities\' official tally of Atlanta Child Murder victims, dubbed \'The List\'. One reason for this may be because, as former Atlanta Public Safety Commissioner Chet Dettinger observed, 25 victims were murdered after the arrest of Williams, the purported Atlanta Child Murderer. There was also (as with so many purported serial killer cases) no specific MO employed, with victims being murdered via shooting, stabbing, bludgeoning and drowning and, although dubbed the Atlanta Child Murders, a number of the victims were adults and although the victims were predominantly male, some girls were murdered as well. There is, therefore, considerable uncertainty as to how many victims there actually were and when the killings began and ended.</li>
</ul>
<p>In July 1980, victim Earl Terrell disappeared. His aunt promptly received a \'phone call informing her that her nephew had been taken and warning her not to call the police. Shortly after, she received another call telling her that Earl had been taken to Alabama and that it would cost her $200 to get him back. There was no evidence that Earl had been taken to Alabama, nor was it ever explained why a kidnapper would be stupid enough to transport a child across state lines for a paltry $200 ransom. These \'phone calls did have the effect of making the case a federal matter, which allowed the FBI to take control of the Atlanta Child Murder case. Some 200 FBI agents descended upon Atlanta, including their profilers, in what was billed as the first real test of the \'science\' of profling. Not surprisingly, the Bureau\'s self professed \'experts\' claimed that a single, black serial killer was responsible for the murders (the classic \'angry, lone nut\' solution, in addition to the largely false trope that serial killers kill only within their own race). Before the investigation was wrapped up, no less an authority than Vice President George H.W. Bush came to town, ostensibly to coordinate federal and local efforts and to make sure the investigation stayed on track. It is of note that Bush Snr. was implicated in the Franklin Scandal, with his sons George W. and Jeb possibly being connected to the Hand of Death cult which Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole claimed to be part of.</p>
<p>Suspicion first fell upon Williams when he was allegedly observed on a bridge at the same time a splash occurred in the river below. Two days after that alleged incident, the body of one Nathaniel Carter, an admitted drug dealer and homosexual prostitute, was discovered downstream from the bridge. There is serious doubt, however, as to whether this incident ever actually occurred. The police officer who filed the report did not report the splash immediately, nor attempt to verify the source of the alleged splash, nor request equipment to drag the river in order to find the object which made the splash. The medical examiner was initially unable to ascertain the time of Carter\'s death, but later accommodated police by placing it in accordance with the bridge story. Moreover, 4 eyewitnesses came forward to say they had seen Carter alive the day after the alleged bridge incident. These witnesses were never presented at Williams\'s trial. Williams was not arrested immediately after the alleged bridge incident, but he was publicly identified as the new prime suspect, leading to a 2 1/2 week press circus at the Williams home and a trial by media which branded him the Atlanta Child Murderer before he ever set foot inside a courtroom. Local authorities were pressured by the FBI into arresting Williams, despite the fact that they no real evidence linking him to any of the murders (other than highly dubious fibre evidence) and that Williams bore no resemblance to any of the witness descriptions in police files or any composite sketches which had been created. Moreover, the other adult which Williams was charged with killing, one Jimmy Ray Payne, was not even initially considered a homicide victim!</p>
<p>There were numerous other suspects in the murders. For example, victim Timothy Hill was known to frequent the house of known paedophile names Thomas Terrell. Two witnesses placed Hill at Terrell\'s house around the time of his disappearance and Terrell admitted to police that he knew Hill and had sexually abused him on previous occasions. Victim Earl Terrell disappeared shortly after leaving a public swimming pool which was directly across from a house which was the hub of a child pornography ring The house was owned by one John David Wilcoxen who was later convicted for his involvement in the ring and a witness placed Earl at Wilcoxen\'s house on several occasions Victim Lubie Geter was also connected to Wilcoxen. 3 eyewitnesses claimed to have seen laundromat manager James Brooks go into the back room of the laundromat accompanied by a young, black male. One of the witnesses claimed to have seen Brooks and another man, Calvin Smith, beating, sodomising and strangling the boy. Other witnesses saw Brooks in a hooded, ceremonial robe carry a large object out to the dumpster behind the laundromat. Victim Clifford Jones was found in that very same dumpster. A drug dealer and police informant claimed to have seen the body of a young boy in the back seat of the car of one of his customers. He said he knew this man to be a paedophile and that he had, on previous occasions, offered him money to procure young, male prostitutes. Police never followed up on this lead. Despite so many of the victims being connected to, or seen with known paedophiles prior to their disappearance, none of these paedophiles were ever seriously considered suspects.</p>
<p>As for Williams, while there is no hard evidence that he took part in the abductions/murders, he was most likely involved with the child porn/prostitution ring which was responsible. Williams was, by profession, a freelance photographer and self styled \'music promoter\' who spent much of his free time trolling for talent among Atlanta\'s black youth. He was also known to impersonate a police officer, which got him arrested when he was 18. In response to the bridge incident, according to reports received by Chet Dettinger from the Williams\' neighbours, Williams and his father began a major cleanup job around their house. They carried out boxes and carted them off in their car. They burned negatives and photographic prints in the outdoor grill. It does not take a great deal of imagination to figure out what type of photographs Williams had been taking. Williams was most likely a procurer of children and producer of child pornography for the ring which carried out the murders.</p>
<p>Roy Innis, head of the Congress of Racial Equality, made public the story of witness Shirley McGill, a cocktail waitress from Miami who claimed that the murders were perpetrated by a cult involved drug trafficking, child pornography and Satanism. This cult contained members in Georgia and Florida. She claimed that her part-time lover, one Parnell Traham was one of the leaders of the cult. She claimed to have witnessed both animal and human sacrifices and identified Williams as a member of the cult whom she had seen filming the rituals, but not directly participating in the ritual murders. She also claimed that she acted as bookkeeper for the cult\'s drug trafficking operations which involves purchasing used cars in Miami which would be loaded with drugs and then delivered to Atlanta and Houston. The cult operated with police protection and she knew of at least one funeral home which was complicit in the disposal of bodies. McGill passed to polygraph examinations, recounted the same story under hypnosis and was able to lead investigators to remote sites where rituals had been performed. Another indication of the Satanic nature of the murders is that many parents of the victims found that their children had crosses carved into their foreheads or chests. It is also of note that Williams once claimed to have worked for the CIA and, as former FBI Agent Ted Gunderson observed, many Satanic cults operating in America are creations of the CIA.</p>

             Notes taken from John Ramseys offices in Denver Colorado in December 1996 include the phone numbers of Oliver North, Edwin Meese and former U.S. President William Clinton. Sources close to the Denver Police are now finally reporting that this evidence was taken in December 1996 and then classified under a National Security Decree." Maybe Judicial Watch could file a FOIA?

             Thanks for that. Needed a refresher. These links give a really strong scent of luciferianism attached to these murders. Really important not to let these connections dry up.

            Williams may have worked for the FBI, but I believe they made him a scapegoat for all of the crimes.  I believe he may even have been MK Ultra.He seemed way to docile for someone that has been accused of all those murders, unless of course we were not shown the backlash.  When I first saw the special they had on CNN I kind of believed he did it.  Now since a few years ago, I question outcomes especially with all the lawsuits of the wrongly convicted.  I don't think he did it.  I also believe the CIA is behind cults and may be using MS-13 now to do a lot of their dirty work too.  The RCC is aiding and abetting with their family cults and FLDS as well.   There are Satanic SRA family cults but also those under the CIA and their pedo elite friends so they can have their Sick Fun.
