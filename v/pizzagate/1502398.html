            Are there guidelines around posting primary source material? I pulled the headline exactly from the You Tube video so the testimonial was sourced exactly as I found it.

             It was not voluntary. You can thank Gopluckyourself for raging on a rules following tirade today and getting Crensch to delete it. People keep posting the video anyways. You can see our conversation about it at the very bottom of this thread. And here is the current post that is still up, and that ironically Gopluckyouself is now finding linked to the Dutroux case.

            Lucas was born in Belgium where she was sold into a sex trafficking ring at the age of six.[4] This ring reached news headlines in 2004 during the pedophile scandal involving Mark Dutroux, who claimed to be part of "a ring that included high ranking members of the police force and government." From 1969 on, Lucas was abused in the ring, made to commit violence, and was tortured before being released in 1974 at age eleven.[5] Lucas claims to have been given survival instructions by her rescuer which included relocating to London, Paris and New York. After living in all three cities as a young adult, she moved to Los Angeles in 1986 where she began therapy, yoga and meditation.[6] In 1991, Lucas entered the MFA screenwriting program at the American Film Institute Conservatory where she graduated in 1993. Her acceptance at AFI was based on her writings on the subject of sexual abuse.

            Lucas was born in Belgium where she was sold into a sex trafficking ring at the age of six.[4] This ring reached news headlines in 2004 during the pedophile scandal involving Mark Dutroux, who claimed to be part of "a ring that included high ranking members of the police force and government." From 1969 on, Lucas was abused in the ring, made to commit violence, and was tortured before being released in 1974 at age eleven.[5] Lucas claims to have been given survival instructions by her rescuer which included relocating to London, Paris and New York. After living in all three cities as a young adult, she moved to Los Angeles in 1986 where she began therapy, yoga and meditation.[6] In 1991, Lucas entered the MFA screenwriting program at the American Film Institute Conservatory where she graduated in 1993.

            How the fuck could a person kill a child?
           </p>
           <p>
            It literally makes no sense to me. My mind literally cannot comprehend the thought of killing a child...
           </p>
           <p>
            My first thought when she started talking about the chopping block was that she is a liar, that people don't actually slaughter human children like chickens.

            I'm just at a loss for words. It's one thing to sit here on Voat and talk about it but it's so much different actually hearing from someone who this happened to.

             Don't let it bring you down too hard or let it spoil your faith in humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
             The people doing these things aren't fully human. Their actions are being guided by influences they have invited into their bodies through rituals or otherwise..
            </p>
            <p>
             What I'm saying is that these people are possessed by entities who feed on human suffering. This is what David Icke and others have outlined for decades. That there really are spiritual forces. Good, evil and everything in between is all around us.
            </p>
            <p>
             The point is that there is mostly good in the world and that our humanity is inherently good and biased towards life. The fact that we are seeing the horrors that have been covered up is a good sign because it means light is shining where it once was dim.

            This is a women who leads an established charitable organization, testifying about how she was brutalized in an elitist pedophile and murder ring while a child. Under her story, the reason that there are few victims coming forward to testify about this type of elite pedophile ring in Europe is because the children involved are routinely murdered after they have been used up. If you look this women up, she appears legit, and has been discussing this issue for some time (way before Pizzagate).  How in the name of fuck has this not been addressed by authorities somewhere in the world? (EDIT: grammar)

             So few victims because as she says they kill so many of them and so many powerful people who you wouldn't believe would do such a thing are the abusers? I had thought that maybe these people do kill so many of their victims that that is why so few speak out. They can't speak out because they are dead.

              That's one part of it... the other part of it is as Marthevedderett says. They are on the take. The famous Italian Judge (a very good man), Vittorio Occorsio, was about to reveal the MOST intricate, complex, Vatican connected P2- 33rd degree Freemason Mafia lodge in Italy that had created an entire Shadow Government network &gt;&gt;&gt; then he was murdered by  Pierluigi Concutelli, a member of the infamous P2 lodge that was mostly fascist. The murder of judges and plaintiffs serves as a reminder to anyone who attempts to reveal their insidious satanic empire will face the consequences. So if you're not on the take, even uncorrupted judges have an incentive to give "light" sentences. (sickening)
             </p>
             <p>
              Members of this lodge have admitted that to become a member, infanticide was a prerequisite. I will make a separate VOAT post about this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also a Catholic study on trafficking found that 63% of those in the sample of minors trafficked for sex had a relationship with their handlers either through their parents or community at large that sold them into the sex-trade.

               They are powerful people. Nonetheless if there were more victims it wouldn't be as easy to cover this up. Judges would have to do something or the public would demand they resign. A jury of the people would probably always convict sex traffickers if there is enough evidence. In this case it is hard to find evidence.

                Yes, that's part of it, but of the ones that live, there are countless cases such as Epstein where the jurors know the evidence yet they are duped into giving light sentences. ONLY Epstein was sentenced with a 13 month sentence (and even then he was allowed to travel freely during the day, he just had to spend the night in jail).... guess what? That judge will probably be reappointed. Many judges are appointed and simply confirmed through silly votes that are notoriously famous for just rubber-stamping.
               </p>
               <p>
                The litany of evidence and of plaintiffs in the Epstein case is absolutely STAGGERING and yet only 1 person was convicted. Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and Alan Dershowitz are all implicated with MANY flight logs on the Lolita express where countless minors were raped...... despite there being many victims and 1 who was extremely vocal. The court system didn't notify the victims about certain procedures that ultimately left them unheard.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, as I stated, MANY plaintiffs are murdered if they are going to go to court to reveal the extent of the Satanic Occult Freemason empire. Many are also brainwashed. If you do 15 minutes of research, you'll find that child sex slaves are the perfect victims b/c the overwhelming majority blame themselves for the crimes committed against them. I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but that is how these sadistic people work, when these creeps rape someone with such a young, innocent, fragile mind, they are often brainwashed into not coming out against them and even defending them in court, which Epstein was able to produce.
               </p>
               <p>
                At any rate, there are some pretty famous cases of children speaking out about how it's extremely difficult to prosecute, b/c they fear for their lives or they are brainwashed by their handlers.

                 The judges in the UK are known to give light sentences to pedos too. Someone I know actually said about one case on the news "What do these judges have between their ears?"

                 It's all part of the same problem. They are rich, famous and in many cases make themselves, seem on the surface seem like good people, make themselves seem like philanthropists. They seem this way because they have charities, donate lots of money to them, pretend to be anti establishment, anti rape anti human trafficking, they make it seem like they want to end poverty and help impoverished nations when they really take advantage of and use impoverished nations and poverty to take part in crime and make themselves rich too. Even if you take away their money and the payoffs to corrupt judges who wants to believe they are really capable of such evil? They have most of the public fooled in my opinion. They are pretending to be good people when really they are sickos, criminals and scum, the lowest form of scum.

                  Ding ding ding!!! Exactly! All these sickos have 1 thing in common - they look all benevolent. It's why the Shriner's hospital which is a 33rd Degree Freemason program was created. Shriners are 33rd Degree masons yet they seem all benevolent wearing their Red fez caps fashioned with an Arabic sword as well as the crescent moon and star. The cap signifies the murder of 50,000 Christians in Morocco in 890 AD, the day that the Arabs revolted the old world order in North Africa and forever changed its history. They hide in plain sight.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Here are a bunch of 70+ year old white men, seemingly Anglo-Saxon Westerner christians, yet they are donning a cap that signifies the blood sacrifice murder of many Christians while promoting the benefit of children (another disturbing aside of potential victims for these sick satanists... terminally ill patients).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The garden variety Freemason has no earthly idea what I am talking about... it's only once they "climb the ladder of enlightenment" to the higher degrees that they understand their mission in life and of the NWO. That's why it is called the 33rd degree... In the US system, the first temperature degree that represents thawing of ice is 33 degrees Fahrenheit... therefore the mind is finally unfrozen and "enlightened" and you are now your own god.... hence the Crowley ideas on being your own god, etc (that's where people like Crowley got their ideas from, Freemasons)

                   Well here in the UK Jimmy Saville gave allot of money to organization's for charitable causes. Now he wasn't that rich. And I'm not saying he didn't have judges payed off however. He wasn't as rich as some people, I don't think he had billions. I don't know how often he could keep bribing people. But still he gave lots of money to charities, and he volunteered at hospitals allot. Some of the staff at one he volunteered knew he was a creep, in fact a nurse there at was told to go to the morgue to get something "but if there was a pink haired man in there don't approach him, turn around and come straight back" he was known for groping and harassing women by the staff. They say allot of the staff were even told by patients he abused them. Either nobody believed the accusers or if they did, the people hearing about the abuse didn't want to do anything more about it because they thought they wouldn't be believed. Allot of the victims actually chose to be silent for the same reason, because they thought they wouldn't be believed.

                    Jeezus fu*k.... it amazes me how evil some savages are.... I'm willing to bet that a lot of these people like Saville are protected b/c they are also a big source of supply to the more powerful connected and rich friends. It's been noted by others on here that Saville hung around people way wealthier than he was that didn't make any sense ( I don't know the nuances b/c I'm not from the UK, but this fits the same narrative of some lesser known cases here in the US).

                      Exactly. He was David Brock's boyfriend at one time and is the guy that David Brock had to pay $850k. His relationship with Brock is what vaulted him into fame. If you notice, all those sadistic bands such as Heavy Breathing seem to have come into existence the time Obama won the presidency... the same time Brock and Alefantis were dating. Brock was the famous right-wing conservative turned EXTREME liberal by George Soros.

                      In a few WikiLeaks emails, John Podesta tells a few staffers that David Brock is a "total creep".... it makes A LOT of sense why he maligns Brock even when he has 0 incentive to do so.... B/c Alefantis and Podesta had become lovers and Brock was out of the sex triangle by the time Podesta maligns Brock in private emails.

                     <p>
                      Alefantis sends Podesta an email and ends it with "xoxo" .... no normal guy relationship ever ends an email with xoxo.

            Later in her statement she says that women can protect the children but I disagree. It is us Men who have failed and we need to own it.

            Clooooooose. Still not quite there tho.
            <br/>
            Mention the dutroux case ask the questions tell us that they tried to cover it up. This is still low effort. The article is maybe worthy of a link in a bigger post but not a solo post.

While this is a very sad story and awful to hear that she had to go through that this is not pizzagate related. This isn't relevant to pizzagate. MOOOOOOODDDDS

             This is relevant. Pizzagate/pedogate is a worldwide fenomenon and I'm using this brave woman's testimony to spread awareness in my and her country, Belgium. This will definately help to have people listening to a story they would otherwise find too unrealistic.

              This is an appeal to emotion to further your argument.
              <br/>
              Argue using logic with me please.
              <br/>
              The statement, "we can share this article with people to sway them through the use of an emotional appeal to convince them to look farther into the pizza gate investigation," is accurate. And I agree with it. So make that statement in your post. Post it to social media linking to pizza gate. Don't however tell me that this does any of these things.

             Can you please define pizzagate? For many of us, it encompasses world-wide trafficking of children, drugs and arms by elite or persons abusing authority (government officials) for quite a long time. The use and abuse of these children is entirely relevant, particularly if used for blackmail or commodity purposes.

              In my mind pizzagate is the investigation into widespread corruption and pedophilia of the political elite based on the wikileaks podesta emails and topics related. Not necessarily pedophilia but as they are related to the current web that we know of. Which iiiissss

              dis. edit: topics that can be pointed at and the question asked how does this relate to what we currently know?

             It is relevant because it puts a face on what is happening to these very children we are trying to save from trauma. It is people's humanity. It is through the heart that we will reach our fellow human beings. First hand testimony of survivors is primary source information. We want more people to feel safe coming forward. If you want to get technical on the reference to Pizzagate research, then you are correct in that there is no direct link at this time.

              Not even that if you want this to be part of the pizzagate psyops to help convince people of our cause then sure go for that. Pretty sure there are already threads and stuff for discussing that tho.

               I am struggling to make sense of what you are trying to say as there is a lack of coherence in your thought-stream. If you want to make this an issue regarding relevance, I won't try to stop you as that is your choice. I feel integrity in my position.

                The sidebar rules make some excellent points as far as how to make a post.
                <br/>
                2. Posts not about PIZZAGATE specifically will be removed.
                <br/>
                3. EVERY new discussion post needs to cite at least one source and provide an explanation as to why you believe it is relevant or furthers the investigation.
                <br/>
                7. Where the title is not sufficient to explain the connections/content of a link, the body must explain the connection.
                <br/>
                This post does none of these things.
                <br/>
                There are propaganda efforts to redpill the masses into buying into pizzagate. If this post is related to that then state that point in the title or make a text post linking to this article. As it stands I have no idea what you're trying to say with this post. It is literally only about a victim of a case of pedophilia as you have framed it. You have stated pedophilia of europeans elite in it but have not provided anything else. Ask the questions you want answered or make a connection. edit: otherwise this is just signal noise instead of content.

              I think many people are finally starting to listen and maybe believe. Not nearly enough people just yet, but the awareness is high. The more people come forward the higher likelihood it'll be kept alive and not get buried under all the rest of the news.
