            Does anyone know what a CO2 cartridge is?  Filled with shellfish toxin?  It is what was used to kill Reagan, but it did not work.  So they used a gun which they first said was a .33  and then  a .22.

            HOLY COW  Read This:  Hinckley married twice; first on December 6, 1641 to Mary Richards, and again to Mary Glover (née Smith) on March 15, 1659. He may have had as many as 17 children; different sources disagree on the exact number. One of his children, Samuel Hinckley (whose mother was Mary Richards), was a direct ancestor of Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as an ancestor of the former president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gordon B. Hinckley. Thomas Hinckley's sister, Susannah Hinckley, is an ancestor of President Barack Obama, which means that Thomas Hinckley's father, Samuel Hinckley, is the ancestor of three U.S. presidents. Although not himself a Mayflower passenger, through the marriage of his grandson Samuel to Mary Freeman, great-granddaughter of Governor Thomas Prence whose wife Patience was a daughter of the Elder Brewster, many of his descendants can claim Mayflower heritage.[4]  WOW.  I Am Still In Mortal Shock.  LDS  and  OBAMA.

             Thanks for posting that Carmencita.  Isn't it amazing how intertwined the ruling class is.  It is like we small people are just their little play things/slaves and we don't even know it.  What was that movie  with Jim Carey about his life being a reality tv show.  Everything planned out for him without him knowing it.  Was it Truman?

              I never liked Carey and have not watched movies for a long time...just old ones.    I do agree that we never suspected how prearranged our lives were, yes.  But now the fat cat is out of the bag and so big they can't stuff her back in.  We just need to find a good way to move this stuff forward faster.  I can't believe the Drama that plays out on the news (my local) and it is like a Circus.  I can't believe people put up with this, like it is entertainment.  Do the stupid idiots not realize they are being duped and made fun of when these people are off the tube?  They probably laugh uproariously behind closed doors.  The news is not a sitcom it is reality.  Real Reality.

            Mounted on a wall in the Wrigley Mansion, former home of P.T. Wrigley, is a letter Teddy Roosevelt wrote to P.T. Wrigley thanking him for "the first and largest financial contribution" to his 1912 race for the presidency. On the way to Sedona is a resort that once served as a principle watering hole for the wealthiest men in the world. Known as Castle Hot Springs, this resort was built in 1888 by Frank Murphy, the contractor who built the SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD for W.A. Harriman. To this day the summer homes there of John D. Rockefeller I and P.T. Wrigley sit side by side with those of the grandfather of Casper Weinberger and Cornelius Vanderbuilt.  AND The Beat Goes On.   The Sedona Forum

            "Now for the secrets of the FREEMASONS and these other secret societies that are "guarding the secrets of the Temple of Solomon". The KNIGHTS TEMPLARS were the "guardians of the Holy Grail". On the exoteric level school children are taught that this was some kind of cup. But if the syllables are split a bit differently "Sang Raal" in French translates to "Holy Blood"! This holy bloodline is what the PRIORY OF SION  has dedicated itself to for more than 1,000 years. Many of the Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion are well known historical figures like Sir Isaac Newton and Francis Bacon. Today the Grand Master is a Frenchman named Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair."    IT IS ALL ABOUT THE BLOODLINES.  They Are All Cousins.  Princess Di was a Cousin too.  They have been  working on this for Centuries to Kill the Christians and Catholics.  They want to Throw Us To the Lions Again.

            Can't you see that all these groups inevitably enrich JEWS and that that cannot be coincidence?  I do mean these guys in particular.  You didn't even mention Harriman building LA.  California is kind of important, are you aware? Notable for its JEWISH population.  Do you people even accept that crypto-Jews are a thing??

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Here is the story line that runs through both HOLY BLOOD and GENEALOGY. Joseph of Arimathea was the uncle of the Virgin Mary (both therefore of the Davidic line). Joseph of Arimathea possessed one of the largest fleets in the Mediterranean doing a vigorous trade in metals. The tin mines of Cornwall in great Britain were part of his domain (tin plus copper = bronze). In my many readings of the Bible this background figure never registered in my conscienceless. But it was in the private garden of Joseph of Arimathea that our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified and in the tomb of Joseph that He was placed.
             </p>
             <p>
              What underlies all the disparate facts of this article is an intense spiritual warfare against the Christian faith which has all but succeeded in splintering and fracturing all earthly efforts to transmit the life giving message of Jesus Christ. FREEMASONS murdered the last Pope. Malachi Martin, who claims to be a confident of the present Pope, discusses in THE KEYS OF THIS BLOOD the intentional destruction of the Catholic Church from within. This same guerrilla warfare has been directed at all 
denominations attempting to mutate Christianity into something quite the opposite. We may all live to see true Christians thrown to the lions --- for indeed they are truly the only force left to resist the power so visibly concentrating in the small elite herein described.
             </p>
             <p>
              But in all this turmoil, if we take one step toward God, He will take two steps toward us. Jesus proclaimed the worthiness of all God's creatures.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lucifer exulted the strong at the expense of the weak. Much of what passes for Christianity today can therefore be seen as Luciferian. The New Age openly exults Lucifer as do the FREEMASONS. Never has there been an age where it is easier for evil men to acquire wealth or more difficult for honest people to keep the rewards of their toil. It is as if a Creator has set up the ultimate test of character --- is it not?

             Maybe I misunderstood the meaning behind the link, but it I think it says that the New Word Order is nothing new and the elite philosophy  clearly goes back to Jews who felt threatened by Jesus' "Christian" teachings and wanted to protect their trade industry.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Gospel of Nicodemus, a text appended to the Acts of Pilate, provides additional details about Joseph. For instance, after Joseph asked Pilate for the body of the Christ, and prepared the body with Nicodemus' help, Christ's body was delivered to a new tomb that Joseph had built for himself. In the Gospel of Nicodemus, the Jewish elders express anger at Joseph for burying the body of Christ, saying:
             </p>
             <p>
              And likewise Joseph also stepped out and said to them: Why are you angry against me because I begged the body of Jesus? Behold, I have put him in my new tomb, wrapping in clean linen; and I have rolled a stone to the door of the tomb. And you have acted not well against the just man, because you have not repented of crucifying him, but also have pierced him with a spear.
— Gospel of Nicodemus. Translated by Alexander Walker.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Jewish elders then captured Joseph, and imprisoned him, and placed a seal on the door to his cell after first posting a guard. Joseph warned the elders, "The Son of God whom you hanged upon the cross, is able to deliver me out of your hands. All your wickedness will return upon you."

              It is BLATANTLY CLEAR who controls PG.  Even the UNINTENTIONALLY CORRECT "KHAZAR" FAGS ADMIT ITS AN ETHNIC MINORITY-BASED CULT: THEREFORE IT BECOMES A QUESTION OF WHAT MEASURES MIGHT BE JUSTIFIABLY TAKEN, AND HISTORICALLY THAT HAS BEEN EXPULSION OF THE GROUP THAT

                 You are not white either. You are Muslim. Hollywood is controlled by Jews. Everywhere else in California doesn’t feel like that. It’s full of a bunch of liberals and illegal aliens. Are you now adding that you have white kids and were interested in the Christian stuff so we wouldn’t keep believing that you are Muslim?

                     Equine said Jews are not white. Who is white? Light skinned people? White is a broad spectrum. Middle Eastern Muslims are NOT white. Therefore you are not. So do you really have kids? Did you leave them behind with the goats, camels and wife or what?

                         You always reply for the little bitch and run to his rescue. When I talked to him privately, he acted like he LOVED you. But he opened up to the mutual friend too much and with so many details that I think he showed his true self to him. But, he’s a fag. Some information came my way outing you. When I searched outside of voat, equine admits to being gay. You were standing up for Muslims. Your hatred for women and Jews goes along with you being Muslim, as well as information that came my way. You are curious about transgenders tho because you visit tranny subs. That would explain you liking your little bitch equine since he likes it in the ass. That’s why you must be besties who trade little dick pics. You try to confuse. Now saying you have little white kids and were interested in something Christian.

                         You’re so lame. So you either are equine, or you guys wanna fuck each other. Good thing your wife is still in Iran and doesn’t know that her goat fucking husband also likes men. Allah would not like that and he sees what you are doing. You won’t get your 72 virgins now.

STRANGE FOR A SHILL TO DEMAND LESS POINTLESS SOCIAL CHIT CHAT RATHER ENCOURAGE IT but you are oh so committed to "outing" me as, what, ANOTHER EQUALLY UNPOPULAR POSTER WITH SIMILAR VIEWS?

                           Equine was friends with Bopper. That’s our mutual friend. You liked Bopper because equine liked Bopper and you don’t like anyone. You think he’s stupid now because Bopper is done with equine. You just confirmed it more for me thanks.

                             Awww did he break up with you? In the long run, that’s for the best. I think since you are the one running to his defense, that he must have been the one to break up with you. What the fuck did you pull Donkey? So you are kissing his ass because he’s mad at you. So running to his rescue might earn you some brownie points right?

                             You need to give the faggot life up if you are married with “white kids” that are stuck in Iran. Shape up because Allah would not be happy with your behavior.

                             I think the reason you hate me so much is that I come too close to the truth when it comes to you lol. That and you have a crush on me because you are a bi-sexual. I know underneath you love me haha. I can’t imagine what a joy you must be in real life. Damn!

                               At least you admit you can’t resist me. You and horse fucker are trying to distance yourselves from looking like the same person so it’s normal that you would say that about him. You probably sent him a little love note afterwards telling him why you had to say that. I know AreWeSure is a shill. Didn’t you say you liked him? The crazy thing is, he actually makes a good point sometimes. He’s nothing close to being as mean as you are.

                               I’ve never said I’m not a little ditzy. I am smart about the subjects that I’ve been interested in. I’ve said I’m new to a lot of this. Like secret societies. I can be gullible. That’s how Equine sucked me in for like a minute. Ditzy doesn’t mean stupid. I have ADHD. My mind is all over the place and going 100 mph constantly. It’s hard for me to focus on one subject.

                                I'm new too.  Supported Israel.  Then PG, a real conspiracy, had Jews top to bottom, so I gave those a listen too.  I know another dude who went further to flat Earth on the basis of Jews alone. In fact the leader of the movement is called Eric Dubay and introduces himself on his YouTube channel as Flat Earther And Holocaust Denier.

                                  Does it not bother you more that 100% of popular culture is manipulated garbage to debase us, and all the great sixties bands were puppets in a Jewish psyop?  Our education is bogus too: we have been living lies essentially, so theyve sort of killed you already, perhaps that's why they enjoy making zombie movies so much.

                                     There is a lot I would fight donkey 🙄 Politically, I am a Conservative. Pro life, pro family, pro guns. I hate all the evil corruption I see. Christianity is and will always be attacked. I like it when men can be men and still be gentlemen. Not expected to become more feminine. I like where wives can still stay at home and that not be weird to others. I don’t like how there is a push for roles to be reversed. If I could fight it all I would. I’m only one person.

                                      Throughout the ages Jews were kicked out when they did ritual murders -- until women were given the vote.  Indeed now you can live unemployed for 92 weeks at your nieghbors expense.

                                  I know. George Soros is funding Black Lives Matter. They want us to have a race war. They want it to be complete chaos. Now whites are being the target of hate. Of course I don’t like it. Even whites are hating whites. People are crazy. We like our gun rights. My husband has a license to carry. He has one on him at all times. It’s tough to get a license here. But we want to move away from this liberal fricken state that we live in.

                   Jews are the culprit. Among others. They are not the ONLY culprit. Why is it so important for you to see “Jews”? Are you paid a quarter every time you say that word or have someone else or something? You’re crazy. Camel Jockeys hate Jews 🐪

             The Teamsters Union is one of the largest labor unions in the world, as well as the 11th largest campaign contributor in the United States. While they supported Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush for President in the 1980s, they have begun leaning largely toward the Democrats in recent years; they have donated 92% of their $24,418,589 in contributions since 1990 to the Democratic Party. Though the union opposed former President George W. Bush's agenda to open US highways to Mexican truckers, it did previously support Bush's platform for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[175] On July 23, 2008, however, Hoffa announced the union's withdrawal from the coalition favoring drilling there. Speaking before environmentalists and union leaders assembled to discuss good jobs and clean air, Hoffa said, "We are not going to drill our way out of the energy problems we are facing -- not here and not in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."[176]
            </p>
            <p>
             The Teamsters Union endorsed Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic Nomination on February 20, 2008.[177]

            <p>
             Sir Angus James Bruce Ogilvy, KCVO (14 September 1928 – 26 December 2004) was a British businessman, best known as the husband of Princess Alexandra, a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ogilvy is also remembered for his role in a scandal involving the breaking of sanctions against the regime in Rhodesia in the 1970s in the Lonrho affair. In later years, he was heavily involved in charity work.

             Early life
            </h1>
            <p>
             The Hon. Angus Ogilvy was born in London, the second son of the 12th Earl of Airlie and Lady Alexandra Coke, the daughter of the 3rd Earl of Leicester.[1] Many of his relatives had close links with the British Royal Family.[1] His grandmother, Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie, was a close friend and Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Mary.[1] His father was a Lord-in-Waiting to King George V and Lord Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother).[1] He was a second cousin of Diana Mosley, second cousin of Lavinia Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk, and a second cousin once removed of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury. He was also third cousin, once removed of Pamela Harriman.
            </p>

             Education and career
            </h1>
            <p>
             Ogilvy was educated at Heatherdown School, near Ascot in Berkshire; and later at Eton College (also in Berkshire). Between 1946 and 1948, while on National service, he was commissioned as an officer in the Scots Guards. In 1947 he attended Trinity College, Oxford, graduating in 1950 with a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.
            </p>
            <p>
             After university, Ogilvy worked at the Drayton company, later working with the tycoon Tiny Rowland in Drayton's subsidiary, London and Rhodesia Mining and Land Company (Lonrho). The Prime Minister, Edward Heath, criticised the company and described it in the House of Commons as "an unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism" on a 1973 court case over the company's management style. His career ended in 1976 after he was criticised in a Department of Trade report into the company's activities.[2]

            Disgusting that these Evil freaks will sell their souls to the devil for wealth and fame! 
There is no way of ever going back once you have gone to the dark side. 
I really pray that these Evil Pedo Elites spend the rest of enternity in constant mental &amp; physical turmoil &amp; immense pain &amp; suffering.

             George W. Bush's grandfather, Prescott Bush, was the Managing Director of the investment bank Brown Brothers, Harriman from the 1920s through the 1940s. It was Brown Brothers, in conjunction with Averell Harriman, the Rockefeller family, Standard Oil, the DuPonts, the Morgans and the Fords who served as the principal funding arm in helping to finance Adolph Hitler's rise to power starting in 1923.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Peter Duchin, who was really an unofficially adopted son of Averell Harriman, talked once of a little cottage he remembered staying in, on the enormous Harriman estate , when he was a teen, and even into his 20's . Averell promised Duchin he would inherit it , on his death. The property was over 100 acres, so one could visit the cottage, and never even get near the main house, grounds. Anyway , when her husband died, Pamela found a loophole, re the estate, and made sure that even the cottage would be hers , and not Duchin's . She power grabbed everything - and as others have pointed out , even things of no importance to her, but that meant a lot to others.

             Brooke Hayward showed her for what she was in her memoir "Haywire." After the suicide of her sister Bridget, Brooke and Pamela went to Bridget's apartment to find something for her to wear at her burial. They found two pearl necklaces that had been assembled pearl by pearl over the length of their childhoods by their mother Margaret Sullavan. Sullavan paid for the necklaces, diamond clasps and all, by playing high stakes Hearts with Sam Goldwyn, David O. Selznick, Herman Mankiewicz and Leland Hayward. They were so valuable Bridget and Brooke never had "the nerve" to wear them. There was also a large emerald ring that Leland Hayward had given their mother. Brooke said: "When Pamela saw them that day, she pointed out that they would be much safer with her. Pamela had a priceless jewelry collection that reposed in her custom-built safe, a series of drawers, each with an individual combination, which rose grandly from the floor to the ceiling of her closet. I was in no mood to defend my irresponsibility, so away went the pearls and the emerald. Ten years later, when I asked to have them back for my own daughter, they had vanished."

            Considering she'd been left with $100 million from her husbands, she died with only $10 million.  She must have been a squanderer.
