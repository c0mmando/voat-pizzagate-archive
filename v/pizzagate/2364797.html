<blockquote>
<p>Aaron was a student at the same Christchurch primary school in Hampstead, London that Ella Gareeva\'s children attended and testified about having been complicit in their abuse. <strong>Aaron\'s mother, Jenny Dover, worked at the school as well as the Tavistock Centre in Hampstead apparently.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I checked out Jenny Dover\'s CV and found that she is indeed an educational psychologist employed by Tavistock and has worked with children\'s mental health since 1986.  I wondered why an educational psychologist would work with a mainstream school, as I think that\'s pretty unusual.</p>
<p>Then I found this Christ Church school policy document which was originally drawn up in 2013 and updated through 2014 and 2015 (right round the time the whole story blew up in the media) <a href="http://www.christchurchschool.co.uk/images/parents/behaviour-policies/send%20policy%20-%20february%202015.pdf">http://www.christchurchschool.co.uk/images/parents/behaviour-policies/send%20policy%20-%20february%202015.pdf</a></p>
<p>The Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND) governor : Chair of Teaching, Learning and Standards Committee is <strong>Brad Fairhead</strong></p>
<p>Brad Fairhead has a CV that really makes me wonder how he got that position.  He\'s basically a digital advertising man with ties to New York, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, etc</p>
<p>According to Linkedin:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing Director of  Aperture Insights <a href="http://www.apertureinsights.com/about-us/">http://www.apertureinsights.com/about-us/</a></p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>He joins from mobile software company <strong>Go Find It Technologies</strong> where he was chief operating officer. Prior to that, he was at social media analytics agency Starcount as its chief strategy officer.</p>
<p>Fairhead co-founded Hyper in 2005 and then became Hypernaked’s managing director between 2011 and 2013 after it merged with Naken Communications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the last 24 months, Green has been on a sabbatical from advertising. But not the kind of sabbatical where you rest and do nothing - the kind of sabbatical where you go all out and get shit done.</p>
<p>He started <a href="https://blowmeballoons.com/">Blow Me Balloons</a>.   (website tag line: $9.99 FOR 20 BALLOONS. FUCKING BUY SOMETHING YOU CHEAP PRICKS)</p>
<p>Says Green: &quot;Like Hallmark for hellhound miscreants.&quot;</p>
<p>He\'s a founder and a creative director of interiors company Feathr.com. </p>
<p>Says Green: &quot;Unboring your walls.&quot;</p>
<p>He has written two books that you can buy on Amazon: The A to Z Of Fuckin\' Everything &quot;It\'s bonafide wankerpedia&quot;, and, You Can\'t Give Vodka To A Baby And Other Parenting Myths &quot;Use this if you want your kids on Jerry Springer.&quot;</p>

<p>Very odd.  If anyone can find a complete list of the governors at the school, please send it my way.</p>',

            was the most blatant case I remember right now. All that poster said was "there are some good threads in the deleted threads area" and boom, got banned. Much hell was raised about and Falcon finally had to relent. There have been others but I think this Christ Church situation might have just gotten straight with your help. Since I am not  here to raise hell and argue I would rather just drop the banning subject. All I wanted to do was defend a relevant topic. I just pinged the OP and pointed to your helpful advice and hopefully its problem solved now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for your help dude :)

            These two children gave the most bone chilling testimony of being ritually abused and sexually molested in pizzagate history. The two little blonde kids. You will remember their faces instantly probably. Its the Hampstead children. World famous case. Its so relevant he didn't bother with Rule 1.

            Not going to say because Falcon has a history of banning members for simply having an opinion he does not like. I don't what he thought of my last username but with his history of banning people that say things he does not like, I figure the less he knows about me the better. Not trying to pull a fast one, that is just how I feel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that I stuck up for this post I will have to create a new name probably because he will most likely target me. I am being straight up in my defense of the Christ Church topic and that is really all that matters.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't want to be the subject because I am not relevant. The rules are relevant and Falcon just exceeded his mandate.

              Falcon knows who Tavistock is. Everybody in the whole truth community knows who Tavistock is. It does not matter if he knows or not. You brought names that were new to you to a valid case in the pizzagate world and he is hindering. That is all that matters. Its not his job to speculate if the dots will connect or not. His job is to allow research within the rules.

            I am not the OP. I am a community member. The post met the rules. It obviously did. Why is Falcon allowed to sift through all the details, as if he did the research, and nit pick the data and be the judge. That is what the community is here for. A research community. The post meets the rules. He is breaking the barrier as a mod. This is obvious. Why is this allowed. He has done this on Christ Church before. This might be the hottest and most famous case in pizzagate history and he squelches it. It does not say in the rules that he has the right to do that.

            I have been reading this sub daily for about a year. For several months I was a daily poster. I had to go back to work and stopped posting for a while and forgot my password. I recently joined again. I have seen you settle disputes before. I'm not sure what your role is. I know you are not a mod. But I have seen you settle disputes before. So, I pinged you too.

            Posts are to be judged by if they met the rules, not if dragonkiller is an asshole. You don't get to be the judge detective Falcon. The post met the rules. And its Christ Church. It is relevant. We know that because you didn't cite Rule 1 but its obviously relevant.

              Christ Church is so relevant that not even you can dispute it. Where does it say in the rules that you have the right to stop the research community from investigating new information. You don't know where it might lead and you already admit that you do not know. Why are you stopping people from investigating new information? Not your job. That is a direct question and I want you to answer it. I just checked the rules again and your name as lead investigator is not in the rules. You don't get to decide which dots can be researched and which ones cannot in a relevant subject when the post meets the rules.

              I did not post it. I just remember you censoring this topic in the past. I like this topic because its the best case pizzagate has, or so a lot of people think. You did not do the research, you just stopped others from doing it. Not your job. The post met the rules. Research is what we are here for. If the post meets the rules you are not allowed to stop people from trying to connect the dots on new information. That is our job. This is new data in a relevant case. OP wants it investigated. You are hindering.

            has deleted posts about this before. This post is obviously relevant and has met the specifications of the rules. Instead of letting the community discuss the details and decide what the interpretation of the data is Falcon has stepped in as judge and jury and interpreted the data for the whole community. This is not your job Falcon, this is what the community does. You have done this on Christ Church posts before.

            Rule 2:  How do we know that

             @AaronDover
            </a>
            is the actual Aaron Dover, not a disinfo shill?  (And we have reason to suspect this because the real Aaron Dover was apparently a flat-Earther.   Apparently there was considerable suspicion in the original thread posted on Voat that it was disinfo).  If we have no proof it's him, that's fine;  just be clear.  (From the date of the post being so close to the date of his death, it's hard to tell whether it was posted before Aaron Dover's death or after.)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Aaron's mother, Jenny Dover
            </p>

           <p>
            Rule 2. Needs source that this is his mother.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rule 3: It's no clear what the relevance of the rest of your post is.  A guy who worked at the school had worked for a marketing company, and somebody else who worked at same company had started some quirky businesses (which kind of makes sense because that company is apparently known for innovative marketing).
