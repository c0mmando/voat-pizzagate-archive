<p>The NYPD Suicide Cluster: Clinton Chicanery or Mental Health Crisis?  
</p>
<p>( i count 6 not 4  .. )</p>
<p>JUNE 27, 2019 MIKE ROTHSCHILL</p>
<p>This week, the cluster of suicides plaguing the NYPD added another name to its tragic ranks today, with news breaking of the suicide of an unnamed veteran officer who worked patrol in the Bronx.</p>
<p>This marks the fourth NYPD officer to die by their own hand in June. First there was 38 year NYPD veteran Deputy Chief Steven Silks of the Patrol Borough Queens North, who was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot on June 5th. The next day, the body of veteran Brooklyn Homicide Detective Joseph Calabrese was discovered in a grove of bushes near a beach, also dead by his own hand. Then on the 14th, a Staten Island patrolman, with six years of experience, killed himself behind his precinct.</p>
<p>The four suicides have been deemed a “mental health crisis” in the NYPD, shedding light on the high suicide rates of police officers around the country.</p>
<p>Sadly, they’ve also been latched onto by conspiracy theorists as part of both the QAnon conspiracy and the ever-expanding “Clinton Body Count” – the list of people supposedly killed by the Clintons over the last four decades.</p>',

            When it came to taking on the Catholic Church, survivors of clergy sexual abuse say that Kamala Harris turned a blind eye - refusing to take action against clergy members accused of sexually abusing children when it meant confronting one of the city’s most powerful political institutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kamala Harris Stopped Cooperation With San Francisco Church Sex victims...
           </p>
           <p>
            In the USA 2020 presidential election contest, the big money on the Democratic side is swinging toward Sen Kamala Harris, who is half-black (parental heritage split between Jamaica and India), and rather a female Obama type, speaking well but having full big corporation support
           </p>
           <p>
            Kamala Harris has a Jewish husband, Douglas Emhoff, and is 'committed to Israel and fighting anti-semitism'
           </p>
           <p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Just for the record Aangirfan. Tulsi Gabbard is a Satanic fraud. I know very little of the fake politicos state side. I gave up on politics years ago (when I got made redundant) lol.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, that said, her Il Cornuto salute in the helicopter tells me all I need to know about that abomination. In case you missed it - her il cornuto hand gesture is 100% Satanic. Therefore (yet again) the 'paid for opposition' and fake politics are at play.
           </p>
           <p>
            That one picture you have published speaks louder than a 1000 Tulsi haters and tells me all I need to know about her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like Corbyn in the UK - the long knives are out. Fabian Corbyn and his fake climate science and anti semitism framing his leadership. Indeed - all part of the fake politicking. She may sound all anti war or anti establishment and be under attack from the Israel lobby or the Patriots or whatever.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember this..........so was the Orange Zio Mong and look how he turned out. I ain't buying this utter tripe for one second. Look again at the picture. That hand gesture is enough for me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest anyone who isn't familiar with the Il cornuto gesture to Google it. I'll make it easy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google: Celebrity il cornuto and click images. Much easier then to see Tulsi in context with her Satanic mates. Lets not forget the strength of the image in it's own right.......
           </p>
           <p>
            Is she wearing a ball gown?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is she wearing pyjamas?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is she wearing a lab coat?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is she wearing a bikini?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is she wearing a business suit?
           </p>
           <p>
            No. She is wearing 'disruptive pattern material (dpm)' and is clearly sitting next to someone also doing the same hand gesture. She has all the essence of Djinn.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing about her makes sense. She is the Spinal Tap of politics and the new voice of reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't be fooled by this clown. A quick check on her images from her military service and I easily found her making the same Satanic hand gesture in about 6 other photos with an assortment of military types.
           </p>
           <p>
            Time and time again and the same old tripe playing out. Another political fraud playing the game, fooling the masses and laughing whilst doing so.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tulsi for President. Why not. She ticks all the boxes for the (not so bright) Americans to fall for ......again!
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Will it be Action Lady?
           </p>
           <p>
            Will it be one of those retarded Senate types?
           </p>

            It is LITERALLY just a means to discredit pizzagate etc itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            It adds nothing new except explicit partisanship "elect Republicans plz" among the most crucial demographic to fool (boomers with money who should be white nationalists).
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no strategic justification for launching a public awareness campaign about a military strategy, especially one where literally "Nothing can stop The Plan"
