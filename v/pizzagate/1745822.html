             Part 2: why it is not the Russians behind the pizzagate disinformation campaign:
            </p>
            <p>
             Russians would not use white nationalists
Russians would not call attention to a successful OP after the election.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            No 1.  Russians openly support nationalist parties all over the place.  It's their number 1 tool to achieve their number 1 goal: to weaken NATO so they can counter Russia's desire to rebuild their empire.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Russians were just barely hiding the operation as it happened.  They wanted us to know they had this capability in cyber warfare.   One of their generals gave a public speech previewing this in Feb 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Russians are not coming in at the back end of Pizzagate.  They were involved in the inception.

            I have to downvoat simply because I don't sense that anybody was hired.  I think you're off base on that one.  This seems to me to have been a simple case of going to war with the army you have, not the army you wish you had.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thank the organizers for their efforts and the attendees and speakers for their energy in making the event happen.  It was small and there are things to criticize about it, but dammit, stop shooting people for trying just because you have a different way you'd like to go.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have actual evidence of covert agendas, post that.  That some speakers expressed views you don't like -- or even downright goofy ideas -- is not evidence of anything except a loose approach to event coordination and the presence of some passionate  fringe persons in the movement (which, at this point, should surprise exactly nobody).

            I highly doubt they were hired!  I believe it was truly organic, typical of a low-budget effort with basically a couple organizers.  They obviously didn't want to be accused of directing the conversation, maybe a mistake, but it appears totally legitimate to me.  The subject is deep and wide, so many varying points of interest.  Maybe YOU should have gone if you see a need to make it a better effort.

            Should be leaderless movement. A vigil is needed with candles, not a march or rally. Have it every weekend in memory of the children.

             Yep. Silent like the Belgian white march. We should do simultaneous white marches all over. No talking just release balloons. Anything else and a repeat of today will happen.

              This isn't possible, but having balloons with a simple 'face', maybe just two 'x's for eyes,  and a larger red X for a 'silenced' mouth, each balloon represents the silenced dead children.

               Look at that. It can be done and this is how it should be done if we are to avoid shills co-opting it. No stage, no signs, no e-celebs, no talk. All white and balloon release, then go home. Like a flash mob. Maybe we can do it small scale and have flash mobs of white balloon releases happening all over. If they want to know what it is they can check online.

                That's an amazing turnout.  I would think we're going to need a lot of community outreach to Churches and other groups who are on board with protecting children, even a few key people with large FB or twitter followings would be of great help.  What we face right now is the push back and cover up from pedo protectors, high profile people who speak out face threats, loss of business, censorship and/or media black out.  I like the flash mob concept.

              Organizing and being a "leader" aren't entirely the same thing, but yes, coordination does not perform itself.  Any event does need one or more people to step forward and coordinate it.

            I think it looks like a great turn-out! This guys just not nice. He won't even listen to people tell their stories without mocking and talking over them or walking away. I can't finish the video because of the shitty narration but I'm looking forward to more videos from other attendees. Great job marchers! Very brave.

             It's not the time or place for that. We're looking for arrests and spouting off about Zionism will do nothing to acheive that. What it will do is cause certain Jewish high-profile celebs that are helping with PG to distance themselves from this place and all future events.

             Red-pilling people should be done carefully and with tact. This is a bi-partisan movement and to bring knowingly divisive subjects into it in public while being filmed is extremely retarded. Smarten up and stick to the mountain of facts we already have. Screaming about aliens, jews and angelic beings discredits us.

              There are no extraterrestrials.  There are very likely to be interdimensional beings. If you are telling the truth, it shouldn't matter all that much that people are not yet ready for it.
The nature of the universe is such that everything is connected.  Literally.   Every 'particle' contains enough information to hold the location and vector of every other particle in the universe.

              If more people find out about Zionism because of Pizzagate, how is that a bad thing?  Yeah, sure, there are people that hear Zionism and think "Oh god, an anti-semite" but that doesn't mean theirs is a legitimate viewpoint to hold.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have to take the long view. Even if there are no arrests (which SADLY looks increasingly likely) then the major headway from Pizzagate will come from getting people to take a more spiritual view, and that means opposing Satanism, which is closely tied to both Zionism and Kabbalah.  The abuse of children, horrific as it is, is just a piece of the puzzle, it is not the whole puzzle.  But it is important to address WHY they commit child abuse, and the reason first and foremost is of course blackmail (of the political variety) and extortion.  But that doesn't explain why some of the 'elite' do it so wholeheartedly and enthusiastically.  That can only be explained via the 'elite's occult belief system, and their sociopathy.

              Screaming about anything will do that.  But your essential point is valid.  The more divisive a topic is, the more it will tend to divide, so vigilance is needed to keep on subject.  Titus is correct about the Talmud, but yet, it is probably best to leave that out for a protest like this.  That's a subject better addressed in videos or other lengthier presentations, where there's time to explore and to present evidence.

            Someone's talking about Dennis Hastert right now. Seems legit to me. Don't denigrate people trying to do good. They're letting everyone speak. What are you doing to help besides criticizing?

            How can we get a million strong like they did in South Korea? How can we get people to understand that the money we use all indirectly helps their cause? Every single time you buy a product from a company that an elite pedo has their hands in, every single time you buy from big pharma, big meat, big whatever the fuck it is, you are fueling the illusion? It's difficult because so many fucking people work their asses off, 1 or 2 or 3 jobs just to make enough money to survive, on the other hand you have people doing basically useless labor making normal 50-60k+ salaries, these are the people who would never distrust their leaders, on the other hand the people who toil 1-2-3 jobs for ends meet are the ones who are religiously afraid, they are SO afraid of being destitute, SO afraid of having NOTHING. There needs to be a safety net for the poor that doubles as an awakening agent for the better off.

            The world is not right when the upper echelon is a bunch of fucking kid abusers/murderers/rapists. We need to completely destroy the whole system a la Fight Club and figure some shit out. That's one thing I didn't know about David Seaman until recently that he backed bitcoin, although I've heard that currency has been usurped too.

             Actually, no, money is one form of control, another form is RELIGION and RELIGIOUS, ENCODED BIGOTRY. Of course there's fucking discord when Jews, Muslims and Christians, all under the same FALSE BULLSHIT HOLY BOOKS, hate each other. But even MORE dangerous is the people PRETENDING to be religious. The PEDDLERS of religion, indeed, the "HOLY MEN" that you are meant to trust MOST OF ALL. They're the fucking ones abusing the power. They're the ones telling you to PRAY YOUR ILLS AWAY AND MEDITATE ALL DAY AND DO NOTHING BE IGNORANTLY HAPPY FOR ETERNITY AFTER YOU DIE YOU WILL LIVE AGAIN HAHAHA WE HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

             There are those who will try to tell you there is a bright side to every situation. Then there's the nihilists with no bright side at all. THE REAL WILL TELL YOU WHERE THE TRUE BRIGHT SIDE IS.

            Hmmm... there are essentially two groups at work today. One is comprised of folk who want justice for the innocents and are trying hard to make some small effort to further the cause by showing up. Perhaps they do not speak so eloquently, but their heart is in the right place. Their actions will neither make or break the case, but they will form bonds of unity just by meeting on common ground for a lone purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other is comprised of sniveling complainers whose mission it is to try to defile the first group.

Do you really believe that?
Do you rellly believe, that it takes rocket science, if you allow anyone on the stage, that nonsense will be spread?
Do you really want to tell us, that stupid speeches, divisive speeches cannot be avoided?
Do you really believe it's not possible to hold at least one decent speech that can be recorded and spread later?

              I hate to sound condescending, but any English major would tear apart your post and point out that it's riddled with errors in spelling, syntax, and grammar, so I'm not so sure you're qualified to be critiquing anyone's speech. My composition is perhaps acceptable, but I make no claim to be a writer, so I'm sure the same could be said for me, but to a much lesser extent.

              I have not listened to all of the videos of everyone who spoke today, but the few I did sounded sincere and perfectly acceptable under the circumstances for people not used to speaking in public, let alone on the most taboo subject known to man while in the very stomping ground of the enemy. Cut them some slack, and appreciate the effort. Better yet, grab a bullhorn, go to work broadcasting PG, and post some clips so the rest of us can learn how to do it.

            I don't think bringing religion into this is helping one bit.  It should just be about raising awareness on the alarming number of children that have gone missing all over the world.  I don't even think they should be mentioning podesta,  alefantis,  Hillary or anyone.  They should first grab people's attention about the missing children.... that's just my opinion though.  When I try to get people to follow any of this I have learned that bringing up anything having to do with those names I am instantly shut out.  So now I just talk to people about the number of missing children that no one is looking for.  I have been somewhat successful with that approach.  But that's just my opinion on this whole waking people up thing....

               My impression, too (I have written a comment below, why this looked to me like a fake demo).

               I ask you, because I noticed one thing and wanted to ask you, if that impression I had on the web was correct:
The speakers were all solo people. No friends, no family came with them. Seaman knows a lot of poeple in DC and brought nobody with him, correct?

            Eh, I guess it is what you can expect, without full sound evidence those who have parts that detract from credibility are what dominate and therefore detract.  Even here on voat, I here stuff added in to the concern and shake my head. This is about kids being abused, when you add in other stuff, it serves to discredit and pushes away those engaging in critical thinking.

            I watched the speeches and I have to agree, that it was very badly organized. I didn't hear Seaman's speech in full, because the one who streamed it, was suddenly surrounded by others who were brabbling, after Seaman had criticized him.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I must say, I did not hear not ONE SINGLE DECENT SPEECH!
Not one speech, that would have summarized something!
Not one speech that would have tried to reach the ones not in the know!
Not one speech that reached out to politicians!
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead totally counterproductive idiotic and DIVISIVE speeches, and that everything was under control by the pedo-circles anyway. WTF are you doing there, if everything is moot anyway!?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seaman even begun his speech with his personal agenda, that he was attacked, has a book ou tof print, and so on. A journalist who knows extremely well how to create awareness and reach a wide audience...
           </p>
           <p>
            Seaman had claimed before the event, there were "political celebrities" speaking. Did I miss someone or was this another broken promise?
           </p>
           <p>
            Three dozen people in times of social media? What were they organizing for 30 days?
And another very strange thing:
Seaman and all the organizers I saw: they were alone. Seaman does not have friends or colleagues? The organizers have no family and friends?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seaman, Titus Frost, Honeybee. All either totally incompetent or not incompetent at all...

              I watched the speeches and I have to agree, that it was very badly organized. I didn't hear Seaman's speech in full, because the one who streamed it, was suddenly surrounded by others who were brabbling, after Seaman had criticized him.

             The woman who was a key organizer spoke later and I was impressed with her speech.  For an amateur it was strong and it was much of what you are claiming, here, was absent.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do agree -- belatedly; I didn't initially feel this -- that Seaman is cancer.  However, having been involved with grassroots event coordination myself in the past, I know it's sometimes tricky balancing conflicting concerns.  When you've got veto power over the inclusion of certain parties, everybody is watching you to see if you'll use that power the way they would.  Seaman is a polarizing figure; including him will alienate some, while excluding him will alienate others.  I'm not going to condemn the organizers for their choice on that, because I know it's a lose-lose situation.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not sure what y'all's issue is with Honeybee.  Maybe I need to watch her speech again, but I didn't notice anything terrible.  Titus was good aside from bringing up the Talmud and Zionism, but that's the kind of thing you get when amateurs do impromptu speaking.
            </p>
            <p>
             It could have been more tightly coordinated, and certain aspects should probably have been handled differently, but it seemed like a sincere amateur effort to me (what I saw of it, anyway, which was about an hour's worth).  The matter of whether it's worth the effort and cost is a legitimate question, but I don't agree with the slamming of the organizers or the suggestion that they're insincere.

            Parts have been stupid drama, but there have also been good points raised (ie. the Pizzagate5 lady was ok). Was also good to see people immediately call down the JOO crap as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also way too much religious hokey stuff being chucked into the mix. We need more signs at future protests calling out that pizzagate is bipartisan to counter the inevitable MSM crap promoting that this is right-wing.

            As I suspected and feared. I was going to film a mini-documentary it for Aceloewgold.com but feared this would happen, and that I would have to cherry pick bits of footage just to present it in a way (dishonestly) that wouldn't turn skeptics right the hell off of even considering PG. Then again I would have kicked myself very hard if the march went well and I didn't get my footage!

             Yup they have done a good job of making that seem completely unbelievable though... at least to the average citizen.

             "Parsons was Winston's fellow employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralyzing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms---one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the Sports Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, saving campaigns, quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Center every evening for the past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat , a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone." - 1984

            Sadly I have to agree. In the half hour I was watching the stream, I heard about fallen angels, Zionist Jews, Nazis, Trump, and Michael Jackson. This is doing more harm than good, whether it's the product of paid disinformation or just plain ignorance. The open mic in particular is a very bad idea.

              This is too deep for most people but the Nazi's &amp; are from the fallen angels and are the Zionists who in fact are as it warns in scripture " do not be deceived by the Jew who is not a Jew" referring not to religion but to lineage or genectics. In 2013 it was proven for the first time ever that the Ashekenazi Jews from the khazar region who would migrate and become the banking elite families &amp; royalty (13 illuminati) were in fact not Jews at all but had distorted and lied and taken power attempting to exterminate any genetic link to Jewish people through Hitler and create a superior race-this is referred to as Aryans of course but it is not what it appeared. It is not race but bloodline or genetic cleansing of Jewish genealogy.

              Excuse me I have had a page set up for the VICTIMS of MJ now for over four years. On that page we discuss both the Michael Jackson case as well as other high profile cases of child exploitation.  If you actually listened what I was discussing is the topic of cognitive dissonance and how it is hard for the general public to understand that even people who are philanthropic to children's causes can also be child abusers. I came a long way discuss my experiences trying to educate the public on this cause. I have also posted several times on Voat discussing this topic and even posted an interview I did with Ed Opperman about this topic. So before you attack me get your facts straight.

               I never attacked you and never even saw your posts, so stay in your lane.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you've ever read the documents of the TWO cases (let's be honest, the other civil lawsuits postmortem are money grabs), you'd see how fraudulent they are. Sneddon was literally creating evidence in front of the Grand Jury, which is on the transcript of the Grand Jury Trial for 2003-2005.
              </p>
              <p>
               You'd know about Evan Chandler drugging his son with Sodium Amytal once his ex-wife and kids started hanging around Michael more than him, and when Michael finally stopped the money train and wouldn't fund an expansion of his house. Evan committed suicide because he's a pathetic dentist who couldn't make it big in Hollywood beyond writing Men in Tights. Jordan didn't even want to be around him.
              </p>
              <p>
               And the Arvizos were a joke from the start. The mother had been scamming celebrities for years prior to Michael and researched the prior case to coach her kids. She even reached out to the first civil lawyer the Chandlers used because that's all she cared about, and she didn't want it going to court. Do I also have to remind you that now Gavin carries Michael Jackson's last name? Yes, it's after his step dad but if you were brutally raped and molested DURING YOUR CANCER, how the hell would you carry that same persons last name?
              </p>
              <p>
               Fuck right off and do your research.

               <p>
                First of all let's go over a couple of points first you claimed that my comments somehow show that the protest was all about  disinformation. The reality is is that I have been supporting the accusers of Michael Jackson for 4 years. The reason why I believe it is so important is because that case shows even when there is mountains of information that points to Michael Jackson being a child predator anyone who dares to question his motives around children are  either verbally attacks harassed or told to be quiet. I went to this protest because I felt that the Michael Jackson case parallels what is going on with PedoGate.  Michael Jackson was a very wealthy, influential and famous individual who used all those aspects of his life to sexually exploit children. As we speak there are PR firms that makes sure any negative information that relates to his  past allegations are white washed, that is exactly what the mainstream media is doing when covering the topic of elite child exploitation. Anyone who dares to come forward and show support for those who may be in some of the worst conditions imaginable are told to be quiet and are mocked harassed and ridiculed.  So next let's get to your claims you made starting with the Arvizo family. First of all if you actually did your research you would realize that Gavin did not change his last name to Jackson his mother did. The reality is is that a name did not rape Gavin but a man did. If you actually did the research you would have realized Gavin recently got married and his last name is Arvizo. Also this idea that Tom Mesereau made about the Arvizo's being grifters and out for money.....history has proven him WRONG AGAIN. Before the case started Janet Arvizo stated she did not want the devil's money after the case she stated the same. If Janet was this amoral psychopath that was willing to use her children for a payday she would of got her payday. Made no difference if she lost the criminal trial.  The burden of proof in a civil trial is much lower and anyone with half a brain could see MJ barely got through the criminal trial.  If there was a civil trial all the information that was barred would be fair game, more than likely a settlement would of been reached, However if the Arvizos dud not want to go through another court case it would have been easy to parlay their situation into a money making giant. Exclusive Interviews, Book Deals, International Press Junkets, etc To this day Gavin has six figure offers to give exclusive interviews, he refused. However Gavin will be telling his story during Wade's trial, for free. Next let's get to the claim that you made about the Chandler case in which you stated Evan Chandler who was a dentist gave his son (Jordan) sodium amytal  to sedate him. I am assuming  you are bringing this up because you believe that this drug was used to place false memories in Jordan's mind. First of all sodium amytal can be used to make people more susceptible to placing information but in no way can it have the results of having a 13 yr old child give a detailed, repeatedly consistent delineation of his abuse to both law enforcement,  social workers, therapists and detectives. Sorry Sodium amytal is not a magic drug. However Jordan was never sedated with that drug but by a run of the mill sedative that was used in the dental practice. Jordan's own uncle laughed at that claim, sorry it is bogus. Next let's look at the hard facts of the case Jordan accurately described the underside of MJ'S genitals. My sources are DA Tom Sneddon, lead investigator Bill Dworin,  Dr Strick who was in the room when the pictures were taken and the most surprising source Michael Jackson's own defense attorney Carl Douglas who when they got the pictures and description back said it was the 300 lb gorilla in the room and they knew that they had to silence the child. Look it up on YouTube it is a video entitled Frozen in Time.  Shortly after hmmm a 20 million dollar settlement was given. Next let's look at your claim that all the other accusers are just looking for a money grab. Do you know Wade Robson?  I do. He is a talented and at the time in demand choreographer. He went through two nervous breakdowns. He recently had a child and coming forward at that time was a risk. He knew it would be career suicide but he needed to tell his story. If you don't think his lawyers told him how much of a long shot case this is, you know nothing. However he decided to come forward and file a civil claim. He knew that by him coming forward it may destroy his career and he had a family to think of. Next James Safechuck is a successful computer engineer. He has a wife and children. He also suffers from PTSD which is a result from his abuse by MJ. He heard Wade come forward and decided he was not going to live in fear anymore. He again understands the difficulties of his civil claim but wants to be heard in a court of law. Next let's take the newest accuser who is now a grown woman. When she was twelve she was raped by Michael Jackson.  She has both disturbing letters and cancelled checks in the sum of 920,000. The largest check came in 1993 during the Chandler allegations, that check was for $600,000. If you did your research you would know that back than MJ hired private investigator thug Anthony Pelicano who went around to all possible complainants and either bought them off or used threats and intimidation. If you did the research you would also know that Pelicano did a jail house interview in which he is quoted as saying "MJ did a lot worse things than just molesting boys" If you also did your research you have realized that one of Michael Jackson's most staunch supporters Aphrodite Jones in a interview with Blog Talk Radio stated that after hearing the testimony of June Chandler that she felt it was unnerving and felt that MJ was in love with that boy. So I hope that helps, it is called real research you may want to try it sometime.

                 LMFAO. In what universe did Jordan describe Michael's penis accurately? He said it was circumcised and he got the spots wrong (one could argue Michael's vitiligo was actively progressing due to his head burn and his use of bleaching creams once he passed the 50% line SO ill give you the spots claim), soooo???
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, Wade was going into debt when all this shit happened, he was not in demand by any means and you are insane if you believe that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do know about Pelicano's claims and it's not a quote I like, so fair point. Michael also didn't pay people because he didn't think he had to (see Shana Mangatal's quotes over the last few days about paintings he didn't pay for etc), so it's possible Pelicano just didn't get paid and is salty. We don't have evidence that the quote means he was part of some Satanic boy buttfuck ritual.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I know who Aphrodite is, and I have her book. You do realize June Chandler was being intimidated by her exhusband, saying he'd keep Jordan away from her for good unless she complied? Of course testimony would match up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, must I redirect you to the (unfortunately removed from their site since 2009ish) GQ article from 1994 in regards to Sodium Amytal. Even in 94 they knew it was a drug that suggested memories and did not cause truths to come out. Many therapists have been sued by fathers of women who came out claiming their fathers abused them based on suggestive thoughts with this drug. I have no idea where you are getting that he was just on basic sedation and would honestly love proof if you have it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't want to defend Michael if he's guilty and I started in 2005 thinking he was, but I've been researching this since then, and have never found a lick of evidence against him.

                  Again more flawed research. The idea that Jordan described MJ as being circumcised came from a book called MJ was my lover written by Victor Guiterez. The description in that book was unverified and unsubstantiated.  So if you believe what is in the book. You must agree many of his other outrageous of claims of MJ having circle jerk and how he was in love with Jordan. This all came out of that same book which I never reference but if you want to embrace that book, go ahead. Next use common logic. MJ had one of the best defense attorneys on the planet in 1993, Johny Cochran.  So you are saying the same attorney that got OJ off was so incompetent that he empirical proof that the accuser's description was totally inaccurate which would of proved without a doubt that he was lying and never saw MJ naked but instead of using that indisputable information, Johny Cochran decided to advise a settlement of 20 million dollars, seriously. Again there is ZERO proof he used sodium amytal another myth and again that drug does not have magical powers. Jordan was interviewed by some of the best detectives on child sexual abuse. He was even interviewed by a psychiatrist who specialized in coached and fraudulent claims and he said Jordan's testimony was credible. As for the proof of the basic sedation that came from Evan Chandler's associate who was there when it happened and also comes from the mouth of Evan's brother Raymond who when interviewed essentially laughed at the concept of a magical truth serum that allowed Jordan to give long, detailed consistent, testimony that men/ women from all fields of expertise agree was credible.Next as for Wade's so called debt. Do have his bank statements. Do you realize that he hired one of the most expensive entertainment attorneys in LA county. He has now changed law firms and make no mistake his former attorneys did not work for free, especially when he changed law firms. Do you realize that Wade wrote popular songs for NSync and was a choreographer for some popular movies. He also now lives in one of the most expensive parts of the country, Maui. He also had accumulated a great deal of savings from his highly successful career and like most people had investments. So stop speaking about what you don't know. As for your link of evidence. That is laughable. There is plenty of evidence but because it is Michael Jackson you raise the bar to the height of MT Everest. Seven accusers, three cash payouts, one child accurately describing the underside of MJ'S genitals. Again I gave you references including his own attorney Carl Douglas. MJ sharing a bed with a child for 100s of nights.If you read the 2005 court transcripts you would realize that one of MJ'S "special friends" sister testified that MJ shared a bed with her brother over 300 nights, again she was a defense witness. In 1993 again read the court documents they found a Polaroid type picture of a naked boy they believed to be another special friend J. Spence. They also found in a locked filing cabinet two books which were edited by pedophiles. One book was called Boys will be boys and had an inscription by MJ himself praising the book. Again these semi nude and nude pictures in these books were hand picked by pedophiles and the book was highly rated by boy lover groups. MJ also wrote disturbing letters to a twelve year old stating things like "I love you so much" I am getting even more crazy about you" again this letter was to a twelve yr old. He also wrote checks to her for $920,000 MJ also defended the fact that unrelated children should be sharing beds with 30, 40 yr old men. MJ also would also ignore children when they reached puberty. This was even mentioned by Sean Lennon. Again most people living in the teal world would be convicted with one quarter of this information. This is exactly what the pedogate movement is about. Waking people up to what is right in front of them.
