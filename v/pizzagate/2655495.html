<p>&quot;this place and hwood ruined me man. it really has. the reason i never liked posting on pol or visiting much was because i would always start raging then crying. crying because when i see that spammer who posts that all those links about ritual abuse and satanism i know its real. i\'ve been around these people.. all these celebrities, news anchors, journalists, billionaires, bankers, CEOs, politicians who put a smile on TV then turn around to partake in the worst, evil degeneracy possible. it hurts so fucking much man. im in tears right now. it hurts so much that DC, LA, and NEW YORK are the soddom and gamorrah and run the USA. it hurts so much watching all the people who come in to the business with bright eyes, lovely huge smiles, great spirits then leave either corrupted or broken,dead shells of themselves. i\'ve seen so many kids (and it hurts because i\'m a father and grandfather) come into this business and be tossed around like a piece of meat for these hyenas. i\'ve seen so many people off themselves because they couldn\'t take it. they couldn\'t take partaking and seeing so much evil. imagine how much you have to do/see that you off yourself even though you seem to be living a great life? i know that the people in a power positions have to be somewhat corrupted but fuck man WHEN IS ENOUGH ENOUGH? you know what i mean fellas? i am spiritually dead inside. i don\'t even know why im alive. so much evil going on in this world and i know it\'s always happened and humanity has flaws but still dudes.. maybe this life is really hell.... or purgatory at least.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;the gay/jewish mafia of hollywood uses local california mexican mafia cells for low-level wetwork (getting rid of prostitutes).. HUERO BUFF did not die from alcohol poisoning</p>
<p>huero buff got whacked because in prison a brother showed him the protocols of elder zion, mein kampf, 200 years together and other related works and HUERO BUFF became woke. huero buff was the original link between the VAN NESS ST HWOOD OPERATORS and the LA EME. huero buff went against the grain and was dusted for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;the black-mexican war did not happen because of &quot;muh racism&quot; or &quot;muh drugs&quot;.</p>
<p>mexican and black brothers in jail were getting woke on the JQ and started to spread truth literature among other gangsters in the late 60 early 70s... the jews realized just how woke my people were becoming and started to fuck with our neighborhoods. the original upper echelon of the gangs started to get dusted in the 70s after they corrupted our youth. since then its gone down hill.</p>
<p>the plan started in the 60s after the CIA started working with berkley(and other universities) sociology, psychology, and other professors in order to bring down the black and brown community to keep the country divided among racial and cultural lines to the point of hatred.</p>
<p>the plan was to destabilize us so we wouldn\'t deviate from political thought control. Arthur Jensen, , Donald T. Campbell and others (alive and dead) contributed to this.</p>
<p>FUCKING ANTHROPOLOGISTS AND MUSIC HISTORY TEACHERS WORKED WITH RECORD COMPANIES/HOLLYWOOD AND CIA TO FOCUS BLACK MUSIC ON VICE AND VIOLENCE.. NO BULL SHIT!!!!! WHY DO YOU THINK IN THE 60S AND 70S BLAXPOTATION FILMS POPPED UP!!! GANGSTER MUSIC!! FUCK!l!&gt;!!?!?</p>
<p>why the fuck do we worship fucking professors? they are the ministers of propaganda in this evil machine &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;back in the 80s the ports (especially benicia) were used to bring in 3rd worlders.. the original cover was human smuggling. benicia was a pedo paradise. after they got em off in the ports a vehicle would pick up illegals (kids and adults smuggled to service the local elite aka hwood) and smuggle em into benicia or into SF or the LA ports and drive them as far as Las Vegas.. after that they be coerced into silence or dusted.. the kids would usually stay quiet while the adults would get dusted. Dr Orourke who died in 2012 was the doctor who would bring in shady doctors to do contract work. please look into him&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lucio Fulci was a connoisseur of real snuff films made by foreigners and americans. he along with other evil buddies would pay up to 100 big ones for snuff films to manuel noriega and other... noriega would use his death squads to make the films which were then smuggled into the USA for them. funny how the DoJ never brought charges against him for that... THIS IS ONE OF HWOOD BIGGEST SECRETS!!! FUCKING DIRECTORS (LUCIO WAS JUST THE FRONTMAN) PAYING FOR THIS SHIT!!!!!!!!!! SNUFF AND CP!!! FUCK ALL DIRECTORS!!!!!!!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;thomas bradley was propped up by the hwood elites so he could be mayor. he was being paid close to a 500 big ones back in the day to allow the hwood mafia to operate more freely.. hwood mafia would smuggle in adults and kids for evil shit through LA using the ports. san diego border point to a lesser extent. Tom Bradley was molded by this guy, damn i cant remember his name but he was a proffesor in UCLA in the 30s and 40s....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;officials are paid off at the ports to not inspect certain containers of the hwood elite... in the LA ports ship containers are used to hold rape/torture/kill dungeons that are then shipped to SEA/SA to be disposed of. chinese use to do this but ever since theire economic boom they want to take over Hwood and stopped being the stooges. american companies are contracted to bring them back to SEA/SA while SEA/SA companies are used to bring them into the USA. they are breaking regulations EVERY FUCKING DAY but they aren\'t touched.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Snctm IN HWOOD IS USED AS A FRONT FOR KIDDY DIDDLNG AND WORLDWIDE HUMAN SMUGGLING!!</p>

            "In Nuevo Laredo, Mama Lupita [Guadalupe Carmona] has earned the respect of the locals, including the drug cartels so there is somewhat a hedge of protection that surrounds the orphanage."

            There are no doubt other churches that host mission trips to this orphanage.

            If there are any german names that pop up I would gladly research the german end of pizzagate. Until now i haven’t read anything about german involvement, surely because most here don’t speak german.

            90lbs Of Cocaine Found On Ship Owned By Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's Father-in-Law - The Chao Family
           </p>
           <p>
            Though Foremost has played a pivotal role in McConnell’s life, bestowing the senator with most of his personal wealth and generating thousands in donations to his campaign committees, the drug bust went unnoticed in Kentucky, where every bit of McConnell-related news has generated fodder for the campaign trail. That’s because, like many international shipping companies, Chao’s firm is shrouded from public view, concealing its identity and limiting its legal liability through an array of tax shelters and foreign registrations. Registered through a limited liability company in the Marshall Islands, the Ping May flies the Liberian flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before the Ping May, a rusty cargo vessel, could disembark from the port of Santa Marta en route to the Netherlands in late August, Colombian inspectors boarded the boat and made a discovery. Hidden in the ship’s chain locker, amidst its load of coal bound for Europe, were approximately 40 kilograms, or about 90 pounds, of cocaine. A Colombian Coast Guard official told The Nation that there is an ongoing investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have posted this before and I don't know if these ships are involved in trafficking these children and adults Renegade speaks of, but what connections!  Ships traveling all over the world and found caught up in drug trafficking.  There are other ships as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chao's daughter is Elaine Chao who was the 24th United States Secretary of Labor in the Cabinet of President George W. Bush (2001–2009), the first Asian Pacific American woman ever appointed by a President to the Cabinet in American history. She is the 18th United States Secretary of Transportation in the Cabinet of President Donald J. Trump (2017–). She is married to the current Majority Leader of the United States Senate, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

              Good, Kappy was acting like he was Renegade on twitter, pretty suspicious of Kappy. Specifically Kappy tweeted about being banned from 4chan around the same time renegade was banned or something like that is why I thought Kappy might be Renegade.

            I think the Renegade drops contain some valuable information. I worry about his safety as I don't think he has been back since he released this all a couple of weeks ago. It is my opinion he is legit and is much more of a top level insider than Isaac Kappy is. Now that I think about it...Kappy came out around the same time as Renegade. Everyone is following and hanging on to Kappy and nobody seems to be talking about renegade anymore. Maybe Kappy came on the scene to distract people from the real Hollywood insider....hmmm.

             People are still talking about SNCTM, which is what Renegade wanted people to talk about. Maybe Renegade and Kappy were both inspired to come out by the same thing, which was the Gunn/Black/Oswalt/Harmon social media posts. If Renegade was still posting, people would definitely still be talking about him.

              There was much more dropped than just SNCTM, look at all those posts. For one, he was asked, what person should /pol look into that they haven't? He answered Sumner Redstone, Tim Burke and Yoram Globus. Haven't seen any threads on those people. Are our attention spans so short that since he hasn't posted for awhile, we should just move on?
             </p>
             <p>
              I watched a couple Kappy videos, until I realized he isn't saying anything new other than the Seth Green stuff. Maybe he is interesting to the newly awakened but for the people who have been following this for almost two years now, we have discussed most of his info already.
             </p>
             <p>
              Renegade has brought up things beyond SNCTM that I have never heard of before.

               I agree with you here. We already know most of what Isaac Kappy says because apparently most of what he knows comes from here or 4chan. So much information came out that weekend that we're still processing it, and we shouldn't let these leads slip by. I have been suspicious of Sumner Redstone for years, since reading an article (can't find it now) in which he said that the conspiracy theory [truth] movement needed to be infiltrated and subverted.

                That's interesting, hopefully you can find that article. I started looking more into Ronan Farrow, because of his newest story about Les Moonves, when I read that Shari Redstone was in a legal battle with Moonves for control of CBS, I remembered the Redstone name from the renegade drop. Which then put me down the whole metoo rabbit hole.
               </p>
               <p>
                I do know parts of the Redstone family are fighting with each other right now. I am going to start trying to dig some more into them too.

                 The article I read was in a physical newspaper, and I read it probably around 10 years ago, but it stuck in my mind. It may not be on the internet anywhere. Digging on him and the others mentioned by Renegade is definitely a good idea.
