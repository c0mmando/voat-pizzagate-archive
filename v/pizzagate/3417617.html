<p>Dimitrios Negrepontis was descended from an expatriate Greek family and grew up in Lausanne, Switzerland, and attended boarding school in Klosters, Switzerland, where he learned to ski. Negrepontis used his family money to become a Greek shipping magnate, and in 1939 would marry Catherine Coumantaros, described as one of the most beautiful women in Greece. She had been born in New York, although her family returned to Greece when she was three. His shipping business would bring him to New York where they lived in Manhattan. </p>

<p>..Basil Mossaides, the Executive Director of the Order of AHEPA, said the Order is always looking forward and is excited about 2014, but he also focused on Greece and Cyprus</p>
<p>“In 2013 we sent four medical containers to Greece with a value of close to $3.7 million and an additional $350,000 in food to feed the hungry. Through the APOSTOLI/Mission program of the Church of Greece, AHEPA has fed over 10,000 underprivileged people in 2013. We are always trying to assist our friends and families back in Greece.”</p>
<p>..The HMS is also helping with general aid, for example, through the One Laptop Per Child project of Greek-American Nicholas Negroponte, founder of the MIT Media Laboratory, they sent 100 computers to the Kalamata region. </p>

<p>The selection of Negroponte for the new post of national intelligence director has focused renewed attention on the question of how much he knew about the Honduran military\'s involvement in nearly 200 unsolved kidnappings during the 1980s, and what he did about it. The subject has dogged him in the past, and Democratic staff members said it is likely to be revisited when the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence holds nomination hearings, tentatively scheduled for April 12. </p>

            The selection of Negroponte for the new post of national intelligence director has focused renewed attention on the question of how much he knew about the Honduran military's involvement in nearly 200 unsolved kidnappings during the 1980s, and what he did about it. The subject has dogged him in the past, and Democratic staff members said it is likely to be revisited when the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence holds nomination hearings, tentatively scheduled for April 12.

                No, but I have to say that mimics my online activity a bit. Should I get an alt? What would be the end result/purpose? What is a png? I will get you turd Vin. Much Love.

                 A png is an image file. You replied to my reply to him as if you'd received a notification for it, so I was wondering if you controlled that account. I try to keep track of such things; generally (but not always) those who run multiple accounts are up to mischief of one sort or another. :-)

                  OK. I am not technical with computers. The guy who kind of taught me too turn on one did write code for Berkely in the day/60's, by happenstance. He said "we made/set up computers for dummies". Thanks for bringing up fairly recent memories, and reminding me how the world passed me by. This should be on Pizzagate whatever, but I really see no difference now between politics, finance, other, and Pizzagate, so here;
