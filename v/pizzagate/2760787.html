<li><strong>Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi:</strong> The so-called \'Hillside Stranglers\', Angelo Buono and his cousin Kenneth Bianchi were serial killer partners alleged to have abducted, raped and murdered 12 girls and women between October 1977 and February 1978.  As with Henry Lee Lucas, both Buono and Bianchi were born to prostitute mothers.  Like Lucas, Buono recalled his mother plying her trade his presence.  At age 3, Buono\'s mother took him to a hospital due to repeated bed wetting incidents and his inability to sleep.  A quote from the doctor afterwards was, &quot;Mother needs help.&quot;  Similarly, at age 9, Bianchi was made to wear sanitary napkins due to involuntary urination.  Prior to that, at age 5, his mother consulted a doctor because he lapsed into trances of daydreaming with his eyes rolling back in his head and his inattentiveness (which is to say he had a tendency to dissociate).  He was quick to anger and temper tantrums.  It should be noted that, while Bianchi was diagnosed with petit mal syndrome, these characteristics, the inability to sleep/night terrors, acting out/temper tantrums, poor bladder control and a tendency to dissociate are all signs of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse (Bianchi did recall that as a child, he endured such punishments as having his hand held over a stove flame) .</li>
</ul>
<p>After a brief marriage lasting only 8 months and a spell in junior college studying psychology and police science (like John Gacy and Ted Bundy, Kenneth Bianchi had apparently considered a career in law enforcement), Bianchi relocated to Hollywood and moved in with his cousin, Angelo Buono and Buono\'s son, Angelo Jr..  At some point prior to that, Bianchi had joined a biker gang, which was ostensibly the inspiration for his \'Satan\'s Own M.C.\' tattoo (Manchurian Candidate?).  After arriving in Hollywood, Bianchi readily established access to a steady supply of drugs, which he both sold and used.  He also regularly visited a hospital for what he claimed was outpatient treatment for cancer.  He never had cancer, however and the exact nature of the \'treatment\' he was receiving at this medical facility remains unknown (was that the source of his drug supply?).</p>
<p>Bianchi\'s cousin and reputed partner in crime, Angelo Buono, strangely never lived more than a couple of miles away from his mother throughout his adult life.  He left school at 16 and was remanded to the custody of the California Youth Authority shortly thereafter.  By age 20, he was known for his flamboyance, exemplified by his habit of driving new Cadillacs.  It is unknown how he suddenly acquired such wealth.  Buono apparently had a lifelong penchant for underage girls; he married at least 2 of them.  He sired at least 8 children by his numerous wives and he reportedly regularly sodomised all of them.  He also beat and sodomised his wives, frequently in front of the children.  In spite of this, Buono has been described as a, &quot;magnet for women&quot; and had a constant stream of teenage girls through his home.  Many of them worked him at his auto upholstery shop, which served as a front for an underage prostitution ring.  These girls were kept virtually enslaved with regular beatings, rapes and threats of death and dismemberment (legitimate business serving as a front for child sexual abuse sound familiar?).</p>
<p>Angelo supplied the services of these young girls to the city\'s business and political elite, including a city councilman, a police chief and a chief aide to a member of the L.A. County Board of Supervisors.  Such favours had earned sidekick Bianchi the right to display a L.A. County Seal on the windshield of his Cadillac.  Buono and Bianchi had connections to the Hollywood crowd as well.  Buono had once shared a home with actor Artie Ford, a friend of fellow actor Jay Silverheels (Tonto from <em>The Lone Ranger)</em>.  He also repaired cars for Frank Sinatra and mob boss Joe Bonnano.  Buono\'s daughter claimed that her father once drove her to Frank Sinatra\'s Palm Springs home where he dropped off a package.  What was in that package?  Given that Sinatra was well known as a bag man for the mob, the first answer that comes to mind is drugs (indeed, from the Hand of Death to the Franklin Scandal, drug and child trafficking seem to go hand in hand), but it is also possible it contained CP, given the nature of Buono\'s business.  He was known to be an avid photographer and his Polaroid camera was said to have been used to photograph some of the pair\'s victims, though these photographs were never produced at trial, strangely, considering how damning they would have been.</p>
<p>While it is likely the cousins were involved in the killings, it is just as likely that others were involved as well.  Several of the suspect identified during the course of the investigation were connected to Hollywood.  The first suspect was actor Ned York, who gave a long and rambling confession to the crimes.  Another man questioned in connection with the murders was identified as a minor actor who had a film studio set up in his home.  An aspiring actress told of going to this home for an audition and being forced to participate in the production of hardcore S&amp;M films.  Another suspect was identified only as a famous Hollywood producer who was said to enjoy the company of young girls.  He was stopped by police whilst driving the car of a convicted rapist, accompanied by a young girl, and was found to be in possession of a fake police I.D..  It is also telling that one of the \'experts\' consulted by the press on the killings was one Dr. Louis Joylon West, a prominent member of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (long time visitors to this subverse will know all too well of the sterling work they have done protecting child rapists), who told the L.A. Times, &quot;It would be most unlikely to find this was done by more than one person...this type is almost always the work of a single person.&quot;  The classic \'angry lone nut\' scenario being fed to the public!  It is my considered opinion that, like Corll and Gacy, Buono and Bianchi were procurers of children to be pimped out to elite paedophiles among the political, business and legal class of L.A., as well as the dregs of Paedowood and, like Corll and Gacy, they (and others) disposed of girls no longer of use to the ring, as well as troublesome witnesses.</p>

            I HIGHLY recommend the documentary Cropsey (2009) many jailed serial killers, cult leaders, rapists or abductors have documentary, there is the main narrative, but many refer to a unsubstantiated story of devil cults and  underground networks of tunnels for trafficking. Crospey has a good section about this other version of events, and has an interview with someone who knows, but can't say. Thats all i see now, like david icke, he never meant reptilain people, he meant people so inhumane they lacked humanitty and were as cold as lizards. leanr their comms so to speak

             That is what Princess Diana most likely meant when she called the British Royal Family lizards; that they were cold blooded psychopaths.  And the thing about needing an infusion of human blood every few generations obviously meant staving off the symptoms of inbreeding (the 'Hapsburg Jaw' and whatnot).

            I believe that some of the serial murders/cases were actually committed by others as a cover up.  LE is happy to comply in many areas across the country.

             Case in point: Police were happy enough to let Richard Ramirez take the fall for all of the purported 'Night Stalker' attacks, even though evidence showed that he had at least 1 accomplice and one of the murders appeared to have been mob related.
