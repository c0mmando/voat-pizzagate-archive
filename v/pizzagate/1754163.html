            Call Alex jones what you want...but he is one of the few alternative media giants even talking about pedogate. Maybe no longer about pizzagate but do you see drudge or breitbart talking about Laura Silsby like the jones show did yesterday?
           </p>
           <p>
            His apology certainly made me lose respect for him. But I credit jones for waking me up to government corruption about a decade ago. So you guys can attack his every move, and act like you, without any proof know for certain he is a shill, but there are lots of people who are waking up still because of Infowars. So he deserves a little, even if just a tiny bit, of respect.

             Not a single good word from those attacking him about these videos should make you think twice!

             Interestingly those attacking him are pushing absurd stories:
Pay attention how they work:
Here's an extreme example where GeorgeT overplayed his hand:
GeorgeT suggesting credibility to a totally fact free and nonsensical discussion:

            AJ, Seaman ECT. are distractions. Just to do exactly what's happens. Clogging up the threads and all there bs. That's why I try to avoid all these posts. I think the majority of us have figured out exactly what there game is. Really the Clinton Foundation seems the biggest key to bringing to all this down. I try not to get to involved with commenting on these threads, because they're much more experienced investigators, cyber forensics than me. But I'm trying to do my part through other ways about spreading the msg. Just want to say thank you to all the people working through distractions and literally ending friendships to keep up the pressure on these twisted events. It's tough sometimes when you try to hold and intelligent conversation with some if the smartest people you know about this to only be dismissed as some conspiracy nut. This I really can't tolerate anymore, some people will stay ignorant to this because it's not directly affecting their lives. On that point these people are totally wrong because it's so widespread that this is affecting the whole world. Between all the msm cover up it's looking like we the people are going to be the ones to blow this wide open. So to everyone stay the course. We can see we got them scrambling and scared. Keep putting on the pressure it has crack at some point. There been some positive strides forward the last couple weeks. Again thank you to everyone putting in all the time and effort. The most important thing  is saving children from this vile shit.

            ANOTHER thread? We get it. I don't like Alex Jones either, but yet another complaint thread about him is of little use at this stage when we should be posting and digging into leads, not "why Alex Jones sucks a D, Part 3". No offense, I just think there are better, less divisive topics than this clown.

Remember Anon on 4chan? Focus on the Clinton Foundation.

              I know how you feel, he pissed me off handling it, too. But it does us no good arguing with each other about these "personalities". We're all on the same side. If someone still buys AJ's water filters, that's their opinion. Infighting over these people only distracts us and helps the pedo elites.

            Because part of the bigger plan by whoever (James Alefantis? Media Matters?) was behind the lawsuit against Alex Jones was to discredit him and make truthers and Trump supporters turn against him. They know how large his outreach is, that was the point behind the smear campaign before the apology. I feel betrayed by him somewhat for backing down but he still has been disseminating a lot of truth on other issues.

             That's exactly what #pizzagate at the beginning was about and everyone could have only dreamt about!
Remember Anon on 4chan? Focus on Clinton Foundation!
            </p>
            <p>
             And now, Infowars, Cernovich, the whole world is beginning to awake to the global pedophile network and instead that this is aplauded, look what happens:
Jones and Infowars is attacked here, like from the MSM!
            </p>
            <p>
             Interestingly those attacking him are pushing absurd stories:
Pay attention how they work:
Here's an extreme example where GeorgeT overplayed his hand:
GeorgeT suggesting credibility to a totally fact free and nonsensical discussion:

            Periodically he has "meltdowns"where he is totally unhinged. I remember one of the worst was then he was in full face clownish makeup wearing an (anti) Ocommie T-shirt.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is like a WWE "star" on drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also constantly repeats the PROGRAMMING about 1776, George Washington, the CONstitution, etc.  That's to reinforce to the slaves that we are "free" when we are anything BUT!

            To be honest, his interview with Mike Cernovich tonight sounded pretty drunk and would support your post as an example too. He wasn't drunk, he just has a lot in common with drunk people even when he's sober.

               Damn right another fucking thread. There's still tons of people here that trust Infowars and Alex jones. Let's start showing them that he's a shill..

               I'm posting this because I myself used to listen to Infowars and after his apology to Alefantis, I'm pretty fucking pissed off. Wouldn't you be doing the same thing? Trying to wake other people up?
