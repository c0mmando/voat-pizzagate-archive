<h1></h1>
<h1>Moody was a former Pulaski County Democratic Party chair and was communications director for the state Democratic Party from July 2015 until February 2017</h1>
<p>He left his role as state party spokesman when current chairman Michael John Gray was elected, said Reed Brewer, current communications director for the party.</p>
<h1>Since then, he\'d been a special events coordinator for Pulaski County Youth Services. He also continued to do political work, including serving as campaign manager for Tippi McCullough\'s successful race for state House from Little Rock this year.</h1>
<p>The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that he was fired from his county job Monday after the county learned of the investigation.  The newspaper quoted a spokesman as saying Moody had an administrative job and did not work with children in that post, but organized fund-raising events.</p>
<p>A government release said an undercover investigation observed Mood in an online chat room where child pornography was displayed and he also was observed distributing it.</p>
<p>Moody pleaded innocent Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Little Rock and waived his right to a bond hearing, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas said. Moody will remain in federal custody.</p>

            We have come a long way on LGBT issues, but what about transgendered Arkansans? Do you think we're going to see a so-called "bathroom bill" in the next legislative session?

            Absolutely. Next session we're going to have to fight the bathroom bill, and they've already started making moves on a tax cut. Those are the two big fights that we're going to have to gear up for pretty quickly after the election. I've always thought that as the LGBT movement progressed ... the T got left behind.

            I can just imagine how this bill would help out this pervert.  Maybe dress as a woman and take pics with his phone of little Children?  This is what they do.  This was the intention of the bill and he just can't wait.  So sick.

             Good to see him gone, but we all know this goes higher up than him. Let's just hope he had some evidence lying around that can expand the investigation.

              I am wondering and hoping to find Clinton Ties.  He had Hillary United on his FB.  With his Dem connection there is possibility especially in Ark.

               That judge from El Dorado. That brought up some kind of memory from something I read. I read way too much to archive everything, but I will recognize it when I see it again. I would say the % is high for our hopes. L.R. is a corrupt town, but the people of Arkansas are some of the nicest people anywhere, and will get very angry when stuff gets exposed.
