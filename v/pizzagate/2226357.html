<p><strong>THE TIME IS NOW !!!!  THIS IS THE BIGGEST HAPPENING SINCE WE STARTED</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>RESEARCH</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sun, 4pm ET - Updated Q\'s caps, all to date - <a href="https://imgtc.com/qean2FF">https://imgtc.com/qean2FF</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sun, 4pm ET - we need source / proof that the entire block where CPP and Besta pizza are located are owned by Bin Talal. Can anyone search these threads for proofs and collate them? <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2226357/10981799">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2226357/10981799</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sun, 2pm ET - We need factoids on all connections which can be used in memes. Post to here or /pol - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2226974">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2226974</a> )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sun, 2pm ET --- We need pictures and memes up of players and locations, draw lines connecting and explaining why and how they are connected. See updates section on guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sun, 4pm ET --- We need answers to all of Q\'s questions, new ones too. A paste of up-to-date Q&amp;A\'s can be found in the updates below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are looking for connections to <em>everything we know and have researched here</em>, to the Saudis </p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>QUICK RUN DOWN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Insider anons are reporting that the Podestas have been selling children to Saudi Princes, those who have just been arrested / ousted from power. These princes control <strong>everything</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are saying the pedo parts of this won\'t get to the MSM without us, and are asking us to GO!!! Quoting Q- &quot;SHOW US WHAT YOU CAN DO&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q Anon\'s questions are connecting REAL dots that we have always known and have researched but have never linked it all together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything PG, Vegas, 911, Cabal is connected to SA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Saudi Princes are huge donors to the CF et al and the CF has been using them for money laundering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These Saudi\'s are in the class above Soros. Soros is worth 10B, these Saudi princes together were worth 2T. Not even close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q made it clear in his &quot;four family&quot; post that Soros was controlled by them. So Trump and Salman brought down corrupt members of the House of Saud (one of the four families). That cut the strings to HRC, but now she\'s twisting in the wind. Soros is the pipeline, not the puppetmaster. The corrupt Sauds were the puppet master.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trumps SA tweet was confirming that he\'d trade Amaco on the NYSE, his part of the bargain for these Princes being ousted. He\'s essentially saying he\'ll protect the Saudi economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trumps first visit overseas was to Saudi. He made a deal that these Princes would be outed, so he can bring down the Cabal in exchange for him protecting the Saudi economy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The missile which hit Riyadh last night was a US one. Targeted EMP is being used to cut power to the princes compounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saudi prince ousted earlier owns Mandalay Bay alongside Bill Gates. The Vegas shooting was part of this. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saudi Prince ousted is the second largest share holder of twitter and owns a larger share than <a href="https://voat.co/user/Jack">@Jack</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Saudi Princes have been protecting the cabal. They can\'t any longer. The princes had to go first. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IMPORTANT - See my comments in the updates below for essential reading on the Saudi tweet from Trump earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q signed a post with a puzzle leading to the initials DJT (will find the link - anyone have it?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It appears that MegaAnon is Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Follow from this post, and into the next thread where the \'feet \' photo shows feet on the WH Press Room carpet --   <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/147998236#p148001412">http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/147998236#p148001412</a> --- Appears that she\'s posting as Sarah and Megs at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have been chosen to support DJT and this historical time. WE ARE THE MEDIA NOW.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Princes Go First --- Podesta and Clinton Cabal Next</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whatever you\'ve got, please post it!! The dots are being connected JUST NOW and /pol are calling for us PG Voaters to help as we know our subject. We need us all just now to do as much as we can. This is our time</strong></p>

           <li>
            <p>
             The Saudi Princes are huge donors to the CF et al and the CF has been using them for money laundering.

             These Saudi's are in the class above Soros. Soros is worth 10B, these Saudi princes together were worth 2T. Not even close.

           <li>
            <p>
             Q made it clear in his "four family" post that Soros was controlled by them. So Trump and Salman brought down corrupt members of the House of Saud (one of the four families). That cut the strings to HRC, but now she's twisting in the wind. Soros is the pipeline, not the puppetmaster. The corrupt Sauds were the puppet master.

            <p>
             Trumps SA tweet was confirming that he'd trade Amaco on the NYSE, his part of the bargain for these Princes being ousted. He's essentially saying he'll protect the Saudi economy.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Trumps first visit overseas was to Saudi. He made a deal that these Princes would be outed, so he can bring down the Cabal in exchange for him protecting the Saudi economy.

            My ex wife was a prostitute call girl working out of a hotel in Paris. I had no idea. She has been COMPLETELY protected for 22 years. I had years of being followed around by what appeared to be men from the middle east. Never found out who threatened my 4 year old son. The entertainment business is entwined in this. As are manhy major hotels in Los Angeles(they own them or did anyway)

            It probably will be deleted. Anything true is getting censored. Voat is totally compromised. The only reason why this may stay up is because it is old news. Anyone who investigated 9-11 at all already knows everything the op posted. This was covered up before it will happen again. Our only wildcard is Trump.

             Q made it clear in his "four family" post that Soros was controlled by them. So Trump and Salman brought down corrupt members of the House of Saud (one of the four families). That cut the strings to HRC, but now she's twisting in the wind. Soros is the pipeline, not the puppet master. The corrupt Saudis are apparently the puppet master.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The House Of Saud is not the ultimate puppet master. Saud is nothing but a proxy for the banking family oligarchs that print the money. If Saud does not do as it is told it too will be bombed into the stone age.

            In Italian casino means whorehouse. Casina means little house. If you say casina it's not talking about a WHOREHOUSE, if  you say casino, it is and it is literally a swaerword that means whorehouse, for example  if you are literally stuck in a traffic jam with an irate  Italian  GOD EXECUTIONER!  PIGMOTHERMARY WHAT A FUCKING WHOREHOUSE sound like this: Dio boia porka madonana che casino! I would look around what just this traffic jam? Now I go OOOOH yeah, CASINO= HUMAN TRAFFIC. What about the Monarch Casino with Pedologo that had to do with Gidon Feen friend to Alefantis and Podesta worked at podesta Group? The casinos are super suspect any state, my  opinion. Concerning. The Jews AND the Italians were/are great  money people. An Italian told me about money talk..  Banks were tables like benches , that would break,  bankruptcy go under water, recede flood like the Nile, the river banks would  hold the currency....the flow...I think Casinos is where the cards are.

             Thanks for your post and info. Do you mind posting over on thread 3? It's stickied at the top just now. Gilderoy has an interesting comment thread going on about the cards over on that one, and adding yours may help.

              DOJ To Russia Today: Register As A Foreign Agent Or Face Arrest
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Congress is using a decades-old piece of legislation to force Russia Today to register as a foreign agent in the US, adding that if the site doesn’t comply with the order by Monday, the DOJ could move to shutter its operations and arrest its top executive, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan.
            </p>
            <p>
             Russia Today revealed Thursday that the Department of Justice has given the site until next week to comply with its new interpretation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). RT has been operating in the US since 2005.
            </p>
            <p>
             While undoubtedly disappointing in terms of its implications for first amendment freedoms in the US, the DOJ’s declaration is hardly a surprise. Under pressure from lawmakers, Twitter last month said it would prohibit RT from buying paid ads on its platform.

           <p>
            More than a year ago, I was taken by the rumors surrounding pizzagate. Trying to understand what I thought was a meme I began to comprehend the reality of the conspiracy that was being so actively spread to the minds of many.
It was then that I wanted to understand the full scale and found that resources were either scarce or too plenty and scattered. I felt the need to organize, and over a year ago I came to voat to find people who felt the same. The initiative was there, and shortly after I with a small group of anons began collecting the facts and creating arcticles in what became the most comprehensive, most referenced, elobarate effort to catalogue and finalize all knowledge on the conspiracy, exposing the many scandals and unspeakable facts about pizzagate. Months passed without even a day where there weren't new articles, edits, contributions and, most importantly, being accessible to the public. Still now articles across other websites even reference the Wiki and at one point there was even collusion with Wikileaks. The admin (RebelSkum) even did interviews on the radio.
           </p>
           <p>
            It became all to real to me when the first website came under attack and it had to be relocated entirely.
           </p>
           <p>
            Due to personal situations I had to abandon the project for a while though everytime I checked back it seemed to have improved. Now it's gone. In comparison I was only a small contributor, though I feel I was invested thusly that without my initiative, nothing of the likes had been done. It is with that same investment that I come back to ask what happened? It was a goldmine of data and resources.
            <a href="http://atavisionary.com/pizzagate-wiki-removed-internet/">
             Atavisionary called us the most visible website on the topic
            </a>
            . We even exposed efforts to discredit the conspiracy in many ways by many different organizations. Almost any name and entity mentioned in the conspiracy had a page describing their alleged role, inlcuding testimonies from victims as well as perpetrators and debunking media claims such as the Welch shooting. I only have a fraction of my own contributions saved. Hundreds of pages have been lost. Dozens of articles are gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I'm calling out to everyone who worked on the project or knows what's up. The fact that this research is under attack means we were dong important work, and reached many people with the raw facts. This was also our entire goal: to have the info available for personal interpretation, like any encyclopedia. Because the only conclusion a rational person can make is that pizzagate is real, when given the facts.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the link below are some resources I still kept that were used on the encyclopedia (pictucres). I also have files from the first site when it got under attack that we used to restore the new site, however there have been so many contributions, and I haven't downloaded these many pages and edits to my PC, I doubt my outdated files come anywhere near the scale of what we had.
            <a href="https://imgur.com/a/P9WBR">
             https://imgur.com/a/P9WBR
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope any of who worked on the project read this. I hope any of you downloaded the site like we did the first time the site had to be taken down. We can do it again and restore what was lost. I haven't seen an alternative which seems important in reaching the average public, other than circulating infographics, which are effective in their own respect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks to anyone who contributed, to the Wiki, to the cause, to paying attention and being a decent human being who values and protects the innocent. It's not over yet.

               A pleasure Sol, there have been a few threads over these past months discussing it and imploring Rebel to rock up and let us know he's ok / how we can re-host the wiki. The last I heard our trusted mod

               </a>
               had been in touch with him privately, said he was otherwise occupied and had let it all fall behind (the domain and hosting renewals).

                Understandable. I'll try and contact him myself to get things back in business. I fully trust that with the level of dedication of some of the contributors, that they have made plenty of back ups for situations just like these. Though I am not as closely involved it was very promising to have witnessed to project take such effects. Any hurdle has only helped us grow, I see every reason to come back yet again stronger than before.

                 Good you'll try and get in touch and you're right, there's every reason to come back with it again and stronger. A few months ago I took a search for him myself, along with others here. Back then, the latest sign of him was on Steemit, answering a message on his page there. It appeared he was creating a big add on for the Steemit platform, so that's possibly what took him. Good luck my friend, and here's praying you all do come back.

            There is no PG investigation and this is not related although some of the players are. And Podesta is not in custody. That is an impossibility for reasons you should know but chose to ignore. And notice how the pedo mods promote this. This time next week and next year there still will be no investigation. They will never jail themselves. This is their system not ours.

            Q = Alice = HRC = Queen = Red Queen = Hivite top bitch. The Disney references are just that, DISNEY. They have been used for archetypal programming to instill certain personalities within our culture. This is mind control. This is Masonic coming of age concepts (pinnochio is heavily analyzed as such from before Disney got ahold of it). This is interesting because Walt has Nazi ties...

            Guys, technically I suck. But I am posting on all social media platforms as most of my contacts/followers are the top journalists in the country! ALL of them heavy HRC ' I'm with her types'. NPR, Democracy Now, CNN ( ugh!) ABC et al. One of them - winner of the Edward R. Murrow Award, asked me to send her the links to Q Anon! She teaches journalism at Columbia.
It's working!

             I've moved from Far Left to what others see as Far Right in just a short couple of years.  Must be old age catching up with me.
            </p>
            <p>
             My leftist friends think diversity means reaching out to Hispanics and Blacks.  How about reaching out to Whites in the alt.right and hearing their stories as equally valid? ....I''ve suggested.   This new perspective seems to cause good thinking.  Reaching out to the right involves all sorts of class issues, like maybe they won't talk to me.  Passing around a few dollars to poorer people than oneself gets lots of smiles quickly.  We don't see the class issues when facing that direction.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was a revelation to me that that the right feels the same sense of being embattled by their government rather than assisted, that the left carries. Both carry a chip on the shoulder.   Both sides feel misunderstood and in the minority.  Both think the other side controls the government.

             Mrs Kravitz, that's incredible!!! Love it!!!! What's the reaction? Did you find the most up to date Q messages to send to your friends?? I'm looking for them now and will post soon. I'll ping you. I'm also adding factoids to the 'redpill' section above, please feel free to let me know of any. The Citigroup and Twitter connections are huge. Massive kudos for all you're doing!

              I am a publicist by trade. Entertainment mostly, and so I already havr all of these relationships. I started posting the Q Anon questions...didn't get any neg feedback...so kept posting. Then the Saudi arrests and all of a sudden I seem clairvoyant! They are sheepishly eating it up haha!! General consensus is, " how come I/ we didn't know about this!?"

            Greg Chism's ex wife Angelica has a friend named Lesley Still who posts the same symbols on her Facebook as what was found near Lisa Irwin's home. The graffiti found by a CNN reporter said "Freak for Life" and I have linked Greg Chism back to the abduction of Lisa Irwin through numerous facts I can't find any way to debunk.

             Upvoting your comments on the new alt so you can submit your investigations of Pakistani pedos, Amy. Might want to remove the shortened urls from your Steemit article for security. Also, imgur is owned by Reddit and not trustworthy. Catbox is one I see voaters use instead.

            A senior Saudi prince and seven other officials have been killed in a helicopter crash near the country's border with Yemen, state media report.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, the deputy governor of Asir province, was returning from an inspection tour when his aircraft came down near Abha late on Sunday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prince Mansour was the son of Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, a former intelligence chief who was crown prince between January and April 2015, when he was pushed aside by Prince Mohammed's father, King Salman, now 81.
           </p>
           <p>
            HRH Prince Ahmed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz was in the United States on 9/11, and was flown out from Lexington, KY to London on 15th of September 2001 by the Bush Administration, while all other flights were grounded.

            The alphabet agencies are simply getting rid of conspirators they have to share the stolen wealth from. The Saudis are not needed and the USA is in economic meltdown and needs all the loot they can get their hands on. All the while they continue to attempt to war monger against Iran because they don't have a Rothschilds Central Bank in their country to control them.. This is not PG being taken down. You guys are doing it yet again. And how long have you been here that all caps style headlines are frowned upon as front running?

            deserves an MVP award for putting this all together in such an easy-to-access format. Phenomenal progress has been made in a few days. Many thanks to all who are contributing and putting time into this effort. I was praying for you all in church this morning and have been thinking of all my fellow PG Voaters today.

             Yes, I saw a post in the latest Q posts thread and agree--these, and Alice in Wonderland, are all about child deception, slavery and could specifically be MKULTRA related as I know terminology and symbolism from AW is often used, along with other Disney movies, to trigger victims of this brand of mind control. Cathy O'Brien goes deep into it in TRANCE-Formation of America.

            Hey OP, a lesson about communication: Get to the fucking point. You will quickly lose your audience otherwise. Im on pol as we speak following this, but I would have TL;DR-ed the fuck out of here if not for the fact that I already knew what you were on about.

            Maxine Waters
           </p>
           <p>
            Not too long ago we learned that Maxine Waters’ daughter was bringing in a hefty paycheck from working on her mother’s campaign committee, Citizens for Waters, since 2006.
           </p>
           <p>
            Karen oversees a gravy-chain operation called “slate mailers,” also known as “endorsement mailers.” The slate mailer operation is a lucrative enterprise where an established politician like Maxine Waters gets paid to endorse a political candidate.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Free Beacon, “the operation is run by Karen Waters, the daughter of Rep. Waters, who has collected more than $650,000 to date for running the endorsement mailers.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The mailers are sent to 200,000 residents in South Central Los Angeles, a district Waters represents. FEC (Federal Election Commission) filings show that Maxine Waters’ campaign scored almost $300,000 from these slate-mailer endorsements in 2016, the Free Beacon reported. Karen Waters was paid $70,000 to run her mom’s slate-mailer operation last year
           </p>
           <p>
            Karen also owns a company called Progressive Connections, which she used to make her credible deniability.
           </p>
           <p>
            New FEC filings show that Maxine Waters is set to pay her daughter another $108,000 for her services. Once this payment is made, Karen will have hauled in $750,000 for running her mom’s slate-mailer campaign since 2006.
           </p>
           <p>
            You may be asking yourself, who would pay this sort of money for an endorsement?
           </p>
           <p>
            Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom who paid Citizens for Waters $45,000 for his part of slate mailers as he was running for his current position.
           </p>
           <p>
            Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer threw $5,000 to Citizens for Waters, and the very same year, Progressive Connections pulled $181,000
           </p>
           <p>
            Kamala Harris campaigns have paid a total of $63,000 to the Waters campaign in exchange for placement on a mailer announcing Waters's endorsement of Harris, according to Federal Election Commission records.
           </p>
           <p>
            The payments were made from Harris's campaign committee and transferred to Waters's campaign committee through a lucrative "slate mailer" operation run by Waters's daughter, a program that has proved profitable for both her daughter and the campaign.

             Roger Clinton Jr. one of the indictments?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              As you have probably heard, one of the grand jurors in the Mueller investigation leaked one of the names on the sealed indictments handed down so far in the Russia probe: Roger Clinton Jr., half-brother of Bill.
             </p>
             <p>
              The woman, whose name we now know is Caroline Dans La Ville from Baltimore, reportedly texted her nephew excitedly when the grand jury voted unanimously to indict Clinton for his involvement in a company that was lobbying for increased foreign aid to the Ukraine. If convicted, Fox News says Clinton could face up to 25 years in prison for making undisclosed millions from secret deals with foreign powers. Hours later, she went missing on her way home. The Washington Tribune reports:
             </p>
             <p>
              Dans La Ville took a bus to 2nd Street, where she began her usual walk to her second-floor apartment on nearby Kruger Ave. Street cameras captured her rounding the corner, but she never arrived home according to a police report filed by her two children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hours later, she was found in the bushes with her throat slit.

            Maybe just simply looking into the person who runs Disney? We already know all their movies have subtle pedo symbolism and all the movies he's listing out here are by Disney. I guess think of their reach now that they've acquired Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. Think of how huge Disney really is, not just with their movies but theme parks etc...

              (which dissects SA involvement in block)  "In his Disney-themed office, the 6-foot 225-lb doctor forced more than 100 children to perform sex acts inside the Pinocchio exam room. After his arrest in December 2009, Bradley refused to cooperate with investigating detectives, and that raises the question of whether he was protecting accomplices in a child-sex ring."  Could this have to do with the NEW Disney themed clue???

            I found this site which has a huge collection of Saudi scandals. Sex trafficking, murder, etc.

            Can't believe it's been a year, since we all started down this pizzagate rabbit hole. Yesterday was a huge blow to the cabal. Taking down the Saudi side was a brilliant move, it took away so much power from the worldwide swamp.

            I think it's important to answer Q's question.  Where is John Podesta?  Because if they've agreed to a media blackout until John is arrested, then maybe that was the plan in the first place to hide John so the media blackout isn't ended.  No?  Where might John hide?  Pegasus?  The farm? Tunnels?  New identity?

            I wonder if "Alice &amp; Wonderland" refers to Queen Elizabeth &amp; her money that is hidden in the rabbit hole of jurisdictions as an hour ago revealed by the Paradise Papers?

            Long time lurker, first time poster, and bonafide survivor of Pizzagate. I need to THANK all of you in the VOAT community who have pushed this investigation forward. When I awoke to my victim status last year and fled my home, I went into hiding and was terrified for my life. VOAT was a guiding light and saving grace to me during this time. So many of you are absolutely onto the Truth, and thanks to your efforts, I believe this is all about to be revealed and taken down. Many of you have been asking "where are the survivors? Why don't they speak out?" Know that each one of us were tortured repeatedly so that we would NEVER remember, let alone speak out. I am defying my abusers and subverting their mind control programming, and I am making my stand right here, right now. I recently made public statements on facebook and twitter, and I invite you to visit my timelines and see the Truth as I see it, based on my own experiences and what I see happening in the world today. I am no longer afraid, and I now have faith that there are, indeed, GOOD people in the world who will succeed at eradicating this awful practice. THANK YOU VOAT!!!!  Keep pushing! We are winning and we are about to see the fruits of your labor displayed for all the world to see. You are a part of history, and you are making a difference for so many victims like me.

                (deleted account for safety). he encouraged you to look in the Sachler family. Your posts are so thorough and often lead to truths. I don't automatically agree with every analysis of yours (I think the alien narrative is a disinfo scare tactic and I don't know enough about advanced technology to discern whether those pieces feel true to me), but I truly appreciate your contributions and I recognize the work you are doing to contribute to this investigation. Thank you for what you do. Keep pushing.

              It's a really long story, but basically, it became clear to me that I was a victim of Satanic Ritual Abuse that was presently ongoing as of March 6, 2017 (age 35). My gut said to RUN because I wasn't safe - I had a strong awareness that they were going to crucify me on Easter to mock Jesus (they often used me as Jesus or Mary in rituals).

              believed me, even though it sounded bizarre and impossible, and we each packed a bag and drove straight to the FBI in D.C. They sent us away because they only handle terrorism (if only I had realized then that these people ARE ISIS in America, they would have listened, maybe). We then went to MD field office and reported to the desk agent, he sent us away claiming they didn't have jurisdiction. I don't know if the report was ever recorded. FBI is likely VERY dirty and not following up. I've reported directly to the WH and to the FBI in my new location, as well as police departments in 4 states. No one has followed up with me. We were on the run for 2 weeks and drove all over America trying to make sense of what we were going through. During this time, Chris' memories started to return as well, and we began to realize that he is also a victim of one of these families. FAMILY IS THE KEY!!!! It is all the Family International, Children of God, lost tribe of Israel (Canaanites), 13th illuminati bloodline, masons, etc. All branches of the same family tree descended from Ancient Phoenicia/Hivites (Canaanites). Since we've been on the run and in hiding, we have been working together and filling in the blanks for each other, we cracked the code and put a LOT of things together, including biblical naming patterns that indicate a person's role in the rituals for other cult members to be able to identify them, even when they don't know the person. We've cracked the bloodline pattern (maternal) and political/property pattern (paternal), and many more details of how the mechanisms work. We hid in Cali for 6 months and then recently moved again. We are still being harassed and targeted - a dirty sheriff (married to my realtor, both involved) did an illegal and unsolicited "wellness check" on our 5th day here. The cult here has been following us as we shop and go about town. We are recording everything and wear body cameras at all times in public. Chris carries a duty size pistol with at least 3 rounds at all times on the property and we sleep with a Bull Pup in the room. We have been at each other's side every minute of every day for over a year. The truth really is stranger than fiction, because these assholes don't put the whole truth in their fiction. Our culture is completely infested: music/TV/Movies reference these things symbolically ALL THE TIME. It really requires an understanding of esotericism, kabbalah, biblical bloodlines, current events, symbology, mythology, psy ops, and many other pieces that only make sense when you look at this whole thing through the lens of occult pedo human sacrifice bloodline cults for the purpose of consolidating power and exerting control over the masses. The key is Phoenicia/Hivites - ancient egyptian/babylonian "mysticism" which is really just psychological mind control phenomenon. These bloodlines have ruled the world for 6000 years and have infested EVERY culture and country on the planet. HRC was to be the final act. She was going to hand over control of our country to the Guild of Doom (i.e. "God") to be part of the "benevolent despotism" described by  Bill Cooper (former mason, murdered for breaking his blood oath of silence). My father must be a high priest in this ancient Phoenician/Hivite (aka Canaanite) cult (derived from Zoroaster/Zarathustra dualism ideology) because he imbued me with so much esoteric knowledge when I was 14 that I was able to put this all together on my own, with Chris' help, in a matter of months, at age 36, after being completely unaware I was a victim for 35 years. (Look up "Tertiary Structural Dissociation" and read Alison Milller's "Healing the Unimaginable" or "Becoming yourself" to get a glimpse of the experience). It's a miracle, really, and I am only alive today because I trusted my intuition. Attraction/avoidance gut instincts are more accurate that reason - the Body never lies!!! The body holds all the memories of abuse, and as I listen more to my body (they tried hard to dissociate me from my body completely) the more the memories come. I plan to share all the details, once I've recovered more of the memories of the abuse. But with being on the run and fearing for my life, I haven't been able to do solid, focused memory work the way I need to. It takes most survivors YEARS to break out of the mind control. I credit the recovery of my memories and waking up from the mind control to my faith in God, my commitment to Christ-like principles, my formidable spirit, my acute mind, the strong and secure attachment bond with Chris, and the awareness that Trump is making the world a safer place for me to exist in the light of Truth. And VOAT! Seriously, I cannot stress enough how important VOAT has been to me and Chris in this process. It's been our lifeblood. I've wanted to chime in so many times to nudge the researches a little further when they are right on the edge of big truths, but I've been too afraid of being doxed. Now that I'm firmly planted in a newly purchased home, he and I are standing and facing the enemy and choosing to FIGHT instead of run. God is on our side. If God is with us, who can be against us?

                That is quite a compliment, thank you! I could talk about this forever it seems. I can't wait to compile everything in one place. It's amazing to be witnessing history right now while feeling so personally connected to it. It overwhelms me sometimes. I appreciate the kind words. Take care!

                 Hi Sarah. Just saw your comments here. If/when you decide to post about your experience, make sure you understand the submission rules. We are not really set up to handle first-person accounts because we require links to supporting sources (otherwise every CTR shill would be on here making unsourced discussion posts and Voat anti-censorship policies would not allow us to remove them). I don't want you to get deleted, so make sure you include some links to relevant stuff like psychological research, previously published victim accounts, etc. If you ping me when you post, and do so at night when I mod, I can help you tweak it so it satisfies the guidelines. The O's of the sub and MF interpret them very conservatively.

                First, thanks for being so rude and making statements about my mental condition. You sound like a total shill, but whatever. I haven't been able to verify the pattern externally, so until I am able to do that, I'm not going to make any claims about it in detail. But at least in my family, biblical names are used pretty exclusively, and if you know which names are associated with which tribes of Israel, a pattern emerges. Of course, not all people with these names have been through this, and not all families follow the same naming conventions, it seems. I can only speak on my own experience and awareness and family. If I can find evidence to support the theory (because that's all it is right now without external validation), I will gladly share that clue.

                 I wish I could remember which survivor it is but I can't because my collection of survivor testimony is so large I forget which ones say things sometimes.

                <p>
                 But, according to the survivor the child's name is inextricably linked to their destiny and role in the cult. Survivor said her father gave her a name that designated her as a lifelong member that would rise and be part of the cult for life. Then after talking with a nurse about baby names the mother changed only one or two letters in the name and it changed survivor's fate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Survivor was now designated to be sacrificed in a ritual at some future point. Survivor said that names are a clue to the rest of the cult as to the role the person will play in the big drama.

                  This is 100% correct. It's why I choose to keep and use my name when I speak publicly. My initials are SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse) and my name backwards is "Haras" which tells them to torment me. Sarah is wife of abraham = mother of jews. Motherlessness in the cult makes them hate Sarah (also due to rivalry with Hagar, LONG story). Sarah died of heartbreak when Abraham went to sacrifice Isaac. Not only did my dad use me as Isaac (sacrifice) he made me feel like I was Sarah, he was abraham, and then would likely ritually kill babies he made me think were mine (I don't have all my memories back yet). Naming convention is absolutely a clue and a pattern and is well established and part of the code they use to identify each other and know who is supposed to do what. It also denotes bloodline and royalty status. I'll tell you this, J names are BAD people. John, Joseph (Joseph's bistro, anyone?) and Mary is a victim name. That's all I feel confident enough about to share for now. If I can get some more evidence, I will make a more detailed post about it. Hopefully soon.

                    Exactly. Jessica, Jennifer, Julie, Joanna, Joaquin, Joseph, James, Jeremiah, Jared, just to name a few more. Remember, not all people by this name are one of them. A good tell is if they are really pushy, they talk fast, they try to tell you what to think, or they try to get you to do/buy something. = Enforcement of Will onto another, which they practice religiously. Literally.

                   After I spent about two hours analyzing the bistro stuff I knew it was bad shit. I realized that it was like a phone directory of cult members and their businesses. There was also just some blind locations like under a bridge, in a field, etc in out of the way places that were probably used as drop points, meeting places, or god knows what else.

                   I have been studying this for about 20 years and I am always interested to hear what survivors have to say. I have 30 or 40 transcripts and videos of survivors I felt like the real deal that I have compiled over the years. I have learned as much or more from the survivors as anybody or anything else.

                    those mystery locations could be where the bodies are hidden. It's worth considering, as perhaps LE can go looking and find mass graves. Sad but likely.

                   <p>
                    When this is all over and the #Hivite cabal is a matter of history, not present reality, perhaps we can link up to gather this information and put it out publically. I would most definitely be interested in hearing stories from other survivors. I hope one day we survivors will have a supportive community to interact with and be a part of. Thank you for all the work you've done and continue to do!

                    It is. One of my "doctors" is on that list. A GM office connected to my dad is on that list. A neighbor of mine growing up is on that list. Sooooo...  Survivors have the esoteric understanding that they don't write down anywhere, so it's not easy to find or verify the info. The pattern is evident and undeniable once it's uncovered. They are ONLY able to operate when this shit is a secret, they have NO POWER when their methods of control are exposed.

                     I have heard several survivors say that they are genuinely scared of us and two of them used the word "terrified." Does that sound accurate?

                      100% accurate, why do you think they attack the site so much? You know you are onto something when they start fighting back digitally. I've only been on twitter for less than a week talking about #Hivites and as of today, they are suppressing the term in search and hashtag lists. They wouldn't do that unless it was a truth they want to keep hidden. Impossible now. The internet is the new Gutenberg press and this is reformation 2.0, as

                      has pointed out. Real-time information sharing makes revisionism impossible. The evidence is clear and their methods only work when hidden. Call it by it's name and say it like it is, and they can't hide. They know they failed already (they NEEDED HRC to win in order to make their final plays). Now they are just going to try and take as many people down and out with them when they get exposed. Grab the popcorn! Should be an interesting end of 2017, the most absurd year on record.

                   My birth name is Lunar. Really. It was changed by my mother to Christopher when her family stole me and decided to make me a servant for women. Of course that would ultimately lead to sacrifice as the "bearer or Christ" cannot be left to live. Had I remained Lunar, meaning "of the moon",  I can only imagine my fate today as a black priest...something I never do.

               You should be very grateful to have someone by your side whom you can trust.  Please be careful giving out details which could be use to ID you.  Be careful about talking about your security plans as well.  They are here - watching.  I suggest employing several layers and getting a good dog or two as well.

                .  In addition to protective dogs I also suggest you exercise your rights under the ole Second Amendment by getting a license to carry concealed in your state.  Then lock and load, keep your big dogs nearby, install a home security alarm, install a separate video camera system (set up to send motion alerts to various accounts), and put an automatic starter on your car.  Aim those cameras on your vehicle and a points of entry.  Stay safe.  We're praying for you, kid.  God bless us all......

                  Attagirl!  I'm so glad to hear it.  For my family and me the last things we got in place were the 24/7 video cams (with real-time motion alert capability) and the automatic car starters. Seemed like such a pain.  Turns out thru weren't a pain at all.  Now l don't know how we ever lived without them.

                  Another trick?  Just stay very, very vigilant.  And pray, pray, pray.

                   Amen to that! The personal and home security measures become second nature with a little practice. Vigilance is a must, and being wise as serpents is key. Know how to spot them, know how to stop them. It WILL come crashing down, and very soon I think. Just keep the faith!!!

                I can confirm addresses in my local state were used as well. My own story includes being trafficked internationally while a member of the Air Force. Sarah and I have unique skills that complement one another exceptionally well. She has legal training and I have psychology training. We both have an eye for patterns. The abuse/stressors received in childhood creates a highly functional mind when integrated. Requirements like total recall for reporting under hypnosis are pretty decent attributes to maintain these days.

              I'm not going anywhere. NOTHING, not even DEATH, will prevent my truth from being told now. I'm still in physical danger, but I am no longer afraid, and VOAT has a lot to do with that. I feel I owe the freedom of my mind to voat, at least in part.

               Remain strong and we will all get through this nightmare.  The world is slowly waking up.  We need people like you to come forward and climb out of the abyss of evil telling us you will survive because we are making a difference.

                I'm already seeing the impact and the awareness spreading on twitter in just 48 hours. The time is right for this to come out and for people to be able to understand it, identify it, and eradicate it. But it is 100% up to us, the citizens, to make it happen. Trump can't do it himself - it will be politicized and treated as fake news. It MUST come from the public, there is no other way. KEEP DIGGING FOR EVIDENCE!!!! They didn't intend for the internet to be a total recall record of all knowledge and actions. There are clues everywhere but they are buried in information overload. Find the kernels, chase them down, and get this shit off this planet for good please! Too many kids are being hurt, too many people are being murdered. It MUST end.

            It's so hilarious that youve been chosen to prove the one thing taken for granted here without any EVIDENCE EVER BEING PUT FORTH (Saudis get paid in children).  Qatar, their enemy with worse PG connections, has been repeatedly caught trafficking humans as handmaidens camel jockeys sex slaves etc.

            Spent hours here since yesterday. Am I missing a convo about Iceland's government and pedo stuff just a couple weeks ago and now Saudi Arabia and possibly the US. Yes folks, you can bash Trump all you want but it sure appears he is working on a global scale against the pedo crisis and SUCCEEDING!  I have a feeling Nixon is looking down and feeling a great sense of excitement in this. His efforts were 45 years ago. Those that remember and are here now, realize what a great thing is being accomplished by our President.

            Just putting this out there, Q asked what HRC's relation to Huma was, (I know the caps HUMA is referencing a different Huma, both are stressed) which she has called her a daughter of some sort,  With the references to Godfather III, a debt could not be repaid &amp; the daughter gets killed.  Hillary can not repay the debt she has to the Saudi's....

            Love you guys. I cannot do anything important computer-wise, but I will be spending a lot of time in prayer today. Some of you believe in that, and some do not, but I have seen some amazing things happen.

              and everyone.  This is astounding.  Please, God, give all the good guys strength and peace and clarity of mind.  We renounce Satan in the name of Jesus Christ, and we pray that God's will be done.  In the name of Jesus Christ we pray, for the health, safety, and welfare of all who seek justice, amen.

            It Will Blow Your Mind.  My head is in total disarray after reading it all.   NK is not controlled by Kim, the answer would be unbelievable and make most people riot and rebel.  (I have heard it is the CIA).  Also it said the SRA in Haiti and other countries are paused but not discontinued until players are in custody.  That's it, Please Red and see for yourself.  So Much Valuable Info.

I am absolutely blown away by the information in this thread and the amount of work everyone is putting in, thank you all, for your time and your commitment to building a better world, no matter how mind-bending and dark the truth happens to be.

              this is the right track butt connect it to George HW Bush....He is not a Bush.....He and Saudi Bin Laden Family met on 091001 the day before 9/11....CARLYLE GROUP....Obama being sponsored by Saudi is a cutout....Obama is sponsored by Bush...he was raised for this... his bloodline connects to Rothschilds...Roths and Saudi wahabbi is the same Babylonian Talmudists...

            On September 10, 2001 George HW Bush (not his real name, brought over in Operation Paper clip) met with Saudis Arabia Bin Laden Family as the Carlyle Group. Many deals were made that day. Rumsfield also announced from Pentagon 6 trillion dollars was missing. 9/11 was Directed Energy Weapon with CIA agent Tim ? As the Bin Laden fantasy goat the world chased and apparently our special forces could not find dragging his dialysis machine through caves in Aphganistan and Paki...give us a break we have been played as fools...
           </p>
           <p>
            At 9/11 President George W Bush was reading a book to school children about goats with the book turned upside down. Nothing is a coincidence. We are the goats to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            All air traffic was grounded except for the Bin Laden family which were secretly flown out of the US to Saudi Arabia...
           </p>
           <p>
            Huma parents are the Muslim Brotherhood. Huma was a gift to HRC as a sex slave but also a MBrotherhood spy. She entered the Whitehouse when HRC was 1st Lady and she was only 20?....she had started the Muslim Brotherhood on campus of Michigan for a reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            George HW Bush is a Nazi when you discover his real identity you will be shocked. Who is the one "God" Hitler said it was good to worship "Allah" (little known fact)
           </p>
           <p>
            Hitler did not die in WW11 but was brought to Argentina as was Dr. Mengele (Dr.Green in US)
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA were simply Nazis with new identities now aloud to work in black budgets underground in preparation for the end times 4th Reich. George HW 
was a big part of the JFK assasination. He was on the ground in Dallas as an agent...
           </p>
           <p>
            Uranium One is a representation of George HW The US Enrichment organization....where he made billions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Uranium One was created by Obama, HRC, Mueller, Comey, McCabe, Holder, etc. to sale 20% of American Uranium but also had offices in two other countries.,This ties Paddock &amp; Marilou Danley together. They managed ratline of weapons, Uranium, children, etc. for CIA/JTTF....
           </p>
           <p>
            The owner of the top five floors of Mandolay Bay was Waleed where the UAE princes Otaibe and the Paki Awan brothers (Paki Spy Ring) were involved in "Dumbo Drop" drug-rape of trafficked kids in Vegas and D.C. And other places...
           </p>
           <p>
            The terrorist in NYC is also related to Uranium as are many other UZBEK's I can't tell you how yet (due to death threats) but they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama is not who you think he is. More than a Muslim....neither of his parents are who you think. He is CIA=Saudi Arabia=Babylonia Talmudists=Jesuits=Zionists=Luceferian.
           </p>
           <p>
            His identity will shock you if it comes out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudi Arabia owns the whole block where Comet Pizza and Besta are located...that means it is all CIA..
           </p>
           <p>
            All the rat lines, players, thiefs, pedo's, etc evidence is in protective custody...
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of us are whistleblowers sent to Whistleblow...

            Would suggest the following as threads to pull...
-The entire block where CPP and Besta pizza are located are owned by Talad
-What were these ousted Princes ties to Israel?
-How much "art" did these fellas buy?
-Don't we have rat lines with container ships etc all mapped out?
-I recall alot of f*ckery with Saudi's being "in country" on 9/11
-Huma and HUMA above both important

              Alwaleed bin Talal: meet the Saudi prince giving away all his money
             </p>
             <p>
              The high-flying royal, who sued Forbes for ‘underestimating’ his fortune just years before handing it all to charity, seems to defy the cliches of a Saudi magnate
             </p>
             <p>
              There is something that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia badly wants you to know: the exact amount of his wealth.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2009, he invited a Forbes reporter to a week-long visit of his 420-room palace in Riyadh and to accompany him and his then wife, Princess Ameera, on a flight to Cairo on board his personal Boeing 747 to make sure the magazine realised the scale of his wealth when compiling the list of the richest people on the planet.

              Is there a list somewhere of the things predicted before they happened? For example, did they predict the arrest of the Saudis before the media informed about it? I'm unaware of the precise timeline.

            Photos Show Obama Marching With Racist New Black Panthers
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2008, led by their leader, the self-named “King” Samir Shabazz, members of the New Black Panthers (NBP) in Philadelphia intimidated voters by standing before a voting place in the city, dressed in their uniform of black beret, black jacket, black pants, and black boots and carrying clubs in their hands. Shabazz has also been captured on video saying he hates all white people, “every single one of them,” and calling for the killing of all white babies.
           </p>
           <p>
            On July 6, 2010, former DOJ official J. Christian Adams testified before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that attorneys in the civil rights division were instructed to ignore cases that involve black defendants and white victims. Adams said that “over and over and over again,” the department showed “hostility” toward those cases, including the New Black Panther voter intimidation case.
           </p>
           <p>
            At a New Black Panther Party meeting, its president Malik Shabazz said outright that his brothers got a pass from the Obama Justice Department because “Justice Department leadership changed into the hands of a black man by the name of Eric Holder.”
Andrew Breitbart reports for his BigGovernment.com website, Sept. 24, 2011, that when Congress began looking into the NBP voter intimidation in July 2009,  news came that someone named Malik Shabazz had visited the private residence at the White House. But the White House denied that the Malik Shabazz on the visitor’s log was the same Malik Shabazz involved in the New Black Panther voter intimidation case.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time, the media did not challenge the White House on the veracity of this claim — except Andrew Breitbart, who asked the White House to identify exactly which Malik Shabazz it was who had visited the White House residence on July 25, 2009. But, the White House continues to stonewall Breitbart.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are even more photographs. But the individual who had taken the pictures wrote Regnery reversing his permission to include the photographs in Injustice. So the images were removed from the photographer’s Flickr account. Happily, Breitbart managed to capture the pics before they disappeared.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Black Panthers spoke with Obama at the podium shown above, and departed together with Obama for the main march itself, as shown by this grainer image captured from YouTube:

            In another article.....
           </p>
           <p>
            During the 2008 elections, two members of the New Black Panthers, Malik Zulu Shabazz and Jerry Jackson, were videoed physically intimidating voters at a Philadelphia polling location. The two men were arrested and charged with federal felony charges of civil rights violations
           </p>
           <p>
            Disregarding eyewitness testimony and the video of them caught in the act, Obama’s legal puppet Eric Holder ordered DOJ attorney J. Christian Adams to drop all of the charges against the two men. Adams was so incensed with Holder’s orders that he quit his lucrative job with the DOJ. This also explains why the photos of Obama and Shabazz disappeared from most websites
           </p>
           <p>
            ( is  J. Christian Adams still alive?)

            Obama meets influential young Saudi prince to improve relations
           </p>

            US President Barack Obama hosted youthful Saudi Arabian Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Friday, underscoring his guest's meteoric rise and increasingly pivotal role in managing strained US-Saudi ties.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 30-year-old deputy crown prince, who has become the driving force behind economic reform and a more activist Saudi foreign policy, swept into the West Wing with a gaggle of advisers for hour-long talks
           </p>
           <p>
            Bin Salman, the king's son and the country's defence minister, has met the biggest of Washington's big hitters during a week-long visit.
He held talks with the CIA director, the secretaries of state, defense, treasury, commerce and energy as well as leading members of Congress.
His meeting with Obama took place in the Oval Office, a rare honor for a non-head of state, one not afforded to the Dalai Lama earlier in the week.
           </p>
           <p>
            As minister of defence, bin Salman got his country into expensive wars, including intervention in Yemen that reportedly cost the kingdom up to $200m per day until a ceasefire took effect

            What is 'State Secrets' and how upheld in the SC?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Under its original formulation, the state secrets privilege was meant only to exclude a very narrow class of evidence whose revelation would harm national security. However, in a large percentage of recent cases, courts have gone a step further,
             <strong>
              dismissing entire cases in which the government asserts the privilege
             </strong>
             , in essence converting an evidentiary rule into a justiciability rule.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government response has been that in certain cases,
             <strong>
              the subject of the case is itself privileged
             </strong>
             . In these cases, the government argues, there is no plausible way to respond to a complaint without revealing state secrets.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            On January 22, 2008, Senators Edward Kennedy and Arlen Specter introduced S. 2533, the State Secrets Protection Act.[27]

            <p>
             Sibel Edmonds
            </p>
            <p>
             The privilege was invoked twice against Sibel Edmonds. The first invocation was to prevent her from testifying that the Federal Government had foreknowledge that Al-Qaeda intended to use airliners to attack the United States on September 11, 2001; the case was a $100 trillion action filed in 2002 by six hundred 9/11 victims' families against officials of the Saudi government and prominent Saudi citizens. ..

             Notra Trulock
            </p>
            <p>
             In February 2002 it was invoked in the case of Notra Trulock, who launched a defamation suit against Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, charged with stealing nuclear secrets; President Bush stated that national security would be compromised if Trulock were allowed to seek damages from Lee... though it resulted in the case being dismissed, another suit was launched directly attacking then-FBI Director Louis Freeh for interfering and falsely invoking the state secrets privilege.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Wen Ho Lee: The New York Times article on March 6, 1999 reported that nuclear secrets stolen from a US government laboratory had enabled China to make a leap in nuclear weapons development: the miniaturization of its bombs.  It said there was a suspect, a Chinese-American scientist at Los Alamos.  It cited comments by unidentified officials that the White House had minimized the espionage investigation for political reasons.

            Just want to remind everyone that Alwaleed Bin Talal is Twitter's second largest shareholder, and Twitter had two pretty significant scandals in the past week.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, it admitted, in light of the Russian hacking bullshit, that it had
            <strong>
             censored
            </strong>
            almost 50% of all #DNCleaks tweets.  Then, Trumps twitter was deactivated by a "
            <strong>
             disgruntled employee
            </strong>
            ."   Just so happens, Trump was in the middle of tweeting about Hillary the cheater/election rigger based on Donna Brazile throwing Hillary under the bus about rigging the Primary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in 2015, Alwaleed tweeted this to Trump 
".@realDonaldTrump
You are a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America.
Withdraw from the U.S presidential race as you will never win.
2:02 PM - Dec 11, 2015"
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump responded:
"Dopey Prince
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Alwaleed_Talal">
             @Alwaleed_Talal
            </a>
            wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected. #Trump2016
7:53 PM - 11 Dec 2015"
           </p>
           <p>
            Which sounds to me like President Trump already had info that Alwaleed was bribing Hillary/pay for play.

              <p>
               Alwaleed, who likes watching CNBC and has given money to many universities – including Harvard, Cambridge and Edinburgh – has not been immune to controversies. Perhaps the most curious is his alleged retention of a group of dwarves as an act of charity. The prince has described reports of dwarf-tossing as lies. His supporters say he has shown a favour to the dwarves by giving them shelter and money. The prince, who frequently invited journalists to his palaces before, has since become somewhat press shy – at least to western media.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The article fails to mention that Talal's support of Harvard goes back to when he offered money to get Obama admitted into Harvard.  Don't have the link at the moment but I recall there was a Saudi Billionaire offering to make a large donation as a thank you for accepting Obama.  I now assume that was Talal. Maybe Obama is one of his 'dwarves' LOL

              This one of many small hints dropped by Trump throughout his Twitter campaign (this is information warfare) that he knows about the mind control programming. Archetypes such as the 7 dwarfs are installed within victims to be called out later. Dopey, when called as a post hypnotic suggestion, will become the forward personality and the victim will be dumb. It's likely used when conversations happen around a slave. Trump has been triggering both victims and perps in this way since becoming elected. I picked up on it and starting in March I began laying out my own campaign on Facebook against my family and socially engineered "friends". The echo chamber of perps has been good for stirring them up, getting them to make mistakes, and ultimately incriminate most of them in my upcoming charges against them.

              Maybe it also ties into symbolism of the Saudi Sword Dance that Trump participated in on his visit.

               The term 'ardah' is thought to derive from the Arabic verb ard meaning 'to show' or 'to parade'. It was so named because its purpose was to publicly display the fighting strength of a tribe and boost morale before an armed engagement.[1] Although there are regional variations of the particular rendition of ardah, the purpose it serves is nearly identical throughout the Arabian Peninsula.[1]

            Another certain prince was Osama bin Laden's brother and owned an oil company with George W Bush in texas in the 1980s
           </p>
           <p>
            Ties Between the Bush Family and Osama bin Laden
           </p>
           <p>
            Critics dismissed that as an invention. They were wrong. There was a link, but not the one Bush was selling. The link between Hussein and Bin Laden was their banker, BCCI. But the link went beyond the dictator and the jihadist - it passed through Saudi Arabia and stretched all the way to George W. Bush and his father.
           </p>
           <p>
            BCCI was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a dirty offshore bank that then-president Ronald Reagan's Central Intelligence Agency used to run guns to Hussein, finance Osama bin Laden, move money in the illegal Iran-Contra operation and carry out other "agency" black ops. The Bushes also benefited privately; one of the bank's largest Saudi investors helped bail out George W. Bush's troubled oil investments.
    BCCI was founded in 1972 by a Pakistani banker, Agha Hasan Abedi, with the support of Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and head of the United Arab Emirates. Its corporate strategy was money laundering. It became the banker for drug and arms traffickers, corrupt officials, financial fraudsters, dictators and terrorists.
    The CIA used BCCI Islamabad and other branches in Pakistan to funnel some of the two billion dollars that Washington sent to Osama bin Laden's Mujahadeen to help fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. It moved the cash the Pakistani military and government officials skimmed from U.S. aid to the Mujahadeen. It also moved money as required by the Saudi intelligence services.
           </p>
           <p>
            The money BCCI stole before it was shut down in 1991 - somewhere between 9.5 billion and 15 billion dollars - made its 20-year heist the biggest bank fraud in history. Most of it was never recovered. International banks' complicity in the offshore secrecy system effectively covered up the money trail.
    But in the years after the collapse of BCCI, Khalid bin Mahfouz was still flush with cash. In 1992, he established the Muwafaq ("blessed relief") Foundation in the offshore Channel Islands. The U.S. Treasury Department called it "an al Qaeda front that receives funding from wealthy Saudi businessmen."

            Random Catch:   bin Talal/Saudis, Clinton, Podesta, Gates, and Boeing (in this example) all in bed with each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            Four Seasons Hotel in Vegas (floors above the Vegas Shooter) owned by Alwaheed bin Talal and Bill Gates.  Center for American Progress founded by Podesta and funded by Soros and Gates, located only a couple of miles away from Alwaleed's bin Talal's Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding in Wash DC.  Gates obviously major Clinton Foundation Donor.  Top on the list of foreign donors to the Clinton foundation is Saudi Arabia, which contributed between $10 million and $25 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Major donor for CAP is Boeing.  "Rudy deLeon, CAP’s senior vice president for national security and international policy, was a Boeing executive and directed the company’s lobbying operations between 2001 and 2006, before joining the think tank the following year."
           </p>
           <p>
            "On Christmas Eve in 2011, Hillary Clinton and her closest aides celebrated a massive $29.4 billion sale to the Saudis of over 80 F-15 fighter jets, manufactured by Boeing, a company which coincidentally contributed $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation."
           </p>

            Rudy deLeon was not only a Boeing/CAP guy.   "Rudy deLeon served as President Clinton's undersecretary of the Air Force from 1994 to 1997, and as Clinton's undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness from 1997 to 2000."  So he's in deep, and he's still relevant.  "Defense Secretary Gen. James Mattis wants to nominate a senior fellow at a Soros-funded think tank as undersecretary at the Pentagon, as the embattled Cabinet official continues to clash with the White House over prospective nominees. Politico reports that Mattis wants Rudy deLeon — a senior fellow at the far-left Center for American Progress (CAP) — to come on board as undersecretary for personnel and readiness. DeLeon previously served in the Clinton administration as deputy secretary of defense. During that time, Gen. Mattis served as his senior military assistant."

            bin Talal of course owns one of the most expensive private jets in the world.  "Boeing 747-400 owned by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal – $220 million.  This 747 which was originally configured to seat more than 400 people belongs to the Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi prince bought this plane in 2003 and afterwards had it customized to fit his own needs. "

            In case you didn't catch that, Alwaleed bought his private Boeing jet while deLeon was working for Boeing.

             This must be the most upvoted topic.
Mor ethan 300 upvotes and made sticky. That must be huge!
I read it and there is not a single proven fact!
Just old rumors which finally need to be supported by FACTS.
            </p>
            <p>
             But asking for facts would probably just disrupt the collective insanity which this place has obviously become dominated by...
You sensationalist spammers make us look like idiots.

            Obama secretly backing Muslim Brotherhood
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/3/inside-the-ring-muslim-brotherhood-has-obamas-secr/">
             http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/3/inside-the-ring-muslim-brotherhood-has-obamas-secr/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The policy of backing the Muslim Brotherhood is outlined in a secret directive called Presidential Study Directive-11, or PSD-11. The directive was produced in 2011 and outlines administration support for political reform in the Middle East and North Africa, according to officials familiar with the classified study.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://humanevents.com/2014/07/07/obama-muslim-brotherhood-and-mideast-chaos-presidential-study-directive-11/">
             http://humanevents.com/2014/07/07/obama-muslim-brotherhood-and-mideast-chaos-presidential-study-directive-11/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Obama administration conducted an assessment of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2010 and 2011, beginning even before the events known as the “Arab Spring” erupted in Tunisia and in Egypt. The President personally issued Presidential Study Directive 11 (PSD-11) in 2010, ordering an assessment of the Muslim Brotherhood and other “political Islamist” movements, including the ruling AKP in Turkey, ultimately concluding that the United States should shift from its longstanding policy of supporting “stability” in the Middle East and North Africa (that is, support for “stable regimes” even if they were authoritarian), to a policy of backing “moderate” Islamic political movements (italics added for emphasis throughout).
           </p>
           <p>
            The revelations were made by Al Hewar centre in Washington, DC, which obtained the documents in question.
           </p>
           <p>
            This too is significant. As Daniel Greenfield writes: “Al-Hewar, which actually got hold of the documents, is linked to the International Institute of Islamic Thought… which is a Muslim Brotherhood front group.  Figures in the Muslim Brotherhood had threatened to leak understandings with Obama Inc. This is the next best thing. It warns Obama that if he tries to forget about them, they can prove that the relationship was official policy.”

            The only link I've found is that Mohammed bin Salman (the guy responsible for the arrests) studied at Scotland Yards anti-terrorism institute.

            I guess there's a link between British and Saudi royalty. Prince Charles is heavily involved with Saudi Royalty, Bandar bin Sultan and Turki bin Faisal

            . I don't think this is relevant to Madeline in particular but keep an eye out for their names.

            Whew! As long as it's not THE FUCKING ILLUMINATI we can relax boys. Keep these rabbits chasing from burrow to burrow, too busy to look around. They think they're catching us with all the stuff we did in the 80's. And their leaders are dumb enough to think they'll be safe in the new America we've built in Saudi Arabia! Everything's going according to plan, we have our seed vault, our underground facilities, time to kick some nukes.

            what is the meaning of Q Anon's signature line 'Alice &amp; Wonderland' ??
           </p>
           <p>
            not sure, but it could fit
           </p>
           <p>
            Wonderland wouldn’t have seemed so absurd to the real Alice. 
“Some of the things that seem like nonsense to us would have made total sense to Alice and her sisters,” Vega explains. When the Mock Turtle says in the book that he receives lessons in drawing, sketching, and “fainting in coils” from an “old conger-eel, that used to come once a week,” the Liddells would have recognized their own art tutor, who gave the girls lessons in sketching, drawing, and oil painting. Much of the “nonsense” from the book was “based on people and places and experiences that these very real children had and would have been familiar with,” Vega says
           </p>
           <p>
            The real Alice was the daughter of Carroll’s boss.  So to the Bosses daughter, wonderland wasn't so strange
           </p>
           <p>
            how would it apply?
           </p>
           <p>
            some of the things that seem nonsense, to those in the know, it makes total sense
           </p>
           <p>
            you have to admit, this whole thing is crazy, but for those that have been red pilled,  it makes sense????

              I drive a day cab semi for Federal Logistics (not FedEx) in East Peoria, Il.
             </p>
             <p>
              We deliver food to the prisons,
             </p>
             <p>
              When we got to the prison there was a line of representing government agency vehicles including all manner of military all the way out the entrance. We were rushed in a head of everyone to be unloaded and got to the main gate to be checked in. At this point we were escorted not inside to be unloaded at the usual docks but instead off loaded to the ground where we learned that the material we were carrying would be given to local Department of Transportation vehicles and dispersed to police stations throughout the state.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was here that I finally got to see the load that we were carrying. Entire truck loads of bio suits, masks, gloves, the whole gamut.

               Wow.  That is frightening.  This has probably been going on across the country.  Which is more frightening.  Remember the UN trucks people were posting on here?  Trump must know about them.  He is trusting the Military now, because I read that is the only Agency not infiltrated with Deep State.

                  WFP coordinates with other UN agencies, often through the UN Development Assistance Framework, so that their efforts complement one another. Agencies such as the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO), UNESCO and the United Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF) provide technical assistance in their specific areas of expertise. In countries where we distribute food to refugees or internally displaced people, we have a strong operational partnership with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  WFP has a special relationship with the other two Rome-based UN agencies – the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) – with which it shares a common vision of promoting food security by alleviating hunger through food assistance, while working to eliminate its root causes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We also work closely with other international and regional organizations, such as the EU’s Directorate-General for Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), the Organization of American States and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). International financial institutions like the World Bank support us through funding.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Policy and advocacy work carried out by the WFP offices in New York and Brussels support partnerships on the ground, concentrating mainly on relations with other UN agencies and Member States, and European institutions respectively

               It's quite likely that there's multiple messages/clues/hints to be garnered from the sign-off. My guess, if it means something to you, roll with it and see what you find. I myself get strong hints to revisit my Alice Liddell &amp; Lewis Carroll research, angle being that Carroll was falsely accused of being a pedophile with intent by the accusers to push an agenda and/or hysteria; corruption.

              <pre><code>Looking Glass (or Operation Looking Glass) is the code name for an airborne command and control center operated by the United States. In more recent years it has been more officially referred to as the ABNCP (Airborne Command Post).[1][2] It provides command and control of U.S. nuclear forces in the event that ground-based command centers have been destroyed or otherwise rendered inoperable. In such an event, the general officer aboard the Looking Glass serves as the Airborne Emergency Action Officer (AEAO)[3] and by law assumes the authority of the National Command Authority and could command execution of nuclear attacks. The AEAO is supported by a battle staff of approximately 20 people, with another dozen responsible for the operation of the aircraft systems. The name Looking Glass, which is another word for a mirror, was chosen for the Airborne Command Post because the mission operates in parallel with the underground command post at Offutt Air Force Base.[4]

               CURRENT STATIS
There was some speculation that the "mystery plane" seen flying over the White House on September 11, 2001, was some newer incarnation of Looking Glass. However, as indicated by retired Major General Donald Shepperd, speaking on CNN on September 12, 2007, the plane circling the White House on 9/11 resembled an E-4B which was likely launched from Nightwatch ground alert at Andrews Air Force Base.

            The arrest of Prince Al-Waleed suggests someone is being punished for the failed Las Vegas neo-9/11 plot, where Israel and Saudi forces planned to destroy parts of Las Vegas and blame Iran and North Korea - pushing the US into world war to destroy those two remaining opponents to the Zionist world financial system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal is part owner (along with Bill Gates and founder Issy Sharp) of the Four Seasons hotel chain. The Four Seasons own and run the top floors of the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also arrested were
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             10 senior princes
head of the National Royal Guards
head of the Navy
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The reason given for the arrests was "corruption" - which could easily be PR-speak for "attempted coup."
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems little coincidence the arrests occurred as Trump is en route to Asia to face the North Korea problem (and how many levels of globalist Matroska doll puppetry are involved in creating the supposed NK "threat" we don't know).
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, the arrest of such powerful members of the royal family and military suggest this is cleanup after the failed Las Vegas neo-9/11 plot. Whether the arrested are simply being punished for their failure, or were part of a Deep State-allied coup attempt, is not yet clear.

             Yes, they're Pakistani.  Not sure if they also own the Awan Group but it's very likely they're related because of the use of the name.

             Imran has strong roots in the N Virginia/Baltimore area, which is right in the heart of pizzagate country.  I also remember talk back in the day of a Saudi cargo company - that deals in live animals - working out of that area, along with the whole idea of the cargo actually being live human beings.  So the cargo transporation thing is really ringing my bells.

               <p>
                Looking Glass (or Operation Looking Glass) is the code name for an airborne command and control center operated by the United States. In more recent years it has been more officially referred to as the ABNCP (Airborne Command Post).[1][2] It provides command and control of U.S. nuclear forces in the event that ground-based command centers have been destroyed or otherwise rendered inoperable. In such an event, the general officer aboard the Looking Glass serves as the Airborne Emergency Action Officer (AEAO)[3] and by law assumes the authority of the National Command Authority and could command execution of nuclear attacks. The AEAO is supported by a battle staff of approximately 20 people, with another dozen responsible for the operation of the aircraft systems. The name Looking Glass, which is another word for a mirror, was chosen for the Airborne Command Post because the mission operates in parallel with the underground command post at Offutt Air Force Base.[4]

               Seems 'above board' if not abused, what caught my attention though, was this:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <h1>
                Current status
               </h1>
               <p>
                There was some speculation that the "mystery plane" seen flying over the White House on September 11, 2001, was some newer incarnation of Looking Glass. However, as indicated by retired Major General Donald Shepperd, speaking on CNN on September 12, 2007, the plane circling the White House on 9/11 resembled an E-4B which was likely launched from Nightwatch ground alert at Andrews Air Force Base.

              <p>
               Relevance unknown, but, it strikes me as odd, to say the least.

              I don't know.  I was just reporting what 4chan had on their page.  It is open for discussion.  We are all waiting to see if any of this comes to pass.  But we already know that the arrests have taken place, so we shall see.  Who knows how this may come out, it could come out in such a way that Trump is not implicated in releasing such info.  Or not at all.

             FBI Anon said Michael was a she....FBI Anon said he also gave false info to protect his identity...
            </p>
            <p>
             So then I Youtube'd the Usurper working out...

            <p>
             And Michael working out...
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFtkNok787s">

            <p>
             Point is...I'm confused AF and admit the possibility that Michael might have a fem-penis, but I am certain who would win in a fight.

               And she actually said in a sad voice ...... 'She is a transgender... we all know....' she used a scientific term! She got killed - how throat biopsy - a masonic code for throat chakra - ie She SAID TOO MUCH. I miss her. She would have had a field day with this madness. Those killers will be brought to justice as well as those pedocrats!

                 Just startpage FBI Anon transcript, and yes he mentioned that some of what he said was disinfo...good stuff and it is amazing it is still timely.  Here is the weird thing about FBI Anon on other websites...the shills have discovered that Killary having SAP level programs on her bathroom server was out in the news prior to FBI Anon.  Few of the plugged in people knew the significance because we stopped paying attention to the MSM a long time ago.  But here is what shuts them up...FBI Anon was the first to emphasize what SAP level programs were...and he was the first to mention that HRC was selling that info as well as people (human trafficking)...just FYI...I have seen that tactic on T_D and /pol/ now which kinda freaks me out.

                  no matter how you slice it, H's server, emails to fake identities (her own daughter was Diane Reynolds!) is undeniably criminal and shows intent. Comey' refusal to acknowledge these crimes is equally criminal. So selling the info is just one of many crimes.

                 <p>
                  Michelle Obama masquerading as a woman, I'm not sure that's a crime. If all you had was the one or two photos, you could claim some panty mishap excuse, but Joan Rivers statement and then death, makes me believe it 100%. Entire Obama admin is complete fraud.

               !  Lots to be thankful for this year, for sure.  I get a shit eating grin, spontaneously, from just thinking about these abusers jonesing for the baby blood that most certainly ain't flowing as freely as it used to.  May God damn them all to Hell.

                  I think so, there is a post on this, a few months ago. I doubt that Joan would have tarnished her reputation with a lie about this.

              I'm trying to find it. This site is so confusing. Maybe because I'm on an iPad. But I have 2 questions...
             </p>
             <p>
              Who is Meg?

              Wouldn't Sarah get in trouble if she was the poster? Wouldn't she be more careful?

                Thank you for being so nice and patient. I see the great view from up here from her Twitter or whatever. I looked at all the other pictures on the left too. I can't find anymore of her, I must be an idiot 😫 It's ok. I believe you tho.

             So Al-Waleed has been meddling in foreign governments (ours), and doing backroom deals with our corrupt officials along with possibly funding terrorists in the US. Trump calls him out on manipulating the American government. Al-Waleed doubles down on his bullshit. Trump wins, goes to Saudi Arabia, makes nice with the king, and sells some weapons under the condition that the king gets his kids in-line. Vegas happens, and a few weeks later the King goes full purge. 
How much do you want to bet he's going to turn over any and all information he has on corrupt officials in the US? If you think kike brigade went nuts over Russia wait until you hear the war rhetoric against the Saudis.

            Sounds like an attempted distraction more than an assassination attempt - may even be innocuous(or 'random'), would still recommend the officer receive adequate guard while in hospital, regardless of severity of injuries - given the timing of everything.

             From BBC news, July 2, 2015: Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has said he will donate his $32bn (£20bn; €29bn) personal fortune to charity.
The 60-year-old nephew of King Salman is one of the world's richest people.
He said he had been inspired by the Gates Foundation, set up by Bill and Melinda Gates in 1997.
The money would be used to "foster cultural understanding", "empower women", and "provide vital disaster relief", among other things, he said.
Mr Gates praised the decision, calling it an "inspiration to all of us working in philanthropy around the world".

            Oh yeah...Obama and Saudi...OG Birther here...always wondered why Alwaleed got the Usurper into Harvard.  Remember that Obama grew up as a Muslim in Indonesia and IMO is the son of that subud cult guy.  the resemblance is uncanny.

            Loretta Fuddy was also subud and certified the fake birth certificate and was subsequently suicided by diver in the water after a small plane crash...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v636AlaVmE
           </p>
           <p>
            So, the implications are that O is a true Manchurian Candidate for Alwaleed...his actions certainly point to that...Alwaleed is Twitter's largest shareholder,  Alwaleed at odds with Saudi ruling family, Alwaleed backs HRC, Alwaleed possible VIP in Vegas, Kushner tips Saudis off about possible coup, Alwaleed now in Saudi jail...looks like Trump just crushed a ruling family.  Can't wait to see what he has in store for Soros and Rothschild...

             i read the article b4 coming here, but i didn't see where it tied it to child trafficking. (of course i assumed that's what it was, but missed it in the article, so tired my eyes are blurry.) this is getting intense! we really need the troops to come home.

            Obama’s Harvard Years: Questions Swirl
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘New questions have been raised about Obama’s student loans and Obama’s ties to a radical Muslim activist who reportedly was raising money for Obama’s Harvard studies during the years 1988 to 1991.
           </p>
           <p>
            The allegations first surfaced in late March, when former Manhattan Borough president Percy Sutton told a New York cable channel that a former business partner who was “raising money” for Obama had approached him in 1988 to help Obama get into Harvard Law School.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the interview, Sutton says he first heard of Obama about twenty years ago from Khalid Al-Mansour, a Black Muslim and Black Nationalist who was a “mentor” to the founders of the Black Panther party at the time the party was founded in the early 1960s.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sutton described al-Mansour as advisor to “one of the world’s richest men,” Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Renowned global speaker, Muslim lawyer, black nationalist and author, Dr. Khalid Abdullah Tariq Al-Mansour  who made news in 2008 when it was revealed that he had been a patron of Barack Obama and had recommended him for admission to Harvard Law School in 1998, is co-founder of the International law firm of Al-Waleed, Al-Talal and Al-Mansour and Special Advisor to Saudi Arabian Prince, His Royal Highness Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulazziz.
              <em>
               (bin Talal was the very same Saudi who had offered New York $10 million to help the city rebuild after 9/11, but who had his gift refused by Mayor Rudy Guiliani.)
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              ...According to Percy Sutton, al-Mansour had asked him to “please write a letter in support of [Obama] … a young man that has applied to Harvard.” Sutton had friends at Harvard and gladly did so.
             </p>
             <p>
              Khalid al-Mansour was a piece of work. Although impressively well connected, the Texan-born attorney and black separatist had not met the paranoid racial fantasy unworthy of his energy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ben Smith, then of Politico, took the lead in killing the story. Shortly after the story broke, Smith ran the disclaimer that “Barack Obama’s campaign is flatly denying a story told by former Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The Obama camp, in fact, denied that Obama even knew al-Mansour. Smith then talked to al-Mansour. At first, al-Mansour avoided contradicting Sutton’s story out of respect for Sutton, “a dear friend.” When pressed, however, al-Mansour disowned Sutton’s story. “The scenario as it related to me did not happen,” he reportedly told Smith.

             Could Al-Mansour (Donald Warden) also have been a CIA asset? (just wondering)
            </p>
            <p>
             Who is Khalid al-Mansour?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Born the 11th of 12 children as Donald Warden to a polyglot father who often spoke glowingly about Islam, al-Mansour decided to change his name in 1964 after learning Arabic and studying Islam.
             </p>
             <p>
              Al-Mansour’s rise to fame and fortune began with an introduction to the Saudi king in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 1977.
             </p>
             <p>
              He met and befriended Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the world’s 19-thealthiest person, when the prince was studying at Menlo College in California in the late 1970s. Al-Mansour’s law partner was representing the prince in a court case in California.
             </p>
             <p>
              After 1979....The two began to work together, and the prince asked him to help him invest in Africa. “He said, let’s make our focus turning Africa around. He has never told me until today where this idea came from, but it became an obsession.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Al-Mansour says he and the prince flew from country to country as he introduced the prince to heads of state. “It was easy for me, because I knew all the presidents.”

             As far as Barack Obama is concerned Al Mansour declined  to answer questions about him (in 2008)
            </p>
            <p>
             Sounds like BO (son of a CIA Communist mom) was recruited by an Islamic Black Supremacist.  Given how his presidency was all about dividing people his actions support the idea. ONLY BLM BLM  BLM

             <p>
              Valerie Jarrett’s Father-in-Law was a Communist – Worked with Obama Mentor Frank Marshall Davis
             </p>
             <p>
              Later that year, Frank Marshall Davis left Chicago for Hawaii to work on the Honolulu Record, then edited and run by Communist Party member Koji Ariyoshi.
             </p>
             <p>
              While the Communist Party in Hawaii faded into the Democratic party and the International Longshore Workers Union, there is no evidence that Frank Marshall Davis ever stopped being a communist. As late as 1973, three years after Davis met and began mentoring the 10 year old Barack Obama, he was still listed as an endorser of one of the party’s oldest fronts, the Committee for Protection of Foreign Born.
             </p>
             <p>
              Vernon Jarrett was aware of Barack Obama’s career from its early stages and became an influential supporter.

               Interesting background on the Jarrett women...yikes.  Don't marry one. Or don't divorce one lol.
              </p>
              <p>
               So Communism, CIA, Black Supremacist movement, Islam, and Saudi Arabian prince who loves to make investments in the US, including getting Barry Soetero into Harvard. (and the story of investing in America's minorities, in my other post).  The account of how his Saudi Angel helped him was shut down by the press, Media Matters (Soros Brock), during his run for POTUS 2008.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thinking back...His ties to Bill Ayers radical leftist, terrorist.
              </p>
              <p>
               Recall he had ties to Tony Rezko, and I remember when BO was running I found that he had supporters tied to Hezbollah I believe.  A couple of brothers or cousins, they were in Iraq or getting ready to go (I forget), but they made sure to vote for BO first!  Then there was the case where he wanted to bring in Iraqis to train in Chicago, then supposedly send them back to help the US. (Why train in Chicago?)  That from off the top of my head trying to remember from 2007.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just found an interesting quote of his in a 2006 speech..  "In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda. And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way."
              </p>
              <p>
               He had been to Iraq as well.

                  Writing two days before his death, Reyes tells his comrades that "the gringos," working through Ecuador's government, are interested "in talking to us on various issues."
"They say the new president of their country will be (Barack) Obama," he writes, saying Obama rejects both the Bush administration's free trade agreement with Colombia and the current military aid program.

            Dude...I have been there...it is crazy...around #46 or so, everybody was down because it seemed like Q might have been a larp...and the BOOM!

            BTW, I theorized that instead of a name, could Q perhaps refer to the James Bond character "Q" who was a Quartermaster...and might that relate to anyone in the Pres. Trump Admin?

             You are more correct than you realize... MGM/Fleming/James Bond... it's a LONG story, but, from what I can tell, MGM/Fleming are good people, James bond films are littered with clues. I had planned to address this in my research, but, the MGM angle keeps getting a bit rabbit-holey for me, while I have other more important subjects to cover.

              So the are trying to expand the Muslim Brotherhood.  Do you remember that article Sacha Fal that people said was trash?  It was about Huma and some of her family and a house in Michigan.  I think there was something to it, imo.  Wow  Barack Obama is the Manchurian Candidate.   We are living the Movie In Real Life Time.

               Obama is more likely CIA ... maybe MKULTRA victim.
              </p>
              <p>
               Who knows how many "Manchurian Candidates" the CIA created?
              </p>
              <p>
               Meanwhlle, looks like the Vatican -- as has been rumored -- created Islamic religion.
              </p>

               The Islamic Connection / Total Onslaught - Walter Veith

                https://youtu.be/QCmSBfVXEmAYouTube

              </p>
              <p>
               Iow's, Vatican isn't only responsible for the immense violence the RCC is 
responsible for, but also for the violence of Islam.
              </p>
              <p>
               And the US/CIA has worked also along those lines to try to create a more
violent strain of Islam.
              </p>
              <p>
               This was one of their most successful efforts as children reading 
violent passages from school text books about JIHAD appeared 
on TV's everywhere across the US ... and it was believed ...
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Have you heard about the Afghan Jihad schoolbook scandal?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Or perhaps I should say, "Have you heard about the Afghan Jihad schoolbook scandal that's waiting to happen?"
               </p>
               <p>
                Because it has been almost unreported in the Western media that the US government shipped, and continues to ship, millions of Islamist textbooks into Afghanistan.
               </p>
               <p>
                Only one English-speaking newspaper we could find has investigated this issue: the Washington Post. The story appeared March 23rd.
               </p>
               <p>
                Washington Post investigators report that during the past twenty years the US has spent millions of dollars producing fanatical schoolbooks, which were then distributed in Afghanistan.
               </p>
               <p>
                "The primers, which were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines, have served since then as the Afghan school system's core curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books..." -- Washington Post, 23 March 2002 (1)
               </p>
               <p>
                According to the Post the U.S. is now "...wrestling with the unintended consequences of its successful strategy of stirring Islamic fervor to fight communism."
               </p>
               <p>
                So the books made up the core curriculum in Afghan schools. And what were the unintended consequences? The Post reports that according to unnamed officials the schoolbooks "steeped a generation in violence."
               </p>
               <p>
                How could this result have been unintended? Did they expect that giving fundamentalist schoolbooks to schoolchildren would make them moderate Muslims?
               </p>
               <p>
                Nobody with normal intelligence could expect to distribute millions of violent Islamist schoolbooks without influencing school children towards violent Islamism. Therefore one would assume that the unnamed US officials who, we are told, are distressed at these "unintended consequences" must previously have been unaware of the Islamist content of the schoolbooks.
               </p>
               <p>
                But surely someone was aware. The US government can't write, edit, print and ship millions of violent, Muslim fundamentalist primers into Afghanistan without high officials in the US government approving those primers.

               Remember, as well, that the Vatican is also one of the oldest repositories of secret knowledge --
from occult, to UFO's/aliens -- and probably have the greatest knowledge of what torture does
to human beings which they would have amassed during "The Inquisition" and "Witch Burnings."
              </p>
              <p>
               Likely during WWII they passed this knowledge onto Hitler/Nazis -- aided Allen Dulles and Prescott
Bush and Elites internationally in funding Hitler and two years before it was actually over, it's pretty
clear that they also helped in bringing out the gold/$$ and in bringing out the ex-Nazis who were
brought to the US/Operation Paperclip.

                I now realize he was CIA.  I also know the Vatican is responsible for much of the evil happening with the Refugees.  Yes, I had heard of the books before.  We can blame much of this also on George Soros, whom I am sure is helping fund many of the CIA's projects.

                 Don't know what evidence may float out about Obama and CIA ... but
as far as I know it is only now still rumor that he may have been CIA/MKULTRA.
Family was connected to CIA it seems.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Glad you know about the violent textbooks -- it was another way US/CIA attempted to create a more violent Islamic religion.  Frightened the hell out of Americans here.  People actually believed it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Who knows who George Soros really is -- certainly not a liberal.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Was watching a video by former Canadian official -- maybe PM? -- Paul Hellyer re UFO's yesterday
... and he makes clear that it is a pyramid with about 100 wealthy families at the top who create all
of this havoc ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 there is no reason for poverty, for depressions, for unemployment or wars ...
this is always to create fear and chaos in society -- to keep public disunited.
And to enrich the already wealthy.

                  Yes, and they are always telling how there will not be enough food, there are too many people, etc.  This all feeds into their plan.  There is plenty of abundance for all of us.  We are all willing to share, They are not.

               Sorcha Faal also has to inject truth sprinkles, otherwise they would not even stand ground. This is by NO MEANS a vindication of, or to declare Sorcha Faal to be a legitimate source! Their (dis)info peddlement more often than not insert bullshit truths amongst the truth nuggets to divert away the greater narrative from Cabal's activities and condemning trails.

               This whole thing is controlled, it's the "Culling of the Deepstate Outskirts" as I wrote about here:

               Let everyone be reminded there are "Inversion Agents" of the Satanic NWO cabal at work here on this very forum. They present them on the "good" side of history; their task is to keep global (PG) research WITHIN THE CONFINES AND CORRALS of the intended culling of the outskirts. Thus:
              </p>
              <p>
               Clinton Cartel, Saudis. But, going beyond this "corral" is being derailed and censored big-time here. Global research efforts SHOULD NOT STOP at the plate with offered up outskirts offenders like Hillary, the Podesta's, these corrupts Sauds involved in traffic etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               PUNCH THROUGH to the core of the (zio) satanic sectarian kabbalah and eject the entirety of the parasite. Not just the outskirts, its disposable tentacles! Get to the body of the parasite.

                Thank you for your explanation.  Yes, many times the cabal hides behind coming out and standing up for laws against human trafficking and other similar laws to keep their record clean when at the same time they are involved in the crimes of the elite.  We ave to keep pushing for they are constantly finding ways to cover their sins.  It is hard to dig deep for their plans and operations are designed in such a way to keep us from getting to the bottom of the Rabbit Hole.  We must not stop.

             Kevdude wants to delete this but cant. He is not on your side. He is aware there is a backlash because of the pedo mods here so he is doing damage control. One of the accounts he pinged was one of his alts, aka the most hated mod here.

                I can prove it and have before. The only one who can confirm is putt himself yet he has publicly lied so nothing he can say can be verified.

               Same here!  I said it was Sarah Huckabee Sanders and then I deleted it too.  Thought she'd have to stay behind to do press conferences, so i second guessed myself.  How do you know for sure?

                 I was just reading through this thread again and I believe that particular "Q" was one of the shills. I found the "feet" pic they cropped a few days ago. I don't come around here much anymore, been real busy and I don't trust this place.

                  Thanks for posting and correcting this. It's important that we fact check everything and this was simply pure specuation. I thought I'd deleted all the posts about it, but it seems I'd missed this one, so thank you!
                 </p>

                  I understand your need for a break, it's important. It would be good to see you around more again.

               Whoever it is likes to add Bible quotes and references to God which would be consistent with the daughter of a minister. Gov Huckabee is a Baptist minister.

             Dude..the TLDR would take hours...basically Dr. President has a time machine because his grandfather was tasked to look over Nicola Tesla's research, because of this, he just eviscerated a Saudi Royal family that happened to install Obama into the Presidency and heavily funded HRC as well as owned most of Twitter.   This is a prelude to eviscerating the swamp.   Swamp likely shitting pants right now.

Any bad habbening worldwide, CIA is at least tangentially involved.

             There's no short version which does any justice, but, Hollywood fuckery has the Podestas et al, on the ropes; "it's all coming down", so to speak... at least, that appears to be the case at the moment.

               They are end enemies. Why do you think SA was do pissed at the Iran nuclear deal. I'm pretty sure the crown Prince just took out rogue Saudi elements who were working against the country. Think of them as the deep state of Saudi Arabia.

            The Saudia Arabia thing is a transfer of wealth related to Aramco which is the largest oil company in the world. Basically in a nutshell the majority of the Saudi Royal family is being cut out of the deal and will no longer be the middlemen. The new King arrested tons of the Royal Family and froze their assets.
           </p>
           <p>
            The new King as been saying for the last two or three years that Saudia Arabia needs to diversify. Trump is asking them to list the oil company on the New York Stock Exchange.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl;dr The London/U.S. banking criminals are stealing Saudia Arabia's assets using the new king of Saudia Arabia to do it.

              The last thing to escape from Pandora's Box was "Hope." It was the last thing to escape because when its gone then a person truly has nothing left. When that happens people might become dangerous and take action against their oppressors.

              I try not to smoke the Hopium. I would rather "follow the money."

              Who was Bill Clinton? His tagline was "The Man From Hope." He gave people a lot of Hope and a lot fuckings as he stole them blind.
             </p>
             <p>
              What did Obama promise? "Hope and Change." He gave people a lot of Hope and a lot of fuckings as he stole them blind.
             </p>
             <p>
              Right now people are smoking a lot of Hopium. Its tempting but "follow the money" is a better pair of glasses.

              If you don't believe it then why has the republicans been hawking about Iran? Iran isn't bothering anybody and hasn't attacked anybody in a hundred years. We are entering the completion phase of the original intention of the Balfour Declaration which was the agreement to let the "jews" have a country of their own in the middle east. That whole move was a long range plan to strip the middle east of its resources. I would say it has gone pretty damn well considering that every country that had big mineral resources and no Rothschild bank got the shit bombed out of it.

              Wishful thinking. This is not about "giving those evil baby fucking democrats what they deserve." This is two criminal factions fighting over wealth. It has been known for decades by those that understand the plan for the middle east. The Saudi royal family has been allowed to wallow in money instead of getting bombed into the stone age because the family was useful.
             </p>
             <p>
              The western oligarchs have been using the royal family as patsys to help take over the oil fields of the middle east. Saudia Arabia was always slated as the last jewel in the middle eastern crown to fall when they no longer were needed.
             </p>
             <p>
              The plan to capture the middle eastern oil fields has been completed. Western oligarchs how have control of middle eastern oil. Now they want those billions they royal family has been paid as a middleman fees. I have known this for at least six years.

              Trump explicitly asked the Saudis to list Aramco Oil on the New York Stock Exchange recently. Google it. Jared Kushner is also working the deal.

              As bad as I hate it this is nothing more than two criminal factions fighting over power and wealth. Some of the democrats may get taken revenge on in this criminal squabble but that is all it is.

                Sometimes it is necessary. Best of all world is that the whole satanic hoard be locked up because you know how they operate. If left to their own devices they will never stop attempting to destroy all that is good and wholesome. But if a deal has to be struck with some unsavory characters to purge the people that are currently running the child abuse rings then that is just the way it has to be.
               </p>
               <p>
                If we purge them from access to our children they will still operate in the background though because that is what they do. We have to start somewhere though.

                 They may have realized that in cyber age their satanic rituals will not go undetected and the NWO cmmand decided to initiate the purge. I always suspected that the Russian hacking was in fact real but they are not telling Americans that Putin the former KJB spy has all the info and that is why they gave it to Trump. Like you said, gotta start somewhere.

               Sadly, your assessment makes the most sense to me. Despite all this excitement in the last few days I've not been able to reconcile Trump's clear alliance with the Zionists. Am I wrong in thinking they'll try to pin 9/11 on the "bad" Saudis that have been arrested to take heat off the Israelis?

                You are not wrong the threat was made long ago. Remember the infamous missing "28 pages" of information from 911 that were released? Around that time they were drafting legislation to allow members of the american public who lost loved ones on 911 to sue the Saudi Government. That was a direct threat.

                I hate it as bad as the next guy but the evidence is right under our nose. AIPAC is chomping at the bit to bomb Iran and give them a central bank headquartered out of London also known as a Rothschild bank. They may be the only bank left that isn't one. Rumor has it that North Korea and Cuba don't have one but I don't know if its true.

                Iran isn't bothering anybody and hasn't attacked anybody in a hundred years. Our Pres said repeatedly he wasn't happy about the settlement made with Iran which is saber rattling in Iran's direction.

                 Thank you for the added clarity. I do remember the missing info re: 911. We might hate the truth but I'd rather know what I'm facing than believe a lie. You've known much longer than I have that the only way we can win is for enough of us to recognize the real truth rather than believe what we'd prefer to be the truth.

              Thanks again for all your efforts in here.  The threads on 4chan/pol will go down in history.  I love it when people say, "WE NEED A NEW BAKER. WE NEED A BAKER!"  Epic.  You're doing a phenomenal job distilling everything and summarizing it here.  Bravo, man.  Thanks again.

                , I learned how to post on 4chan, finally.  The only place there I go is /pol and only for these threads.  It's amazing.  I contribute where I can but mainly just encourage.  Breadcrumb by breadcrumb we are baking loaves of the most important bread ever.   The bread of life, not death.  Keep up the great work and rest assured, everyone of you white hats, that we are winning.  And I don't know about you, but I'm not sick of winning yet.  As you wind down afree a long, tiring day, just take solace in knowing that Anthony Weiner is spending his first night in a locked cell out east.  Hah!
