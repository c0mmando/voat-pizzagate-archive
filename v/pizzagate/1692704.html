<p>At 20:10 he says Weiner sent a picture to the girl depicting him in a &quot;sexual pose or sexual activity&quot; and his little son lying next to him. Maybe it was the same picture he sent to a woman according to the New York Post </p>

            my twitter account has been closed down for talking about pizzagate. they are slowly but surely censoring the subject so the masses will just forget about it eventually and they can all get on with the business of raping and trafficking children for profit

             That's what they hope for. But I pray they will not succeed and finally go down. We must not stop talking about it, find ways around the censorship. You can also use gab.ai instead of twitter.

             I'm not much active here and I'm not an investigator myself, that's right. I'm just a lurker, for a few months now, but that's not a sock puppet account. As I said above, I was not familar with all the details of the Weiner case as I'm not from the US. Sorry, if that was old news for you. It was new for me, and maybe some other folks are unaware of it, too. I found the video worth sharing and I didn't find it anywhere here on voat.
