<blockquote>
<p>Negligent investigation by the Tacoma Police Department failed to protect two children who were sexually abused by a convicted sex offender their mother was dating, a lawsuit alleges.
The minors, identified in the civil action as 11-year-old M.E. and 9-year-old J.E., filed the complaint against the city Aug. 23 in Pierce County Superior Court.
It alleges, in part, that investigators missed signs of sexual abuse in the home on one occasion and should have known the mother’s boyfriend had been convicted of a prior sex crime when they talked to him on another occasion. As a result of the negligent investigation, the girls were subject to “repeated acts of sexual assault,” according to the suit;.</p>
<p>An officer checked on the girls in 2011 after one of them told her father she’d taken her mom’s medicine and gotten sick, the lawsuit states.
On that visit, the officer noticed there was garbage and other items covering the floor of the children’s room, including pornography.
“The presence of pornography in the young girls’ bedroom was a red flag for potential child sexual abuse, yet this was not investigated further,” according to the lawsuit.
The officer decided the living conditions weren’t suitable for kids but didn’t remove the girls from the home.</p>

            When they are taken away and not returned to the parents maybe some officers are afraid to put the kids into the CPS System.  IDK, it can be a hard choice, no?  What do you do when this is the choice?  I am not saying that is the reason, maybe he was a bad LE person.  But the alternative is not always good. Such bad stuff going on in all the states, imo.  Also, could they have been protecting this guy?  There are too many answers now I am afraid.  The ones to feel really sad for are those poor girls.
