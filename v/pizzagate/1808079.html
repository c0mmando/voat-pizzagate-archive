            Even assuming Trump is an illuminati freemason pedo mobster double agent fraud, which is not totally clear considering that he kicked Epstein out of the Mar a Lago and once tweeted that pedos should get the death penalty, for corporate branding purposes alone it would seem like bad business for Trump to side with the pedo mafia when so many potential resort guests around the world are clearly getting fed up with these perverts.  At the Mar o Lago, for example, the resort guests were tired of Epstein stealing their towel girls and hitting on their daughters.  Whatever the deal is with Trump, his hand may be forced.

            I dunno, I saw his interview with Hagmann, and he was pretty mealy mouthed about the whole thing. His goal isn't to bust anyone, it's to raise awareness via a documentary. That's all he's doing. I think he's out here by the deep state to quell our anger, and make us believe there is a warrior who's gonna take care of the pedos for us.

            We all have our limits. I read enough to convnice myself of the reality of pizzagate, but stopped as it was really creaping me out. As for Trump, I still hope, but the chances of jail for the elites is small.

            People are fundamentally insane. They will not believe something they don't want to. I heard a well-done report on what Russians think of Putin. While it is not unreasonable that they support him, the majority disbelief that he could have had his opponents killed is a disconnect from reality. Those that see their grandmother in Hillary are not going accept she could do wrong, much less, pizzagate, no matter what the evidence. Also, for examples of insanity: Sweden, Merkel, etc.

            In fact I did choose to live among uncorrupted people. They are called Muslims and there's tons of low cost beautiful countries to choose from with respectable virgin girls who don't let rock stars molest them.  Unlike your cunt mother.  ME? A TROLL?

             Breh. "uncorrupted people" = Muslims? They cut off their kids' dicks, in the Jewish tradition. Only difference is that they don't suck the kids' dick after they permanently mutilate it. You can't just paint the world in huge strokes. It too varied. The Freemasons/Illuminati own it all. Fuck off of the guy's username.

              You know full well only some hasids suck the d.  Muslims do it at age 6 or 8 or something.

              Sure Islam may be no more than a loose plagiarism of their semitic cousins.  But any illiterate Arab peasant knows more about the JQ than most here.  I don't care about usernames but he's spamming and it's in poor taste to flaunt a Satanists song.  Listening to music is fine.  Although again the Muslims predicted pop music and mockey mouse being used as mind control among pther things and we all laughed and laughed at them as we read Zionist outlets like memri.org which translates Muslim media to mock them.  Muslims are our natural allies.

            This has been going on for eons since Babylon and before that even.  Even if we got handed a John Podesta indictment on a silver platter this would not end.  Does that mean people should give up?  NO

            I understand your frustration but when things get darkest for you, just remember how dark and bleak it is for those children who even today have been abused and tortured.  Logic says there is no way we can save them all.  But maybe we can save some.  We can believe and give a voice to the ones that escape and come forward.  We can keep shinning light on this infection when ever we can.  We can try.  We can keep trying.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a spiritual war ultimately but we can try to lessen the impact of these evil people.
           </p>
           <p>
            We all need breaks because its so overwhelming.  However, no matter how distressed I feel about it, it is nothing compared to what these children are going through.

            Being a member of the "elite" society is a private club.  You are initiated or you are annihilated.   No outsiders allowed.  If you can't set aside your "care" and participate in these rituals then they will take you down.  Trump is either an ignorant outsider they are trying to take down....or he's one of them.

             I agree that after taking a little break, it is the thought of what the children, who would also choose to take a break if they could, are suffering through. And then there's some good news of pedo busts, or badass commentary on Voat, and my spirits are up again, and I'm ready to go. But this is tough stuff. I've never been the same since learning about Hampstead...

              I almost wrote that in my previous post....  Those Hampstead children haunt me daily still.  It's been two and a half years and they are locked away in a corrupt system.   But when you consider all the survivor stories and their commonalities regardless of location around the world you know that this abuse and murder is wide spread and pervasive as well as organized.
             </p>

              what hope do these children have without people fighting for them?

            How long did it take to overturn slavery and Segregation in America?
How long has it taken to find the US guilty of genocide vs the native American and restore their land?
How long has it taken to gain civil rights for homosexuals?
How long has it taken to stop the warmongering by the US and actual wars?
How long has it taken for women to reach true Constitutional equality in the US?

            None of this is over yet, but no one is bailing out on fighting against these injustices.

            See Detective Rothstein on simply NYPD spending more than 50 years of investigating pedophile rings where three investigations ended up being stopped by higher up's.  One of those investigations even reached the level of NY State and hearings in Albany.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the break in.
            </p>
            <p>
             LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress.   Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rothstein also comments that our military is involved in this child trafficking/pedophile rings.

             Lol get your non red pilled ass out of here please.  Before you find me or my dad "guilty" of slavery and genocide LOL.  Slavery was not a good economic system and would have died anyway. The South lost remember? Their slave labor didn't do any good and the richest states were still nortjern.

              Slavery existed here with Columbus and was authorized by Papal Edicts -- as basis to enslave or murder native peoples here and Africans enslaved here.

             <p>
              And it went on 250 years or more in US.  Not bad for a failing business -- !!!

             <p>
              The South lost -- certainly the people of the South lost everything -- but Elites in the South didn't.

              It wasn't Southern Elites who died in the Civil War, it was ordinary people in the South who didn't own slaves.

            I am so sorry to see a new person go who like me has been following the controversy since day #1. In being a lurker one is separate and apart and can thus see the trends and they are not good. Burn out is beginning to show. If you make critique you are labeled a shill. This community will never have an opportunity like this to help catch a pedo, what with a Republican Congress,  a Republican  president who is on board and a Congressman like Trey Gowdy who can deliver on legislation and conduct investigations and who is on record that elite pedos must be brought down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless there is a return to researching elite pedos in Washington DC then you folks are spinning your wheels and willl drift into obscurity in due course. The fact that MSM has launched a full frontal attack on pizzagate on behalf of Alefantis indicates a nerve has been.struck. I urge you, no I implore you to pledge that for the  next 4 weeks you will do nothing but submit research relative to DC. Given how large this community has become, you might see some amazing research. Trey Gowdy listened to and admired the research tips on the destruction of Hillary's emails. It's now time to give him the blueprint he needs to build a case.

             True, Trump may not turn out to be the "godsend" that some of his supporters thought he would be.
Do we really know yet?
            </p>
            <p>
             IMO, Trump is there to deny Global Warming which is the primary issue.
And to stop population control across the world which is essential in helping the planet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Elites/wealthy do not want the public to understand the true perils of Global Warming or that they are imminent, not something in some far distant future.

             AND what many don't understand is that we had a 50 year gap where the harm done to nature and our weather systems wasn't really visible or being felt.  However, right now, we are feelings the effects of the harm done to Nature/Global Warming up to about 1967.  Think of all the damage done after that time.  We will have increasing weather events in number and severity.  And due to the melting of the glaciers which shifts the pressures on the tectonic plates, we will also have increase earthquakes in number and severity.

            Take courage my friend... we are all in this together until the end. Peace to you and yours. The frustration is real. We are fasting and praying every Tuesday night sundown to Wednesday night sundown. There are people in places around the world that are humbly petitioning the FATHER to release HIS people from this awful bondage that we are in. The SPIRIT can go where no man can follow. All will be revealed in due time 🙂 ...

             , I know what your name means in Russian. It means HOPE!
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm going with hope, as discouraging and exhausting as this investigation can be -- sometimes it's necessary to take a break, and I often do, but those who are game need to fight this thing to the bitter end! I hope you're right about unseen help coming from the spiritual side, meanwhile we can and should continue as though everything depends on us.

             Thats what I was saying to my wife earlier, (not in your words but close) I said I will leave it to the higher power to take over (my high power happens to be Jesus) I understand some see it as something else . thats ok but GOOD will always prevail and I am personally praying that he steps in and ends this soon

               Jesus is here, but that doesn't mean we get to sit back and do nothing. He had disciples for a reason. He can use our help. We are indeed helping. But it's going to take a miracle to take this satanic system down. And I believe in miracles.

                Well, "Jesus" is here in your mind - not everyone's.
And he's run by organized patriarchal religion -- male-supremacist religion -- which underpins patriarchy.
So, not a good thing.
And "Jesus" is a successor to a story told many, many times previously.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is no Satan and there is no Devil -- these are invented boogie men to frighten the public.
And it's why it's coupled with "sacrifice" and ritual acts and abuse of children.
These people are cowards.  It takes awareness on the part of the public, not miracles.

                 The devil's greatest trick was to make you believe he doesn't exist. But as long as people are out trying to raise awareness, it doesn't really matter whether we come together on this.

                  Again, the "Jesus" story is not original, but repeated dozens of times in history with different names.
Devil &amp; Satan are creations of elite patriarchy with the use of male-supremacist religions to frighten and control the public.
You have to decide whether you want to be controlled by fear, or not.
Fear is one method of mind control.
There will be no "miracle" to solve pedophilia and human trafficking, or drug trafficking or any other kind of corruption.

                   You happen to be typing to someone who experienced a miracle. I fell 10 stories and died. I met God and know the score. Talk to me after you've had what they call a near death experience. Until then, it's best to admit you don't know for sure. I really do think God has a hand in overturning evil, and pizzagate is the very epitome of it. I even think that our discovering as much as we have constitutes a miracle. We investigators participate in it, but not in the absence of a loving God who DOES plan on putting pedos in their place.

                    I didn't say that I am without spirituality and believe it is universal, but that there is no "god" in the sky for then we must ask
who created him?  I do think there's a possibility that reincarnation is likely as nature produces flower bulbs which bloom again
for 200 years and more.  I do think it likely that we get to walk in "someone else's shoes."  I used to think that perhaps 100 or
more lives were possible, but perhaps it's 1,000?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also think that ET's and UFO's have long been studied in secret and likely  they are based, as well, on this planet and the moon and within our oceans.
Originally, I had confidence that higher intelligence brings wisdom and justice, but now there seems to be no guarantee of that.
Some suggest that our planet is being run by draco-reptilians who are very aggressive.  And that they may control a few other planets.
I think we've seen enough of the "bird with one wing" here on this planet to know that it doesn't fly and has only done great harm to 
humanity and the planet.  Thus, neither do I hold any favor for theories that we can pollute and destroy one planet and then move out 
into the universe to another to destroy that and move on again. 
What I do hold with is what the female native of the Bikini Islands said as she and her fellow citizens were being moved off of their Island
so that the US could test atomic bombs there ...
"Americans are really smart about really stupid things."

                   <p>
                    There aren't endless choices about "god."
                    <br/>
                    Either he/she can do things that he/she hasn't done because he/she is incapable or disinclined.
If we are going to thank "god" for saving us from catastrophe and plane crashes, then we must also blame "god" when
we are run down by automobiles or crash down in an airplane.

                     I've blamed God a lot of times for shitty things. It's ok. He can take it. And I don't mean He as in a male being, it's just that when I was on the other side, I heard his voice, and it's a deep rumble like a subwoofer, rattling every atom of you. In general, this is all probably the most difficult thing to discuss. So much comes down to personal experience. From my experience, the shitty things that have happened to me (probably paying off karma) always ended up becoming a positive. I'm in a wheelchair from the fall, but I wouldn't trade it to be able to walk yet not have this NDE under my belt. So I can't judge that what looks like shitty experiences for other people actually are. If this is a metaphysical world, then things can't be judged on the surface level. That's why it's so hard to discuss, we don't know the whole story. Did the car that plowed into someone actually save them from something worse? Did it bring the victims family together in a way that couldn't have happened otherwise? Are we really here to have a cushy life with no strife? Or is this more like a play, and a school, a place to save our own soul as well as helping others? This was the stuff I learned after dying. A pain free life is not what we are promised, and it doesn't always lead to us becoming selfless servants to our fellow humans, who need us to be. It is greed and selfishness that is destroying this planet and keeping the people suffering. A good wake up call looks painful and unfair on the surface, but in the spiritual realm, if it turns someone into a more compassionate person concerned with others, the personal momentary pain doesn't matter.

                    <p>
                     One thing I was told after I came back from the other side, was "test me". It's ok to test God. To pray and then see what happens. Take some mushrooms and see what God has to show us. He is real, in a personal way. That's what I believe anyway.

                      Actually, I've heard "his" voice and it's nothing like that. . .  It's soft, sweet and comforting.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Also George W Bush heard his voice because he claimed that "God" spoke to him and told him to
attack Afghanistan and then at a later time to attack Iraq.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      W mentioned nothing about a subwoofer.
So who is anyone to believe -- you, me or W?
                      <br/>
                      How many people have heard "god's" voice?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This isn't difficult to discuss -- many people have had "after life experiences" --
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And, consider the play...."MY TOWN" where the young newly wed female's after-death experience is a large
part of the play.

                     <p>
                      Life is about pleasure as most of nature shows us in its beauty and in spirit of place/tranquility.
The Dali Lama actually wrote a whole book based on that theory.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Pain and suffering are part of the male-supremacist "god" model -- and so is guilt and belief in punishment.
Think of the Old World Religion where there is no Satan, no Devil and no Heaven or Hell.
That religion and spiritual state was based in Nature.
Beware of those with a strong urge to punish.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It is organized patriarchal religion which has given license to Elite patriarchy and their crimes against humanity.
"Manifest Destiny" and "Man's Dominion Over Nature" are the licenses issued to elites to exploit nature, natural resources,
animal life -- and even other human beings according to various myths of "inferiority."
All of this provided the way and the will to destroy Nature - and at this point in our lives Global Warming makes clear that they succeeded.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And our Founders as well created an Elite Patriarchy.

                      Meanwhile, here are two quotes by Emile Zola to think about --

                      <strong>
                       A god of kindness would be charitable to all. Your god of wrath and punishment is but a monstrous phantasy

                         The Dalai Lama is a political, not a religious leader. And he's full of shit. Funded by the CIA.

                          Obviously, much of the pain suffered in our nation -- and pain which we extend to other nations by warmongering and gun-running and drug-running -- could be avoided.  These things go on because of corruption and violence by leaders.

                         <p>
                          As far as I can see -- and it's my personal opinion -- Nature is about beauty and pleasure ...
which is why we had to be taught by male-supremacist religion that every bit of pleasure is likely wrong -- especially if it had anything to do with sex.

            Take a break. Don't give up.  We need you back. We all have our moments, but we can't stop as this is far too important to stop. Then they win. That is not an option when kids are involved.

              This is why Pizzagate is banned on the donald. Donaldo is part of the Illuminati/Freemasonic/Satanist plan. Our entire political schema is a show at this point.

               Pizzagate gets posted on the Donald fairly often, especially when you consider that it could get the entire subreddit banned.

            Sorry to see you go silverbug. I thought Trump was a sell out at first too. I was pissed off when he started bombing Syria. I was fucking livid. Then the news reports started trickling in that of the 59 missiles only half hit their target and they didn't damage any airplanes. Full Stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no fucking way half the missiles failed and there is no way 25 Tomahawk missiles couldn't take out a single plane. That attack was pure theater. I've followed this story for the past 6 months and am starting to get a feel for what is real and what isn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if that attack was pure theater that means there is a takedown in progress. Those 59 missiles were fired to make it appear Trump wasn't doing Russia's bidding. That's going to be important when the Coup de grâce enters stage left.
           </p>
           <p>
            This fucking charade is going to be ending soon. It has to. We don't have a government anymore. In the remote possibility Trump doesn't take it down then the military will. They took an oath to defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic. That ain't something you can ignore. Enough's enough. May God Speed The Plow.

             If it was just Syria but it's not.  We are now in Somalia, more troops to Afghanistan, Yemen before all of this, war on weed is back on the docket, several reversals on things that help workers and worker safety and this is just for starters.  Trump is deep state.

             Good thing is the 'controlled opposition' was red pilled in massive numbers and just might not go back to sleep this time.

               I wondered that too until it dawned on me what controlled opposition means.  'Seems like' trump as the straw man was not supposed to garner so much response but it snowballed.  Hill was such an unpleasant candidate and so sick/drunk with so much baggage it was decided to let him win and Hill was not pleased.  Keep in mind her fireworks planned for election night were cancelled week before but they kept stringing her along that she would really win.  Trump gets in, ppl feel vindicated, he hits the ground running, opposition is happy...and the regular scheduled programming is back in place.  If Hill had been elected (by hook or crook) and escalated Syria there might have been riots in the streets/more so on the order of the viet protest.  With trump you still have his devotees going it's 5 d chess, well, he'll at least do some good things, better than Hill etc.  The Syria thing being blamed on Ivanka was just a cover story to look plausible.

               I'm not sure how (or if) the reversal on limiting vaccines vs some fed mandatory thing will be pulled off but I wouldn't be surprised.
Also how to get out of TPP...maybe a new and improved version with trump going this is really huge, bigly, you'll love it.
They will push thru as much as they can before ppl really revolt then probably hang him out to dry and in comes Pence.
All speculation of course but possibilities.

               Reversal of private prisons...um, what could be up there I wonder???
Also the sticky of an armed population but trump has no problem doing a 180.  Still too soon for that bc that would deff cause a revolution.
Um, maybe that ties in with the revival of private prisons?  Inquiring minds~

               But I don't discount that there are others who do not want what is happening and they might be working in the background...time will give more details.
Trumpster was the catalyst...so it's still all good.  Better than the resignation that has been going on for forever/since viet nam protest basically.

               Plus states got a whiff of state's rights and I don't see that going away any time soon.

               One more thing, when it was down to Hill and trump I said at least he doesn't have sex with kids.
With all the other reversals I look at the rather disturbing pictures with Ivanka as a child in a whole new light.

                I agree. I think things are fluid right now within the Deep State. They are gauging the outrage and trying to plot a course that keeps them alive. We know Sandy Hook was a staged event to get an Assault Weapons ban. That means they're afraid of Assault Weapons. They're afraid of Militias too. Both are in the 2nd Amendment. If they could just get rid of that stubborn little nugget of truth. You can feel their frustration from miles away.

                I think things are fluid right now because THEY are waking up along with us. They were breathing their own marketing smoke for so long they fooled themselves. Now it's the next morning. They have a massive hang over and are slowly beginning to realize what the fuck they did the night before. It's hazy, they had blacked out but they suspect the did something horrible.

                THAT'S where we are right now. And THAT'S why I think this thing is going to come down. Trump winning was 100,000,000 deplorable shit lords throwing a bucket of ice cold reality in their face. That sobered them up and they're starting to freak the fuck out.
