            Hi gamepwn. The reason most adrenochrome posts get taken down is they usually don't have sources that support the actual pharmacological plausibility of this drug, and it's a tantalizing narrative that has been heavily pushed by the schizoid Amalek shills off and on all year. There's a lot of fictional references to it, but nothing scientific that shows it would actually have the effect described. I'm not sure why you removed it yourself -- you had quite a few links and made a solid effort to satisfy the submission rules. I was going to leave it up and give it the "Possible Disinfo" flair. By the time I finished writing this, you'd already removed it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The biggest problem is that none of the supporting sources provide any evidence there is actually a drug like this that has any effects that would make it worth killing people over.
            <a href="https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/adrenochrome/">
             Erowid has a lot of good articles about it you might be interested in
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            I know

            did a lot of serious digging on this topic back around Christmas, and actually found a real drug called adrenomone made from cow pituitary glands in a Veterinary pharmacopeia from the 1980s. He was going to make a submission about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, this is a subject we are classifying as disinfo until evidence appears supporting the PG-related premise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, I think we're much more likely to find out they're transfusing fetal blood that's being harvested from abortion clinics. That actually has evidence of a scientific benefit.
