<p>Relevancy: The relevancy is that Veterans on Patrol discovered a possible human/sex trafficking bunker. Some of the items alleged to have been found are those that suggest that children were kept there -- in a septic tank! Since the find was in Arizona, I immediately flashed back to Ed Buck, and how he manipulated the political landscape by mounting a full scale recall election. <a href="https://people.com/archive/arizonas-outspoken-new-governor-evan-mecham-seems-to-enjoy-diving-straight-into-political-hot-water-vol-28-no-8/">https://people.com/archive/arizonas-outspoken-new-governor-evan-mecham-seems-to-enjoy-diving-straight-into-political-hot-water-vol-28-no-8/</a>  There had to be a reason that Arizona was so important, and if the allegations made by VOP are true, then this bunker is just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so the VOP\'s Tucson Arizona find is causing a battle over who is to guide the narrative. I expressed reservations about Open Secret over their very premature [and sloppy] claim that Stormy Daniel did not have a brand. Why premature and why sloppy? Because the man writing for Art Voice specifically said that he confirmed she does have a brand from studying stills of her porn flicks. <a href="https://artvoice.com/2018/05/10/guest-view-you-may-be-wrong-stormy-daniels-may-be-branded-nxivm-slave/">https://artvoice.com/2018/05/10/guest-view-you-may-be-wrong-stormy-daniels-may-be-branded-nxivm-slave/</a> Now Open Secret/Gabe Hoffman and Matthew Valentinas the two producers running it are filmmakers. That\'s what they do. But on the basis of the iconic pic shared virally, they negated the claim she had a brand. Since they are FILMMAKERS, they could have studied Ms. Daniels\' films and easily either proved or disproved what this investigator claimed, but didn\'t even make the attempt. That did not pass my sniff test. </p>
<p>That brings us to today when for some strange, bizarre, really squirrelly reason, the OPEN SECRET folks decided to do a Snopes and stamp the story of the bunker as: FALSE. The thing is that Craig Sawman Sawyer was enlisted to help investigate the find.  Sawyer\'s involvement really became a source of contention because Liz Crokin jumped in to defend him. The thing is that OPEN SECRET then backed off calling out Sawyer, BUT ... and it\'s a big BUT ... Sawyer is still an integral part because they used him to refute the story put out by VOP. </p>
<p>Now I didn\'t really have an opinion before I saw the food fight on Twitter so I followed up on some of the charges OPEN SECRET made, and they are WAY OFF BASE. I mean, out into Neptuneland! It\'s crazy how they lied! Or got the story completely wrong! So here\'s where I start linking tweets. First one from OPEN SECRET debunking the bunker and VOP: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret/status/1004747523557351424">https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret/status/1004747523557351424</a></p>
<p>Because people who use #StolenValor &amp; aren’t veterans Tend to lie about other things. </p>
<p>They told Sawyer there were actual kids there &amp; he hurried down - lie </p>
<p>They say LEO never came - lie Tucson PD went May 29, did a full site rundown, even brought in cadaver dogs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so let me tear this apart. They said that \'\'THEY\'\' [meaning VOP] told Sawyer that there were actual kids there &amp; hurried down based on that information. That\'s a complete fallacy! If you go here: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://beforeitsnews.com/prophecy/2018/06/tucson-child-trafficking-standoff-via-craig-sawyer-plus-hagmann-report-interview-video-2498782.html">https://beforeitsnews.com/prophecy/2018/06/tucson-child-trafficking-standoff-via-craig-sawyer-plus-hagmann-report-interview-video-2498782.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And click on the first video entitled:</p>
<h1>INFO ON THE TUCSON CHILD TRAFFICKING STANDOFF</h1>
<p>At 0:10, he said and I quote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was initially notified by a third party on Tuesday night that there were actual children in it ... in that underground container ... and that they needed help securing those kids until law enforcement could get there and secure the scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So according to Craig Sawyer, VOP never told him children were there. It was a THIRD PARTY that notified him. And in case you think he misspoke, here he is saying the exact same thing. In the next video down, the one entitled </p>
<p>HUMAN TRAFFICKING CAMP? CRAIG SAWYER ANALYSIS - 6/04/2018</p>
<p>At 0:54:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got notified Tuesday night  by a THIRD PARTY</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the interesting thing is that this video is the Hagmann Report and OPEN SECRET even urges people to go listen to it! Here\'s the tweet: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret/status/1004756425472708608">https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret/status/1004756425472708608</a></p>
<p>We haven’t trashed Craig Craig is not part of Veterans on Patrol However the head of VOP is a #StolenValor liar Watch the first couple minutes of Craig’s interview with Hagmann Craig was lied to, told there were actual kids there - and sprinted down to the site</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They tweeted that in answer to Liz Crokin who was going off her chain in defense of Sawyer. But let\'s get back to OPEN SECRET\'S third point which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say LEO never came - lie Tucson PD went May 29, did a full site rundown, even brought in cadaver dogs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another LIE IF Sawyer is to be believed. And we have both OPEN SECRET and Crokin vouching for him. So please go back to the first video and go to 0:31: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the organization that had uncovered the site ... that found it ... VOP ... were in the parking lot of a gas station notifying Tucson Police Department of what they had found. So TPD took their statements ... took their report ... and LEFT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, according to Craig Sawyer, VOP was not still at the site messing up evidence. They DID report it immediately ... on the same night -- MAY 29TH Tuesday, but look, OPEN SECRET: LIES AGAIN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret/status/1004743207467540481">https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret/status/1004743207467540481</a></p>
<p>Tuscon PD went to the site promptly May 29 and did an investigation. They even brought out a cadaver dog. They are on record with this in a reputable local newspaper &amp; elsewhere. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/tucson.com/news/local/no-evidence-to-support-child-sex-trafficking-claims-at-tucson/article_d464a498-6937-58ad-9fdf-2253ce4e2e2c.amp.html">https://www.google.com/amp/tucson.com/news/local/no-evidence-to-support-child-sex-trafficking-claims-at-tucson/article_d464a498-6937-58ad-9fdf-2253ce4e2e2c.amp.html</a> …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Sawyer says they left, and OPEN SECRET who was never there say they completed a thorough investigationand even brought in a cadaver dog! What? So Sawyer is stupid? He missed all that? It\'s hard to believe because if you listen further, he states how VOP brought him back to the site for him to have a look around. Does OPEN SECRET actually think the police would not tell them to get their asses off the property if they were conducting an investigtation? And just to make clear that Sawyer meant what he said, please go to 7:23 of that first video.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scrutiny is needed because initially law enforcement were not inclined to go out there and really follow through and give this any serious scrutiny </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, he says starting 7:35: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I\'ve notified FBI very specifically to go and do that and I do hope they go and do that and follow through in good faith and carry this out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you go, after him investigating the site -- and I suggest everyone listen to the entire video because the evidence is compelling -- he called THE FBI!!!! Does that sound like nothing was found? What is OPEN SECRET going by? This NBC story? </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/arizona-veterans-group-finds-homeless-camp-fuels-new-pizzagate-style-n880956">https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/arizona-veterans-group-finds-homeless-camp-fuels-new-pizzagate-style-n880956</a></p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists have found a new outrage to respond to, this one in Tucson, Arizona.</p>
<p>An armed group called Veterans on Patrol is demanding that authorities recognize a homeless camp they found on private property to be a child sex-trafficking camp.</p>
<p>Authorities have found no evidence that there was a child-sex camp on the site, even though they have brought in investigators and a police cadaver dog to search the area. But the lack of evidence has done nothing to prevent these claims from catching on among far-right online conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>... </p>
<p>Followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory — an elaborate offshoot of the debunked “pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which claimed Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring in the basement of a pizza shop that had no basement — have been particularly gripped by Meyer’s claims. The “pizzagate” theory inspired one person to fire an AR-15 rifle in the restaurant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there\'s where the cadaver dogs come in and the pizza place with no basement and a false flag that just happened to destroy JA\'s computer hard drive. Obviously OPEN SECRET is working in concert because they use the same language of nutso\'s going crazy! Like this tweet: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret">https://twitter.com/AnOpenSecret</a></p>
<p>Is a false hysteria Made up by “Veterans on Patrol” &amp; their #StolenValor leader in search of clicks &amp; donations False hysterias Distract from real crimes against children &amp; Real efforts to better protect children &amp; Punish child molesters</p>

<p>uscon PD went to the site promptly May 29 and did an investigation. They even brought out a cadaver dog. They are on record with this in a reputable local newspaper &amp; elsewhere. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/tucson.com/news/local/no-evidence-to-support-child-sex-trafficking-claims-at-tucson/article_d464a498-6937-58ad-9fdf-2253ce4e2e2c.amp.html">https://www.google.com/amp/tucson.com/news/local/no-evidence-to-support-child-sex-trafficking-claims-at-tucson/article_d464a498-6937-58ad-9fdf-2253ce4e2e2c.amp.html</a> …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, the OPEN SECRET\'s producers didn\'t really include anything in that film of hers that wasn\'t already known. And who have they called out? I don\'t see the tweets to Sheen asking what he knows, or Rob Reiner, or Henry Winkler or any other star or director that was around the scene and perhaps on the set when very bad things happened. Nope! All they do is call out Weinstein and Dan Schneider, the two fall guys. </p>
<p>And guess what other little disinfo guy comes out of the mouse hole? Jack Posobiec! Yup, Cernovich\'s little bitch. You remember Cernovich, the prick who doesn\'t see what good it would do to lock SKANKLES up and who was advocating to leave her alone because he feels sorry for her! </p>

<p>Have looked into this and can report there is no hard evidence this site in Tucson was used for child trafficking, the same as I reported there was no evidence for Comet Pizza. Appears to be another example of mass hysteria</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really? No evidence? As I said, you can listen to the first video, but in the second video, Sawyer goes more into detail.</p>

            Tuscon PD went to the site promptly May 29 and did an investigation. They even brought out a cadaver dog. They are on record with this in a reputable local newspaper &amp; elsewhere.

           So Sawyer says they left, and OPEN SECRET who was never there say they completed a thorough investigationand even brought in a cadaver dog! What? So Sawyer is stupid? He missed all that? It's hard to believe because if you listen further, he states how VOP brought him back to the site for him to have a look around. Does OPEN SECRET actually think the police would not tell them to get their asses off the property if they were conducting an investigtation? And just to make clear that Sawyer meant what he said, please go to 7:23 of that first video.

            The scrutiny is needed because initially law enforcement were not inclined to go out there and really follow through and give this any serious scrutiny

          <p>
           Further, he says starting 7:35:

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            I've notified FBI very specifically to go and do that and I do hope they go and do that and follow through in good faith and carry this out

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So there you go, after him investigating the site -- and I suggest everyone listen to the entire video because the evidence is compelling -- he called THE FBI!!!! Does that sound like nothing was found? What is OPEN SECRET going by? This NBC story?

            Conspiracy theorists have found a new outrage to respond to, this one in Tucson, Arizona.
           </p>
           <p>
            An armed group called Veterans on Patrol is demanding that authorities recognize a homeless camp they found on private property to be a child sex-trafficking camp.
           </p>
           <p>
            Authorities have found no evidence that there was a child-sex camp on the site, even though they have brought in investigators and a police cadaver dog to search the area. But the lack of evidence has done nothing to prevent these claims from catching on among far-right online conspiracy theorists.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory — an elaborate offshoot of the debunked “pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which claimed Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring in the basement of a pizza shop that had no basement — have been particularly gripped by Meyer’s claims. The “pizzagate” theory inspired one person to fire an AR-15 rifle in the restaurant.

           So there's where the cadaver dogs come in and the pizza place with no basement and a false flag that just happened to destroy JA's computer hard drive. Obviously OPEN SECRET is working in concert because they use the same language of nutso's going crazy! Like this tweet:

           Yup, the OPEN SECRET's producers didn't really include anything in that film of hers that wasn't already known. And who have they called out? I don't see the tweets to Sheen asking what he knows, or Rob Reiner, or Henry Winkler or any other star or director that was around the scene and perhaps on the set when very bad things happened. Nope! All they do is call out Weinstein and Dan Schneider, the two fall guys.
          </p>
          <p>
           And guess what other little disinfo guy comes out of the mouse hole? Jack Posobiec! Yup, Cernovich's little bitch. You remember Cernovich, the prick who doesn't see what good it would do to lock SKANKLES up and who was advocating to leave her alone because he feels sorry for her!

            Have looked into this and can report there is no hard evidence this site in Tucson was used for child trafficking, the same as I reported there was no evidence for Comet Pizza. Appears to be another example of mass hysteria

            I don't think the Open Secret twitter account is Amy Berg.  It's most likely the film's producer.

            Berg and the producer were not on good terms by the end of the movie and a lawsuit was involved.

            <p>
             Would a producer describe themselves as ''we're filmmakers''?!!! That was Amy Berg. Plus there was another tweet where she called out VOP for accepting donations of gas, etc. Whoever is running the account answered again that ''we're filmmakers'', then warned people to be careful of others asking for donations. Personally, if someone is doing something that is taking up most of their day, it is a profession. I don't know what the point or obsession is with calling people out for needing money.

              Producers are absolutely filmmakers.  Film do not get made without them.  They hired Amy Berg for this project I believe.  The project existed before Amy Berg got involved is the history of this, I believe.
             </p>
             <p>
              Checking yes, that is true.....There are two producers on the film Gabe Hoffman and Matthew Valentinas.  They came up with the idea for the documentary.

                is this account directly linked to the film or just a fan set up posting news reports?

               Fantastic! So it's run by Hoffman and Valentinas. It makes me feel much better calling them out because they obviously deserve it. I'll take her name out of the OP.

            What is odd though is that they are critical of the VOP guy, but support Craig Sawyer, who is fishy imo.

            They seem to accept people who want to join who aren't vets.

             Absolutely. Sawyer is someone who got on my radar at the beginning and never got off it. Then there's him being tight with AJ.

             Not to my knowledge. In fact, in the NBC news article it clearly states that he is not a vet so I'm not sure where that's coming from or why it's said. But just concidentally, and there are no coincidences, I read the best quote yesterday. It's from Julian Assange about disinformation:

             That's what this seems like. The Stormy Daniels debunking and now VOP... and especially the what An Open Secret thinks of Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer. Did anyone ask them what they thought of Daniels? Of VOP? Or Meyer? And yet there is there opinion spewed that they think he's claiming to be a vet with no proof offered. Then they very nicely call everyone curious about the find in Tucson tin foil hatters? I don't recall asking for their goddamn opinion ... nor do I care.
