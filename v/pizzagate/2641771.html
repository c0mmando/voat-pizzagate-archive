            He served in the Army from 1950 - 54.    Arpaio was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on June 14, 1932,[21] to Italian parents, both from Lacedonia, Italy.[22] Arpaio's mother died while giving birth to him, and he was raised by his father,[23] who ran an Italian grocery store.[24][25] Arpaio completed high school and worked in his father's business until age 18 when he enlisted in the United States Army.[26][21] He served in the Army from 1950 to 1954 in the Medical Department and was stationed in France for part of the time as a military policeman.[26]

            Charlotte, N.C. (AP) -- As Charlotte, North Carolina, celebrates being chosen Friday to host the 2020 Republican National Convention, an undercurrent of concern about the potential for violence runs through the Democratic-leaning city.
           </p>
           <p>
            The GOP's national committee selected North Carolina's largest city over Las Vegas as hundreds of party activists gathered in Austin, Texas, for the committee's summer meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The city that I represent has truly established its place on the national stage, and I want to thank you again for the opportunity to showcase our city and showing the world how special we are," said Mayor Vi Lyles, Charlotte's first black female mayor. "We're a growing center of diversity and inclusiveness in the New South, and we're going to show you the true meaning of Southern hospitality."
           </p>
           <p>
            Under Lyles' predecessor, Jennifer Roberts, Charlotte passed an LGBTQ nondiscrimination ordinance in 2016 that included allowing people to choose whichever bathroom corresponds to their gender identity. The Republican-led General Assembly responded with House Bill 2, which prevented other local governments from passing similar laws and directed transgender people in schools and government buildings to use restrooms and locker rooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates.
