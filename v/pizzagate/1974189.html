<p>RACINE MAYOR JOHN DICKERT’S PERSONAL CHOICE FOR RACINE’S POLICE AND FIRE COMMISSION ACCUSED O
F POSTING RACIST COMMENTS AND INFLAMATORY IMAGES TO FACEBOOK AND TWITTER!!
RACINE MAYOR JOHN DICKERT “I CANNOT CONSIDER REMOVING HIM.”
Racine-After seeing the posts, Racine Mayor John Dickert said he contacted Bishop Mark Johnson and asked him if he could continue to serve on the Police and Fire Commission unbiased. Freeman told Dickert he needed a few days to think about it, and then later told Dickert, yes he could serve unbiased.
Mayor Dickert then went on to say that he cannot consider removing Freeman from the commission without a formal complaint of some kind. The mayor said he did not know whether the commission had the power to unilaterally vote Freeman off the panel.
Racine Police Chief Art Howell declined to comment on the issue and Todd Hoover, president of the Racine Police Association, could not be reached.
The concern over Bishop Mark Freeman’s comments comes as police officers  have come under fire from snipers and other attacks. A sniper killed five officers in Dallas in early July, while three officers were shot dead in Baton Rouge on Sunday.
The anti-police rhetoric reached Racine on July 8, when a 43-year-old Racine man was arrested for making online threats against law enforcement officials.
Unofficial word is that the Police and Fire Commission have already filed a formal complaint to have Freeman removed, but Dickert is refusing to remove him despite the racist comments, due to the fact Dickert himself had appointed him without a formal background check.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to media, Pastor J. Mark Freeman said he would not resign from the Racine Police and Fire Commission following controversial social media posts. “After prayerful reflection, meditation and consultation, I have decided to remain in my post as a Police and Fire Commissioner and to serve out the duration of my commission,” Freeman wrote.

             Posting this again? You are really getting desperate. Of course New York and New Orleans are corrupt. That is not news.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine, Wisconsin - a small city under 80,000 sitting on one of the world's largest fresh water supplies with ties to elite secret societies being a main root the entire network of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption is.

            As soon as this gained any visibility outside of Racine they hurried and made an inside deal to shut down the exposure. They cannot allow the light to shine on Racine, and they have been busy trying to cover up brazen criminal corruption with a string of sudden resignations, retirements and transfers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine's corrupt mayor is close friends with corrupt businesses and organizations, and is close friends someone who works for George Soros and someone who works for the Clintons. They have since shut down the Racine Social Justice League to hide their previous comments and are now weaseling behind veterans projects, education projects and anti-trafficking projects such as the Fight to End Exploitation as cover.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is a model for sanctuary cities. Racine is one of the 13 NGP Van Bellwether districts. Racine is the birthplace of Sustainable Development and Community Policing.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are corrupting the churches and every level of business and organizations as the elite power players, the mafia, and their network of corrupt politicians and henchmen control the media, local authorities and the community through various forms of blackmail, extortion, embezzlement, bid rigging, fraud, and other crimes. They use collectives such as Racine Interfaith Coalition to control the local church groups and those who are involved. They use Racine as a model for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption through the lie of false Gods, Sanctuary city status, community policing, and Sustainable Development. This is directly linked to Timothy Dolan's recruitment to the area to cover up the scandals at the Catholic Church, and to the global Agenda 2030 through the United Nations and other groups all orchestrated by the secret societies that link to Racine, namely Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Pilgrims Society.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Podestas are part of the inner circle of the Pilgrims Society. This is just one of many reasons why Racine is a main root for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             Corrupting the churches is like including every aspect of society.   While I believe the catholic church is corrupt is covering up child abuse, hoarding money, i cannot imagine in what other ways they would be corrupt???
How could you possibly discover that from the outside?

              It is a control mechanism. Work and church are two of the main social circles for families. People need to feel accepted, so they go along with the program.
             </p>
             <p>
              They start with simple feel-good programs and coalitions, such as helping the homeless or veterans through collectives like Racine Interfaith Coalition, Social Justice League, and Coalition for Peace and Justice. Most people at lower levels do not know the bigger picture. They go along with it, and it escalates into supporting more nefarious activities such as Social Justice and Sanctuary Cities that enable and hide the truths about trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look at the who is behind the Fight to End Exploitation in Racine. This is directly linked to the people involved as a way to control the investigation and narrative. It includes corrupt churches, corrupt coalitions, corrupt authorities, corrupt businesses, and is linked to the Clinton Foundation, McCain Foundation, local foundations, and even to Ashton Kutcher and Kabbalah (his real name is Chris, he is also a freemason and he was working with this group to be a main spokesperson and front man for the organization except that he recently backed out of attending an event because the spotlight was on him and Racine). It is also tied to corrupt new age churches like Living Light where Chelsea Clinton held a rally for Hillary's presidential campaign.
             </p>

              Churches and foundations help determine what area groups and programs receive funding, and which do not. They also put pressure on families to conform and support their agenda, sometimes through compartmentalized initiatives.

               Living light does not mention who there sponsors are or what they do with the money 
I am assuming they collect money because that is what it takes to do anything

                Many people suddenly moved to Racine, Wisconsin in connection with this corrupt "church". They are using religion as a way to build partnerships, but they are evil and corrupt. They are creating coalitions between area religious groups to push Sanctuary City status and to control the community.
               </p>
               <p>
                Chelsea Clinton is connected with them. There is a group of 'next generation leaders' who have been selected to push through their evil agenda. Ashton Kutcher is another involved at this level along with Jared Kushner.

              “Secrets of the Vatican,” recounts the transition from the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI and “illuminates the extraordinary challenges facing Pope Francis as he tries to reform the powerful Vatican bureaucracy, root out corruption, and chart a new course for the troubled Catholic Church and its 1.2 billion followers,” according to the Frontline web site.
             </p>
             <p>
              The film explores a number of issues, including the global sex abuse crisis, Francis’ efforts to reform the Vatican bank and bureaucracy; and the Vatileaks scandal that resulted in the theft conviction of Benedict’s butler.
             </p>
             <p>
              The film features interviews with Milwaukee-area sex abuse survivors Peter Isely, who was molested by a Capuchin priest at St. Lawrence Seminary in Fond du Lac County and Monica Barrett, who was raped by the late Father William Effinger. Both would be excluded from the archdiocese’s compensation for victims under its proposed reorganization plan.
             </p>
             <p>
              The film takes a critical view of the Milwaukee church’s decision to move $57 million earmarked for the perpetual care of cemeteries into a newly created trust to protect it from legal liability. Frontline filmmakers did not interview officials with the Milwaukee archdiocese. But they said they attempted unsuccessfully to reach Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who won Vatican approval to protect the cemetery frunds in 2007 when he was Archbishop of Milwaukee; and retired Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland, who oversaw the handling of the sex abuse crisis in Milwaukee for three decades.
