<p>Without releasing too much info, we botched the whole thing and my 3 letter friend’s contact (who was to ensure prosecution against We The Pizza) is now confirmed KIA. We are safe and headed into the protection of a friendly foreign intelligence agency and the agency now possess the 2GB of child rape and cloned Hard Drives. My 3 letter friend assures me they are on our side and can be trusted.</p>
<p>What we are releasing is disturbing, it was to be November’s child rape menu. My 3 letter friend believes his other trusted friend already has the children from the menu in government witness protection or even hiding them somewhere in a hotel. </p>
<p>Me and Guy#1 were never trained for this shit. Sorry we blew it.</p>
<p>For those who didn’t follow the original reddit post, here is a run down of what happened:</p>
<p>We are friends with a 3 letter agent. </p>
<p>We volunteer to help him. </p>
<p>Guy#1 sneaks into WeThePizza and unplugs some computer cords and fucks up their network. </p>
<p>Our 3 letter friend is contacted by WeThePizza to fix the computer issues, but says he is busy and recommends me (Guy#2) as a trusted pedo friendly repair tech, I am no computer expert but I do know a pretty decent amount. </p>
<p>I walked out with 2GB of child rape porn, a half assed (I somehow fucked it up) cloned Windows XP hard drive and some weird .exes that generate client lists. </p>
<p>We setup multiple deadman switches.</p>
<p>The original plan was to get this verified by the media, and contact verified government agents. But fucking Guy#1 panics and wants the FBI, CIA, NSA or whoever to know we have the deadman switches operational and he makes his first Reddit post (we told him not to) on the now banned <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>. He lied about the specifics (thankfully). But then people start asking for proof and he posts child rape porn as proof. But people still don’t believe him and people start coming up with all sorts of fake theories about him. He then gets drunk.</p>
<p>As further proof we are legit, within 2 hours of Guy#1\'s post, wethepizza.com takes down their website to a simple message that says &quot;Coming Soon&quot;. That should be enough to convince any non-shill we are LEGIT.</p>
<p>A couple hours latter I create a reddit account to do damage control, but shills and disinfo agents confused the shit out of me. I tried posting a PGP message, for people to brute force, but I didn’t know you couldn’t brute force PGP and I am called a troll and disinfo/shill. Honestly the whole night was an  absurd combination of being called a shill, CTR agent, spook, disinfo agent, etc. I am NOT responding to anything non-constructive today, I will only answer valid questions. <strong>I WILL NOT BE FEEDING THE TROLLS.</strong></p>
<p>I gave up with the shills and called it a night, sometime during the time I was trying to relax, a shill at thedailybeast.com makes up this bizarre article that makes no sense and (kind of?) tries to take credit for our work.</p>

             Me and the 3 letter man are assembling a guide. At the moment, any pizza restaurant in the same city with a foreign embassy is to be a suspected rape safe house. ESPECIALLY a city with a Saudi embassy. We are working, but right now we are trying to meet up with help.

              Okay, stay safe. If this is all true, don't mind all the people calling you a fraud. It's expected. I have a healthy bit of skepticism as well, but this is just too much to ignore.

             any way this can be confirmed safe and legit without posting contents? i know .pdf's can contain active elements that can 'phone home' and contain other nasties to, also file size is a little bit big for just a menu isnt it?

              The file is legit and disgusting. I'm doing a few scans on it now to see if there's anything bundled with it. So far, looks clean.

                Nope, it's just the supposed "menu." It can be faked easily but considering the content, I'm not sure why one would keep this going for so long if it wasn't true. The pictures are extremely disturbing.

                True, and if it were a honeypot, I'm sure they have tools that are undetectable by normal means. All I know for sure is that it has very disturbing pictures of children within it.
