<blockquote>
<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The owner of Rockstar Burgers in the West Bottoms has been arrested and charged with multiple felonies in Platte County.</p>
<p>Brian Smith, 42, who owns the burger restaurant at 1611 Genessee St. in Kansas City, Missouri, was charged Friday with second-degree domestic assault and armed criminal action in connection with an alleged incident Nov. 24.</p>
<p>In a probable cause statement, Parkville police said that a woman who previously had an intimate relationship with Smith told officers that Smith entered her apartment on Nov. 24, forced open her locked bedroom door and struck her on the head with a handgun.</p>
<p>Smith also became involved in a physical altercation with another man in the apartment, according to the probable cause statement.</p>
<p>The woman also told police that Smith had assaulted her in the past, including choking her at his residence. She said she did not file a police report after that incident out of fear.</p>
<p>Parkville police issued a person of interest order for Smith on Thursday, and he was located by the Kansas City, Missouri, Police Department and transported to Parkville.</p>
<p>Smith could face up to seven years in prison for the domestic assault and no less than three years in jail on the armed criminal action charge, if convicted.</p>
<p>The address listed in court records for Smith is the same for Rock Star Burgers.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, KCPD tweeted about the charges against Smith and urged possible other victims to contact police.</p>

<li>incendiarynews.com - (Dec 3, 2019) &quot;KANSAS CITY: Restaurant Closes After Owner Exposed as Abuser of Women&quot;: <a href="https://archive.md/D4IXR">https://archive.md/D4IXR</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday Kansas City restaurant owner Brian “Rockstar” Smith confirmed that he would be closing Rockstar Burgers after being exposed as an abuser of women. Leading up to his announcement the community launched a campaign against him including protests and details of his abuse posted around Kansas City and online.</p>
<p>Details first began to emerge after a picture surfaced on social media depicting Smith’s ex-girlfriend’s head covered in blood, claiming that the wound was inflicted by Smith pistol-whipping her. According to employees of Rockstar Burgers, Smith was violent and possessive in his relationship with his ex and had beaten her in a fit of misogynistic jealousy after accusing her of cheating on him.</p>
<p>Seeking to humiliate her further, Smith then posted several videos online depicting his ex, who is visibly drugged, performing sex acts with a dog while he records. His attempted smear campaign against her would immediately backfire when the videos went viral on the night of November 25.</p>
<p>Smith’s personal YouTube channel is full of videos of women passed out or otherwise incoherent. In one of these videos, several photos can be seen on his phone of naked women lying face down on the floor tied up. He has also been the subject of sex-trafficking allegations as well as sexual abuse of minors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="break"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One eyewitness told Incendiary about her experience on the floors above Rockstar Burgers where Smith and others live and where he is suspected to have committed many of his crimes. She had been invited by one of Smith’s tenants named Armondo.</p>
<p>“[There were] tiny hidden rooms behind doors, and behind drywall. It was just like a maze, and very poorly lit,” the eyewitness said. “If you didn’t know about the rooms, you wouldn’t know how to get in or out of them.”</p>
<p>These observations are more disturbing when considering Kansas City’s history as a hub for sex trafficking, due in part to its central location within the US. Last August, two teenagers and 35 adults were freed from a sex trafficking ring in the city after a federal investigation, and in November police arrested 21 people in a human trafficking sting operation.</p>
