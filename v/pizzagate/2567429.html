<p>From the third link: &gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>David Geffen Quietly Sold His Apartment to a Russian Billionaire for $24.5M</h1>
<p>It appears to have been an off-market deal, as the 5,000-square-foot pad at the Parc V wasn’t publicly listed. The co-op was last shown for sale in 2016, with a $27.5 million tag—it was delisted in December 2016, after only three months on the open market.</p>
<p>The new owner is Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler, a business partner and close pal of Roman Abramovich. Per public record, Shvidler doled out $24.5 million for the two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom residence at 785 Fifth Avenue. Perhaps now, Shvidler won’t feel the need to park his yacht, Le Grand Bleu (it was a gift from Abramovich), in front of the Statue of Liberty anymore—that didn’t go over particularly well with anyone. ... </p>
<p>It was originally a three-bedroom layout, but one of the rooms was transformed into a professionally-designed soundproofed screening room, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transformed into  a screening room? Yes, well, of course, it seems de rigueur for every place these pervs call home to have a <s>rape room ... sex dungeon ... dark web porn viewing pit ..</s>. screening room. </p>
<p>Also did you notice how the price of the pleasure palace DROPPED in value? No such thing. It brings up the trouble topic of funneling money to one another through the alleged \'\'sale\'\' of real estate. More on how cozy Abramovich and Shvidler are: </p>

<p>Shvidler, the buyer, is a close friend and business partner of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. The pair started the oil trading outfit Runicom S.A. in 1995 ... </p>
<p>Shvidler courted controversy last year when he docked a 370-foot superyacht — a gift from Abramovich — in front of the Statue of Liberty for two months, ruining tourists’ views.</p>

<p>So Abramovich bought Shvidler that yacht ... nice. </p>
<p>Here\'s more real estate swapperoos ... this one with Denise Eisenberg Rich ... yup! Wife of Marc Rich, the guy pardoned by Slick Willy Clinton: </p>

<p>Denise Rich admits that wealth helped her gain unique access to the first family, but says that she never had sex with President Clinton or even spent the night at the White House.</p>
<p>&quot;I don\'t even know what the Abraham Lincoln bedroom looks like,&quot; she tells 20/20\'s Barbara Walters in her first television interview since Clinton\'s controversial pardon of her ex-husband on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>&quot;I never had a sexual relationship or anything else that\'s improper,&quot; she says. &quot;Any kind of relationship that would be improper with President Clinton.&quot; </p>

<p>Okay, I\'ll wait. I know you\'re laughing up a storm at that one, but I\'ll move on. Catch up when you catch your breath with reading a bit about Marc Rich: JEWISH MAFIA. Really? </p>

<p>Billionaire Chelsea F.C. owner Roman Abramovich and Dasha Zhukova separate</p>
<p>Art collector, fashion favorite and entrepreneur Zhukova — who is on the board of the Metropolitan Museum — spearheaded the $27 million Rem Koolhaas-designed Garage Museum of Contemporary Art that opened in 2015 and drew a crowd from Jeff Koons to François Pinault. Vice Media acquired a controlling stake in her Garage Magazine last year, and she is also a founding partner in hot art startup Artsy.</p>

<p>This ARTIST basically filled fish tanks with human bones, foliage, and food? Calls it \'\'ART\'\'. Now is that what human traffickers think they\'re creating when they dispose of a body? Maybe. We\'ll have to ask a forensic specialist. </p>
<p>And MOCA seems to be a HUGE support of the fat cow called Abramovich, but it seems not everyone is so thrilled</p>

<p>The prospect of this “grotesque spectacle,” the outraged Rainer wrote, reminded her not of Abramović’s The Artist ... but of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1975 film Salò, where fascist sadists sexually abuse beautiful youths. “Subjecting her performers to public humiliation at the hands of a bunch of frolicking donors is yet another example of the Museum’s callousness and greed, and Ms Abramović’s obliviousness to differences in context and to some of the implications of transposing her own powerful performances to the bodies of others,” Rainer wrote, suggesting that MoCA rename itself “MODFR, or the Museum of Degenerate Fund Raising.”</p>

<p>Who really killed Pier Paolo Pasolini?</p>
<p>In April this year the Vatican, which had once pursued Pasolini and helped secure a criminal conviction for blasphemy, declared his masterpiece, The Gospel According to St Matthew, &quot;the best film ever made about Jesus Christ&quot;. This expression of Pasolini\'s radical faith portrays Jesus as a revolutionary &quot;red Messiah&quot;, according to the Franciscan doctrine of holy poverty, which in part influences the current pontiff, Francis. ....</p>
<p>Long before Calia\'s investigation, published in 2003, Pasolini had worked on the posthumously released book Petrolio, featuring barely disguised versions of Mattei and Cefis, and revealing knowledge of how the ENI scandal and murder went to the heart of power and the P2 Masonic lodge, of which Cefis was a founder member. &quot;With 25 years\' foresight,&quot; wrote Ceccarelli, &quot;Pasolini the writer had been aware of the outcome of a long investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, in 2005, the floodgates opened. ... Three years later, Pelosi gave further names in an essay called &quot;Deep Black&quot;, released by the radical publisher Chiarelettere, revealing connections to even more extreme fascist cells tied to the state secret services, saying he had not previously dared to speak, after threats to his family.</p>

            Denise Rich admits that wealth helped her gain unique access to the first family, but says that she never had sex with President Clinton or even spent the night at the White House.

           <p>
            "I don't even know what the Abraham Lincoln bedroom looks like," she tells 20/20's Barbara Walters in her first television interview since Clinton's controversial pardon of her ex-husband on Jan. 20.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I never had a sexual relationship or anything else that's improper," she says. "Any kind of relationship that would be improper with President Clinton."

           This ARTIST basically filled fish tanks with human bones, foliage, and food? Calls it ''ART''. Now is that what human traffickers think they're creating when they dispose of a body? Maybe. We'll have to ask a forensic specialist.

               The prospect of this “grotesque spectacle,” the outraged Rainer wrote, reminded her not of Abramović’s The Artist ... but of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1975 film Salò, where fascist sadists sexually abuse beautiful youths. “Subjecting her performers to public humiliation at the hands of a bunch of frolicking donors is yet another example of the Museum’s callousness and greed, and Ms Abramović’s obliviousness to differences in context and to some of the implications of transposing her own powerful performances to the bodies of others,” Rainer wrote, suggesting that MoCA rename itself “MODFR, or the Museum of Degenerate Fund Raising.”

            Who really killed Pier Paolo Pasolini?
           </p>
           <p>
            In April this year the Vatican, which had once pursued Pasolini and helped secure a criminal conviction for blasphemy, declared his masterpiece, The Gospel According to St Matthew, "the best film ever made about Jesus Christ". This expression of Pasolini's radical faith portrays Jesus as a revolutionary "red Messiah", according to the Franciscan doctrine of holy poverty, which in part influences the current pontiff, Francis. ....
           </p>
           <p>
            Long before Calia's investigation, published in 2003, Pasolini had worked on the posthumously released book Petrolio, featuring barely disguised versions of Mattei and Cefis, and revealing knowledge of how the ENI scandal and murder went to the heart of power and the P2 Masonic lodge, of which Cefis was a founder member. "With 25 years' foresight," wrote Ceccarelli, "Pasolini the writer had been aware of the outcome of a long investigation."
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, in 2005, the floodgates opened. ... Three years later, Pelosi gave further names in an essay called "Deep Black", released by the radical publisher Chiarelettere, revealing connections to even more extreme fascist cells tied to the state secret services, saying he had not previously dared to speak, after threats to his family.

            Glad you covered the sale of the "little" condo of DG.  So much money was my immediate thought and also what are they exchanging as well.  I also wondered how he "entertained" his pizza friends.  Mark Rich is def Mossad.  From what you described, it sounds like a Cc of our Deep State.  KGB as well?  Why not?  Putin was a member of KGB.  You can probably throw Rahm Emanuel into the mix as well since he is heavily involved with Mossad. Rahm dual citizenship to Israel.  These guys are all dirty and so is Rahms bro Ari the biggest agent in Pedowood and major bundler for Obama.  The moguls are probably all related to Mossad and Mossad probably controls Hollywood and the Movie and Music Industry.  They let DG control it all.   Nothing But Endless Rabbit Holes.
