            I'm a pizzagate believer all the way, and maybe this is "related" in that there are new stories being circulated about this 550+/- year old event to maybe dilute all the noise people like us are making about pizzagate today, but this is REALLY a stretch. Nearly all superstitious/religious cultures have historically sacrificed children and animals to appease their gods that they believed controlled the weather &amp; harvests. That is a well known and widely accepted FACT so I don't see any reason for op to be so crazy aggressive to the mods about questioning why this is relevant to the work this sub is trying to accomplish. I also don't get the point of it being here other than to maybe once again make pizzagaters look completely unhinged.

            , how is this directly related to the sexual abuse of kids by the global elite, again? Obviously, historical child sacrifice is indirectly related, but you've presented no evidence this is directly related to Clinton and the rest of the globalist overlords. Also, you need to provide linked support for all major claims in your submission. I see no support linked for your claim that:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Fuck TRUMP! AM I RIGHT GUYS?...You stupid sheeple, when will you wake Up and realize that trump IS THE DEEPSTATE
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            In fact, you actually refer to evidence that invalidates this claim:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He's accomplished More in a year, Than all of the presidents in my lifetime, combined... Plus He's always drawing attention to Human trafficking, The Deepstate, Fake media etc
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            This doesn't look like a serious research submission. It looks like an attempt to either discourage pizzagate investigators or bait them into arguing with you. Please edit your thread to meet our first and second submission requirements, or we will need to remove this post in 24 hours. Thanks.

            Kanye just said him and Trump had dragon power, like they are dragon buds. Sorry I don’t trust Trump or anyone in government. I look around at the Clinton orphanage that was built in Haiti. Grand opening probably this month or next if the project came in on time. It is an orphanage. It resembles a prison. It is going to be runny a Catholic groupcalled Fondation Enfant Jesus. That is a great combination the Clintons and Catholic!!! We know what Catholic-priests do to children. HOK was the architect for the building. I dig into them and they are the largest architect in the USA. They have build lots of things for the Arab kings intge Mideast, mosques, and they are building Apple’s new headquarters that they call the  California spaceship. HOK did the project in Haiti for free.
