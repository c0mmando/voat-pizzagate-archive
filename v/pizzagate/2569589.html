<p>Blind Item #1 - Reader Blind Item</p>
<p>For this former child actor - probably one of the most iconic faces of the 1990s because of this one appearance - it was like Hollywood all over again. Despite the barrage of offers that followed his breakout role, he walked away from the business. Part of it was that people liked him for being famous, rather than for being himself, and part of it was the predators in his midst. He knew why they liked him too.</p>
<p>So, as an adult, he got a degree in international relations, and dedicated himself to humanitarian work. He worked on improving access to education for girls in the mideast and elsewhere, but was especially interested in the plight of trafficked children. It turned out to be ugly, grueling work, officials, even parents and family, turning their backs on his efforts. But where as in the business he felt his only choice was to walk away, this was his calling.</p>
<p>Sadly, he died in August of last year. His death, by drowning, in a certain (basically) colony, was ruled an accident. But missing from his belongings was his latest and last notebook, which contained not only his usual musings - poems, musings, lyrics (the latter is the reason you\'ll know him - not his, but this probably permanent A list gen x front man\'s) - but extensive accounts of child trafficking by wealthy and powerful men in countries he had worked, and involvement by Westerners, including at least one music mogul known around here. He died a martyr\'s death, like his screen counterpart.</p>

               I think Keidis severely abused as a kid. Running around HWood like jailbait when he was 8. In addition to drugs and all that. Has gender crisis and all sorts issues.  But don't think actually vagina. His autobiog great read :)

                I remember you now. Yeah, you do come across as a stalker girl sometimes.

                I agree with you on Kiedis all the way. But he’s tranny all the way. It’s hard to see I’ll give you that. Go watch his induction of Talking Heads in the rock n roll hall of fame. He says at one point that girls remember where they were when they got their first period. Everyone bursts out laughing and they keep laughing like they know some inside joke, and Anthony looks a little confused or embarrassed, something. I didn’t get before what was going on but I think I do know.
