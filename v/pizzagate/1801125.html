            It's amazing sometimes when we revisit old news and how it shed light in new ways!  This article was discussed a couple of months back I believe right here on voat so it was not new to me. Many of us have gotten impatient regarding the low level arrests that we have seen, but this article demonstrates how one arrest leads to more arrests. I cut and paste the section I am referring to below. This article gives me hope that the new administration is really hot on the trail of these evil child rapists.
           </p>
           <p>
            In November 2010, Robert A. Diduca was arrested, and among his 10,000 images investigators found one that would begin to unravel an international web of pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            It depicted another man, a young boy and a toy rabbit.
           </p>
           <p>
            The rabbit, federal agents discovered, had not been made in America. It was Dutch, and it led authorities to one of the most prolific child abusers in history.
           </p>
           <p>
            Robert Mikelsons, a day-care worker and professional babysitter in the Netherlands, was convicted in May of abusing 67 children. Newspapers dubbed him the "Monster of Riga."
           </p>
           <p>
            He was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
           </p>
           <p>
            From those two men and their computers, investigators uncovered thousands of images and chat histories that led to dozens of arrests around the world.

            Nuggets from the article that everyone should memorize -
           </p>
           <p>
            "The typical child pornographer, according to the center, is single and white and male. He could be any age. He is normally well respected in his community.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              He often works in a position of trust, like a pastor, teacher, or coach.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            His victims are seldom strangers. They are his neighbors' kids, his nieces and nephews or, often, his own children."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            "The men use code words.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Young boys, for instance, are referred to as "asparagus."

            He found that people who view child pornography also tend to sexually abuse children.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Bourke examined 155 prison inmates who had been convicted of possessing or distributing child pornography. Of those, only 26 percent had a known history of abusing kids
             </strong>
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Bourke observed the group progress through months of therapy and eventually found that 131 of those men —
            <strong>
             <strong>
              85 percent — acknowledged that they had molested a child
             </strong>
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            On average,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              each man had more than 13 victims
             </strong>

            There are several confirmed precedents for Pizzagate.  The most notable in the U.S. is the Franklin scandal/coverup of the 1980s-1990s.

            In googling "Michael Arnett arrested" I came across this related article...there's some interesting details in here as well that sound familiar to CP and James A.:
            <a href="http://www.ocalapost.com/worst-child-pornography-case-in-u-s-history/">
             http://www.ocalapost.com/worst-child-pornography-case-in-u-s-history
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "An eerie stairway led them to a locked door in the basement of the residence. Behind that door was a sally port that led to a second door with a keyed lock. Behind the second door was a dungeon, which was lined with acoustical sound deadening material, a chair, a television and what appeared to be an internet modem."
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              The room also contained a child-sized homemade coffin,
             </em>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            with large speakers covered in mesh wire at one end with exterior locking devices. A steel cage that was approximately three feet wide, two feet high, and four feet long with multiple locking devices and had a steel table top with steel rings at six points, presumably for restraints.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a deep freezer, an upright freezer, disposable scalpels, deluxe butchering kits and castration tools. In recovered chats from Portway’s computer, he described his dungeon as a place he intended to use for keeping kidnapped children while he sexually abused them, and where he would eventually murder and eat them."

            If ever you have a doubt that PG is real, remember that we have confirmed cases of ''pedophile cannibalism'' and the article even describes their motivations perfectly! They try to one up each other. Its like a competition for these sickos!

             Arnett bragged of the boys and girls he had murdered and roasted, according to the records. He took photos of a toddler posed in a pan inside an oven, authorities say; he was found with images of decapitated children that a medical doctor believed to be real.

While it would seem even more difficult to determine what makes a person fetishize the murder and cannibalization of children, that question may not be impossible to answer.
