<p>Human Trafficking situation in Hawaii has been getting worse since judges appointed by Clinton and Obama have stepped in. Trafficking <strong>includes children</strong> as young as 11 years old according to this local article:

<p>The fresh court order against Donald Trump\'s executive order was made <strong>after possible meeting</strong> between Obama and judge Derrick Watson, according to Infowars.

            I can tell you this. Hawaii is an entry point of trafficking from South East Asia. Most cases I am aware of all the traffickers get caught bringing people in, usually from Thailand.

             According to the stydy, the most people are definitely not being caught and according to the local news to problem is growing. Study reveals the labor sources as Mexico, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Micronesia, or other Pacific Islands. More importantly, I'm trying to locate the link to child prostitution while the news I found are mostly about business/labor related. Of course, both are actively done, but how much protected by the governance is the issue here.

              In Hawaii, due to our culture and general attitude about protecting children, one would be subject to an "accident" if you got caught trafficking children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Docking point would have to be private pier of some sort to do this type of thing unseen ...or could be using a military facility. Traffickers typically get caught when they have to dock to handle paper work and refuel so a long term high level trafikker would be doing something to mitigate that risk.
             </p>
             <p>
              So we are probably looking for organizations that have military transport contracts.

               Thanks for this tip. In the meanwhile, I just connected the rest of the presidents who have appointed judges to Hawaii as candidates to support coverup actions:

            I agree. This should be looked into. Too much coincidence which again appears. Considering the "dreaming of your hotdog stand in Hawaii" email. The coincidental evidence justs keeps on coming.
