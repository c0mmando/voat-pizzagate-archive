           These people are "different from you and I." It's one thing to explain the actual nuts and bolts of #PizzaGate to someone (details, history, connections, etc.), but, because their social circles are so different and their motivations so perverted as compared to someone raised "normal" like us, it's impossible for the layman to understand this from a participant's perspective.

            ok,, i get where you're coming from and will settle with 'some of them used to be like us but made a choice in their life to trade their humanity for something they valued more at the time'... and i'm only saying that in trying to layer in a narrative to support a big name turncoat who'll see the light and turn snitch. I don't want to be confused for defending any of the evil bastards but I truly feel to get to the end of this rabbit hole and accomplish something we're going to need to realize a shit load of people are gonna get exposed and an even bigger shit load of people won't believe they could have done it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cognitive dissonance is a killer,,, I just keep thinking of Corey Feldman and how his abusers name was on his lips a few years ago. Imagine if he outed Martin Sheen,, for example,, for those of us who'd believe him we'd have two options. String him up and the story ends with him,,,, or get him to break and talk about how things where when he was a kid,,, suddenly we're starting to really get to things [I'm betting daddy and his friends have stories to hide]. In my opinion anyway...
           </p>
           <p>
            Soz,, went on a ramble there. In short I totally agree with you,, the fact that I have empathy is the very reason I'm forced to abstract the horrific nature of what we're dealing with down to 'shitty stuff'. I've been chasing these evil dicks since before Savile when everyone thought I was a weirdo for calling him a pedo. Now that bastard was exactly the level of evil fuck i'm hoping we actual catch,,, before they die!

            Just throwing this out there,,,, I think part of the problem is that many of the people implicated probably aren't much different than you and I beyond their ambition. Now i'm not talking about the people at the top of the pyramid or the people who enjoy this sick sht. I'm talking about the people who climb the ladder in whatever industry they're in until they hit that point where in order to get to the next level they are put in a position to make a choice,,, take part in XXXX and get the job/role/title/position or loose everything. I personally think that there are a sht load of people who deep down are good people who've done something shtty in order to get where they are [because that's the way the control structure works]. Pedo Blackmail is a tool that I think is utilized in just about every 'industry' as a method of control. It's just a theory,,, but it's why I think if we approach this problem without the pitch forks we might get the 'lower level' guys to out themselves and therefore help us get to the real sick bastard... just my opinion and i'm in no way saying the likes of Podesta aren't the evil ones,, I'm just hypothesizing and throwing out some idea's. I do think that if we all new the truth and everyone implicated was put in jail we'd probably have NO ONE LEFT.

            Here you have from Lord Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita:
           </p>
           <p>
            Chapter Sixteen: The Divine and Demoniac Natures
           </p>
           <p>
            Bg 16.4 — Pride, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness and ignorance – these qualities belong to those of demoniac nature, O son of Pṛthā.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bg 16.8 — They say that this world is unreal, with no foundation, no God in control. They say it is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bg 16.9 — Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneﬁcial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bg 16.13-15 — The demoniac person thinks: “So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemies will also be killed. I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacriﬁces, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.” In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bg 16.18 — Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and blaspheme against the real religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bg 16.19 — Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bg 16.21 — There are three gates leading to this hell – lust, anger and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.
           </p>

            A person tired of heterosexual sex becomes homosexual. (due to indulgence) -&gt; Homosexual tired becomes pedophile or zoophile or both -&gt; then he becomes psychopath, they become so insensitive that get pleasure only killing, torturing etc... pure evil..."

              People with demoniac nature (Pyschopath Killers, Pedophiles, Satanist...)
             </p>
             <p>
              1.- Pride, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness and ignorance are their qualities.
             </p>
             <p>
              2.- Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. (i.e. Evil is good and good is evil)
             </p>
             <p>
              3.- Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.
             </p>
             <p>
              4.- They say that this world is unreal, with no foundation, no God in control.
             </p>
             <p>
              5.- They say it is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust.
             </p>
             <p>
              6.- Therefore, deluded they engage in horrible works meant to destroy the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              7.- They take shelter of insatiable lust and absorbed in the conceit of pride and false prestige.
             </p>
             <p>
              8.- They believe that to gratify the senses is the prime necessity of human civilization.
             </p>
             <p>
              11.- Absorbed in lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratiﬁcation.
             </p>
             <p>
              12.- The demoniac person thinks: (This is very important for understanding such people)
             </p>
             <p>
              "So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will           increase in the future, more and more."
             </p>
             <p>
              "He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemies will also be killed."
             </p>
             <p>
              "I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am."
             </p>
             <p>
              "I shall perform sacriﬁces, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice."
             </p>
             <p>
              13- Their anxiety is immeasurable. They are bound by a network of hundreds of thousands of desires.
             </p>
             <p>
              14.- They are Perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions. (I.e. See above)
             </p>
             <p>
              15.- Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes proudly perform sacriﬁces in name only. (I.e. Charity good actions)
             </p>
             <p>
              16.- Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of GOD, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others.
             </p>
             <p>
              17.- Blaspheme against the real religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              18-. They are cast to hell.

            Like serial killers they have a "persona" for the public.  Loving wife, kids, good job.  Usually a pillar in the community.  Always working around kids.  Coaches,priests, boy scout leaders, etc etc.  Many are highly intelligent and spend a lot of time learning how to get away with their crimes and go unnoticed. They have patience, they are not impulsive.  They take time to plan their actions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing to look at is those with high interest in IT and internet/computer security.  Purchasing many hard drives, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of them invite the children to their homes, or away for trips as part of whatever cover they have.  So say a sports team coach - special tournaments, away trips, etc.  Research the story of the skiiing coach who abused the 12 year olds.  He got them training in France away from their homes in Canada, then abused them the entire time they were away from their family.

            Agree. The solution, I feel, is to graft from multiple profiles. For instance, power-hungry, sociopathic/BPD people will fit in nicely, plus profiles from high-profile criminals like the insider-trading types, perhaps.

            I really do want those two cents! Your expertise is welcome and needed, but, what we REALLY need is something that is concise and well-written for the lay-lay-layman. I am on Twitter a fair amount and am trying to wake people on this, etc., but they often cannot imagine WHO is doing this kind of thing. We need a rough sketch with some basic citations/attribution/academic support, IMHO.
