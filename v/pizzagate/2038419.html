            Could 100 be a designated capacity for a type of aircraft to spirit them away? There will be support staff of course, so maybe it refers to a plane that has a capacity of 120-150 people? Pure speculation.

            It is a number from antiquity.  The goddess Hecate was offered blood sacrifices of 100, usually oxen.  The blood sacrifice of 100 (whatever) was called a hecatomb.  But always the most valuable sacrifices are the human ones.  So if 100 humans were available, that would please the goddess greatly.

             Interestingly about this particular set of religious references to spiritualize transitioning 'genders'...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              (The magid explains at length above, that it is entirely possible for a male to have a female soul and vice versa.)
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             ...is that it seems at odds with current SJWTransEdition beliefs.  For example:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Sometimes a man may reincarnate into the body of a woman because of a sin, such as homosexuality or something similar. This woman who has received the soul of a man will not be able to conceive and become pregnant
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So all reproductive/sexual functions, and all gendersouls, appear to be described in terms of ONLY 2 genders, it's just the physical body that's treated like parking garage for punished gendersouls in some cases.
            </p>
            <p>
             The mysticism of transbalah however, elevates gender and experience of
             <em>
              transgender
             </em>
             into a divine state, (not in the sense of overcoming passions,
             <em>
              transcending
             </em>
             if you will, thereby being freed from compulsive destruction addictions or other negative behavior), but rather it sounds like the worship of cosmic sex.  One can only imagine how pedobalah followers use children in their ceremonies (better not to imagine, we know enough already to answer that question).
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In this model, the individual mystic's soul, gendered feminine, first participates in an act of transgender-homoerotic mystical fellowship with those of hir fellow mystics in order to at once welcome in the Divine feminine (in some cases entering into erotic union with Her) and immediately switch gender roles to embody that Divine feminine for her congress with the male Godhead. This act of psychic double-transvestism...
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This may explains why some seemingly intelligent groups (academics/medical profession etc.) of people care nothing about the child abuse of implementing Transgender Protocol across the world, they're practicing religion.  (Okay no points for me lol).

               I never said you made shit up (my response was in fact one angle in support your sweeping unsourced statement). Don't blame me if it went over your head. Your knee jerk self indignation is boring.  Submit your own thread with sources or stfu. Or maybe you just want to see if you can get banned before your username is 24 hours old.

             Well, if anybody would know, I thought you might . Maybe they  ask for 100, so they can have their pick of 33.

              You could be right dude but you post some quality shit, if only we had some FOCUS.
             </p>
             <p>
              example: everyone agrees modern art is a big part of PG because of its elite nature, but if we look at say the trustees of MOMA in NYC or LACMA in LA we find mostly Jews from beginning to end (chronologically).
             </p>
             <p>
              It is not NOBLE to overlook the Jewish angle here.  Its actually quite embarrassing and pretentious: "thats simplistic, not all jews, blah blah my cunt itches"
             </p>
             <p>
              Seems like people here wanna stop PG UNLESS it requires them to swallow their pride.  Shame!
