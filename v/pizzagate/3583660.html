<p>&quot;A Colorado Springs woman and former daycare owner has been charged with child abuse as a misdemeanor and attempt to influence a public servant, a class four felony, according to an affidavit obtained by KRDO Tuesday.</p>
<p>The suspect, 58-year-old Carla Faith, was the owner of a licensed daycare called Play Mountain Place. That changed last month when a Colorado Springs police officer found dozens of children hidden behind a panel leading to the basement of Faith\'s home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;State officials have confirmed with 11 News that the operator of the four child care facilities in Colorado Springs that were shut down this month got into similar trouble in California years earlier.</p>
<p>The Colorado Department of Human Services says they ran a background check on the owner, Carla Faith, through FBI and CBI but nothing came up. But state records in California show several of Faith\'s facilities there were raided by law enforcement in the late 90s. Investigators there shut down the child care homes after allegations Faith was caring for more kids than her state license allowed.&quot;</p>

            WTH is wrong with this woman? She is a maniac and needs to be locked up. I thought we had some kind of database to keep up with these. It cases. If not there ought to be. PD involvement here maybe?  Idk but she should have been locked up in Cali for at least 20 years OR MORE!
