<p>...When Marj Snyder tells the story of her life, she returns again and again to the same horrifying tableau -- a satanic cult run by her father that victimized her hundreds of times, inflicting sexual, physical and psychological abuse.</p>
<p>With its details of devil worship, sexual orgies, torture and even human sacrifice, hers is a story similar to scores of others that have surfaced in recent years from abuse survivors around the United States</p>
<p>&quot;We now have 400 or 500 of these stories being told and we\'re unable to find the least bit of corroborating evidence,&quot; said J. Gordon Melton, a Methodist minister who directs the Institute for the Study of American Religion at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>One of the leading <strong>debunkers of ritual abuse stories, FBI Academy instructor Kenneth V. Lanning,</strong> warns law enforcers about believing such charges without critical investigation.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;There is little or no hard evidence that (Satan worshipers) are involved in serious, organized criminal activity,&quot; he wrote in a 1989 article for The Police Chief . &quot;The American people should not be frightened into believing that babies are being bred and eaten, that 50,000 missing children are being murdered in human sacrifices or that satanists are taking over America\'s day care centers.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>But Baltimore County police officer Donald H. Thompson said such skepticism <strong>may be misplaced.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I know that ritual abuse goes on,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;I\'ve worked on <strong>three or four cases here this year</strong> that can be substantiated. Cannibalism, sacrifices -- it does occur.&quot;</p>
<p>Thompson has become convinced of the existence of ritual abuse &quot;because a lot of kids from different areas will tell you very similar stories.&quot; He cited one 7- or 8-year-old boy who drew a picture of a crematorium. &quot;Now how does a kid like that know what a crematorium looks like unless he\'s seen it?&quot;</p>

<p>From Sacred-texts.com</p>
<p>Lanning (debunker of ritual abuse stories) :</p>
<p>...Two or three people murder a couple of 
children in a few communities as part of a ritual, and nobody finds 
out? Possible. Thousands of people do the same thing to tens of 
thousands of victims over many years? Not likely. Hundreds of 
communities all over America are run by mayors, police departments, 
and community leaders who are practicing satanists and who regularly 
murder and eat people? Not likely.</p>
<p>Children do fantasize. Perhaps whatever causes a child to allege 
something impossible (such as being cut up and put back together) is 
similar to what causes a child to allege something possible but 
improbable (such as witnessing another child being chopped up and 
eaten).</p>
<p>Many police officers ask what to look for during the search of the 
scene of suspected satanic activity. The answer is simple: Look for 
evidence of a crime. </p>
<p>A pentagram is no more criminally significant 
than a crucifix unless it corroborates a crime or a criminal 
conspiracy.</p>

            Rule number one of the Internet: never trust anyone who cites a "skeptic" group/website.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, this was the same year that my psychotherapist told me about a meeting she had just attended in Omaha. It was filled with Law Enforcement from all over the US. They had been gathered there to be given the following information: the huge missing children epidemic they were witnessing in the United States was due to satanic cults using them in their ceremonies.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know if notes from this meeting were ever made available to the public, I highly doubt it.. It would certainly cause as a big stir as proof of aliens, but even more terrifying and unbelievable.
           </p>
           <p>
            From what we know, it would be very FBI-like to come out with a counter story just as this information is coming to light, since it appears all intelligence agencies are supporting the corruption we see in the world, as evidenced by the Podesta emails, and authority's utter lack of response to our pleas. (I mean, unless it's George Webb who calls in...)

            Maybe a bit off topic, but I'm thinking, it'd be interesting to dig into the "satanic panic" of the 70's or 80's. Probably good info to rediscover...

            on this one. Lanning is a Satanist that long ago was outed by Ted Gunderson and many others. It's our responsibility as citizen investigators to call people like Lanning out for fear that his disinfo take over gullible minds. You should be very careful what you post on here. Make sure it's helping our cause and not crippling it. That's if you want to help, that is.

            This post is cool with me. I think the 80's was the time of the McMartin school scandal, and there was a lot of pushback from the pervs. The "False Memory Syndrome" peeps kicked in around that time. It's good to document.
