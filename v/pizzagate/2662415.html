            This is why, in all honesty, most of my submissions have been provable examples of either historical elite paedophilia or examples of the concerted effort of media, entertainment and academia to normalise child rape.  I believe these examples are useful tools in redpilling those who dismiss Pizzagate as a 'conspiracy theory'.

             That VOAT post got  3,806 views!  WHY?  People are still curious about this incident and the "pizzagate" name. Read ALL of my comments there. I DEBUNKED THEIR FF STORY.  It is impossible to construct a non-conflicting time line based on MSM "witnesses" and police report facts. No one witnessed Welsh shooting the gun. Most early reports do not mention anyone hearing a gunshot. Is that why so many views? Any MSM mention/ reporting on this TOPIC brings up MANY AWAKE, REDPILLED COMMENTS.

              Your research is meticulous and a giant red pill for anyone who reads it.  Needs to be more accessible, though, instead of buried in comments.  Agree people are still curious.  The time is ripe for this element of the PG investigation to catch fire again.
             </p>
             <p>
              On top of everything else, the lawyer Sharif Silmi screams plant to me:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Silmi says his family stopped by Comet Ping Pong as part of a day trip to Chevy Chase that also included plans to stop by Politics &amp; Prose and the Little Red Fox bakery, Comet Ping Pong’s neighboring businesses on its homey block of Connecticut Ave., Northwest, which have caught some spillover flak from Pizzagate conspiracy theorists."
              <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/">
               https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Who plans a day trip with the kids at these specific businesses next to Comet?  Even if he was just a "Pizzagate tourist" (he didn't say he was), that still begs the question how he came to be in Comet at exactly the right moment to be able to control the narrative by providing his "eye witness" spin to the media.  Whiff test flunked, imo.

            Doolord That's why You should stop calling it pizzagate. Don't even Call It pedo Gate. Just Talk about the current events. Been trying to explain this but There will always be those who defend the name in A reply. But I agree there Are many aspects That are disturbing about this Despite the shit name. But There are a lot of promising things as well. Most of which Is not posted On Voat for some reason.

             No but Pizzagate is real too. I admit it was badly named, but I don't want people to dismiss this. They have to know it's real.

             I agree with you, however, the only way forward in light of this is to start pointing out the predominantly jewish over-representation in child sex trafficking, SRA, illegal pornography, and human trafficking at the highest levels. There are players from other ethnicities, but they are not at the helm. I guarantee you that most of these shills are JIDF or jews in our alphabet agencies. These parasites are still allowed to (((legally))) mutilate the genitals of gentile children. They are the problem.

            Not sure where you're getting that we're in a terrible position.
           </p>
           <p>
            The dismissal gives us free rein. You don't see them bothered by only screaming, "RUSSIAN COLLUSION!" and "RACIST NAZI!"
           </p>
           <p>
            That's what they're down to. Deiifying Mueller and Comey.. Plus there's all that criminality they have to contain. Plus plus the income lost from not being able to ship around that "art" in cardboard boxes and sex traffic at will.
           </p>
           <p>

            Remind people that Mark Thompson was the head of the BBC until Jimmy Savile died. He covered up for that monster. Pulled a documentary that exposed Savile as Britain’s most prolific serial pedophile, and possible child murderer. He covered all that shit up. Then he fled to the US to become the president of the New York Times Company.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then the New York Times ran the bogus debunk.

            I was just starting to follow the pizza subreddit when it was shut down, hence my pissed off user name. Fortunately I saw something about voat before the sub was pulled. Do we have an alternate site if it happens here?

            There's been gaslighting alright. But we are still here.  We also have almost tripled our membership since I started almost 1.5 yrs. ago.  It was at over  6K at that time.  People come and go here but they are reading our posts.  Also some tabloids and sites are as well, as many of us have seen when our posts make it on to their sites.  AND even though we has been heavy shill-lighting also lately,  we are on to them and some really great users have warned us with a list of their names.  We are working together to keep fighting them off and I think it is working. So I do not feel so down about our success.  Just look at the memes on twitter.  They are Awesome!

            It would be more terrible EXCEPT thankfully there is a very large and growing number of us here in the US and internationally who know of the lying, scumbag, gaslighting garbage perpetrated on us by: the MSM  including TV and publications on and offline, and all social media platforms (FB and Google, YouTube and Twitter).   Our big pluses are Q and what Q has reminded us of....... and that is ....... God wins.
