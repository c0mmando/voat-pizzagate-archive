<blockquote>
<p>According to the official account, Gouda, an Ezbet Abu Hashish resident, was looking for his runaway son. Galal, one of the local homeless children, told him that he had escaped from a foundation that gives shelter to homeless children in Tahrir Square, and that his son was there, and was getting beaten up by those responsible for the shelter.</p>
<p>When Gouda went with the boy, his son was not at the apartment. On finding locked rooms that the foundation’s staff refuse to open, he left, scared. However, another child called Said begged him for help and to be saved from the abuse and torture there, so Gouda took the boy with him. He then called his relatives, who came and broke into the foundation’s office. They did not find Gouda’s son there, but they found another child, Mohsen, tied down and naked. And so Gouda headed to the Abdeen Police Station to file a report.</p>
