<p>One of these sellers is a company -- possibly a shell company -- called Priap Inc. This company\'s naming decision is important, because it appears to reference Priapus, a <strong>Greek god of male genitalia and sex</strong>, commonly depicted with a prominent and oversized erection.

From Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priapus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priapus</a>):</p>
<p>&quot;In Greek mythology, Priapus (/praɪˈeɪpəs/;[1] Greek: Πρίαπος, Priapos) was a minor rustic fertility god, protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens and male genitalia. Priapus is marked by his oversized, permanent erection, which gave rise to the medical term priapism. He became a popular figure in Roman erotic art and Latin literature, and is the subject of the often humorously obscene collection of verse called the Priapeia.&quot;</p>
<p>Is this just a coincidence, or is Priap Inc. a shell company set up by someone involved with laundering money raised by illicit activity, named this way as an in-joke among the launderers regarding the source of their income?</p>

            Nevermind the name, if there is a Voater here who knows how to do electronic title searches, the kind title companies do for real estate closings, we may very well find ourselves with a resulting  title document that could be scrutinized  by the authorities, IRS, etc. Several months ago there was a Voater who had already done a great deal of research  in connection with Brock and his financial shenanigans with PAC funds as I vaguely recall. Need to reach out to this Voater.

            Flipping one property again and again was a device used by the Clintons in their Whitewater operations. The purchaser would put down a hefty downpayment, then default soon on the mortgage, then the Clinton gang would foreclose and the downpayment forfeited to the Sellers, then a sale of the same property to another sham buyer, a big down payment, another uncontested foreclosure, and so forth. Great Find!

            This naming is no accident.

            On one hand, it's "in your face" or well known within a certain group. On the other hand, they count on the ignorance of the masses who have never had any classical education. The third reason, is that they often use ancient history as a sort of internal justification.

            Many Roman Emperors are still known for their depravity, even if people do not read Suetonius much anymore. I covered that here:

            People involved with pizzagate use ancient names tellingly. For example--one pervert named his Cockatoo "Tiberius":
            <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Dana_Giacchetto">

            Another example of interesting trust names: The Lucis Trust started out as the Lucifer Trust. They published new age BS and Theosophy tracts invented out of whole cloth by the intelligence services -some dating to the nineteenth century.

               I agree. They frequently reference the ancient world because of things like institutionalised homosexuality of Spartans and socially formalised pursuit of adolescent boys by older men. Then there's the frocks...er, togas.

               <p>
                Oh and to address the ignorant myth of pederasty among the Spartans:
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Xenophon, was the only historian with firsthand experience of the agoge (his sons attended it!).
                </strong>
                He states explicitly: "… [Lycurgus] … laid down that in Sparta lovers should refrain from molesting boys, just as much as parents avoid having intercourse with their children or brothers with their sisters."  It is hard to find a more definitive statement than this, and from the most credible source.  To dismiss this evidence simply because it does not suit preconceived ideas is arrogant at best and ignorant to say the least.
               </p>
               <p>
                Xenophon adds: "It does not surprise me, however, that some people do not believe this, since in many cities the laws do not oppose lusting after boys."  This is the crux of the matter.  All of our written sources on Sparta come from these other cities, where pederasty was rampant.  In short, the bulk of the written record on Sparta stems from men who could not imagine a world without it. But then, they also could not imagine women who were educated, physically fit, and economically powerful, who were not also licentious and lewd.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Sparta's constitution strictly prohibited pederasty
                </strong>
                .  Contemporary accounts, the evidence of archaeology, and modern science all strongly support those ancient historians who vehemently denied pederasty in Sparta. These values are reflected in Spartan art, which reveals an austere or "prudish" disdain for explicit, pornographic, or mercenary sex, but immortalizes married couples as partners.
               </p>
               <p>
                In sharp contrast to misogynous Athens, Sparta did not disdain and ridicule women's sexuality, but respected it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sparta's laws recognized women's sexuality and encouraged it within marriage.  In the rest of Greece, wives who liked sex were disdained, and men sought sexual pleasure outside of marriage with slaves, boys, and prostitutes.
                <strong>
                 Male victims of child abuse generally grow into misogynous men
                </strong>
                .  The status of women in Athens fits this pattern perfectly--totally subordinate to bisexual men, while the status of women in Sparta completely contradicts – indeed, refutes – the thesis that Spartan men were systematically subjected to sexual abuse by their elders as children.
               </p>
               <p>
                The archaeological evidence from Sparta likewise demonstrates an almost complete absence of pornographic depictions on artifacts, unlike Athens and later every single Roman city, not just Pompeii (which was like Las Vegas but with more brothels than gambling).  This is in sharp contrast to the plethora of explicitly pornographic art from both Athens and Corinth.  While pederasty is as frequently depicted in Athenian and Corinthian art as heterosexual sex, no homoerotic art originating in Sparta has to date been found or identified.
               </p>
               <p>
                Furthermore, while female sexuality was recognized and respected, Spartan males were expected to find sexual satisfaction within marriage.  Thus Sparta was reputed to have no brothels at all within the city limits, and Spartans claimed to know neither whores nor adultery.  To date, the archaeological evidence supports the assertion that there were no brothels in Sparta, and the absence of heterosexual (as with homosexual) pornographic artwork further supports the thesis that in contrast to other cities, sex in Sparta was a private – rather than a public – affair as in Athens and most of the ancient world.
               </p>
               <p>
                Those pushing the homosexual (etc.) agenda don't want you to know the truth about Sparta.

                Right, as if the ancient world (BC) had absolutely nothing else going on.
               </p>
               <p>
                First of all, the Spartan Agoge is misrepresented because the sources that are used are from the Hellenistic (very decadent later period) when the agoge was already passe, and the mores were completely different.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is only one contemporary source, and it tells about a massive educational program which was comprehensive and was the basis for the best of classical civilization, not what Hollywood portrays. It was also the only instance in which education was a compulsory requirement for citizenship--Sparta educated women as well, and equally so, which is unheard of in most countries even today. Spartan women controlled the economy and agriculture, at a time when Athenian woman were veiled and hid in back rooms. Spartan rhetoric (laconic style) was the most admired in the ancient world and influenced Athenian philosophers. Spartan women even competed in the Olympics.
               </p>
               <p>
                The best account of the agoge and its different stages of development in English is provided by Nigel Kennell in The Gymnasium of Virtue (University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1995.
               </p>
               <p>
                Furthermore, although there may have been more emphasis on physical fitness in a Spartan education than elsewhere, numerous sources testify to the fact that Sparta also placed great emphasis on training the intellect. Even more noteworthy is the fact that Socrates himself considered the Spartans the greatest philosophers in mainland Greece.  It has been argued that Sparta not only welcomed and entertained philosophers such as Pythagoras for years on end, but actually provided the foundation for Milesian, Pythagorean, Socratic, Platonic, and Aristotelian philosophy.  Certainly Socrates, Xenophon, and Plato were admirers of Sparta; it hardly seems reasonable to hypothesize that these leading Athenian intellectuals admired a city-state that – as many modern writers portray it – was anti-intellectual and inhabited by illiterate brutes.  (An excellent article on this topic is provided by W. Lindsay Wheeler, in Sparta: Journal of Ancient Spartan and Greek History, Vol. 3, Issue 2, 2007.)
               </p>
               <p>
                Spartan education excelled in music, poetry, and dance.  The boys and youths of the agoge were famed for their proficiency at all three skills.  Such skills require practice and are further evidence that modern depictions of the Spartan youth living like wild beasts in the wilderness is pure fantasy. The Romans who debased everything of classical antiquity, later the effete, gay British, and now Hollywood (CIA west) have placed their own creations in place of knowledge. They want you to associate the depravity of Tiberius and his ilk, with a culture that was completely different.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 No one who wants to oppress you wants you to know the truth about history
                </strong>
                , hence the complete lack of any truth in so-called higher education today.

            I wasn't sure that Priap actually referenced to Priapus (sometimes companies just have weird names that aren't copy written yet) so I plugged it in a search engine.  Sure enough, it is basically synonymous with penis.  I even found this weird underwear site called Priape.com.  Very sexually suggestive and NSFW.

            Also Priapus has a modern church in San Francisco and Montreal.  One line in the article is "Prospective members must participate in an interview where they submit to sexual desires of church elders."

            I don't put anything past this group!  They think they are so clever doing this in the wide open and laughing about how clever they are at the next cocktail/pedo art exhibit.  Guess what? Those days are gone. We are pushing down hard on their perverted trail. Soon there will be no more wide open exploitation of their demented sexual antics. They will constantly be looking over their shoulders. Every day another is awaken. I just awaken a millennial the other day. I consider that double points because they are younger and can carry the torch longer.
