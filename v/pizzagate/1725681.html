                  Well, this is an interesting and juicy post. I'd want to share that, too.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I can see why MF removed it from
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                   v/pizzagate
                  </a>
                  , though, and I would have to as well. It's all hearsay plus the logo...but the logo itself isn't enough.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The way to post this is to either build it into a full-blown research post with info about Geffen, links to people talking about this issue in the music industry, links to any dirt on the label or it's directors and principal executives/investors that add credence for the rumor you heard, or put it up in
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/askpizzagate">
                   v/askpizzagate
                  </a>
                  with a question about if anyone in the music biz can confirm or add to what you heard, or in
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                   v/pizzagatewhatever
                  </a>
                  with the same question. Then, bring it up in comment sections and link to it. Additional evidence might come from song lyrics by musicians under the label.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Another problem is that if your post doesn't involve minors, it's not Pizzagate related, so you need to demonstrate that it clearly involves minors.

                  Removing this is not personal (although I get that it feels that way); it just isn't enough to satisfy the guidelines as written. And the guidelines are the only thing that lets us remove posts from
                  <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/117135062#p117136770">
                   guys like this
                  </a>
                  , which we get dozens of every day. Unlike Reddit, we can't just remove any old thing we want. And if we leave up your post, then the next ShareBlue asshole that gets on here to spout bullshit and slide stuff can point to it and say we're compromised/censoring/shills, blah blah blah. Which, of course, is exactly the effect ShareBlue wants to have: discourage people from sharing what they know by creating distrust in the community. MF does make mistakes sometimes, because he carries such a large portion of the workload of modding, and has been doing it through thick and thin and taking hell from users all day every day. But most of the things he removes any other mod would remove for the same rule-violating reasons.

                  There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that the music industry is part of this -- it's the earliest way, other than Disney, to desensitize and sexualize kids. We just have to dig deeper and more meticulously and gather more evidence.
