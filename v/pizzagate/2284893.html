<p>Matt Lauer (from the Today Show for anyone else who hadn\'t heard of him before) has been accused of sexual misconduct by 10 different co-workers, who say that he has a button under his desk that can be pushed to lock the doors behind them. I can source that claim <a href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/07/matt-lauer-love-children-accused-two-more-kids-mistresses/">here</a>, but you probably knew this already.</p>
<p>Lauer\'s office is located fairly out of the way in Rockefeller Center, New York. On a side note, <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/6-places-aleister-crowley-performed-his-particular-brand-of-magick">New York was one of Aleister Crowley\'s favourite places to worship Thelema</a>, and Rockefeller Center is <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?dcr=0&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=942&amp;ei=1aouWuDmOcrBgAa61Lgw&amp;q=Rockefeller+center+distance+from+hyde+park+new+york&amp;oq=Rockefeller+center+distance+from+hyde+park+new+york&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...221579.224295.0.224518.13.13.0.0.0.0.124.1335.6j7.13.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.0.0....0.q7ud5OSmRAk">less than 2 hours away from where Crowley set up</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the first article I linked, it is also mentioned that Lauer may have fathered 2 children who weren\'t his wife\'s.

It could potentially become a new indicator of a predator by parenting children that aren\'t their own. Oh, and to give the story a happy ending, his wife is divorcing him despite him begging for her to stay (although she probably knew all along).</p>

            Who cares about Matt Lauer and what does it have to do with PG? Yes, he supposedly has a button under his desk that locks the door when he is ready to boff hot chicks. And when he boffs them, and they do not resist, they pass out!...I think Matt wrote that BS. But what does it have to do with PG? I know....You are selling Trump in a round about way.. Lauer is PG, and Trump is fighting them. Lauer is exposed!...But Lauer is not PG. He did no crime. He is not under arrest. And PG is not about  crude adults being crude. Get this shit out of here shill.

             Calm down, retard. As for the rape, the insider who broke this can be quoted to say;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “He couldn’t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people, because he’s Matt Lauer and he’s married. So he’d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn’t ever complain.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I mentioned that the pedophilia was speculative, it is an idea that can be built on or disproved. You'll make us look insane to any newcomers if you scream
             <strong>
              SHILL
             </strong>
             at anyone you remotely disagree with. You're doing more harm than good being here, you make us all look like soft-cocks and lunatics. Piss off.

              Or maybe it's "yes", "yes and "yes". You've already heard my reasoning for holding that position, now why don't you go jump back on your broomstick like they do in your favorite J.K Rowling literature and hop off to Reddit where retards such as yourself are not only welcomed, but encouraged.

             I think it is a mistake to think Lauer or any of the #metoo crap is anything but a smokescreen for child abuse. All top level MSM figures are very, very likely Clowns in Action MKUltra zombies. Their on-air alters are complete fabrications.Their predatory sexual behavior mode is uncontrollable and indiscriminate.

             Mario Botali is stepping down today for #metoo like claims.  I've had him on my Pedo radar for over a year, and I have no doubt about his real crimes.

              Our country is fascist. A big "tell" as they say in poker, the men do not like women or children. They are pushed to take center stage in entertainment and media.(control issues) This is the reason so many men are and will step down in the future.As an example, the nazi troops in Italy were raping a lot of little boys. Some of the mothers got together , went to Germany and told the wives. It stopped. Thank you President Trump ....draining the swamp.
