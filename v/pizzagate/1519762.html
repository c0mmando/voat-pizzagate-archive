            Yeah see that's a hell of a serving to have alongside christmas roast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not that I'm a huge fan of preserving comfort in this situation, but, given the nature of things, I would say that it's worth setting aside time (especially during seasonal holidays and other 'family time') to spend with loved ones, without darkening the mood with pizzagate(or similar) subjects.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cherish that time. It is the very reason to investigate and help those suffering in all of this, so that maybe some of these kids can see THEIR families over Christmas and etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Context and setting can make all the difference in how darkness is perceived.

            I cannot possibly agree more or word that any better myself. You hit the nail on the head there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been getting that "please stop talking, this is too uncomfortable for my existence" look for years now, long before pizzagate was a soundbyte which can now be used to keep a running conversation with people who avert their mind from the subject of corruption abroad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because of that, I'm finding that some people are a bit more receptive if you ease them into it. Keep coming back to the soundbyte and expand the topic, tie it all back in to a central theme of perversion and corruption which they can begin to rationalize and piece together themselves, with what is presented to them and what they can then go and find on their own.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's an uphill battle at times, but it's not unwinnable - persistence is key, but also, it's important to remember that this is a lot to take in all at once, many of us here are 'desensitized' already, after years of looking into this kinda crap.

            Add the dutroux affair to your list.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has definitely expanded in the ways you speak of and then some... the whole pizza/online aspect of it was just the beginning, the opening of pandora's box if you will. There's A LOT of darkness to come pouring out yet though, we have to keep our eyes on the bigger picture as it unfolds, without getting caught up on the finer details in a way that consumes impetus.
           </p>
           <p>
            What it means to me, one way or another, is:
           </p>
           <p>
            A) "We the people", as messed up as we can be, as much as we bicker, have shown that we can come together from a variety of countries and creeds - in order to combat true evil, or even just the possibility of it's existence - even with the real threat of artificial suicide hanging over our heads.
           </p>
           <p>
            B) There is finally a viable avenue of investigation, with the capacity to shed an almost blinding light on the darkest corners of the human condition and the evil sods that perpetuate such atrocities. Theories and testimonials that were once considered outlandish and crazy/maliciously false, are gaining traction, the more people pull their heads out and realize that the world is not hunky-dory, that it has indeed become severly corrupted from just outside of their perceivable reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            C) The so-called 'right side of history' is now far more clearly defined, especially with regards to which media outlets are in bed with those that deal in death, misery and perversion - also very importantly, we're seeing TPTB flounder and flail, making hasty and disorganised decisions while their operation begins to derail... in a way, their abhorrent and lackluster response is so laughable that it's actually kind of entertaining as a fleeting thought, until you remember what's at stake...
