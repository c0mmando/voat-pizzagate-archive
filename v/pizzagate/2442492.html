</ul>
<p>Jessica Simpson and Hewitt both had &quot;relationships&quot; with <a href="https://okmagazine.com/news/jessica-simpson-slams-john-mayers-sexual-napalm-comments/">John Mayer</a>, as did <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1860353">Katy Perry</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2: Los Angeles</strong></p>
<p>At age 10, after winning a Little Miss competition, talent scouts recommended that Hewitt move to LA to pursue acting and singing. Her classmates then included <strong>Jonathan Neville</strong>, who became a &quot;talent scout&quot; and recommended her for the show Party of Five.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> She joined Party of Five at age 15. Does anyone start working as a talent scout at 15?  
</p>
<p>In LA, Hewitt lived at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OVzXXb4Z9A">Oakwood Apartments</a>, which have been discussed in other posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1595551">Spielberg</a> at Oakwood</li>
<li><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2208837">CIA affiliations</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>3. First role: Kids Incorporated</strong> (Disney)</p>
<p>Corroborated sexual abuse by producers, with co-star <a href="http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/news/a91275/fergie-reveals-drug-conspiracy-theories/">Stacy Ferguson</a> (<a href="https://hollywoodstreetking.com/fergie-back-on-that-stuff/">Fergie</a>):</p>

</ul>
<p>At this time, producer Tommy Lynch also made a TV special for <strong>Andrew Dice Clay.</strong> Dice was a raunchy comedian, best known for his pornographic <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Andrew+Dice+Clay%2527s+Nursery+Rhymes">&quot;nursery rhymes&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>In 1994, Lynch created <strong>The Secret World of Alex Mack.</strong> Though a children\'s show, it became well known for <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/flashback/the-secret-life-of-alex-mack-had-one-big-problem/news-story/eb9e4b5703da301e1b620a1f83452d16">creepy themes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;In the pilot, when 12-year-old Alex morphed back into a human after a stint as goo, <em>she was naked&quot;.</em></li>
<li>&quot;In one episode, Alex got a duplicate, who among other things, <em>nearly killed her</em> by trapping her in some clogged plumbing and waiting for her to either suffocate or... &quot;</li>
<li>Lynch begged Larisa Oleynik (Alex Mack) to stay on the show, offering her <em>a feature film</em> and a ton of money. But Oleynik left saying she was &quot;burnt out&quot;. </li>
</ul>
<p>Actress <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jessica-alba-on-sin-city-typecasting-and-how-homophobia-pushed-her-away-from-the-church">Jessica Alba</a> also began her career with Lynch/The Secret World of Alex Mack.</p>
<p><strong>4. Music: Jive records</strong></p>
<p>Hewitt\'s managers created a successful &quot;overseas&quot; career for her as a singer, the &quot;success&quot; of which depended on her keeping quiet. Hewitt\'s first album, <strong>Love Songs,</strong> was released by the Japanese label <strong>Meldac</strong> when she was 13.</p>
<p>She released two subsequent albums called <a href="https://www.music-bazaar.com/album-images/vol1002/258/258335/1991366-big/Let-S-Go-Bang-2-picture.jpg">Let\'s Go Bang</a> and BareNaked.</p>
<p>BareNaked was on Jive Records, the same label as <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2225344">Backstreet Boys</a>, Britney Spears and NSYNC.</p>
<p><strong>5. TV: Party of Five</strong></p>
<p>Hewitt joined Party of Five at age 15 to play Sarah Reeves. She apparently carried on a poorly disguised relationship with <a href="http://forums.thefashionspot.com/showpost.php?p=9342585&amp;postcount=653">at least one adult</a> making the show.</p>
<p><strong>6. Movies:</strong></p>

             poor kid had massive bazookas too, at a very young age. Can't imagine how she felt at all the creepy stares etc.

              Wonderland is a favored word.  Alice in Wonderland and Wonderland Club a CP Op that was raided by Operation Cathedral.  I say they never shut this down.  It just popped right back up again.  They love that word.  Remember Wonderland in DC where they said Seth Rich was suppose to go to, but never did.

            Diana Napolis thought Jennifer Love Hewitt was controlling her mind. She also thought Steven Spielberg and his wife were members of a satanic cult who had implanted a microchip in her brain in an attempt to “catch her soul.” According to her, Spielberg ran the cult from his basement. Yep, she was fucking bananas.   UH, not so crazy as far a I am concerned.  Actually this possibly may be pretty close to the truth.  Microchip?

             I haven't looked into PG as deeply as others. So to me, Diana Napolis still seems unfortunate and mentally ill...
            </p>
            <p>
             But it's a big coincidence that Napolis focused on Spielberg and Jennifer Love Hewitt together, isn't it? Those two people never worked on any projects
             <em>
              (publicly),
             </em>
             as far as I know.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, as wild as her conclusions seem, what enabled Napolis to draw a connection between Spielberg and Hewitt, years before others discovered the information about Disney, Kids Inc., etc?

              How do I know?  I can't ask her.  But "as far as I know" is not good enough for me.  This woman is categorized as nuts by whom? You have been on here over 2 years and have learning nothing about what these elites are capable of?  You think that her words and memories are impossible just because.  Well, I say that it is hugely possible.  We here on pizzagate are well aware of their capabilities especially after reading about pizza, hot dogs, cheese, and walnut sauce.  That does not make Diana sound too crazy to me.

              After some of the stuff I have read on here I don't think she sounds at all disturbed. MK Ultra comes to mind and we have proof of microchips already.  So really JLH and SS and his wife are the ones that sound nuts to me.  I am sure someone has run a cult out of their basement before as well.  Just because it is SS does not make it impossible.  Oh, Pray Tell, a famous producer/director, they would never do anything so bazaar.  Yeah. Just you wait.  It will come out.  DC and PedoTown are one and the same.

During all the horrors that proceeded while filming Poltergeist (1982), only one scene really scared her: that in which she had to hold onto the headboard, while a wind machine blew toys into the closet behind her. She fell apart; Steven Spielberg stopped everything, put her in his arms, and said that she would not have to do that scene again. (Cinefantasque, July 1988)

            It is alleged that the bodies, all of which had gunshot wounds to the chest, were found in different rooms within the house and that a gun was discovered lying next to Michael Birnkrant’s body, leading investigators to suspect the incident was a murder-suicide.   Another tragedy connected to SS.

              <p>
               Again, Hewitt was 15 when recording this... probably younger when decisions were made about what "material" to put on the album?

                  I wonder if these records ever made any money, or if they were purely a vehicle for testing (humiliating) her?

                  According to

                   wikipedia
                  </a>
                  , Hewitt released
                  <em>
                   two
                  </em>
                  major label albums in 1995 and 1996. Combined, they had a total of seven singles... all of which "failed to chart".
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Her 1995 album stands out because of
                  <a href="http://www.caratulas.com/caratulas/J/Jennifer_Love_Hewitt/Jennifer_Love_Hewitt-Lets_Go_Bang-Trasera.jpg">
                   the cover art
                  </a>
                  , and the blatant theme of its title/lyrics (Let's Go Bang). Again, Hewitt was 15.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Unlike the Lolita sunglasses, heart-shape symbols and other clues in earlier videos, this "music" project seems to have been
                  <em>
                   all
                  </em>
                  about making Hewitt sing lyrics, do photo shoots, etc. that were so overtly sexual as to
                  <strong>
                   publicly degrade her
                  </strong>
                  .
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then, she gets rewarded with the starring role on TV's
                  <em>
                   Party of Five,
                  </em>
                  and the
                  <em>
                   I Know What You Did Last Summer
                  </em>
                  movie franchise in 1997. But only after she and her stage mom surrender their dignity by cooperating on an album that presents Hewitt as a 100% sex slave, even if no one planned on the music actually being successful...

                   It sounds like the typical pay your dues.  Get sexualized and then let us shame you.  After you do all that only then are you finally rewarded.  Only after God knows what you have let them do to you.  I have a feeling that all these kids are so very needy, needing love from there Moms and never getting it, and doing whatever mom wants her to do.  Go ahead, go with the nice man in the suit.

                    Yup. From the outside, it's hard to believe that execs would sink thousands of dollars in a project they knew would have no commercial upside for them.

                    But when you understand they're playing a bigger game, you can see them dangling a "major label" opportunity in front of the girl's mom, and laughing about the terrible music they're using as an excuse to debase her.

                Yeah, it's inappropriate for a minor that age to be singing those lyrics.

                I feel sorry for the victims. At least the ones who don't become handlers themselves.

            I think that John Mayer is gay. I think that his relationships with women are fake. They're just a cover because he doesn't want to come out.  Just like Tom and Nicole. The reason she couldn't become pregnant is because she and Tom never had sex. The whole Jessica Simpson is Fergie thing is just a big mess. But I think it's true. Two for the price of one. Sorry if I went off topic.

             Good God.  What was that?  A place for Mommy Dearests to whip there daughter into shape?  Like a little Stripper Rehearsal Stage?  The pedophiles are guilty of course but the mothers should not be forcing their children into parading themselves like this. This story sounds like the description of what they demanded Heather O to do on stage day in and out in front of a group of old lecherous old men.  Dressed in a tiny little bikini she also paraded back and forth on the stage at the age of 12.  Did her mother show up to see what she was doing all those afternoons?  No. Was reminded in your story you sent that the Oakwood Arms is next door to Warner Bros.  I had forgotten.

            If Spielberg is exposed as a pedo then Hollywood is screwed. He is their crown jewel. That would tarnish the entire industry.
Ha.  I can't wait.  He is linked to so many it is endless. I really think the Oakwood Arms needs more research.  A heartbreaker for me has always been Heather O.  RIP Heather.

              Just watched the video.  He seems to know exactly what she is talking about and also said he used to live right near there.  She said also that Louis B Mayer suggested she and her mother stay there and she also added it was a place that housed a lot of old divorced men.  She also said that she was looking for Real Men, meaning not those at Oakwood.  Hmm.  REAL Men.

              Just going through the thread now.  This will take a while I am very through, but it said something I had forgotten.  Oakwood Arms is where Corey Haiams died in 2010.  Also this:   Enjoy loads of amenities at The Toluca Hills Apartments, where your backyard is Griffith Park and your neighbors are Warner Bros., Universal and Walt Disney Studios. Live the Angeleno ideal, where getting away and getting to work are both easy.  WHOA!  How can this be any more convenient for abuse!  Should be renamed THE PEDO ARMS.

             Exposed to who by who? The MSM is going to reveal to the sheeple that Spielberg and Hollywood are a pedo traficking network? That post is foolish. He "can't wait". He willhave to wait indefinately.  As always, nobody seems to be able to retain information about how the system works and who controls it. Wasted research.

               I could not open all the links only because it would be too upsetting, but just from reading it alone it has too much sexual messaging.  By messaging I mean they slip in sly messages that mean something else.  But of course, they think we are stupid.  The flying pizza (we know what pizza means) is another way to add their pedo message and the cleaver is just horrid.  Taking a meat cleaver to a child sex slave?  Yeah.  They again are messaging in plain sight.  Two wacky sex movies with her, probably a lot went on while not filming as well.

                 That actually is another message.  It is exactly what he is doing in real life.  drugging his stars and creating dysfunctions and many end up dead.  The parents that drop off their kids at that place and act as if they are innocent when their kids are abused and end up either dead or with a lifetime of Hell, they are the worst kind of parent.  Selling their kids for profit.  We know that there are plenty of stories going around about that.  They cannot lay down their heads on their pillows and have a good night's sleep, when they have created Nightmares for their Kids.

              A very interesting article.  Also frightening to think that around 300 kids and their parents register there every year.  So their kids can be either chosen or not.  Think about that too, at that age.    The only industry in America that can legally employ infants and children.  Just think about that folks.  Sickening.

              Something has to happen soon.  There are those that still support him and always come to his defense, but I believe the masses know the truth.  That is what gives me faith.  People are slowly finding out about SS and WA.  They support is weakening.  And so is my patience.

               You are full of it. The masses do not know the truth. Tell your family and friends everything you know and see how many agree with you.. Stop the disinfo. Stop saying we are winning and stop relying on faith. We do something or nothing gets done.  The support weaking for Hollywood is because of a perceived left wing commie slant. The media played the shell game and you guys helped them by saying Trump was fighting pedos because Matt Lauer abuses women. Made no sense but you guys ran with it. Saying people are waking up and we are winning does not make it so. They are stil in 100% control. The sheeple think the problem is the lefties gotta go.

              Just remembered I looked up Tammy O'Rourke, Heather's older sister.
              <a href="http://www.thefullwiki.org/Tammy_O">

              </a>
              %27Rourke    Tammy Lorraine O'Rourke (born September 30, 1971) is a former child actress and dancer and the older sister of Heather O'Rourke, and was instrumental in Heather's discovery by Steven Spielberg.   I have not been able to find how she was instrumental.  Was she discovered by him as well, is that how he found Heather?  Idk, but this really shocked me.

              Tammy has been happily married since 1991   Let's hope she has had plenty of therapy and has faced the demons.
