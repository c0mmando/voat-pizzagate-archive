<p>What does aging have to do with anything? Well, &quot;spirit cooking&quot; performance artist Marina Abramović is 70 years old and this is what she looked like: <a href="http://www.gosee.us/news/celebrity/what-a-show-gosee-just-loves-performance-artist-marina-abramovic-at-70-with-photos-for-new-york-magazine-by-ruven-afanador-c-o-sarah-laird-good-company-38226/cat">http://www.gosee.us/news/celebrity/what-a-show-gosee-just-loves-performance-artist-marina-abramovic-at-70-with-photos-for-new-york-magazine-by-ruven-afanador-c-o-sarah-laird-good-company-38226/cat</a></p>
<p>Might her &quot;ageless&quot; appearance alone explain much of her appeal? And she does have appeal; Time magazine, for example, listed her among their &quot;100 Most Influential People of 2014&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.complex.com/style/2014/04/time-lists-marina-abramovic-as-one-of-the-100-most-influential-people-of-2014">http://www.complex.com/style/2014/04/time-lists-marina-abramovic-as-one-of-the-100-most-influential-people-of-2014</a></p>
<p>tl;dr: I think the key is narcissism. Do perversion and psychopathy also play a part? Doubtless. But those illnesses can express themselves in many ways. Narcissism maybe the key to understanding the appeal of ritual magic, and all the things that may come with it.</p>',

            I do think their narcissism leads them to their satanism. Satan was pretty narcissistic as it is. I guess when you're rich and have power, all that money goes to your head and you feel limitless. Not to mention they also have kids who unfortunately are raised just like them, possibly worse. Her agelessness is a result of consuming young blood in occult rituals. Just a theory.

            My friend who committed suicide, great grandfather was into black magic. He saw things, he went to far into it, he went into the abyss, eventually he committed suicide. As for something like this, #pizzagate, satanic cults, child sacrifices, spirit cooking etc - It goes deeper, your born into it, or pledged into it aka (Skulls &amp; Bones) etc. Its about living forever, having power. Lets say  A LOT of these satanic top level cults have power and money right? you would get bored, easy.. join a satanic cult and murder children/animals, drink blood, eat human remains. The human brain is easily accessible.  This is from my opinion and lots of research. Its really no mystery, once you start to "understand" what the motivation is behind all of this. It does not get easier "understanding" why they do this, but figuring out WHERE, WHEN &amp; HOW they do this is the key. Its one big revolving rubik's cube.
