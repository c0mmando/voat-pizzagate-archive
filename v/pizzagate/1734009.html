            Being Jewish is NOT about the religion of Judaism!  It is about BLOOD/GENES/DNA.

            BTW, I am a survivor/victim and my family is crypto J, the bloodline of King David, full of Freemasons. We NEVER attended a synagogue, wore a yarmulke, etc.  Only stepped foot in a church twice, and that was Southern Baptist.

            Would you rather run a short game for immediate results, or would your rather run a long game, plan for contingency, and execute said plan with as many allies as you can muster?

            you can't truth bomb everyone and expect it to sink in; there's something called cognitive dissonance which means that person's brain literally can't process the information and will believe the lie rather than the truth because it's easier to comprehend. Sometimes you gotta ease into the subject like it's a gimp suit (to quote Archer) otherwise it'll go to shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            You want to alienate people, make them dismiss you out of hand because they've been conditioned and programmed to perceive things a certain way? Go right on ahead. Some of us are thinking bigger picture, like the kind of big picture that involves a seething mass of humanity walking down DC, the HEY memes as signs. Everybody with a sign, so no matter where mainstream media is, they see the same questions asked over and over, that is assuming they actually cover it. It's going to take a coordinated effort to bring the proper attention to the issue, and forcing people to view it in a light that doesn't jive with their programming will ultimately backfire, imo. You do you, I'll do me, so on so forth. I think the main issue regardless of where one stands is the need to communicate human trafficking is enabled at the federal level. Everything else will fall into place through the course of mainstream investigation. Just have to get it to the tipping point where Ben Swann can freely cover the topic. Once he's free to do so, more mainstream "reporters" will fall in line.

            I believe the Jews are the Kings of Crypto they go deep in all the dominate societies they find themselves in.  They Crypto in Turkey and push their kind to the top alah Attaturk.

            To this date, there is extreme confusion among Muslims and non-Muslims alike around the world regarding who was masonic dictator Mustafa Kemal (widely known as "Ataturk", meaning the father of Turks). Recently, yet other evidences have surfaced that cruel dictator Mustafa Kemal, the anti-islamic ruler and the first president of modern (secular) Turkey, was not only a non-muslim crypto-jew doenmeh, but also a secret descendant of 17th-century Jewish false messiah Sabbatai Tzwi (Zevi)! The evidence comes not from tracing his genealogy, but from the statements he himself made. Check out the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            House of Saud gained prominence in the Peninsula under the British who where already under the domination of the Rothschilds to create Israel in the Balfour Agreement.
            <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/2015/12/is-the-saudi-royal-family-jewish/">
             http://themillenniumreport.com/2015/12/is-the-saudi-royal-family-jewish/
            </a>
            Descendants of Saud (the present day Saudi Family) started a campaign of assassination of the prominent leaders of the Arab Tribes under the pretence that those leaders were apostates; renegading from the Islamic Religion, and deserting their Qur’aanic doctrines; so they deserved the Saudi condemnation and slaughter!
           </p>
           <p>
            In the History Book of the Saudi Family pages 98-101, their private family historian declares that the Saudi dynasty considers all people of Najd blasphemous, so their blood must be shed, their properties confiscated, and their females taken as concubines; no Muslim is authentic in his/her belief unless he/she belongs (affiliates) to the sect of Mohammad bin Abdul Wahab (whose origins are also Jewish from Turkey.) His doctrines give authority to the Saudi Family to destroy villages with all their inhabitants-males including children, and to sexually assault their women; stab the bellies of the pregnant, and cut off the hands of their children, then burn them! They are further authorized by such a brutal doctrine to plunder all the properties of which they call renegades (not following their Wahabi sect.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Their hideous Jewish family has, in fact, done all that kind of atrocities in the name of their false religious sect (the Wahabi), which has actually been invented by a Jew so as to sow the seeds of terror in the hearts if people in towns and villages. This Jewish Dynasty has been committing such brutal atrocities ever since 1163 A.H. They have named the whole Arabian Peninsula after their family name (Saudi Arabia) as if the whole region is their own personal real estate, and that all other inhabitants are their mere servants or slaves, toiling day and night for the pleasure of their masters (The Saudi Family.)
           </p>
           <p>
            They are completely holding the natural wealth of the country as their own property. If any poor person from the common people raises his/her voice complaining against any of the despotic rules of this Jewish Dynasty, the Dynasty cuts off his/her head in the public square. A princess of theirs once visited Florida, USA, with her retinue; she rented 90 (ninety) Suite rooms in a Grand Hotel for about One Million dollars a night! Can anyone of her subjects comment about that extravagant event? If he/she does, his/her fate is quite known: DEATH WITH THE EDGE OF THE SAUDI SWORD IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE!!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            WITNESSES ON THE JEWISH ANCESTRY OF THIS SAUDI FAMILY:
           </p>
           <p>
            In the 1960’s the “Sawt al Arab ” Broadcasting Station in Cairo, Egypt, and the Yemen Broadcasting Station in Sana’a confirmed the Jewish ancestry of the Saudi family.
           </p>
           <p>
            King Faisal Al-Saud at that time could not deny his family’s kindred with the Jews when he declared to the Washington Post on Sept.17, 1969 stating: “We, the Saudi Family, are cousins of the Jews: we entirely disagree with any Arab or Muslim Authority which shows any antagonism to Jews; but we must live together with them in peace. Our country (Arabia) is the fountain head from where the first Jew sprang, and his descendants spread out all over the world.” That was the declaration of King Faisal Al-Saud bin Abdul Aziz!!!
           </p>

            The English Royal family are Jews.

            What we have been sold is no less than the groundwork for the imposition of a future Jewish Monarchy in Great Britain. And engineered by the House of Rothschild, whose relations and puppets on Wall Street and in the City of London are responsible for a deliberatly created international financial crisis aimed at creating a one world currency system, a one world bank and a New World Order, one world government.
           </p>
           <p>
            As one Royal insider commented “An insecure immigrant Royal family who have never felt at ease with the British people, and always more secure with immigrants and outsiders, and an alliance with the richest Jewish family in the world, heads of what is increasingly being re-Christened “The Jew World Order, who also seek to raise their status, is perceived by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh as the best guarantor of their family’s future and safety. In short, we will one day see a Rothschild Royal family.”

            GoldsmithKate
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people still cannot get Kate Middleton or why she, a supposed ‘commoner’ would marry Prince William.  But hidden right under our noses is the truth the controlled mainstream media is hiding. Kate Middleton is a Jew from a maternal line of non-practicing, assimilated and poor Sephardic Jews aligned to the Church of England. Her mother whose maiden name is Goldsmith, practicing or not is Jewish and under Jewish law if the mother is Jewish then the children are Jewish, therefore the children of Prince William will be legally Jewish….especially as William, under Judaic law, is also a Jew!
           </p>
           <p>
            Under Jewish law if William and Kate have children their children will be Jews!

            PRINCESS DIANA WAS A JEW BECAUSE HER MOTHER WAS A JEW THEREFORE PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY ARE JEWS:
           </p>
           <p>
            PRINCESS DIANA’S PARENTAL JEWISH LINEAGE:
           </p>
           <p>
            In Tina Brown’s book ‘The Diana Chronicles’, the author claims that Princess Diana’s Jewish mother Frances Shand Kydd had a long-running affair with Sir James Goldsmith during her marriage to Earl Spencer. She suggests that Diana who was born in 1961, was Goldsmith’s love child and not Spencer’s daughter. Even so the fathers line is irrelevant as Jewishness travels down the matriarchal line and Diana’s mother was a Jew.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Goldschmidts, like their neighbors and relatives the Rothschilds, had been prosperous merchant bankers in Frankfurt, Germany since the 16th century.(Wikipedia). In 1773, Mayer Rothschild invited Goldschmidt, (Goldsmith), Schiff, Oppenheimer, Warburg and eight other ambitious Jewish businessmen to his goldsmith shop. Together they formulated a long term plan to seize control of the world’s wealth over many generations and to impliment the commands of the Holy Talmud that Jews be the chosen people to control the world, while non-Jews (Goyim) would become their slaves. They made a pact to secretly pool their money and influence to bankrupt the nations of the world and create a New World Order. In effect they have been for centuries the ruling Learned Elders of Zion.

            Fidel and Raul Castro’s parents Ángel Castro y Argiz and Lina Ruz Gonsalez The mother could easily pass of for an Ashenazi grandmother in Jerusalem The father looks Jewish too Comrade Fidel looking angrily Jewish or Jewishly angry and Comrade Raul Castro celebrates Hanukkah with Cuban Jews

           <p>
            Fidel and Raul Castro were  born out of wedlock at his father’s farm on August 13, 1926. Raul was born in 1831 after the parents had married The father, Ángel Castro y Argiz, was a migrant to Cuba from Galicia, Northwest Spain.The Castro’s mother was from Spains Canary Islands

            Galicia was an ancient province in the northwestern part of Spain; a barren, mountainous region where Jews settled sparsely in the eleventh century. There were Jewish communities at Allariz, Coruña, Orense, Monforte, Pontevedra, Rivadavia, and Rivadeo, besides individual Jews scattered here and there. Jewish Encyclopedia

           <p>
            Since the Canary Islands were taken over by Spain after the Expulsion of 1492, the first Jewish immigrants to the Canary Islands were *Conversos from Spain and Portugal seeking refuge from the Inquisition and persecution.  The Conversos from southern Spain were the first Europeans to join the small local population of Berber-African origin. In the 17th century, many Conversos, largely from Portugal, settled in Palma and Tenerife. Many of the Conversos who settled in the Canaries led a Jewish life. During the 17th century the islands witnessed a revival of Judeo-Converso life. The islands were a convenient stepping stone to the New World and London. The number of Conversos increased considerably. Jewish virtual Library

            The Secret Fidel Castro: Deconstructing the Symbol By Servando Gonzalez pg 316

           <p>
            Aged six, Fidel was sent to live with his teacher in Santiago de Cuba, before being baptized into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of eight.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Normal Catholics are baptised soon after birth The “baptism” after 8 years may have been an attempt by the parents to cover up their crypto legacy)
           </p>
           <p>
            He was then sent to the Jesuit-run Dolores School In 1945 he transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit–run El Colegio de Belén in Havana.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like Fidel, Raúl also  attended the Jesuit School of Colegio Dolores in Santiago and Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (Spanish: Colegio Belén) in Havana.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus BOTH Fidel and Raul spent their entire academic life with Jesuits  The Jesuit order is full of crypto jews and the founders of the order are believed to have been cryptos themselves

            When dealing with Christians, who believe in Jesus and therefore also the adversary, the satanic angle can actually help.  If your red pill target is Christian and more Faith inclined than Reason inclined, this has better odds of gaining ground.  Many more rational Christians who see the descriptions of satan or the devil in the bible as metaphor or imagery are less likely to draw in.  A lot of Pizzagate is things you take on faith in order to draw the lines.  Those who are more faith based AND inclined to believe that evil exists in the world will be more easily red pilled.  Logic, Rational, Evidence based people without substantial curiosity are less likely to get red pilled until it's too late.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say that by this point this forum is not a place for newbies to be redpilled.  I have been red pilled by watching the censorship unfold in real time.  That's something you can't really get by coming here now as we are largely insulated from the rest of the internet.  The satanism/occult aspect was very helpful for me to find the location of a secret temple and communicate it to all of you because I was able to use their symbolic language against them.  (You can check my post history for the subway station temple.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The satanism aspect is useless in communicating with others who are new or blank slates to the state of the world.  NOT knowing or at least tentatively accepting the satanism aspect once you are here and at least partially pilled will be a barrier to further progress.

            I agree, i don't think we should torture anyone and get off on causing extreme pain, let God deal with that. Efficient and quick deaths for the pedos, not torture. In the bible God used agents to cleanse evil for the sake of the good people who needed safety and protection and were too meek to defend themselves. I also think if it turns to violent revolution, we can't just kill people freely. Round up the ones who are have evidence of pedo activity and put them to trial, using tech now you can separate psychos and liars with incredible accuracy. If anyone attacks to kill the people pursuing justice for children, that is the license right there to protect yourself and the good people and eliminate them quick. In the bible you are allowed to defend yourself and others with force against evil in self-defense, but not lynch mobs and angry frothing people, that is a form of evil itself and we have to be cognizant of that. These bad apples can also spoil the ranks but in more subtle and snaking ways we don't see coming. Thats why when i suggested street watchers, if this did boil over.. not to start killing people on the streets but wait for the evil ones to reveal themselves, keep watch. They will do that by trying to rape, murder and loot amidst the chaos. Looters (should have separated that in the earlier post) can go to trial unless they attack you when you try to apprehend them, then self defense principle kicks in again. Rapists and murderers = efficient execution.

            I strongly disagree. There are significant religious themes like the Trinity and the whore of Babylon which are connected to unnatural sexuality, and religion remains a significant social driver. The genocide of native Canadians which occurred as part of their religious "education" and the billions of dollars paid by the church against claims of sexual abuse are strong indicators of a fundamental problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            While it's true that focusing on specific aspects of the religious problem can be counterproductive, this can be remedied by an examination of the underlying religious themes which endorse harm against innocents.

            I agree, the emails had undeniable references to their involvement in occult activities. If some people are too scared and shocked to consider the pedo information, the occult connections give them something to digest that makes it clear these are not good people, no one normal believes in that stuff (many good people still hang onto religion as a moral compass even if the roots are bad like roman catholics) and it is backed up by evidence in the emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm enlightened, or trying to be moreso every day anyway lol i try to think with clear eyes at all times and I've never been religious, i never even practiced my cultural norms (Edit: First Nations so as to not confuse people). But i see patterns here that are undeniable (and some odd signs at the same time that i cannot chalk up to coincidence). I try to think with many layers overlapping each other (science and logic, spirituality and and metaphysics, real world constructs and human nature patterns). When i do this so many things about history and ourselves fit together rather than conflict with each other, a spatial approach.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although we can all still support the same cause without being divided by our different beliefs. I believe in god, you don't. But we both want to go after pedos. For those trying to corner people into taking one or the other approach will actually divide the movement more, no way people like me are going to suppress the idea of God, no way. But i do agree that you should tailor your approach depending on your audience, the purpose here is to not impose your views on others to sway their mind about God, moreso we want them to join the fight to protect kids so if they don't believe, take the rational approach. if they do, take the spiritual, both have evidence to back it up that the opposition does these things, practices satanism and victimizes children. If you're a pagan that believes in the natural world only but are a good person that cares about others, then no i don't consider you evil lol

           <p>
            You have to be wise and direct your message at your audience.   Start with verifiable statistics, human trafficking and slavery, child trafficking, organ havesting and the evidence of past criminal pedo rings.  then move into the Instagrams, emails, Satanism and art.

             This. All of this. You start off with the Satanic portions, and as true as they may be, you will instantly be tuned out as some religious whackjob who thinks Satan hides under every rock. (I'm atheist FWIW, but understand strong enough belief could drive someone to do something great...or horrifying. I was brought in by sketchy, coded Wikileaks emails, CPP's Insta, and Laura Silsby, and came to better understand some of the occult connections later on.)

            I do worry about our ability to prove someone is a Satanist, or even the usefulness of it (other than being able to use it to personally recognise a fiend when you see one). Take Katy Perry. Admits on camera she sold her soul. We can show that to people but what progress will we have made?

            FBI anon warned about the occult line. Said you will get lost down that hole and have nothing to show for it. As much as I believe it's central to the whole thing, I'm starting to understand what was said.

             Hmm, gonna have to read the AMAs again for that. If this is true, it leads me to wonder if those abused aren't being manipulated (using MK Ultra or Monarch style techniques?) into believing and "recalling" their captors are engaging in ritualistic sacrifices and cannibalism. The intent of this would be if an abuse victim ever did escape their grasp and tell an uncontrolled authority, their story would be perceived as so outlandish that it "couldn't possibly be real".

              I'm not trying to discourage research into the occult side of things, it's integral to the investigation I believe. However I think I am starting to agree that it's one endless mind fuck rabbit hole, and while we may find commonalities in PG people of interest and occult practices, I'm not sure what we can do to leverage that information.

            As far as public outreach I fully agree.  The Satanist aspects and the Art aspects are the weakest case for pedogate as art and religion in a suppsedly open secular society are considered relative.  They are also very powerful once the INTENTIONS behind any religious act or artwork is understood.  Thus if you can red-pill the public by getting them to understand trafficking statistics, organ trafficking, elite criminal cartels - all of which can be proven in one way or another - and then go to pedogates of the past such as Franklin or Seville or Epstein's Island, then you may enter the third phase and show the art, the obsession with dark religious impulses, oh and the emails and instagrams.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Christians here have a large contingent from China called Followers of Jesus or Jesus Followers for some reason.  Call it the miracle of the internet, and possibly the interest of the Taiwan based writer Yoichi Shimatsu.  They are passionate and well intentioned, but at first often failed to understand secular Western comfort with say Heavy Metal images, goth culture, etc...  Plus their tradition came from missionaries and tends to be quite black and white - you either use a spiral and are a ped and Satanist, or you don't.  I have noticed them to be extremely proficient with English and very smart. It has been an interesting experience discussing symbols with them.  They may think you are going to hell, but they are still very polite about it.  ; )

             The Satanic and Art aspects allows you to identify a person's allegiance to a group, the satanists are known to allow human sacrifices, child rape rituals, depraved art and satanic symbols.  These signs are very crucial, because it allows us to identify them before we know anything about them.  I also find it strange that the most powerful people seem worship satan.

             For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

              You have to watch oversimplistic generalizing, or it turns into a witch hunt and innocent people can be grouped in with others by  mistake.

               We need to identify the symbols and art, then we can further investigate the person.  I found
               <a href="http://imgur.com/a/3vmh6">
                Nik Sin666
               </a>
               through his display of symbols and art and then I found out he was involved in a lot of strange things.  You have to remember that satanism is the absolute opposite of God, so that is why satanist rape and kill kids, as well as cannibalism.

                I don't have to remember that, I dont believe in the Devil as a personality the way you do.  I believe humans create beings out of their focus - when you focus on Satan, you effectively create him.  If you focus on Angels, you'll create them. Also there have been God oriented cults that also have pedophilia, rape, murder.  You have to understand your view is not the only view and not the only right thing.

                 You can believe that if you want to, but in the real world, there is a spiritual war going on between Good and evil, between God and the devil.  And pizzagate opened my eyes to all the evil that we have been desensitized to.  Investigating pizzagate made me realize that the people in power worship the devil and they have a lot of devil friends like James Alefanitis.

                 What was in the bible is actually happening,  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

             what about all the Catholic and Protestant pedophiles, the Mormons and Muslims and New Age cult abusers?  You give them a pass when you talk like that targeting one group.  Don't be a bigot.   Be an equal opportunity pedo fighter.   There are subverses dedicated to racists if that's what you are looking for go there.

             and jews learnt from the egyptians... that link you are missing. Just see all illuminati symbols. They go back to Ancient Egyptians.

             That is the root of satanism. Jews learnt from them all wicked things.

              I made a post that was deleted, it was my theory that pizza is sacred geometry in the Kabbalah and that may be the reason why Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry have a over obsession for pizza

             "In a book titled, “The Nazis World War II”, by Robert Edwin Herzstein, published by Time Life Books, there is the following quote apparently said by Hitler himself!
            </p>
            <p>
             Hitler said even in his death that he will start World War 3. One of his soldiers asked, “how?” Hitler replied, “The day mankind finds out that I was trying to defend this nation, Germany, from then that is the day #WorldWar3 will start. For on that day, mankind will learn that I was trying to save my Nation from the Free Masons, the Illuminati, and the Jews. For if the Americans wins the war, then they will conquer the world and forever be a slave to the Jews, and they will try to conquer God. Do you know who America has in its possession?“ he asked. “No”, the solider replied. The Americans have the Jewels Of God. The Americans have stolen God’s Precious Jewels.” he said. “What Do You Mean His Precious Jewels?” the soldier asked. Hitler replied, “America has stolen the Jews. The Jews Of God. His Jewelry. The #Negroes. They are the true #Hebrew’s. What a foolish move and a direct challenge to God, and they plan on moving these false white Jews into a state of Israel"
            </p>
            <p>
             Revelation 2:9 says, “I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically Hitler knew a white Jew is a convert from the Khazar empire and is absolutely not related to Jesus.

            The woman who wrote the post is a witch.  Satanism is heavily relevant in pizzagate, most people among the elite have a strange taste for creepy artwork, like John Podesta, Tony Podesta, James Alefantis, Nik Sin,Tres Shannon, Kenneth "Cat Daddy" Pogson.  These people are in the occult, so the best way to find new leads is to know who these people are connected to in the occult, because satanism allows child rape and requires it.  So we can't separate satanism from pizzagate.  MK Ultra is satanic ritual abuse.

             Yes, MK Ultra uses SRA; it's a staple of it. Those who are enabled by the CIA practice unhindered by masquerading as Christians and going to church. A lot of the abuse happens at these churches, and not just the Catholic church.
