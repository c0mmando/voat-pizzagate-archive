<p>Earlier today, Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/11/28/16711256/fcc-ajit-pai-net-neutrality-cher-twitter">gave an interview</a> regarding his recent push to end the net neutrality protections. He made many interesting points, but this one is essentially the tl;dr of this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pai said... that tech giants could pose the greatest threat by discriminating against viewpoints on the internet. “They might cloak their advocacy in the public interest,” he said, “but the real interest of these internet giants is in using the regulatory process to cement their dominance in the internet economy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pai goes on to describe his policy and states that some ISPs may prioritise some content over others and such. But then, would you believe it, it turns out the big companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter have been urging him to stand down recently, so Pai turned his sights towards them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now look: I love Twitter,” Pai began. “But let’s not kid ourselves; when it comes to a free and open Internet, Twitter is a part of the problem. The company has a viewpoint and uses that viewpoint to discriminate.”</p>
<p>“And unfortunately, Twitter is not an outlier,” Pai continued. “Indeed, despite all the talk, and all the fear, that broadband providers could decide what internet content consumers can see, recent experience shows that so-called edge providers are in fact deciding what content they see. These providers routinely block or discriminate against content they don’t like.”</p>

            Gamergate was when people started to notice this censorship. People caught journalists and employers behaving badly, blackmailing and blacklisting, racketeering, a few contests may have been rigged, and the dickheads behind it had obnoxious opinions like saying the US deserved 9/11. Every major gaming publication was guilty and they responded to the criticism by denouncing literally everyone who plays video games in what was essentially the same article published by a dozen different authors on a dozen different sites on the same day.
           </p>
           <p>
            This all pissed off a lot of people who wanted to talk about it. Twitter, Reddit, Fark, 4chan, and almost every other site on the internet banned all discussion of any of this. Wikipedia banned anyone who tried to document it, put up a fake page about harassment instead, and waited for citogenesis to set in. A few smaller news sites had their hosts kick them off because they had written stories about it. Even the "bulletproof" hosts that allow spammers and kiddie porn wouldn't allow news sites that ran articles about Gamergate. 8chan had its domain name pulled and was kicked off Patreon because it allowed discussion of Gamergate. People started losing their jobs and getting kicked out of university because they had talked about a corporate business scandal on the Internet. The EFF helped to blacklist people who asked them to stand against the censorship.

            The gamers went in for a long grind and started digging, and they found government connections all over the place.

            Facebook has always been Thought Police v1.0, dressing up as an app. This thought police can identify who you are, track you among other people... just you wait until it's integrated with the 'next step' world government surveillance system.

            The sad truth is voat is of only a handful of places one can go to discuss things like Pizzagate. Pizzagate, which was deemed the worse hoax on the planet, and judging from all the commotion from the media to cover it up, a very real thing that needs to be further exposed and talked about.
           </p>
           <p>
            I always thought it didn't make any sense that almost every single company that advertises would give collective billions of dollars in free advertising to company's like Twitter and Facebook. Makes. no. sense.

            Google’s Eric Schmidt admits political censorship of search results
Schmidt’s remarks at the gathering of military and national security officials confirm the World Socialist Web Site’s charges that Google has been deliberately altering its search algorithms and taking other steps to prevent people from accessing certain information through its search engines. The WSWS has itself been a principal target of these efforts.
Google’s efforts are just one part of a much wider government-corporate drive to assert control over the flow of information over the Internet, involving Amazon, Twitter and Facebook, as well as Internet service providers such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon and AT&amp;T.
A campaign against “fake news” has now become a campaign against “weaponized news,” meaning true information that is critical of or damaging to the political establishment. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has claimed that when her emails and Wall Street speeches were leaked by WikiLeaks they had been “weaponized.” Under Google’s new censorship rubric, any article written about the true information in the Clinton leaks would be a candidate for censorship

            I guess they intend to flag Pizzagaters as mentally ill and start sending their Facebook friends and police alerts that the user is mentally ill and needs intervention. They may try to get people sequestered for psych evaluations against their will by getting the family to agree that the Facebook user is mentally ill. This is getting very weird...
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully people abandon facebook in huge numbers. There is no way to Opt Out of being scanned either. We need to start memeing that Democracy is a trick word and that a Republic is what we are supposed to be. That will be a hard sell to normies but Democracy is a trick word, just like the trick Democrats.

             This is software to save lives. Facebook’s new “proactive detection” artificial intelligence technology will scan all posts for patterns of suicidal thoughts, and
             <strong>
              when necessary send mental health resources to the user at risk or their friends, or contact local first-responders
             </strong>
             . By using AI to flag worrisome posts to human moderators instead of waiting for user reports, Facebook can decrease how long it takes to send help.

              artificial intelligence (AI) might be used to analyze and report to law enforcement aberrant human behavior on social media and other online platforms
             </strong>
             was merely the far out premise of dystopian movies such as Minority Report, but now Facebook proudly brags that it will use AI to "save lives" based on behavior and thought pattern recognition.

             “There have been terribly tragic events - like suicides, some live streamed - that perhaps could have been prevented if someone had realized what was happening and reported them sooner... Artificial intelligence can help provide a better approach.” And in a post yesterday announcing the new AI suicide prevention tool integration, he wrote that “In the future, AI will be able to understand more of the subtle nuances of language, and will be able to identify different issues beyond suicide as well, including quickly spotting more kinds of bullying and hate.”

             The idea of Facebook proactively scanning the content of people’s posts could trigger some dystopian fears about how else the technology could be applied. Facebook didn’t have answers about how it would avoid scanning for political dissent or petty crime, with Rosen merely saying “we have an opportunity to help here so we’re going to invest in that.” There are certainly massive beneficial aspects about the technology, but it’s another space where we have little choice but to hope Facebook doesn’t go too far.

            <p>
             And if this is not enough to turn the public's stomach, the glowing review ends by again reasserting Facebook's "responsibility" to implement its AI tools, as "Creating a ubiquitous global communication utility comes with responsibilities beyond those of most tech companies, which Facebook seems to be coming to terms with." Essentially, the familiar argument goes, the public should just "trust us" as this is for our "safety" and we are benign and humanitarian, says Facebook.

              it will now actively and openly pursue an AI regulated future which, as Elon Musk has personally warned Zuckerberg, will likely be the very source of tyranny and ultimate destruction of future humanity

               I don't know enough about AI to evaluate the claim about Q -- Occam's razor suggests LARPers to me. But the fact that we're even talking about the
               <em>
                possibility
               </em>
               of it being AI? Yikes. I know everything's moving a LOT faster in this area than anyone is really tracking. I just can't believe I'm seeing this -- and chips -- in my lifetime.

              Well, I certainly don't know much about Elon Musk or what on earth he's on about, but infusing our brains with software and monitoring its activity does seem like a great way to learn how to control our minds...

               No, I don't.  I had read little bits and pieces about Musk, but this really opened up my eyes.  A sort of addition to the microchips they are already placing into children and workers.  They talked us into microchiping our pets as a precursor and softening the blow.  Now here we are, Brain-ware.

                I saw the report about microchips being placed in workers -- might you have a link to them being placed in children already? I've already told my (teenage) sons that nobody but nobody in our lineage will get chipped -- if they have to move to the mountains and live off the land, whatever: nobody gets chipped.

                O. And I wholeheartedly agree with your concerns about Elon. In case that wasn't clear. Lol.

                 Notice the 10th Anniversary  and also the Mason Logo and in the Side Bar is the Event Calendar for chipping the children.  Breakfast With Santa!  Wake Up People.  I have known this for months, since researching St. Louis Mo.  There is also one in Illinois also run by the Masons.

                   Just spread it around.  I sent this to a friend with grand children and she was livid.  Her kids, not so much, they think it is baloney.  I bet they did not even open the link when they found out what it was.

                    Looks like they're not using chips
                    <em>
                     yet
                    </em>
                    . My guess, though, from the programs name, is that this is a pre-chip program -- softening up the people.

                     MoCHIP is a comprehensive child identification program designed to give Missouri families a measure of protection against the ever increasing problem of missing and abducted children. MoCHIP stands for MissOuri CHild Identification and Protection Program. The program uses an Amber Alert compatible computer disc to provide their child’s critical  information to the parents.
                     <strong>
                      Microchips are NOT used in the program.

                    But I do take this very seriously. I've told my older-teen sons that nobody but nobody in our lineage is getting chipped. I've just started the conversation -- I'll get more emphatic when the grandkids come along :)

             Wow, nice find. I don't keep up with Facebook any more because it's just a given to me that they spy on everyone and censor what they want. They probably won't have robots do all the deleting for them - they can just manually delete certain accounts or posts and disguise it as an error in the automated system.
            </p>

             Hoping the live stream of Zuckerberg's suicide won't be taken down, we're all waiting for it.
