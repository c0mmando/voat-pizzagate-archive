<p>Quality independent media site “Disobedient Media” has received information in response to their Freedom of Information request.</p>
<p>102 pages from the New York State Select Committee On Crime from 1982 have been released [2]</p>
<p>The evidence was given to the New York State Select Committee on Crime, its causes, control and effect on society, in the matter of  &gt;</p>
<p>“A Public Hearing to consider the Boy Prostitution and Pornography”</p>
<p>Senators Ralph Marino, Abraham Bernstein, Howard Babbush, Owen Johnson, as well as Jeremiah McKenna and Lilli Scott were on the Committee.</p>
<p>Witnesses describe children, probably way in excess of 400, being trafficked round a circuit which encompassed Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans, New York, D.C., and Florida, spending a few weeks in each location.</p>
<p>The circuit included bars, burlesque houses, pornographic movie joints where abusers rang up between cities to arrange a child and paid by credit card. This was linked to organised crime or Mafia. One prominent figure mentioned  in connection with pornography was Michael Zaffarano.</p>
<p>Detectives from Washington DC, Carl Shoffler and Anne Fisher gave evidence and described the network. However the part I will concentrate on for this post is evidence given by Dale Smith. He was an investigator for the Select Committee on Crime and research analyst in 1978 and 1979 investigating juvenile prostitution and pornography in New York [p44]</p>
<p>Smith states that there were two 2 male “call service operations” in Washington, called Friendly Models and Stables. Call Service Operations is the euphemistic term they use to describe prostitution arranged over the phone. The prostitution of children was mixed in with this.</p>
<p>Stables was a male homosexual call service linked to another locally and two in New York. Arlington Police raided Friendly Models and obtained a warrant for the search and arrest of Stables operation [p56].</p>
<p>Robert Koehler was an accountant of several call service operations in Washington. Koehler said that details of sexual proclivities of abusers were sold to agents of foreign Intelligence [p58]</p>
<p>Johnathan Christopher Reynolds III, call service operator of Brians Boys and Fantasies Unlimited in Alexandria, Virginia. He admitted that information was sold to British and Israeli Intelligence [p59]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Detectives found that organized crime did play a role in the distribution of child pornography, but that the day-to-day activity in regards to child prostitution appeared to be run by a group of collectors who would, “trade material and trade male prostitutes back and forth.” The investigation revealed that young male and female minors were being transported between California and D.C. along a route known as the “California Connection.” The route was part of a circuit which encompassed Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans, New York, D.C., and Florida. According to detectives, clients could call a phone number in Houston from Washington and have a young boy delivered directly to their location. These purchases were incredibly streamlined and could even be made with credit cards which were charged to front companies under various guises such as photography studios, book stores, models, and model agencies.</p>
<p>Minors were also prostituted out of bars. In some cases, there would be as many as 50 to 75 minors at a single bar. Detectives found that minors were from different sections of the country and were generally runaways, some leaving from various organizations they had been placed into by the state. The investigation also noted that the younger children would be placed on narcotics in order to keep them under control, and were told not to talk to the police, and that if they did, they would receive bodily harm or be killed.</p>

            , the link Cathy Fox gave as the source for the Disobedient Media FOIA for some reason no longer works. It took some doing, but I dug around and found
            <a href="https://archive.fo/bdJeb">
             an archive of it
            </a>
            . Please read through and make sure it supports what she claims, and then add it to your submission. Is she just copypasting their research? If so, you really should post the original. For now, I am flairing this "Accuracy?"
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm wondering why the Disobedient Media site itself seems to be scrubbed. You can still find most of their articles on archive.fo:

            , I'm sorry the archived link isn't working for you. -

           <p>
            I've been having a problem with the .fo ending on archives lately.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would you mind checking to see which of these archive endings are working for you? I'll try to use the ending that works best for people.

              But when you clicked the archive in the original submission, it didn't work for you? Is that correct?

              If so, how odd that it would work now.

               That's correct, I don't know what happened.  I went back to the thread and now it works.  Maybe some of the archive endings aren't consistently accessible?  Maybe my computer? It's not the first time it's happened to me (not your links).  I don't recall having issues with .is before.

                My VPNs interfere with the .fo endings, so I just replace them with .md. Seems to work, so far.
