<p>Today\'s Blind Items - The Covenant - A Church Blind Item</p>
<p>While doing some research for an upcoming podcast episode, I had the chance to talk to someone who recently fled from this very well known cult. The person who fled is an offspring of someone I am going to call the Liaison. The Liaison acts as the middleman between the cult and The Church. In the past, I have written extensively about some of the human trafficking The Church does and how it goes about it. The problem they have encountered with their process is the sheer volume of people which need to be paid off or made aware of at least one part of the operation. Because there is a finite supply of people, they are always looking to enter new markets which requires installing an entire infrastructure of people on the payroll from the finders to workers in government offices. Also, no matter where they extended, they were always saying no to their most requested type - blonde hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>From days gone by and old books and movies, everyone has heard of the white slave trade. Don\'t send your daughters overseas or they will be kidnapped and sold on the white slave market. Mostly a myth, it is still a big request. Previously, The Church used primarily Eastern Europeans in this role. The problem is, none of them were there voluntarily and spent most of their time trying to escape and were only compliant to their owners through drugs or beatings. Not exactly the type of relationship most of the owners were envisioning. They wanted submissive compliant teens to young adults who would spend more time pleasing and less time trying to escape or being beaten.</p>
<p>Because of the location of their Headquarters, The Church has always semi-shared security with this cult. It made sense and both sides agreed the more area controlled, the less chance of outsiders interfering. The cult has been hurting financially the past few years and needed a new revenue stream. They approached The Church about some smuggling and that eventually led to human trafficking. The cult had a product that was high grade, with worldwide demand. A seemingly endless supply of blonde hair blue eyed female teens and young adults. They also solved another problem, because they are complaint and submissive ad will do what they are ordered to do.</p>
<p>It was about this same time that suddenly the leader of the cult changed the rules. No longer would there be any new marriages which would take prospective dollars away from the cult. Now, there would be more teens and young adults available to traffic. The only question was how to get them to where they needed to be. Well, the easy part were passports because, unlike kidnapped children, no one needed to be bought off to get the passport. The second great thing is that the cult has compounds all over the US and the world and no one thinks twice when young women are sent to one of these compounds to repent. They also don\'t expect the young women to stay in touch or be able to communicate because they are repenting. No one will go looking for them because they don\'t want to disobey the cult leader. Finally, the young women are told it is a direct order of the leader, so they do what they are told and join the person who bought them, voluntarily. It is a master stroke of human trafficking and also massively profitable to the tune of low six figures per teen.</p>

             In March 2017, Education Management Corporation reported that they intended to sell the Argosy schools to the Dream Center, a Los Angeles-based Pentecostal organization.[32][33] The sale faced scrutiny by regulators.[34] The transaction closed in November 2017; EDMC said it would remain in operation to wind down the approximately fifty schools that had stopped accepting new students.[35]
            </p>
            <p>
             On February 27, 2019, the US Department of Education stated that they were cutting off federal funding to Argosy University. According to Inside Higher Education, "The Education Department said that the roughly 8,800 students enrolled at Argosy campuses could seek to transfer their credits elsewhere or apply for loan cancellation in the event their campus shuts down."[2]

             Carlos Salinas, the former president of Mexico, may find himself in a unique position: he may be able to rescue his son Emiliano and his daughter Cecilia, from the dark clutches of Keith Raniere, formerly of Clifton Park, now a resident of Monterrey.
            </p>
            <p>
             As his term came near to a close, Salinas appointed his successor, Luis Donaldo Colosio. But Colosio was assassinated at a campaign stop in Tijuana.  Salinas named his campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo,as his replacement.

             Ernesto Zedillo  former campaign manager to Carlos Salinas who has a connection to NXIVM is now the Laureate Education's Presidential Council at Walden University  But also he has connections to Pres. Bill Clinton.

              Hope was, indeed, fortunate. She was Princess Night’s first princess.

              UGH. Horrid. If Dr Phil is mixed up in all of this I am not shocked. Would not be surprised if O was in on this too. Especially now that we know she is linked to Dr. John of Brazil. God these people are awful. We already suspect that pols of big cities are involved in selling off kids for organs or at least look the other way. These organs certainly how to the lower rung and not elites.  Phil and Oprah are not as far apart as we suspect imo.

                Now, at 63, Palmer is making a difference in the lives of hundreds of people as senior pastor of Atlanta International Church and founder of the Atlanta Dream Center.

               So that's the issue I'm running into, and I expect it's by design.
              </p>
              <p>
               The first Dream Centers were Tommy and Matt Barnett's in Phx and LA
              </p>
              <p>
               Sattelite/affiliates have cropped up associated all over the world and usually in partnership with an area church (usually assembly of god denominations).
              </p>
              <p>
               There is also a black sponsored "dream center/DreamAcademy which does after school and tech education programs in black churches for underprivileged kids. This org is pess explicitly christian (oprah sponsored)  but works with churches
              </p>
              <p>
               There is DreamNY and DreamLA which also host "dream centers" which are "fashion internships" for 13-19 year old girls
              </p>
              <p>
               There are the "dream centre" aids programs in 3rd world countries
              </p>
              <p>
               The specific 1 that mentions trafficking is under the banner of joyce Meyers dream center, which is affiliated with Barnett

             The  Rome congregation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the formal  name) vaunts 5,000 members while all told Italy hosts some 26,000, scattered in 100 congregations. The relationship with Italy began when a Sardinian immigrant to Boston, Mass., named Giuseppe Taranto, known in the US as "Joseph Toronto", was baptized there and then returned to Italy with two fellow American Mormons in 1849. These early Mormon missionaries were particularly active in Piedmont, where they made proselytes in the Waldensian territory.
....
Speakers also made clear that a key goal is to demonstrate their activism in Italian civil society, including with helping migrants. In recent years the Mormon church has made conscientious efforts to work together in charity projects with other organizations in Italy, including the Vatican and  Roman Catholic religious communities here. In 2015, 14,000 hygiene kits were prepared and distributed in collaboration with the Roman Catholic Sant'Egidio Community in Milan, Calabria, Palermo and Rome.
            </p>
            <p>
             That same year the Mormons donated to the Italian Red Cross a camp kitchen for preparation of 900 meals daily for the needy. The following year another 6,000 hygiene kits were prepared and delivered for distribution to Sant'Egidio in Rome. by The Mormon youth organization in Venice prepared another 3,000 such kits -- they included diapers, toothpaste, soap, toiletries -- distributed to refugees arriving across the Alps into Italy.

              The Mormons set up camp in Mexico so why not Rome?  There is still Missionary work going on I guess.  This should be very unsettling ti all.   We got Mitt Romney because we gave his Father a stipend when he came up from Mexico to Michigan.  Had we not done that we would have one less NWO elite to deal with.  What is the purpose of the Moromons over in Italy.  Evidently they are trying to do the same as in Mexico.  I don't like this one bit.  But really no one gets to do anything in Italy, and especially Rome, without the blessings of the pope.

                This is frightening.  He called the pope gracious.  Wonder if they exchanged pics of trafficked Children.  This makes me barf.  Two religions if the truth be told in reality, are nothing alike.  They would like to meet in the middle perhaps.   I think last year jorge met with Oprah and Ari Emanuel as well.  Another scary thought.

                  Anyone the pope meets with, especially connected to LDS should be highly suspect.  The pope is highly suspect as well.  He is not to be trusted and really, this meeting scares me.  Another head scratcher is that many are not up in arms over this meeting.  Yes they  have quite a bit in common, but none of it does US any good.

                   I get what you're saying tho. At the superficial level they seem opposites since papacy his ruled by a "celibate" in a fish hat wearing bling and surrounded at all times with symbols while the other guy is from a group that dresses as like feds, whose places of worship (other than the temples) are devoid of symbols, marketing (nothing as bland , intentionaly so, as a mormon church), a prez who likely has many many kids and  likely relatives (distant tho they may be) who have both many many kids as well as many many wives. Funny, I guess, when searching to see how many kids president nelson has this call back story to the 80s satanic panic era in SLC published last year popped up:

                    Most charges like this are true. Very few are false. They are using the same old excuse. They go back to the same well because the were successful once. Also the part of LE finding nothing is baliney. We know from experience and from documents that they have been bought many times. Their claims about False Memory have been debunked. It was in. A post here last year. They will pull out all stops we can be sure.

            Guesses for liason: Romney, a branch of his fam is still in Mexico. Rumours are many of the flights from Colorado City go somewhere near juarez. I also seem to remember one of the Kingston kids, FLDS sect who live in populated areas of UT rather than out in the desert, broke away from the sect. Might be the one featured in Krakauer's Under The Banner of Heaven who tried to rob some of the family's silver and gold they'd keep in some of their welfare wifes' basements.

“A lot of things are changing and we just kind of hoped people would be open to the idea,” said the owner of the first bar in Colorado City, where alcohol was once banned.

            We want to open our doors. We want to share our amazing community with the world,” said Donia Jessop, the first female, non-FLDS mayor of Hildale. She left the polygamist community and FLDS faith years ago, but moved back, hoping she could bring progress to the community — which some had described as being frozen in time

            BLIND COMMENT
"It strikes me that the cult being referred to girls ( and the supply of submissive blond haired but eyed girls) come from the Fundamentalist LDS Church, formerly run by Warren Jeffs. Its former location was Colorado City Arizona and Hilldale Utah. They are polygamists. When Warren went to prison, he stopped all marriages. Young men in the church never had a chance anyway (see the stories of the Lost Boys), as all the old farts wanted 6 or 7 wives a piece. He married/raped underage girls ( I think he had at least 50 wives) and he married them off to other older men. He inherited leadership of the church when his father Rulon Jeffs died. He had around 70 wives, I believe. This is sickening."

            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints—usually distinguished with a parenthetical (Strangite)—is a schism of the Latter Day Saint movement. It had approximately 300 members in 1998. It is a separate organization from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is considerably larger and better known, although both churches claim to be the original organization established by Joseph Smith, on April 6, 1830. The Strangite church is headquartered in Voree, Wisconsin, just outside Burlington, and accepts the claims of James Strang as successor to Smith

            David Evan McMullin[1] (born April 2, 1976) is a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operations officer who ran as an independent during the 2016 United States presidential election.
           </p>
           <p>
            Soon after McMullin joined the CIA, the September 11 attacks occurred, leading to an accelerated training and deployment. He spent the next decade working overseas on counterterrorism and intelligence operations as an operations officer with the National Clandestine Service[14] in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia.[12] He was first deployed in 2003 and left the agency in 2010.[11]
           </p>
           <p>
            After leaving the CIA and graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 2011,[17] McMullin began working for the Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs,[10] and he remained at the company about a year and a half.[18] In 2012, he volunteered for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, which indirectly led to him being recruited by Republicans on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs looking for an adviser with counter-terrorism experience. In 2013, McMullin was an International Advisory Board member for the Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young University.[19]
           </p>
           <p>
            He is is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
           </p>
           <p>
            McMullin has never been married.[59]

              Strang's defense of polygamy was rather woman-centered. He claimed that far from enslaving or demeaning women, it liberated and "elevated" them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to them—even if that mate were already married to someone else.[79] Rather than being forced to wed "corrupt and degraded sires" due to the scarcity of more suitable men, a woman could wed the one she saw as the most compatible to herself, the best candidate to father her children and the man who could give her the best possible life, no matter how many other wives he might have.[80]

             Fascinating little bit there. I have a feeling Nxivm/elite bloodlines also employ similar psychology in their embrace of polyamory.
            </p>
            <p>
             Statistically, the highest quality mates are already in relationships, thus monogamy is bad as it creates "inferior offspring"

              Again, there are no coincidences.  I many times think they insert names and little messages into the movies for a reason.

            It will be impossible to figure out who the recently escaped person is. There are maybe thousands of people who have left since Lyle Jeffs started the United Order in 2011/2012 and began separating all the families. Warren has about 70 siblings, but many of them have left. His brothers Seth, Nephi, and Isaac are assumed to be running the FLDS now. There are a lot of Barlow's in the FLDS too, but any that posed a threat to Warren have been kicked out. There are actually at least 30 or so family names in the FLDS.

              Oh my yes.  Well I will not hold my breath until they receive their just desserts.  I am hoping that if they are the last ones, that they go soon.  The scary thing is, that there are more and more atheists every day.  It is because of the bad practices of the "holy men".  How can people want to be a part of that?  Sad.

             I'd rule out Wallace. He was kicked out of the FLDS in 2010. All of his kids are out and have been for a while. None have escaped recently. Merril Jessop, who was in charge of the compound in Texas,  was kicked out before he went to prison. He was paroled in 2015. Would be 80 something now.

            These people also had a massive church cult branch in some place called Bountiful in BC Canada. I beleieve they were caught many times sending underage girls to places in the US for marriage and who knows what else.

            Not sure if you guys are familiar with Quinn Michaels but he’s talking about “The covenant” since a few years now. If you believe his story, his son was taken away from him. His ex is in “the covenant”. Might be worth looking at some of his vids.

             1." Voree (pronounced "Vor-ee") is an unincorporated community in the Town of Spring Prairie in Walworth County, Wisconsin, United States.[1][2][3] It is best known as the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), a denomination of the Latter Day Saint (Mormon) movement. According to James Strang, founder of the Strangite church and of the town, the name means "Garden of Peace".[4] The community is situated along former Wisconsin Highway 11 just west of the Racine County line."

             "The Voree plates, also called The Record of Rajah Manchou of Vorito,[pronunciation?] or the Voree Record, were a set of three tiny metal plates allegedly discovered by Latter Day Saint leader James J. Strang in 1845 in Voree, near Burlington, Wisconsin. Purportedly the final testament of an ancient American ruler named "Rajah Manchou of Vorito", Strang asserted that this discovery vindicated his claims to be the true successor of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement—as opposed to Brigham Young, whom most Latter Day Saints accepted as Smith's successor in 1844. The plates also lent credence to his claim that Voree, not the Salt Lake Valley, was to be the new "gathering place" of the Latter Day Saints. Strang's purported translation of this text is accepted as scripture by his church and some other bodies descending from it, but not by any other Latter Day Saint organization."

 "Young women tending babies at the Hildale Maternity Clinic in Colorado City, Ariz. All women in FLDS share the same goal: having as many children as possible, and living with "plural" wives."

"Both men, who are part of the 1,000-resident community of Bountiful in southeastern British Columbia less than 2 miles from the Idaho border, face 12 months of probation. The first Fundamentalist Mormons went into hiding after the Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints renounced polygamy in September 1890 and eventually established the settlement of Short Creek on the Utah-Arizona border.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the early 2000s, the cities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, were thrust into the public spotlight when Warren Jeffs, FLDS president and prophet, began facing sex and sexual-assault charges in connection with his plural marriages to young girls and his arrangement of marriages of underage girls to older men in his church.
            </p>
            <p>
             The FLDS church also has small settlements near Crawford, Colo.; near Las Vegas; near Mancos, Colo.; near Pioche, Nev.; and near Pringle, S.D., the Deseret (Utah) News reported in 2008."

             "Hildale, once was solely the domain of the Fundamentalist Mormon church, now by many counts has become majority "apostate," the FLDS term for a former church member, and outsider....Jeffs is serving a life sentence for sexual assault stemming from his illegal marriages to underage girls. His home here has been turned into a community resource center.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last year, Hildale elected its first non-FLDS mayor, Donia Jessop. And the city recently announced plans for its police department, long controlled by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, to hire an outside chief.

             "It’s no surprise then that in the early 1800’s, upstate New York was a flourishing hub of creepy sex cults. Beyond the Mormons, the most notable among them were the Shakers and the Oneida Community. While they were originally founded in England, like other Christian heretics, the Shakers found their true home on the other side of the Atlantic. They were a feminist, antinatalist doomsday cult who built and sold furniture to assuage the pain of being permavirgins (not a joke). The Oneida Community, a wholly American creation, was a communist outfit that revolved around wife-swapping and Tantric sex. With these jokers as your neighbors, a guy claiming that Jesus Christ visited North America and that God has ordered him to take multiple wives would barely register on your Weird-o-Meter."

             "FLDS leader Warren Jeffs was one of the FBI’s Top Ten Wanted Fugitives until his arrest in 2006 for child molestation, incest, and marrying off underage girls to adult men.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many polygamist Mormons also fled to Mexico, among them the Romney clan. Calling Mitt Romney a “Mormon” is like calling Stalin a “bad guy”: it’s technically true but is a massive understatement of the facts. The Romneys are one of the founding families of Mormonism, beginning with Miles Romney, who emigrated from England to Illinois in 1841 after being commissioned by Joseph Smith to construct the Nauvoo Temple. Mitt Romney’s father George, who served as governor of Michigan and ran for president in 1968, was born in a polygamist Mormon colony in Mexico. Romneys have held prominent positions in the LDS Church throughout its history. It’s a surprise that none of this was brought up by the media four years ago."

             I think Jack Parsons is mentioned in Dave McGowan's book about Laurel Canyon as being present when a lot of the many many deaths occured there. "He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's Darker Than You Think, a novelette published in the fantasy magazine Unknown in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery Rocket to the Morgue "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer)

            The Eastern Europe sex slavery business has always been dominated by Jews.  But as this Jewish source admits, Western Europe too:

            <p>
             Jewish sex traffickers were prominent in major transit points from Europe to Latin America such as Berlin, London and Hamburg. In the latter, for example, of four hundred and two sex traffickers caught by police in 1912, two hundred and seventy-one were Jewish (Bristow 52–53).

             <strong>
              Although the facts speak for themselves
             </strong>
             , there was also a tendency to exaggerate the percentage of Jewish sex traffickers and Jewish prostitutes because it was easier to condemn an entire group, especially if they were Jews. At a time when antisemitism was increasing throughout the world, reports of the involvement of so many Jews in such shady dealings caused a great deal of damage to the image of Jews and were used by antisemites.

             DO NOT Go To This Church! They Are Aligning And Support Mormonism!!!
Review of Dream City Church
Reviewed January 25, 2018 
Dream City Church, which now owns Joy Christian School, had a meeting on 1.23.18 with very upset and concerned parents, teachers and students regarding a scandalious situation at Joy Christian School. Dream City Church/Joy Christian school WILL NOT support their Christian "Statement of Faith". In fact, they approved and are defending the hiring of a staff member that is a practicing and active Mormon. In fact, this Mormon JCS staff member also hosts 2 international JCS students, which are being taken to Mormon Church services. In addition, it appears that Dream City Church and Joy Christian School are aligning with a charter school that is finically backed by Mormons. This situation is one of many scandalous matters at Joy Christian School/Dream City Church. Lastly, during the meeting on 1.23.18, Tommy Barnett stated: 1) It is a privilege that your children attend this private school... 2) You (Parents, Teacher and Students) will submit to Joy Christian School and Dream City Church. 3) If Joy Christian School closes, it will be due to the Parents, teachers and Students NOT the wrongdoing of school and/or Dream City Church. Shame on the Barnett's (founder), Dream City Church and Joy Christian School!!!

             No doubt Nomo. I see Schniederisnext showed back up finally to clarify matters and it kinda settle it and quoted your thread. leading readers right back here. I think it was a good thing to sjake a little of that confusion out of that Church blind there was so much speculation in the comments I was spinning.

             "The Church" has to be this Dream City Church, and correct me if I am wrong we DID cover this logo here at one time didn't we? I swear I've seen it here sometime before, but this is all I need to convince myself this entire operation needs some deep eyes.
            </p>

             -first off, for me, this corroborates not only the
             <strong>
              Geffen

             link but this logo and the lighting inside the church reminds me of
             <strong>
              Gary Goddard of Disney's work
             </strong>
             , and of course the

              <em>
               title of the Church
              </em>

             is
             <strong>
              reminiscent of Spielberg's Dreamworks

              This article however does not indicate that Goddard or anyone of that status helped install this church's special effects. It does however illustrate how much attention they paid to the detail in the sound for "special effects".

              Two towns on the Utah-Arizona border run by a polygamist sect on Monday were found guilty of violating the rights of non-believing residents by denying them basic services, such as police protection and access to utilities like water.
             </p>
             <p>
              The verdict marks the end of a tumultuous seven-week trial and one of the government’s boldest efforts to take on the secretive regime comprising Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah.
             </p>
             <p>
              The towns, which make up the 10,000-member commune known as Short Creek, have been accused of public corruption in service to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government alleged town leaders discriminated against nonbelievers by denying them access to public water utilities and intentionally delaying police response times to their emergencies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Witnesses also testified that newcomers were monitored with surveillance cameras and from lookouts, with their movements relayed along more than 30 radios spread throughout the compound.

             Since he didn't say "secret", might just be referring to SLC. The church office building downtown is known as the LDS headquarters .

             That's kinda out in the middle of nowhere (Colorado City).  Most of Colorado's population is on the East face of the Rockies (Colorado Springs and Denver). It's a 10-11 hour drive from either.
            </p>
            <p>
             We do, however, have an "Old Colorado City" (an actual incorporated township) in the Springs. That area, as well as Manitou Springs, has been known for counter culture, drugs and prostitution for decades. If they are indeed separate, is it possible it's Old Colorado City?
