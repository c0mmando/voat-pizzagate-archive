            'Perhaps in the otherwise circumspect Ivy League-Seven Sisters world, nude posture photos were the licensed exception to propriety that spawned licentious fantasies. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'Lanier confirmed that the Ivy League "posture photos" Sheldon used were "part of a facade or cover-up for what we were really doing" -- which would make the schools less complicit. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'It was here that my quest for another kind of tribal illustration -- the taboo images of the blue-blood tribe, the long-lost nude posture photos -- culminated at last. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'I maintain that at the present date, Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, serve the same cultural functions as the posture photos."'
           </p>
           <p>
            'I was struck by one passage in particular:"From the outset, the purpose of these 'posture photographs' was eugenic. '
