            I saw all that flashing stuff too the real fast stuff. I saw little toddlers and other shapes definitely goat heads but after that when it settled to normal speed, I noticed while clicking open the hearts for sale, that when you pull up one of the various hearts they are different. Some don't have an animal head inside as well  detailed, but a simpler design.

            I'm concerned that you are reading way too much into this website. Review the description of the product at
            <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/102904/map-your-progress">
             https://www.bustle.com/articles/102904/map-your-progress
            </a>
            and you will see that it is simply a coloring chart by which to map your progress of a chosen goal, i.e., how many pounds I've lost, how many dollars of debt I've paid off. The charts come in several designs including a heart design; the swirls are just swirls. You can color in the swirls any way you like to make a design of your goals. Nothing sinister about the product. However, what if a pedophile put the heart chart to good use by filling in a swirl for each sexual conquest! Maybe thats what a MAP represents. Did Podesta have a conquest while on vacation and left his conquest chart behind - a cloth chart with a pizza design on it?
P.S. I don't see any goat.

             My practice is looking at what I see. I looked at this site bearing in mind the other meaning to "map". But only came across it accidentally searching Google for the pedophile website heartprogress .com and I put a space between heart and progress where there shouldn't have been one. Im not reading into this site. This site was shown to me by the computer itself, because it knows my searches. I geuss.  The map ypur progress .com site flashes a lot of imagery before settling on a page as I said. That could be filmed and forensically studied. If I had that resource I would.  Only because I like to know what is being flashed. When looking at something and the thing is going a step or two out of pace, I notice. Many people have called me gifted at art, i beleive we all have the ability to see more than we allow. The pace of the flashing of the imagery was off a step and just a bit faster than the eye can see. The site is selling the spiral themed adult coloring (what I do) pages on canvas etc.. a black and white image to color of spirals that form an overall shape to map out your goal or your progress hence the "map your progress" the goat is clear and visible.
