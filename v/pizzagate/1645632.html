            This is picture of John Podesta from a distance, walking. He's actually with Tim Cook and in the woods and seems unnerved by the photographer. You can't say it's him in both pictures, but you really can't say that it's not either. I don't have an imgur account so I have only the link:

            Is there another reference to 'Skippy' besides the wikileaks email about the NYC-DC bus trip? I read the whole thing twice, and it sounds like the NPR writer is making a joke, in context with the whole story...? However, I do think it's very likely that anyone practicing actual satanism or trauma-based mind control has alter personas and creates the same in their victims.

            You're looking at it from a complete different view than I am. It's my assumption that the cameraman is outside of a shower with sliding glass doors and the child is inside of the shower. There is some sort of colored flashlight or strobe light in there with the child. The man standing outside appears to have a dust mop of sorts and sometimes mops the glass with it to agitate the child. The stuff you're seeing in my eyes are the distorted view of the child inside of the shower glass which distorts the view because the glass is similar to stained glass in that it's textured similar to how meted ice can look. Or that's how I have percieved it..

             I see it from the same angle as you do. One thing I'm researching right now is the exact towel bar that is in the video. Towel bars are on the outside of the glass door I believe so you don't use them to support a fall while in the shower, causing the entire door to shatter, and of course the towels don't dry well in a moist environment. With that being said, the towel bar in the video is absolutely on the cameraman side of the door.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think this walking shower is a bit bigger than we may be used to. By my estimate, there looks to be a good 5 or 6 feet from the light source, to the shower glass.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thing to note is that the shower door itself (on the left side of the video) is a split door where the top half and bottom half both swing. It's kind of like those weird front doors on people's houses where you can open the top half to let a breeze in while keeping the kids and dogs locked in with the bottom half.
            </p>
            <p>
             At moments in the video, the man's face and head appear, unobstructed by the glass completely. If someone could enhance and brighten these images, this may provide some clues as to the general shape of the head, face, hair/no hair, etc...
            </p>
            <p>
             The child is most likely curled up on the ground on the right hand side of the video. The man repeatedly bends down and probably forcefully grabs the child, then backs away, probably beating the child as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was my interpretation.

              I think I may have identified the source of light being used. The last setting of this light displayed in this video appears to be being held by the person on the other side of the glass.
             </p>
             <p>
              So you think that there are 3 people? The cameraman, a man on the other side of the glass, and the child? What part in the video do you see his face? I haven't noticed this.

             Yeah, I see it as the opposite, where the person with the camera is inside the shower, recording what is happening outside the shower.

              Do you think there are then three people, a cameraman, who mops the shower door, a child and the yelling man? For which the child and yelling man are outside? And the cameraman is inside?

            Wow, good catches. I did a cursory look myself trying to do some more research following my
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1638965">
             earlier
            </a>
            submission, but didn't see as much detail as you caught.
           </p>
           <p>
            Might as well add some new thinking while I am here. I will forward this string of logic by saying that this is
            <em>
             investigative speculation
            </em>
            meant to provoke further investigation if warranted:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Podesta grew up in NW Chicago in the 1950s and was raised Catholic.
            </li>
            <li>
             Many boys were abused by Catholic priests and many priests are (were) Boston Irish.
            </li>
            <li>
             Many, if not most, adult abusers, were abused themselves as children.
            </li>
            <li>
             I think you see where I am going here - it's possible, if this turns out to be Podesta, that Podesta could be mimicking the voice he heard and trying to produce the feelings he himself felt when he was abused as a child.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Again, investigative speculation at this point. But the way you investigate is to come up with plausible theories that help add context to the crimes that you witness (since you are at a disadvantage when starting at the end and are forced to work backwards).

             I would like to add to your speculation with these two thoughts that had crossed my mind before:
            </p>
            <p>
             Podesta's parents were both from Chicago, the working class children of immigrants, his mother's line was Greek, his father's was Italian.  It is unknown if his grandparents spent time elsewhere upon arrival to the US than Chicago, but one has to assume they most likely came through New York.
            </p>
            <p>
             Podesta graduated from Georgetown in DC in 1976, so he moved from his home state before that.  From then on he has been in DC, so about 40 years there.   Accents can modify over time in different locales.  "The brothers, who grew up on Chicago’s northwest side, have spent most of their adult lives in D.C."

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Re: the Boston/Chicago discussion on JP's voice:  In the above article Tony Podesta also mentions Boston a couple of times, as if being a Boston politician and one from Chicago are sort of parallel but competitive.  It may be that the immigrant tenement kids aspired to act and sound like like the well-bred blue blood politicos of Boston when they descended on DC, and they may have somewhat affected that type of accent until it was second nature to them, in line with their upwardly mobile aspirations.  Just a thought.
            </p>
            <p>
             Same article BTW, as said to Tony P - "Politico’s  Glenn Thrush says that your brother can have a “short fuse;” that he has “
             <strong>
              a sulfuric evil twin [named Skippy] so fearsome that even the brash Rahm Emanuel scrambled for cover

             It was a good voice analysis. It's getting people identifying voice samples and putting them side by side.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not discounting MKU, but I'd also propose that during an abuse episode the adrenaline gets pretty high. Couple that with mocking and derision needed to break a child could probably lead to unusual voice pitches and tones.

            Hard to say about the drugging obviously. But having grown up under rather sadistic circumstances, I know from experience that these types of screams can be elicited without drugs.

             I did not clearly see a child in any of the frames. The child's voice sounds to be probably 7 years old. If you move slowly through the video, the body structure and movement of the figure did not appear to be a child.

               I guess if the camera person was outside the shower, this would indeed be a child. If inside the shower, the perspective would be different. I might need to look at this more closely.

            Let's discuss what is happening in the video, he's making the child day that he is the child's father now. It seems to imply the kid is now owned by this person, that the kid was abducted or sold. It seems like they just got the kid and are breaking (him?) Into the new reality. Is there information as to when this video was made? The kid is still owned or used up and dead. Was there beating? I only listened  once, was hard to listen too, don't want it stuck in my brain, might listen again, but don't want to. I didn't here beating sounds, but the kid sounded in pain, going to guess he was being painfully analy raped. I'm not convinced on the voice, it's close, but not certain. There seems to be an alter ego thing going on, podestas has one. Podestas like torture, that's in the emails, Tony spent the whole night in his torture chamber into the next day, implied John was there the night before and probably others.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Tony may have a projection room set up so that torture can be viewed live feed onto three walls, so that the torture is happening off site with cameras set up for it. As opposed to live torture in his home, but maybe both. He hints at this in the article where he talks about adding the basement for viewing complex video art installations

             Your summary is accurate and reflects the evil being perpetrated on the child....if this is Podesta, then why the fck is he still free when Breitbart called this depraved POS years ago.

             Can anyone post a link to these videos? I can't seem to find  them anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
             I didn't hear beatings in this or the other video floating around. I don't know even if they are from the same event, the video from the second piece is too poor format for me to examine. The Fatherhood video seems to have only one kid. It sounds like there are at least two kids in the second video. At one point there is both a crying and a speaking child. The conversation sounds like there might be more than two kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             My interpretaton is that the first video is an early breaking, coinciding with a change in the relation of the man to the child. A Sandusky-like adoption or a domination with the expectation of repeat offense. It doesn't take a lot to terrify kids and get them compliant.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second video sounds to me like there is coercion being applied against one child and encouraging other children to participate in binding? restraining? disciplining? the crying child. Yeah, abusers use other kids to keep them all compliant.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the first video, the continual brushing of the shower door and changing of position of the camera tells me it was a live video by another person, not a stationary camera.

            This is a pretty futile exercise.   Given the low quality of this video, the darkness, the video compression, there's not even enough information to enhance.  It's basically a Rorschach test.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps my work monitor is too dark, but I literally seen none of what you are describing if if I copy the image and try to enhance it.

             I spent about 3 hours working through the video at varying speeds to identify the sequence of images in context and their frame positions, extracting and enhancing the frame images. Original and enhanced images were posted. You have everything you need to replicate this, I see no need to repeat my own work. I'll stand by my conclusions.

             When you hit the link in the text, the big black box opens up. Underneatht he big black box is another hyperlink that says "open". See if that works for you.

            The last picture of the prone hand with curled fingers is suspicious for Podesta.  He has Dupetryns.  Nice analysis.  If we had an honest justice system they would investigate this.

             Thanks. Out of the 5 hand images there isn't one that could be considered "normal hand" but that might not be too unusual, given how fluid our hands movements can be at any moment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The oddest frames to me included the frame at 28s and the third image at 40s. At 28s the fingers are partially obscured by the video timer, but the fingers are askew at different angles, which is surprisingly like JPs fingers. The last frame at 40s shows another 'not normal" finger positioning that looks almost arthritic.

             Not trying to be a smartass, but it is spelled Dupuytren's contracture for those who want to look it up.  It is usually associated with older people and often alcoholics.

               There's a documentary series from the BBC called Blood of the Viking; they talk about Dupuytren's contracture. It's found in people with ancestry north of the equator, and very little incidence in populations around the equator.

               I'm not saying alcoholism is a requirement or anything or that Podesta doesn't have it.  I'm fairly young and have the even rarer foot equivalent Ledderhose disease and also have Dupuytren's run in my family.  I just wanted to put the correct spelling out there in case someone wanted to look into the connection.

                Sorry for you. That's got to suck! I found a nodule in my palm and obsessed about Dupuytren's for a long time. Gladly, whatever it was receded.
