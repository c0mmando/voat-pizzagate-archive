<p>This place screams thrift shop to me.
A few things that caught my attention. The blackcube on their website address bar, the checkered floor thats seems in bad shape throughout the gallery and these photo\'s that I gathered from different social media accounts. They also throw all age concerts like CPP.

<p>NS was founded in 2004 by Dr. Beatrice Wamey, a US citizen of Cameroonian origin.</p>
<p>Dr. Wamey, founder and current president of NSI ran the organization from her home in Fairfax Station, VA, from November 2004 till April 2008 when the organization moved to its current location at 85 S, Bragg St. in Alexandria. Haunted by the images of malnourished children, street children rumaging for food in the dumpsters in Yaoundé, Beatrice signed up for classes at the Northern Virginia.
Ironically, the office is located in this building looks like a black cube.

<p>Their goal:</p>
<p>Our Mission
NASCENT SOLUTIONS IS DEDICATED TO STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY OF THE VULNERABLE IN RURAL AFRICA TO ACHIEVE SELF‐SUFFICIENCY.</p>
<p>The disabled persons, orphans, former child-soldiers, single mothers, widows, and many other vulnerable people, understand, more than anyone else, the challenges they face. Thus, we work closely with them to develop interventions geared towards translating their knowledge and resources into simple but durable solutions. We empower them to assume more responsibility for and leadership in ensuring their well-being and restoring their god given dignity</p>
<p>Well my first indication that something may not be what it seems. Starts with their link for human trafficking its broken and in this picture it looks as if 2 children are interviewing a victim. I suppose.

<p>From 2014 to 2015 their charitable earnings went from $64,417.00 - $1,910,861.00. The 2015 tax form is sketchy. <a href="http://www.nascents.org/reports-2/">http://www.nascents.org/reports-2/</a>
Beatrice paid herself $111,671. 
Employees $271,021.
Pensions $6,866. 
Other benefits $93,947.
Investment fee\'s 36,212.
Office expenses $22,671.
Occupancy $80,394.
Insurance $1758.
Shipping expenses $79,686.
Business expenses $5,101.
Business registration $976.
Bank fees $8432.
Held a Gala for donations $14,352. which only netted a $7,992 profit.</p>
<p>I am no tax expert, but after looking at this refund and crunching numbers it seems like less then $40,000 actually went towards charity which is less then half of what they have spent on shipping fees during 2015 and she is paying on a loan.</p>
<p>Africa and Haiti don\'t keep good records, and I suspect more is going on here.</p>
<p>Ambassador Michael Hoza the Ambassador </p>
<p>Michael S. Hoza is a career Foreign Service Officer of the United States of America with 29 years of service abroad.

            You have got to archive your links before you post, PLEASE !!

            This is fantastic work and it would be an unnecessary waste to lose it.

              They are probably all a "coincidence".  Just all happen to be near water ways, docks, shores, railroads, airports, sitting on top of tunnels.  Keep moving. Nothing to see.
