            Thank you. I will input. More people need to understand not just the dynamics involved but the repercussions that are life long; the psychological trauma. I am also DID (dissociative identity disorder.) Major depression, PTSD. as a result of abuse.

             I will . I will explain but I don't really want sympathy, I want to help others. Perhaps I will start another thread later about my experience. Pizzagate has been very triggering for me. I often fear I am projecting onto these pizzagate characters. But in my gut I really feel there is something horribly wrong here.
