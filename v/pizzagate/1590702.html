            Is it possible that the same people who ran the Obama Administration website are still running this?  The bias theory has the problem that if the current Administration was engaging in bias why wouldn't they hold down all of the anti-Trump petitions?  But, if the Obama (civil service) team was still running it with the Obama "rules" because Trump had yet to get people/policies in place to change things then what we are seeing make some sense.

            I still haven't heard anything back from my 1st submission (on 1/24/17) to
            <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">
             https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/
            </a>
            . So, I created another submission again this morning (1/27/17), basically stating that the same problem w/ their website is obstructing investigation into child sex trafficking &amp; each day its delayed, it puts more kids’ lives at risk.
           </p>
           <p>
            I saw
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/TheRedPi11">
             @TheRedPi11
            </a>
            's comment about calling them...so I just called 202-456-1414 &amp; pressed 0 (20+ times to override their loop). A girl answered &amp; I told her the issue. She asked if I had emailed We The People, I explained to her that I did, which took me to the WH submission. Then, she hung-up on me (little brat!)! So, I called back &amp; same girl picked up, then saw my phone # &amp; hung-up again. I waited 5 minutes &amp; called back (w/ my # blocked). When she picked up I said please don't hang up!
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, she was NOT incredibly helpful...she kept saying she had no way to contact anyone who could look into website. I told her that their webmaster could have this resolved in less than a day. She said the only contact info she had is this email:
            <strong>
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b7c0d2c3dfd2c7d2d8c7dbd2f7c0dfdec3d2dfd8c2c4d299d0d8c1" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
              [email protected]
             </a>
            </strong>
            . EVERYONE PLEASE FLOOD THEM WITH EMAILS REGARDING THIS ISSUE!
           </p>
           <p>
            I kept pushing her to talk &amp; she inadvertently stated that she didn't know when something would be done w/ website as current administration hasn't decided how they are going to proceed with it (I assume she meant We The People &amp;
            <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">
             https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/
            </a>
            site).
I told her it seems incredibly suspect that certain petitions are clearly being suppressed/censored (like petition vs Soros &amp; ours on investigating child trafficking &amp; sexual abuse). It’s very shady...they clearly don't want this petition to get 150 signatures necessary to  appear on list. While other petitions, like one to reveal Trump's taxes is almost &gt; 300K OVER minimum (100K) required.
Anyway, here’s the email address again:
            <strong>
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="592e3c2d313c293c3629353c192e31302d3c31362c2a3c773e362f" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">

            Or for a competing hypothesis, maybe the WH is trying to keep the signatures low to keep a lid on this until they can wrest control of the requisite agencies (CIA, NSA, DoJ, State), identify friend or foe, and then execute.

            I used your link and signed the petition but when I did a search for it on the White House website I couldn't find it anywhere it's not listed with the other petitions. People are not going to see it unless they get there by your link. Please tell me they're not suppressing this. I will go back and see if the count went up it was at 75 when I signed.

            You see, I've said this before and I'm totally certain it's true. There is no chance of these atrocities being investigated let alone prosecuted because if this nightmare is happening (and I do believe it is) and it reaches all the way to the top as far as leaders go (President, Sec. of State, Vice President etc, Foreign Govts.  Big corporate CEO's, Law enforcement, Banking institutions, Hollywood etc.) They are the slave masters. They are in charge of the world. How are you really going to get a legitimate investigation going? The people involved in this have the ultimate power, they're not going to let this get out. The world would literally crumble.
The only thing I can think of is to set a date for a HUGE protest march right up to the White House and if that doesn't get things going then protest march  to the White House again... and again... and again, and get other Countries to protest march against their leaders on the same day(s). If enough people leave their jobs (take a vacation day(s) or whatever, then the world will get so chaotic that things will eventually get done. Other than doing that I think there is Zero chance of anything being done to prosecute these monsters.

             I would guess the whitehouse.gov website was inherited.  Its internal design to selectively quell or promote petitions was not put in place by the current administration.  It is likely the current administration does not know that process exists.....if that be the case, then do what can be done to make them aware and hope they act in good faith once its acknowledged....perhaps even investigation who or what put such a pretentious and deceptive backdoor into the petition part of the website.

               I'm not sure if Trump is a ringer or not.   He's done some good things lately but then he talks about torture being ok.   I wonder if he plays to the base a bit with those comments because he appointed anti torture people everywhere.   I don't know what to think right now but I am trying to do my best to protect me and my own.

             Trump kicked Epstein out of some high profile party for hitting on a underage girl, I think you may misunderstand. The man has never had a drink in his life he isn't like other people.

                Well being on forbes list made him famous, this makes him infamous. I'm not sure this is the sort of fame he was looking for. But then again these people seem to thrive off of it, so maybe..

             Btw, you do nothing in most but rip on pizzagate investigators. You call everyone loons in many posts. Who are you exactly and what research have you done other than try to break down everyone's possible leads. I'm not saying this post is solid at all. But you're suggestions are far from anything helpful.

              Dude , you're taking to the lead star in the show, he has admitted it in the past, so he isn't even really a shill it's the man himself. He comes here to investigate us, and attempt to defend himself. But yeah that's why, because this is the one person that would know the truth and if it's bad would not want the truth getting out... just saying, this is JA, that you're asking why he defends this shit....

                Right. I'm sure that's why he chose that name. He has actually admitted on here or somewhere that he doesn't like children that he is gay and that he thinks being a top is gross so he sticks to bottom. It must be really hard for him to see this stuff and know which are true and which aren't and not speak out on the stuff that's untrue, but that would expose more than he wants I am sure. He definitely didn't like the focus on Pegasus, as well as at one point he said something like "if something happens to my mom... threats followed" but I think that was to Ryan.. I feel like he is feeling the pressure. I know we're on to something here, but probably a lot of it is specualtion as well. I just wish he could show us that Caris is okay, if he were to do that it would influence my opinion a lot that maybe we're barking up the wrong tree. But unfortunately it doesn't appear to be the case. I want to have faith that this is all a misunderstanding, even with JA, we know pizzagate is real, we can prove that, but maybe JA isn't as bad?? I doubt it, I get the idea that even if James isn't involved in the kid sex stuff, he still has hobbies that may include murder and torture. Not that that isn't bad. But doing it to kids is horrible. So why not just give us a recent picture of caris so we can stop worrying. #carisjames

                 All solid thoughts and sound thinking. Yeah I was just speculating on the name. Thanks for the info. Never saw any of those posts. I for one think everything about JA is absolutely disgusting right down to his lifestyle choice, weather he prefers top or bottom is irrelevant.

              Pretty certain he's affiliated with them some how. He's been here for months now, knows what this is all about like the rest of us but insists on trying to muddy the waters with his shit whenever he can. One things for sure they are all taking it rather jovially and don't seem all that concerned at least outwardly. Quite the opposite. And I mean all of them, which scares me the most.

            The only point of the white house petitions are to keep up the illusion that the citizenry has any pull at all with our "representative" government.  We don't.  It's all a ridiculous Charade.  The CEO of JP Morgan sent Obama his entire cabinet BEFORE he was even elected.  You, me, and 8 million people hitting vote on a site don't mean shit.

             This...I've always known that whatever you do is only an illusion of being able to change the system. This petition is just giving me the first actual glimpse of it happening and having the proof to back it up.

             You're probably right.  Shit posting here will probably get your point across better.  Unfortunately if no one signs it then you can't really say they ignored you.

            The democrats obviously would never have done anything. I support the petition, but Trump and Sessons and Gowdy at least already know about pizzagate. If they're going to do anything about it, we'll see. If they aren't, the petition won't change that. Should I sign the petition or should I wait until it's working?

            Of course they are intentionally suppressing this petition.. they are intentionally suppressing pizzagate on the net. We already know that.
intentional suppression is their game. They have been playing it for over a hundred years and more.. alternate energy, free energy devices, and all kinds of stuff is suppressed to keep control in place. 
What are the chances that the only petition on whitehouse site that has issues just happens to be the pizzagate one?
There is no chance. It has to be deliberate.

            Anyone putting hope in DT to press this issue is a fucking moron.  He is likely part of it.  His Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he fully and completely supports DynCorp.

            If we all call and there are more that 150 of us that call then there will be no doubt.  I know that the view count on voat is an underestimate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: I called.  They said call back at 9:00am.  I will.  Anyone else want to call them at 9:00 EST on the dot?

               There are probably criteria you have to meet to be a signatory, such as be a US citizen or currently living in the US or something, and a way of flagging and deleting those signatures that are not legitimate, so someone's probably just flagging tons of them as fake or as all coming from the same IP or something and removing them that way. That's just a guess.
