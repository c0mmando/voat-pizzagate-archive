            The custody trial did not litigate the fact of whether or not he abused Dylan.  It simply wasn't the issue before the court.  And since that was the case it made the custody issue a lot easier.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In short, Allen was already in therapy for acting inappropriately towards Dylan.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is not actually the case (This is because you need find the actual testimony that occurred to get the full flavor of this case.)  This therapist was a psychologist who specialized in children and her primary patient was Satchel (now Ronan) Farrow
            <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/farrow-doctor.html">
             , but she was familiar with family dynamic
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The psychologist, Dr. Susan Coates, also testified that while she considered Mr. Allen's relationship with his own adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, to be "inappropriately intense," the therapist never observed him acting in a sexual way toward her. And she reported that an evaluation of Dylan conducted in 1990 found the girl easily "would be taken over by fantasy" when asked to describe something as simple as an apple tree.
            </p>
            <p>
             The testimony of Dr. Coates -- who regularly treated the couple's biological son, Satchel, from 1990 to 1992, and often conversed or met with both parents -- appeared to provide an alternative explanation for Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan other than the one advanced by Ms. Farrow. The actress's accusation that Mr. Allen had molested Dylan at her country house last Aug. 4 is a central issue in the custody trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Here's the full quote of what she said.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Coates will testify, “I did not see it as sexual, but I saw it as inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else, and it placed a demand on a child for a kind of acknowledgment that I felt should not be placed on a child.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            This link is a very good timeline of the facts in this case.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The therapist who was apparently more on Allen's side ............. Obviously she'd be motivated not to see that, given who he was and that at that time there weren't accusations of actual abuse against him.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            There's no basis to say this therapist was on Allen's side as opposed to be on the side of the truth.  She knew Dylan quite well and had examined her previously.  What would she not be on Dylan's side?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Farrow side basically dismissed any professional testimony that was against their case as biased towards Woody Allen.  They never did explain why the doctors would not be biased towards the child in a case of actual abuse or biased towards the truth. They only became biased after they gave their opinion.  Dr Coates was first doctor called Mia Farrow called about this accusation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no idea how you could speak to the doctor's motivations, let alone her obvious motivations.  There's no reason to expect her to be biased.   And you are wrong, as to when she made these comments.  This was testimony under oath at the custody trial.  This was months of after the original accusation of abuse that Dr. Coates was the first medical professional to hear about.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is still to this day, only a single accusation.  And none of the doctors or psychologists involved in this accusation would say that any abuse occurred which is why both NY and CT concluded no abuse occurred.

              A fact that the Yale team mentions on page 1 of their report?   Do you think this is damning?
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not sure if you think this refutes something I said, but the fact that Dr. Leventhal did not interview her, does not undermine the conclusions of the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital.  Dlyan was only interviewed by female members of the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital.  Leventhal  did participate in meeting with the police and both parents.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can see why they would make that decision, a young girl possibly molested by a man, may not want to discuss that incident with a man.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Leventhal wrote up the final report because he was the head of the clinic, but it was based on the interviews done by the female members of his team.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital are the ones who had by far, the most experience and expertise with dealing with the victims of sexual abuse in the whole case.  It's the why the CT State Police used them, they recognized their expertise was far beyond their own.

             <p>
              Dr. Stephen Herman, a clinical psychiatrist who has extensive familiarity with child abuse cases, was called as a witness by Ms. Farrow to comment on the Yale‐New Haven report. I share his reservations about the reliability of the report.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Herman faulted the Yale‐New Haven team (1) for making visitation recommendations without seeing the parent interact with the child; (2) for failing to support adequately their conclusion that Dylan has a thought disorder; (3) for drawing any conclusions about Satchel, whom they never saw; (4) for finding that there was no abuse when the supporting data was inconclusive; and (5) for
recommending that Ms. Farrow enter into therapy. In addition, I do not think that it was appropriate for Yale‐New Haven, without notice to the parties or their counsel, to exceed its mandate and make observations and recommendations which might have an impact on existing litigation in another jurisdiction.

            <p>
             From the judge's ruling in the case:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Both Dr. Coates and Dr. Schultz expressed their opinions that Mr. Allen did not sexually abuse Dylan. Neither Dr. Coates nor Dr. Schultz has expertise in the field of child sexual abuse. I believe that the opinions of Dr. Coates and Dr. Schultz may have been colored by their loyalty to Mr. Allen. I also believe that therapists would have a natural reluctance to accept the possibility that an act of sexual abuse occurred on their watch. I have considered their opinions, but do not find their testimony to be persuasive with respect to sexual abuse or visitation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have also considered the report of the Yale‐New Haven team and the deposition testimony of Dr. John M. Leventhal. The Yale‐New Haven investigation was conducted over a six‐month period by Dr. Leventhal, a pediatrician; Dr. Julia Hamilton, who has a Ph.D. in social work; and Ms. Jennifer Sawyer,
who has a master's degree in social work. Responsibility for different aspects of the investigation was divided among the team. The notes of the team members were destroyed prior to the issuance of the report, which, presumably, is an amalgamation of their independent impressions and observations. The unavailability of the notes, together with their unwillingness to testify at this trial except through the deposition of Dr. Leventhal, compromised my ability to scrutinize their findings and resulted in a report which was sanitized and, therefore, less credible.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And interestingly, Dr. Leventhal himself never met with Dylan. I believe the Connecticut Magazine article goes into how the Yale-New Haven study was flawed.
            </p>
            <p>
             But despite all this, including the judge's serious concerns about the study, Woody Allen had no problem touting it as vindicating him, the same way he and his defenders have no trouble claiming he passed a polygraph, without mentioning that he refused to take one from the police and instead "passed" the one that he took privately and paid for.
            </p>
            <p>
             And this (and there's still much more to read in that opinion):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Mr. Allen's deficiencies as a custodial parent are magnified by his affair with Soon‐Yi. As Ms. Farrow's companion, he was a frequent visitor at Soon‐Yi's home. He accompanied the Farrow‐Previns on extended family vacations and he is the father of Soon‐Yi's siblings, Moses, Dylan and Satchel. The fact that Mr. Allen ignored Soon‐ Yi for ten years cannot change the nature of the family constellation and does not create a distance sufficient to convert their affair into a benign relationship between two consenting adults.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mr. Allen admits that he never considered the consequences of his behavior with Soon‐Yi. Dr. Coates and Dr. Brodzinsky testified that Mr. Allen still fails to understand that what he did was wrong. Having isolated Soon‐Yi from her family, he left her with no visible support system. He had no consideration for the consequences to her, to Ms. Farrow, to the Previn children for whom he cared little, or to his own children for whom he professes love.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I knew a lot about this case and Woody Allen, but have learned still more recently, and all I've learned demonstrates to me that he's a liar without a conscience and concern for others. The judge wrote at length about how he's self-absorbed and seems to lack any true consideration for the well-being of other people, and gave many examples of how that's so. And about 25 years later, those same sorts of things were evident in this interview he gave:
            </p>

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh, and the judge's opinion addresses the major points of the pro-Allen testimony given by Dr. Coates which the old NY Times article is about.

              He didn't refuse to take one from the CT police he never was asked to take one from the CT police.  The polygraph expert he hired was Paul Minor who had been the head of the FBI polygraph division.
             </p>
             <p>
              The last half of your post address the point of custody which was the only issue in front of Judge Wilk. He was not asked to determine if abuse occurred in the case of Dylan Farrow.
No criminal charges were filed in that case, because no crime was judged to occurred.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am not arguing Woody Allen should have been granted custody.

               You're welcome and thank you. I've had to be busy with other things lately but that Netflix child pornography brought me back here today. And what's more, the liberal MSM have not been covering it, up until this morning at least. Only outlets like Fox, Daily Caller, Daily Mail, Western Journalism, etc.

             Yes, it is actually the case. Your response was an attempt to muddy the waters, but if there is possibly anyone here who both cares about truth, justice, and protecting all innocent parties, including children, and thinks that what you wrote might be just an impartial opinion, I encourage whoever that might be to actually read all they can for themselves on the facts of the case, including the judge's opinion and the other articles linked to here.

              This absolutely not the case.  And it's not how Dr. Coates testified.
             </p>
             <p>
              To be in therapy for acting inppropriately towards Dylan would mean
             </p>
             <p>
              A.  That Woody Allen was Dr Coates main patient.
B.  That this was the reason they sought out the doctor.
             </p>
             <p>
              Both of these are false.    Satchel/Ronan was her patient, but she also had some sessions with their parents and other family members.
             </p>
             <p>
              You claim I'm muddying the waters, but I'm actually laying out the facts.  The link I pointed to gives a much deeper picture as to what Dr. Coates testified to and includes this line:
              <em>
               "Dr. Coates, who had continued to see Mr. Allen as part of Satchel's therapy."
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              Satchel was the one "in therapy" with Dr. Coates and the reason he was in therapy was he wasn't bonding with Allen.  When she spoke with Allen it was mainly about his relation to Satchel.
             </p>
             <blockquote>

             <p>
              The judge in this case was not trying to determine if abuse occurred and he didn't need to.  This was simply a custody case.
He ends up saying we will never know what happened.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Yale Team believed no abuse occurred.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Coates believed no abuse occurred.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Schultz who was Dylan's therapist believed no abuse occurred.  She also believed Allen should not get custody.

              The morons that defend this Perverted Piece of Scum will rue the day they will have to admit how dumb they were.  Mark my words that he is doing the same thing to those girls he and Soon Yi adopted.  They adopted 2 girls.  Not two boys or 1 girl and 1 boy, but 2 girls.  He must be in Seventh Heaven.  He has groomed all his fans into believing that a man laying in bed with a little girl in his underwear while she sucks on his thumb is perfectly normal.  This is just So Sick and Demented. I feel so sorry for Dylan and her family.   I can't even understand how Mia must have felt when she looked at those pictures he took of Soon Yi.  I can't write about it or describe it for the description I read is too pornographic even.  I never want to read it again.  Once is enough.  I hate him with every fiber of my being.

             And then from one of I believe two of Woody Allen's losses on appeal.
            </p>

                We find the fact that Mr. Allen took them at a time when he was formally assuming a legal responsibility for two of Ms. Previn's siblings to be totally unacceptable. The distinction Mr. Allen makes between Ms. Farrow's other children and Dylan, Satchel and Moses is lost on this Court. The children themselves do not draw the same distinction that Mr. Allen does. This is sadly demonstrated by the profound effect his relationship with Ms. Previn has had on the entire family. Allen's testimony that the photographs of Ms. Previn "were taken, as I said before, between two consenting adults wanting to do this" demonstrates a chosen ignorance of his and Ms. Previn's relationships to Ms. Farrow, his three children and Ms. Previn's other siblings. His continuation of the relationship, viewed in the best possible light, shows a distinct absence of judgment. It demonstrates to this Court Mr. Allen's tendency to place inappropriate emphasis on his own wants and needs and to minimize and even ignore those of his children. At the very minimum, it demonstrates an absence of any parenting skills.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Allen's various inconsistent statements to Farrow of his intentions regarding Ms. Previn and his attempt to have Dr. Schultz explain the relationship to Dylan in such a manner as to exonerate himself from any wrong doing, make it difficult for this Court to find that his expressed concern for the welfare of the family is genuine.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                While the tendency of Dylan to withdraw into a fantasy and the inconsistencies in her account of the events of August 4, 1992, noted particularly by the Yale-New Haven team, must be taken into account in the evaluation of these serious allegations, the testimony given at trial by the individuals caring for the children that day, the videotape of Dylan made by Ms. Farrow the following day and the accounts of Dylan's behavior toward Mr. Allen both before and after the alleged instance of abuse, suggest that the abuse did occur.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Moreover, even if the abuse did not occur, it is evident that there are issues concerning Mr. Allen's inappropriately intense relationship with this child that can be resolved only in a therapeutic setting.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                While the court stated that it was not concerned for Satchel's physical safety, it was concerned by Mr. Allen's "demonstrated inability to understand the impact that his words and deeds have upon the emotional well being of the children". We agree. The record supports the conclusion that Mr. Allen may, if unsupervised, influence Satchel inappropriately, and disregard the impact exposure to Mr. Allen's relationship with Satchel's sister, Ms. Previn, would have on the child. His failure to understand the effect of such exposure upon Satchel as well as upon his other children is evidenced by his statement on direct examination in which he stated: "If you ask me personally, I would say the children, the children adore Soon Yi, they adore me, they would be delighted, if you asked me this personally, I would say they would be delighted and have fun with us, being taken places with us. But, I don't want to give you my amateur opinion on that. That's how I feel. And I know it counts for very little."

              The pictures that he took of Soon Yi must have frightened the Hell out of Mia.  I cannot even imagine a Mother of a child finding pictures like that of her child, and of all things, them being taken by the father (although the adopted father).  I have read only once what those pictures looked like and it is so disgusting it completely turned my stomach upside down.  It is making me sick to even write this right now.  He will never understand how it feels for he had an entirely different view of those children than Mia.  Children are playthings to him.  Sexual Playthings. He cannot look at them from her perspective.  How dare he say the children would be delighted to go on outings with him and Soon Yi?  He assumes they will be as happy as he is over the relationship?  They look at it as sick and he looks at it as beautiful.  Barf.

             And what the judge's opinion also touches on is that Satchel (Ronan) was in therapy first because they had concerns about his behavior. That's concerning on its own. He apparently as a small boy wanted nothing to do with Allen and often tried to kick him. Very unusual behavior for a very young boy towards his father -- or the man publicly identified as his father. From everything that even Mia and Ronan have said, it does seem more than likely that Frank Sinatra is his actual father.

              Is Ronan not gay?  That is what I have read.  I wonder if Woody recognized that already in Ronan (Satchel) when he was a child.  Pedos and Gays recognize certain signs that we may not see early on.  Also, some children are way more in tune than others, and Satchel could have already realized that Woody's interest in Soon Yi was something more than just normal.  Also, I wonder if Woody's interests could be more than just young girls.  This just occurred to me yesterday.  I wonder if he had made sexual attempts towards Satchel and Moses as well.  This is all so very Horrid.  My husband wants me to stop reading this stuff because it so greatly affects my life when I read it.  But I just can't stop.  It makes me sick, but also angry.  More angry than I can even explain.

             Yes, if he wasn't Woody Allen the case would have gone very differently. He's confirmed to have done things like this (from page 5 of the judge's ruling):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Her apprehension was fueled by the intensity of the attention Mr. Allen lavished on Dylan, and by his spending play‐time in bed with her, by his reading to her in his bed while dressed in his undershorts, and by his permitting her to suck on his thumb.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ms. Farrow testified that Mr. Allen was overly attentive and demanding of Dylan's time and attention. He was aggressively affectionate, providing her with little space of her own and with no respect for the integrity of her body. Ms. Farrow, Casey Pascal, Sophie Raven (Dylan's French tutor), and Dr. Coates testified that Mr. Allen focused on Dylan to the exclusion of her siblings, even when
Satchel and Moses were present.
             </p>
             <p>
              In June 1990, the parties became concerned with Satchel's behavior and took him to see Dr. Coates, with whom he then began treatment. At Dr. Coates' request, both parents participated in Satchel's treatment. In the fall of 1990, the parties asked Dr. Coates to evaluate Dylan to determine if she needed therapy. During the course of the evaluation, Ms. Farrow expressed her concern to Dr. Coates that Mr. Allen's behavior with Dylan was not appropriate. Dr. Coates observed:
             </p>
             <p>
              "I understood why she was worried, because it [Mr. Allen's relationship with Dylan] was intense, … I did not see it as sexual, but I saw it as inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else, and it placed a demand on a child for a kind of acknowledgment that I felt should not be placed on a child …"
             </p>
             <p>
              She testified that she worked with Mr. Allen to help him to understand that his behavior with Dylan was inappropriate had to be modified. Dr. Coates also recommended and that Dylan enter therapy with Dr. Schultz, with whom Dylan began treatment in April 1991.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             It's how to understand how that therapist didn't see Allen's attentions to Dylan as sexual, except, again, it was Wood Allen the director. Ronan Farrow wrote he had a virtual army doing his bidding to protect him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The judge also went into how the people who did the Yale investigation actually declined to testify but just submitted an affidavit saying there was no abuse.

             (haven't read it yet but supposedly Allen hired private investigators to try to dig up dirt on law enforcement personnel assigned to the case)

              We are witnessing a sea change in how we talk about sexual assault and abuse. But there is more work to do to build a culture where women like my sister are no longer treated as if they are invisible. It's time to ask some hard questions.

              The question is why can we prosecute Harvey Weinstein when we are immediately attacked for even bringing up Woody Allen.  I find this in reading articles and with people I know.  They don't even want to hear about it.  It is just so very frustrating.

              I don't understand why they continue to support a pedophile.

              It said at one point that Moses was receiving help.  Help for what and why?  Was he abused too?  Who knows.  If he has dependency issues that could be another problem.  I think the adopted children were chosen for a reason.  They seem to have social issues or some kind of psychological problems.  They are easy to manipulate.

              In the latimes Dylan talks about Weinstein's accusations and Woody's.  The problem is that Woody and friends are pedos.  They are protecting Woody for their own sake as well as his (due to his Box Off. Draws).  Hollywood has long been known to be filled with pedophiles.  They stick together.  If they started outing each other, how could they keep up their sexual abuse.  Yes, the difference is in the age of the accusers.

              Her apprehension was fueled by the intensity of the attention Mr. Allen lavished on Dylan, and by his spending play‐time in bed with her, by his reading to her in his bed while dressed in his undershorts, and by his permitting her to suck on his thumb.

              That is Barf Worthy.  It made me sick to my stomach.  He was grooming her.  Possibly he had not gone all the way with her yet, but he was getting her ready for it.  Sucking on his thumb was a turn on for him and a euphemism for, Guess What.    This pervert does not deserve to gasp another breath.
