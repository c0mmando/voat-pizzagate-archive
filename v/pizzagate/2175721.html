            In your post, you mention that the date the email was sent coincidentally lines up with the same date as a gap on Wikipedia (wow that means a lot), and was also a Thursday. I am just trying to understand what the relevance of this is to the 'supposed' event 'Chicago Hot Dog Friday'?
           </p>
           <p>
            This piece of information means little to nothing at all, and it is even mentioned on the Wikipedia page of a celebration on the Friday - 'May 15 â€“ The World Series Champion Philadelphia Phillies are honored at the White House by President Obama.'
           </p>

            - Here is the video of the day. Seems to be down on the White House archives. I would say this e-mail is probably as irrelevant as when it was originally discovered, and that your time and effort regarding this investigation would be better put to use following up on something that is of validity.

            Doesn't "Chicago Hot Dog Friday" email, refer to things happening on Friday at that office?   It's not describing the White House, it's describing what they are doing on Friday May 15th

             I just re-read the full emails again and realize what you mean about "at that office".  So to me it reads, whoever these people are were having some kind of event on that Friday, maybe a special company lunch.  Then they guy that replied said he "Thinks" obama flew in the 65k in dogs/pizza.  Could be completely innocent I guess.  Then then "Waitress" comment, some kind of inside joke?  Who knows.  I'm thinking this does not warrant the effort for further investigation.

              Let me give you inside of waitress.  Dnycorp and all other govt contractors aka CIA were over in Bosnia, etc.  They would tell these young girls come we will take you to US and you can have job as waitress, models, etc.  The parents would let them go and there were no jobs outside of human trafficking.  Of course they didn't know that until too late.  That is what "waitress" means. Stratfor is CIA front as well.

              I think people get hung up on the fact that both sets of emails are on wikileaks.

              Do you know the phrase "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail?"

             <p>
              I think since these databases are easy for someone to search at home, so they put a lot of stock in these searchable databases.

             Good points indeed.  Exactly why we need an official investigation.  But since we are not getting an official investigation, all we can do is speculate and look for facts and try to connect the dots.  Why is the archive of Obama's schedule not complete?  How can we find out?

              I disagree with this part.  We need an official investigation to figure what a guy said in a work email?

              My hunch on this, by the way, is that this is anti-obama gossip.
