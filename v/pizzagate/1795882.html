<p>We know that James Alefantis was a guest at the white house during the Obama years, and we know when also, because the guest list was public. </p>
<p>But that was before pizzagate.</p>
<p>Of course, the fronted reason is that it is suddenly in the interest of &quot;national security&quot; to keep the names of people who visit the white house secret:

<p>Some people think it is because Trump has his old friend, Felix Sater (interesting last name--sounds like satyr) of the Russian mob, over as well as other criminals:

<p>More on Sater:
&quot; The relationship between Donald Trump and Felix Sater, whose father is a reputed Russian Organized Crime boss, represented a rather direct link between the presidential candidate and Russian Organized Crime. The Russian émigré — a twice-convicted felon with ties to the Mafia — appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title “Senior Advisor to Donald Trump.” Trump confused when asked under oath in a 2013 about his relationship to the Russian émigré.</p>
<p>Sater served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, “I’ll kill you. I’ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.” Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault.</p>
<p>Bayrock Group LLC was a real estate development firm that partnered with Trump on numerous projects after renting office space from the Trump Organization. Sater is a top Bayrock executive in the Bayrock Group, which is headquartered in Trump Tower. The founding chairman of Bayrock is Tevfik Arif, who has reputed Russian organized crime ties. In 2010 he was charged in Turkey for smuggling <strong>underage girls</strong> into the country for prostitution. Another principal in the deal is Russian émigré Tamir Sapir, who also lives in Trump Tower. Sapir’s executive vice president and top aide, Fred Contini, pled guilty in 2004 to “participating in a racketeering conspiracy with the Gambino crime family for 13 years.” </p>
<p>Source:http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/russian-organized-crime.htm</p>
<p>Like Jared Kushner, Sater is involved with Chabad and was once their &quot;man of the year&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSpFtCmoD5o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSpFtCmoD5o</a></p>
<p>Tevfik Ariv is another interesting guy, who likes to pimp children: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/trump-pal-busted-allegedly-running-hooker-ring-yacht-article-1.191136">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/trump-pal-busted-allegedly-running-hooker-ring-yacht-article-1.191136</a></p>

            I don't trust Trump. Especially after he kill syrian soldiers who fighting were ISIS. You know how heavy a cost that is to syria??? Their poor women are having to pick arms and fight. I pray for Syria. I pray God make them victorious. The syrian citizens stand by their President. They love President Bashar Assad.

             "ISIS"  and the rest are joint CIA/Mossad creations as all who are awake have always known.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ask yourself, If "ISIS" is really "Islamic State", then why do they attack Muslim shrines, and poor Muslim civilians, and never ONE politician, or a certain stolen land which is supposed to be against all Muslims?

             Syria has the only secular govt in the entire Middle East. They also have a nationla bank that makes interest free loans and pays 11% interest on savings accounts, free medical care, subsidized non-GMO food, free education--even through medical school.

            What's HILARIOUS (well, not really) is that the same Trump fans who invent "reasons" to explain this -- out of whole cloth -- would be having a hissy hit -- and rightfully so -- if the Ocommie administration had made the same announcement.

            Maybe it's bc the #MSM makes mountains of mole hills, lies all day long, &amp; creates scandals where there are none. Meanwhile, they ignore important stuff like the House of Reps international spy ring scandal that likely resulted in the deaths of military personnel, why the DNC won't turn over private server to verify the Russian meddling they scream about 24/7 &amp; how Hillary cheated Bernie to win primary, but lost the general despite spending BILLIONS. RIP #MSM.

            A guest list is extremely misleading. They simply meet up with beazlebub somewhere else. They can hold up the visitor log as proof of nothing and then the media goes away happy.

             It's cute you think that even if the guest list was "public" you'd be getting the truth.  Bc the govt is all about transparency, right?  (That was rhetorical,  btw). Trump making his list private is probably the most transparency we've seen in 8 years bc at least it's HONEST.

             I would venture to guess that there are so many people under investigation that they may be masking the identities of the whistleblowers.  They already got Candace Claiborne for treason and she's the first of many.  We all know what happens to whistleblowers on the Democrats....they get suicided.
