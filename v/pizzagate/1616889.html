The Senator was diligently working on exposing CPS legal kidnapping and child trafficking along with revealing some unknowns in a documentary that was to be released just days after her untimely &quot;suicide&quot;. <br />

<p>Bill Bowen was also working very closely with Nancy on her project and Bill  produced a very short film called Innocence Destroyed which was about children who have died in CPS custody and the placement of children with abusers.

<p>Several months later Mr. Bowen also had an untimely death, as the story goes an unnamed source contacted Bill to give him information on the project he was working on.. Bowen went to the golf course to meet the unnamed source (Bowen wasn\'t an avid golfer) and also had an untimely death from a &quot;heart attack&quot; that day at the course. The documentary has never been released but William Fain who was the director claims to still have a copy. </p>
<p>Mr, Fain was fully supportive of Nancy during the production phase of the documentary that he was hired to produce. After Nancy and her husband were found shot to death Fain appeared on Alex Jones\' show and claimed it was a murder/suicide committed by Nancy\'s husband.

<p>Mr. Fain\'s FB page shows a recent request from a pizzagate supporter requesting that Mr. Fain release that production which was declined by Fain.

<p>Discovered on his FB page were several videos he\'s produced, one a story of a young prostitute and another called Demons &amp; Zombies which lists an actor playing the role of Satan.

<p>Which all leads to unanswered questions.
1-Who and or what was Senator Shaefer going to reveal in her documentary before the untimely &quot;murder/suicide&quot;?
2-Who was it who met Mr. Bowen at the golf course before he had an untimely &quot;heart attack&quot;?
3-Is CPS involved with human trafficking and providing children to pedophiles?<br />
4-Why is Mr. Fain not releasing the video if it could serve to save innocent children?  
</p>
<p>Here are a few of many available articles where children in foster care were placed with pedophiles. </p>

            If he wasn't the shill, and possible murderer, he would have released the film in her honor immediately. Or, her death scared the sh*t out of him, and he did whatever he was told afterward, including satanic stuff for pedos What if you have kids, and they threaten to torchuring, trafficking, gang raping them. It's more scary than threatening to kill them. At least Nancy and her husband got a quick kill, not the slow kind. Too strange that he owns the rights to the film. Bet it's destroyed. Who was the cameraman? They know everything. Editor?

             He said he isn't scared or threatened, here's an exchange he had on his FB  page with a pizzagate investigator in Dec.

            Holy shit. I listened to that interview with AJ and Fain was calming explaining that they had "money problems" and that Nancy's husband didn't want to tell her. Then he claimed that Nancy found out about it through a bill or something (can't remember) and that she must have confronted him and that's when he decided to kill her and himself. He was really pushing the narrative that there was "nothing to see here" and that he knew it bc he had worked so closely with them and knew the dynamic.
           </p>
           <p>
            His responses on FB are insane. A) No producer would spend that much time on a project like that if he didn't believe it . Nowhere in that interview with AJ did he say "Ya Nancy was a great lady but what we found in the investigation was that there wasn't child trafficking going on." You'd think that would be important to also cite as a reason they weren't "suicided". No evidence of abuse would also equal no need to "silence" them, in other words. 
B) He dismisses the very real claims that there are people within the CPS system who DO traffic and disappear children. And his responses are so over the top rude and dismissive it's actually disturbing.

             agreed. If he gets shitty with people asking him about the documentary, he needs to accept he' contributed to the concerns of the public in the manner he dropped it stone cold

              Oh boy. I hadn't gone that deep looking into it bc honestly, I thought AJ would have done his homework on that and known if the guy was BSing. Clearly not the case. I just want all of the TRUTH revealed about all of the "elites". That is the only way to wipe the slate clean and rebuild our society.

            Good stuff. What better way of finding out what Nancy Schaeffer had and what she was going to do than to pose as the producer of a documentary? Who wouldn't think they were in your corner? The fact he stuck with the narrative of it being a murder/suicide raises it to a certainty that he deserves another look.

            Really great information.  Nancy Schaefer I found on You Tube a few years ago after her death on radio call in shows.  She was the real deal.  I'm so glad someone tracked that producer.  I'm sure CPS snatches the 
"cute kids" as George Webb calls them.  The others for the low level pedos.  Look at the U.K.
