<p>It\'s already all too obvious that these &quot;higher echelon pedophiles&quot; seek out jobs, organisations, charities etc. etc. that brings them in touch with their prey, usually under a pretense that is the polar opposite of their actual intentions. This is actually the underlying theme of this post: yes, someone could be genuinely concerned about missing children, but if you\'re the one who makes the children disappear, what better way to keep researchers off your tracks by pretending to be one looking for missing children? Hiding in plain sight, so to speak.</p>
<p>So, I\'ve started to wonder about all these online game/chat-worlds for kids. Habbo Hotel, Moviestar Planet etc. etc. They look enticing enough, and they are probably great fun, but it is well known that these communities attract pedophiles, who, posing as kids, try to engage other kids in private conversations. Moderating these platforms must be one hell of a job.</p>
<p>But what if, apart from the visiting pedophiles, these platforms are built by people with, eh, nefarious purposes in mind? A pedophile with a good knowledge of IT and big data analytics could quite easily create the perfect digital hunting ground for himself and his peers. Think about it: kids usually sign up using their social media accounts and/or smartphone, nonchalantly granting access to all kinds of private information (camera, photos, location, friends etc). Also, their online behavior (hours spent online, daily schedule, chats etc.) can be analyzed.</p>
<p>This provides a pedophile on the hunt with all kinds of additional data he can act on. Facebook photos to select on looks, interests etc. etc. And someone who is even a little versed in big data analytics could easily deduce which kids are more vulnerable to suggestions, which kids already show an interest in sexual matters, which kids come from socially weak families, which kids are physically located in the area etc. etc.</p>
<p>Also, if you are in charge of a platform like this, it is dead easy to ignore worried parents who discover their kids having &quot;adult&quot; conversations with a pedophile posing as another user. You can easily say how &quot;shocked&quot; you are, promise to investigate and then claim the suspect user\'s IP-address can not be traced.</p>
<p>Triggered by this post <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1579101">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1579101</a> about how WebKinz offers a &quot;pizza party&quot; when you complete the Babysitter-challenge, I did some googling. </p>
<p>Webkinz operates from Canada, and is owned and paid for by Ganz.Com ... and do you know what else they make? That\'s right! The original Beanie Babies ---&gt; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26263">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26263</a> ... Also, Ganz.com owns a shitload of domain names, few of which are connected to actual websites.</p>
<p>Check out Ganz.com --- there\'s a slide carousel on the landing page. The 5th slide shows a product range called &quot;Crystal Expressions&quot;. We see a crystal girl-love-symbol-butterfly, red shoes (a Podesta favorite), rainbows (also prominent in the W of the Webkinz-logo), and a 5-pointed star. Also, check out this page advertising Webkinz: <a href="http://www.ganz.com/brands-webkinz.php">http://www.ganz.com/brands-webkinz.php</a> ... notice them swirly blue ornaments in the background?</p>
<p>Coincidence? I dunno ...</p>
<p>Of course, WebKinz has a foundation that targets children <a href="http://www.ganzworld.com/about-ganzworld/webkinz-foundation/:">http://www.ganzworld.com/about-ganzworld/webkinz-foundation/:</a></p>
<p>&quot;Webkinz Foundation works with partners who share our vision of a world where all children are educated, well nourished, and have access to quality health care.&quot;</p>
<p>Board members are: Owen Rogers, Max Gotlieb and a Mindy Ganz</p>
<p>Website is no longer in the air: <a href="http://www.webkinzfoundation.org/">http://www.webkinzfoundation.org/</a> ... it seems they\'ve been active for only three years, and collected a cool 1.5M in revenues: <a href="http://donate2charities.ca/en/WEBKINZ.FOUNDATION._.2_816868756RR0001">http://donate2charities.ca/en/WEBKINZ.FOUNDATION._.2_816868756RR0001</a></p>
<p>I also found a strange story about Byron Sonne, who was shortly employed as Senior systems specialist at WebKinz in 2008, and was wrongfully accused of trying to bomb(!) the G20 summit in 2010. It is even mentioned in WikiLeaks: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/15/1538420_re-g20-bomb-plot-toronto-man-arrested-in-g20-bomb-plot-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/15/1538420_re-g20-bomb-plot-toronto-man-arrested-in-g20-bomb-plot-.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Sonne, 37, was arrested after police executed a search warrant at his tony Forest Hill home on Tuesday. He is charged with a series of charges, including intimidation of justice system participant by threat and intimidation of justice system participant by watch and beset. He also faces charges of mischief, dangerous weapons and possessing explosives for unlawful purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently, the police overreacted: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/3iztc6/5_years_after_the_g20_police_overreaction_and_all/">https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/3iztc6/5_years_after_the_g20_police_overreaction_and_all/</a></p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>And what about Disney\'s CLUB PENGUIN?</p>
<p>A VOAT user already mentioned the CP-abbreviation (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1464641">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1464641)</a>), which might a coincidence, but we all know the name Disney pops up all too regularly in connection to pizzagate. Club Penguin is endorsed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which  triggered this response from another VOAT-user:</p>
<p>&quot;Further - <a href="http://www.icmec.org">http://www.icmec.org</a> and further still -- <a href="http://www.icmec.org/fcacp-members">http://www.icmec.org/fcacp-members</a> section can literally be read as a how to manual for international child trafficking. From WIKIPEDIA -- Formed in 1998, ICMEC heads a global missing children network in 22 countries. ICMEC and NCMEC and calling themselves &quot;sister orgs&quot; but really -- same President/CEO Ernie Allen (check him) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ICMEC_Board.jpgJPG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ICMEC_Board.jpgJPG</a>. Officially launched at the British Embassy in DC in 1999 by First Lady Hillary. All the main partners presenting themselves front and center. And come to think of it ... all lining up nicely for the chaos of 911. Just one more giant corporation -- and we are livestock.&quot;</p>
<p>Again, this might be yet another organisation pretending to benefit children, while actually preying on them. This is what Ernie Allen has to say about that: (<a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2007_08/200708022.html">http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2007_08/200708022.html)</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;The introduction of a statewide Internet safety campaign is an important tool in our arsenal to protect children from potential threats posed by Internet predators,&quot; said Ernie Allen. Check out his name on VOAT ... this guy is probably speaking with two tongues.</p>
<p>Similar to WebKinz, Club Penguin is also located in Canada. The company that originally created Club Penguin was called New Horizon Interactive, founded by Lane Merrifield, Dave Krysko and Lance Priebe.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Lance Priebe\'s brother, Chris Priebe, runs a company specialized in online community management. This company, also based in Canada, produces a special product called CEASE that detects &quot;Child Sexual Abuse Material&quot;. (<a href="https://twohat.co/products/">https://twohat.co/products/)</a>) ... the name of this company is &quot;Two Hat Security&quot;. Another hint these people put up a two-faced front? Pretending to serve while aspiring to dine?</p>
<p>In July 2016, this company partnered with PRIVO, a Washington DC based company, with the goal of making &quot;internet safer for kids&quot; (<a href="https://www.kelownanow.com/columns/Startup_Kelowna/news/Accelerate_Okanagan/14/07/16/Kelowna_Tech_Company_Partners_With_Washington_DC_Firm">https://www.kelownanow.com/columns/Startup_Kelowna/news/Accelerate_Okanagan/14/07/16/Kelowna_Tech_Company_Partners_With_Washington_DC_Firm)</a>). Apparently, PRIVO stands for Private Vault Online, and they provide identity management services for underage web-users.</p>
<p>Could be legit, though it strikes me as strange that the first possible tech-partner for identity verification is located over 4500 kilometers away. It is more likely the people behind DC-based PRIVO want to make sure they cooperate with others &quot;in the know&quot;. Again, if you want to use the internet as your hunting ground, you better make sure you control all the ins and outs, age verifications, chat services, pornfilters etc. etc. What better way to do this than to pose as an organisation that pretends to offer legitimate and compliant age verification? </p>
<p>Far-fetched? Remember how those high-profile independent credit rating agencies on Wall Street churned out triple-A ratings for worthless mortgages? They turned out to be completely corrupt.</p>',

           This is some further elaboration on a comment I posted a few days ago in a submission that didn't get a lot of attention. However, after a few days of googling and thinking, I decided this topic warrants its own submission.

           "The introduction of a statewide Internet safety campaign is an important tool in our arsenal to protect children from potential threats posed by Internet predators," said Ernie Allen. Check out his name on VOAT ... this guy is probably speaking with two tongues.

           Similar to WebKinz, Club Penguin is also located in Canada. The company that originally created Club Penguin was called New Horizon Interactive, founded by Lane Merrifield, Dave Krysko and Lance Priebe.
          </p>
          <p>
           Interestingly, Lance Priebe's brother, Chris Priebe, runs a company specialized in online community management. This company, also based in Canada, produces a special product called CEASE that detects "Child Sexual Abuse Material". (
           <a href="https://twohat.co/products/">
            https://twohat.co/products/)
           </a>
           ) ... the name of this company is "Two Hat Security". Another hint these people put up a two-faced front? Pretending to serve while aspiring to dine?
          </p>
          <p>
           In July 2016, this company partnered with PRIVO, a Washington DC based company, with the goal of making "internet safer for kids" (
           <a href="https://www.kelownanow.com/columns/Startup_Kelowna/news/Accelerate_Okanagan/14/07/16/Kelowna_Tech_Company_Partners_With_Washington_DC_Firm">
            https://www.kelownanow.com/columns/Startup_Kelowna/news/Accelerate_Okanagan/14/07/16/Kelowna_Tech_Company_Partners_With_Washington_DC_Firm)
           </a>
           ). Apparently, PRIVO stands for Private Vault Online, and they provide identity management services for underage web-users.
          </p>
          <p>
           Could be legit, though it strikes me as strange that the first possible tech-partner for identity verification is located over 4500 kilometers away. It is more likely the people behind DC-based PRIVO want to make sure they cooperate with others "in the know". Again, if you want to use the internet as your hunting ground, you better make sure you control all the ins and outs, age verifications, chat services, pornfilters etc. etc. What better way to do this than to pose as an organisation that pretends to offer legitimate and compliant age verification?
          </p>
          <p>
           Far-fetched? Remember how those high-profile independent credit rating agencies on Wall Street churned out triple-A ratings for worthless mortgages? They turned out to be completely corrupt.

            As someone who spent years playing Club Penguin/Webkinz as a kid, I think this is absurd without any known cases of child abduction related to the games.
           </p>
           <p>
            Webkinz is laughable. It's impossible to say anything about one's personal information in chatrooms. They are heavily moderated. Numbers will not go through. Names, places, and vulgarity are all filtered, and the rules are heavily enforced. There is manual as well as algorithmic protection in place. No chat logs go unreviewed. Violators are banned from chat spaces for some period of time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Club Penguin's filter system is a little more lax, but it's still extremely hard to communicate anything personal. Numbers will not go through chat, spelled out, or in numeral form. Names will not go through, except for usernames. Using vulgarity automatically earns you a ban. In seven years of playing the game, I've seen users acting in suggestive ways on a few very rare occasions. But to make the jump from that to "therefore pedophiles use it to groom kids" is absurd.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Not everything marketed to kids is pedo related.

             You're talking from the point of view of a regular user. Yes, they are severely moderated, and I'm quite certain these platforms do everything they can to keep the "regular" pedophiles away. But I'm talking about the
             <strong>
              architects
             </strong>
             of the platform. They have access to all the data, can bypass any moderation, and remain completely invisible.

              There would be no evidence of illicit doing if the

               architects

              or the platform are involved.  You must be stupid if you think they would leave tracks, they are very cautious.
