            It is of note that Atlus, the developers of the
            <em>
             Persona
            </em>
            series, are a subsidiary of Sega (Sega bought them out a few years ago when they were in financial trouble).  Two of the creators of Sega (or Standard Games as it was known then) were Martin Bromley (known to have a penchant for young boys) and James Humpert.  Prior to forming Standard Games in Honolulu, Bromley was the owner of the Playland amusement arcade in London's Piccadilly Circus and Humpert was Director of Piccadilly Enterprises.  Playland was at the centre of a VIP paedophile ring in London.  Boys were regularly taken from the arcade to be raped by MPs and other British establishment figures (Peter Hayman, Deputy Director of MI6, for example).  Interesting connections!

            Dangan Ronpa: Ultra Despair Girls very blatently talks about Pedowood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chapter 3 (the Kotoko Usami arc) is about a child actress who was sexually abused. Chillingly realistic depiction of a abuse linked PTSD "trigger".
           </p>
           <p>
            Normally this series is a black comedy, but this chapter is absolutely dead fucking serious in its depiction of sexual abuse victims. White hat game?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Persona 5 predicted the exposure of Harvey Weinstein a full year before hand (one of the targets in Mementos is blatently about people like him). Given a lot of the plot elements of the Third Act, (massive deep state allegories) P5 might be a white hat production.

            I have to call for a rules check... how does this relate?
If you look deep enough into anything, you can find "the mysterious 23" or "23 ski-doo" or anything else you might want to find (7 minutes spent on the elevator, 7 children on the playground; 29 steps to the front door, 29 pizza delivery businesses).
If you look hard enough, you'll find what you want to find everyplace you look.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, there was a game called Night Trap, where Dana Plato (porn star) gets attacked by vampires in a house you control the security system to.
And, a hundred thousand other games and movies and TV shows and so on, and so on...
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem has become, the same stuff is being reposted again and again, and people are starting to exaggeratedly stretch things to "fit the theme".  It's nice,
            <strong>
             now and then
            </strong>
            , for someone to restate the bare metal version of what this is all for. but then for someone to try to stretch things to fit the story, we end up looking like a bunch of nuts.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we need is hard evidence... not the thousands of people in the last month saying that everything is "Satanic Ritual Abuse" just because they saw someone else say it... it's the "witch burning times" syndrome... because someone says it, everyone believes it and can slap the label on anything remotely close to it (it's called Mass Hysteria), doesn't mean it actually is.
In order to get this whole thing into court, they're gonna want hard evidence, not "my third cousin, twice removed, told someone... etc. etc." that someone (who fits the bill for a B-rate horror movie villain) came into her room after she went to bed "and did stuff to her, and made her carry the dead fetus (because of all the hardcore sex or whatever) and then sacrificed it to the thirty horned goat-god so they would be made immortal.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can tie HRC to something like that, with something more than a type-to-speak YouTube video from a week-old account, be my guest... I'll lay out the place-mats however you want them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll admit that Alefantis has strange artwork, both at his house and his business, HRC is an odd person all around, maybe some of these SRA "victims" experienced
            <strong>
             something
            </strong>
            , but to try to say that everything ties back into one single common theme is like saying that the US controls the entire world through a 40 levels deep conspiracy that includes your neighbor's friends cat.  It runs deep, I'll admit it here and now, but not as deep and as involved as people seem to think.
Some are on the right track... NXIVM seems to be a good target, "draining the swamp" is a great one, but HRC harvesting Adrenochrome (which, if you look on www.erowid.com, is reported as being a hell of a bad trip... oxidized Adrenalin... no value there, even) by having Podesta yell at kids in a shower so she can remain young or something, not a good lead... Adrenochrome was created by Hunter Thompson for Fear And Loathing (the book)).
The unfounded research (links to text-to-speech YouTube videos with no real info, garbage media sites) makes us look worse in the public's eyes.
Remember, this is a publicly searchable forum... the mods can do what they can to cull the crap posts back, but if someone searches for "what happened at Comet Ping Pong" or something, do we really want the first page of results to be crap posts with no relevance, or serious posts?

              I put 'some' and 'something' in there in the way that I did because (at least from where I'm sitting), the sudden rate that everyone came forward saying that they were victims of SRA was a little too sudden.  Just within the last few years (don't have concrete numbers on hand... am trying to look them up in another tab, but not finding much... will edit when I find full statistical information), the number of people who say they are victims of SRA has exponentially grown, though I suspect that, at a minimum, some of the people who say they were victims came forward just for the "fame" (yes, I know that sounds stupid, but people will do
              <strong>
               anything
              </strong>
              for five minutes of fame, even if they end up with a label like "victim of SRA" or "sexual abuse victim", and especially if there is money to be made by the people who
              <em>
               claim that they were abused in either scenario when they weren't
              </em>
              .
It is a sad fact of today's society that people will do anything for money and five minutes of fame.
And, while I do still have stuff to learn, everything I know has been learned by being out in the world and seeing things as they are, not just reading about it.  People will exploit anyone and anything for personal gain when the going gets tough, even if they have to screw over family or friends by saying someone "came into my room and did things to me" just to get money or property or anything possible.

            I agree with you, not sure this belongs here either, as the connections are quite weak.  We are going to have to flair this.  The community has 24 hrs to establish relevancy to #pg as per the definition in Rule 1, otherwise this will have to be deleted.
