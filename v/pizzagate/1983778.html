<p>This is by far the most dangerous issue I have come across to speak on. What I am about to reveal may put my family and, myself in danger of character assassination or worse. I state for the record that It was my hand, mine alone who harnessed the initiative, intention and willpower to make this go viral but, others had noticed this and posted on this only to have it removed before me. Our team built on their research and we hope that law enforcement and the citizen journalists can build on this as well so that we all may become informed decision makers in the future.</p>
<p>This information has also been sent to various big name news personalities who may or may not have the guts to try and investigate and expose this issue more. This issue strikes a deep and dark cord in the world today and directly affect YOU by impressioning your children or, children you know with abnormal and indecent behavior. This could lead to serious problems in the development and future of affected children – your children.  Even if your child is not directly exposed to this she/he may encounter other children who have been exposed to these themes and, I am sure you will find said themes disturbing in nature. Please listen to this information and spend 10-20 minuets of your own time to investigate the information I present. I can assure you that you will promptly come to your own conclusions and, that it will not be a trivial issue that you will simply forget about.</p>
<p>I need to provide the background a bit more so you understand what you should be seeing because these videos are not pleasant to watch and, I hope you only spend the time necessary to see the points I make. These videos have the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>They seem to use very popular kids “hero’s” and use them regularly with a favoring of 2-4 main characters (Spiderman, Elsa from Frozen, The Joker from Batman and a rotating other “hero” character or two).</li>
<li>Their themes are shockingly based on pregnancy, injections and syringes, doctor roll play, and leading to the more extreme theme of “bad daddy” “bad baby” poop and urine play and bondage / kidnaping themes.</li>
<li>There is a pattern of some of these YouTube channel names supporting each others “work” and commenting about what a “good video” it is or, similar “positive” comments.</li>
<li>There is a pattern of YouTube users and sometimes the channel creator using what looks like gibberish and/or meaningless words and phases.</li>
<li>There have been known encryption keys and links to other videos placed in some of these comments (see below).</li>
<li>The metadata tags in some of these videos are extensive and encompasses many keywords a child may search. These tags are also occasional translated into other languages</li>
<li>The videos seem to be filmed in nice homes / locations or are 3-D type animations / cartoons.</li>
<li>The videos are commonly centered around “colors” and “teach your child colors”</li>
<li>The videos are either animated or employ adult and /or children “actors” dressed as a character(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some titles and video links of a broad variety of these. Warning the material shared below may be disturbing to some audiences.</p>

<p><strong><em>Super Hero’s YouTube Channel – Statistics</em></strong></p>
<p>Created July 27th 2015. It seems that the channel is a fake profile and the actual channel owner is located in IRAQ</p>
<p>Est. Monthly Income Low: 4k High: 61K
Est. Yearly Income Low: 46k High: 740k</p>
<p>Observations: we have seen a few videos of an older man roll playing with young girls. Videos appear to be recorded in California or a similar warm climate and, there are other indicators that the channel has ties to the US.</p>
<p><strong><em>Surprise Songs Club – Statistics</em></strong></p>
<p>Unknown country of origin, Created January 6th 2017</p>
<p>Est. Monthly Income Low: 500.00 High: 5k
Est. Yearly Income Low: NA High: NA</p>
<p><strong><em>Toys and Me YouTube Channel – Statistics</em></strong></p>
<p>Channel created April 15th 2015. Based out of the UK. This channel has 5M subscribers and over 3 Billion views of its videos. In addition this channel has been seen to consistently grow by over 10k subscribers per day. We have tracked that the owners of this particular channel have ownership of at least 15 other Youtube channels with similar names and metadata tags.</p>
<p>Est. Monthly Income Low: 6k High: 971K
Est. Yearly Income Low: 728k High: 11M</p>
<p>Now take a look at the tags they use for this particular video channel.</p>
<p>Famtasti, candy, sweets, kids, gummy, hulk, warheads, fun, prank, in real life, kids react, funny video, gross, battle, contest, gummy hulk, hot dog, Pizza, Spider man, Super Heros, Elsa, Elsa pregnant</p>
<p>I think that you can clearly see that this is big business for some of these channels and, some of these channels and videos post very questionable and suggestive material. What is the reason for this? Are you as shocked as I am? Do the corporate sponsors of some of these videos know what they are actually promoting?</p>
<p>Plain and simply this is used to condition children to become normalized to pedophilia, transgenderism and the sexualization of young children / teens. The following points prove this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The videos are marketed to kids specifically as noted with metadata tags and the use of popular children’s “hero” personalities and themes.</li>
<li>The acts of “playing” with adults, dress up and roll play are common themes in some channels</li>
<li>There appears to be a common theme of bondage, containment and even kidnaping.</li>
<li>There is a common trend with “eating” or sticking things such as large gummy worms in some of the children’s mouths</li>
<li>There seems to be “fake profiles” set up to promptly praise what a “good video” this is or defend the video if a parent calls out the questionable content in a particular video.</li>
<li>The use of cipher keys and encrypted code has been documented and noted here that unlock secret twitter accounts where clues were left and other YouTube videos were found (see below).</li>
<li>Many of the comments in the videos appear to use some sort of Gibberish / Code to reference some sort of pedophilia comments, events, or for some other use?</li>
<li>Many of the commenters on the videos seem to be fake profiles / shell accounts designed for some purpose described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Info found linked in cipher code on one of the videos below (kind of…)</p>
<p>Warning! This material is highly suspected of containing ultrasonic frequencies, mind control, trigger words and this programming and may cause adverse effects on the viewer. Viewer discretion is strongly advised and it is advised that no one with predisposed mental conditions or DID view this video.</p>
<p>Note: upon further debate and review with my team we, have decided to retract this information based on the very disturbing nature of the material. This material has had reports of making people physically ill and feeling “strange” immediately after viewing it. Material will be shared on a case by case basis and personal request or, you can follow the source links I will provide and uncover it yourself in your research.  I will not be responsible for anyone getting hurt from this material – it is that serious and we recommend only professionals or Law Enforcement view these materials.</p>
<p>In light of these revelations of what appears to have been hidden right under our noses. It is important to contemplate what this all means? I have reached out to gather opinions on this and, from one very well known expert who specifically worked with satanic ritual abuse victims for the Adam Walsh Foundation on some very big cases in the 80’s and 90’s. She has authorized me to use her name here, Pamela Harris-Oedekerk. In our opinion this is direct evidence of a large international concentrated effort to desensitize our children to pedophilia. I am not going to sugar coat it. This is plain and simple conditioning a young person’s mind to view perverse acts as normal.</p>
<p>Please take this information and use it to make people aware of the dangers here and to help us the people shut off the money supply to these video creators. Take any action you feel compelled to. I felt compelled to try to make this go mainstream and viral. Others may decide to write and call YouTube, the video sponsors, the channel owners, Law Enforcement etc… Share this information so that we can work together to stop the spread of this disease before it is too late. Thank you to all the Hackers, KEK, Researchers, Citizen Journalists, and YouTube Truthers and concerned Citizens!</p>

           In light of these revelations of what appears to have been hidden right under our noses. It is important to contemplate what this all means? I have reached out to gather opinions on this and, from one very well known expert who specifically worked with satanic ritual abuse victims for the Adam Walsh Foundation on some very big cases in the 80’s and 90’s. She has authorized me to use her name here, Pamela Harris-Oedekerk. In our opinion this is direct evidence of a large international concentrated effort to desensitize our children to pedophilia. I am not going to sugar coat it. This is plain and simple conditioning a young person’s mind to view perverse acts as normal.

           Please take this information and use it to make people aware of the dangers here and to help us the people shut off the money supply to these video creators. Take any action you feel compelled to. I felt compelled to try to make this go mainstream and viral. Others may decide to write and call YouTube, the video sponsors, the channel owners, Law Enforcement etc… Share this information so that we can work together to stop the spread of this disease before it is too late. Thank you to all the Hackers, KEK, Researchers, Citizen Journalists, and YouTube Truthers and concerned Citizens!

             Thank you very much, the more information gets out there the better. Sadly not everything can be shown though, there are some serious nasty videos located in places like tumbler and even blogger that I can't post with out either getting in trouble. I think on 4chan and on Reddit some people have tired to do the same but their post keep getting taken down. I learned yesterday by another person doing the research that the reason facebook doesn't do anything about it is because it falls under "art", a form of expression and therefore facebook can not remove these hidden groups.
