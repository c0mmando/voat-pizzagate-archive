            what?

           <p>
            When this forum first opened there were a lot of saudi threads that appeared to get scrubbed out.
            <br/>
            I wish someone could research the Saudi area people and find witness testimonies in regard to this.

            <p>
             Egyptian authorities arrested the 30-year-old Hijazi, her husband Mohamed Hassanein, and six others in May 2014 on charges of abusing children in her care and engaging in human trafficking, kidnapping, sexual exploitation, and torture. Local human rights groups have said the charges are fabricated and part of a crackdown by Egypt's government on civil society.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Those are very serious charges. Why would the Egyptian Government want to punish a group of people helping orphans and children? It doesn't make any sense.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hillary Clinton, along with several congressmen and international rights groups, had called for Hijazi's release.

            Ok. Guilty as sin.

             Have you no clue about the Egyptian government? Egypt's leader is a dictator and had presided over a crackdown on human rights groups and other civil organizations.    Did you not notice that human rights groups are sticking up for her?  Are you so blind with hatred, the name Clinton makes you stop looking at other evidence?  Did woman was being illegally held prisoner for 33 months before her trial, a violation of the Egyptian constitution.  The government examined the children at her organization and found no signs of abuse.

              "Have you no clue about the Egyptian government?"
             </p>
             <p>
              And have you no clue about the Muslim Brotherhood? Egypt is divided 51%-49% between two dictators el-Sisi and Morsi. I'm no fan of either because they're two sides of the same coin. They're six of one and half a dozen of another respectively. They're the left and right boot in Orwell's "If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever."
             </p>
             <p>
              The only hope for Egypt is if The Deep State within the U.S. government collapses of its own weight and stops fucking around with you people. Hopefully their turn in the driver seat ends later this year. I don't know if you're writing to us from the Middle East but I'm starting to suspect you might be. Well boy do I have news for you. If you ARE writing from Egypt or Jordan or Saudi as I'm starting to suspect then you've been fooled.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Deep State is a master of compartmentalizing fraud. If you're Muslim Brotherhood they told you everything you wanted to hear. Ever ask yourself who was on the other end of the line? You need to open yourself to the fact it was probably Henry Kissinger and that ain't good for you. Kissinger is a genius. His plan is to keep Muslims in check by getting them to fight each other.....forever. Ring any bells?
             </p>
             <p>
              If you're writing from Israel then I'd say hat's off to you. Getting the Muslims in the Middle East to kill each other until there's no one left is absolutely brilliant. It's diabolical but brilliant nonetheless. That's maybe what I'd do in your shoes but unlikely because I'm a Christian who believes in such tired old platitudes as "Love your enemy" and "Turn the other cheek". You know the deal, you know there's a catch, those are platitudes for a reason. The last time they were so ignored was 2000 years ago and got your Zealot asses thrown to the four corners of
              <strong>
               The Wind
              </strong>
              . If you were ever caught out which looks like maybe the case then any initial success would be returned in spades of anger and righteous indignation to never support Israel again from here to eternity. That's sad but that's a fact. Oy-vey.

No. My point was the Egyptian government is punishing all sorts of people and this is well known.   And they don't need a valid point for it.   The repression is the point itself.  The reason they are doing this is to drive people out of civil society.  To show people if they organize, they are in danger. And I didn't provide anyone of the thousands of links to this because it's absolutely well-known.

Abdel Fatah al-Sisi had taken control of the country and cracked down on dissent, real and perceived.....During questioning, Hassanein was beaten...state-censored media...they wanted big, splash propaganda to show that the government was standing up to the big, bad west... that a forensic examination of the children showed that they had suffered abuse before they were taken in by Belady. Prosecutors stalled, renewing detention without charges for 15 days at a time..."Absent proof, made available for all to see, that they have committed a punishable offense, the charges should be dismissed."...Human rights groups have condemned the detention and said it falls within a larger campaign against aid and civil rights workers.....“From everything we can tell, it’s ridiculous,” said Sarah Margon, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch.....swept up into this excessively heavy handed approach by the Sisi government to go after a whole range of actors. So while the work she was doing was for children, development oriented, it seems very likely that she was lumped in with a campaign against NGOs, human rights organizations....very virulent anti-American and anti-western” sentiment has dominated Egyptian media for months...40,000 people have been imprisoned in Egypt since 2013, many tortured or detained without trial or legal counsel.

               So the facts of the case are the Egyptian government brings a case against them on suspect evidence (a father complained, they were keeping his kid who ran away from home.   The kid was actually in another part of Egypt."), keeps them detained for years, delaying and delaying their trial for two years and then when they are cleared by the court, the court holds it's verdict for another three weeks.   The court decided March 23rd, to delay its verdict and then yesterday, they dropped all the charges.  So guess what, she's not even accused of trafficking anymore.  The government has dropped that accusation.

                I didn't miss any parts. I read it all. Something is suspicious when you dig DEEP enough. Check this new development here for further incriminating evidence.

                 Of course, you are paranoid.  You believe in Masonic/Illuminati nonsense as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And you have no clue about evidence.  The "incriminating evidence" you speak you just pulled out of your deep pool of confirmation bias.

                <p>
                 You are weighing on this against, the evidence of people who were actually on location, who could asess the situation.  The government of Egypt investigated her. They had three years to investigate.  They dropped the charges. She is no longer accused of anything.

            We should look into her organization. It smells a lot like the Sillsby story; worth looking into IMO. As a reminder to all, DO NOT DOX OR ABUSE. Just research.

             Great post and, 100% agreed, it should be looked into. Maybe there is a connection to be made between Clinton and this suspected human trafficking organisation in Egypt. I can't help remembering the poor Somalian refugees (including a mother and her two babies) that washed up on the East cost shores of Egypt a couple weeks ago. Their organs had been stolen and their bodies dumped at sea. So cruel, so unfair... Here are important stories to be looked into as well.

            So the plan is to get women to spirit these children, like a modern day Pied Piper out of the country?  Women are expected to care for children, so they figure it to be less suspect.  Ha!  Hillary has now protected two, the other being Laura Silsby.  So far, one loss, one gain.  But there have probably been others.  There were politicians and rights groups that backed her up as well.
