            Another critically-thinking human amazed he got banned from Twitter for wrong think.  It's almost like this has been happening for months now.

             Yes, it has been happening on twitter and on all the other cia fronts.  I had simply flown under the radar.  The good thing is those not awake and those not taking pop shots at truth tellers trying to wake people, actually take the time to look at truth and start to realize what MSM is telling them is false.  Godspeed!

            I offended the Illuminati this weekend when I woke up to everything trending about Beyonce...it was my first ban. I pretended to delete the post that they already took down and gad to wait 12 hours to get back in. I've been a Russian bot and censored since supporting Bernie till he was forced to endorse her. Only other time I got in trouble was for posting a pic of Seth's parents with a reward poster when media was telling everyone to stop looking into it because they want us to stop. They told me to stop posting spam or get banned. I wonder if there are people who are sitting there with things that need posting but they are afraid to because this could be their final ban because I am kinda worried and want to still be around for the BIG stuff.

             I understand this!  I always weight out whether it is worth it and have even titled a video what? because I wanted the content out there.  It has become very tricky.  I am glad truth tellers are standing up to all of this.  Did you see the Hank Williams before the House Judiciary Committee?  He was something else, but they sure held their own!  Hoping these platforms realize good people won't keep being shoved down and will be vocal about what's happening while trying to achieve change and the right to freedom of speech no matter what political standing!

            Keep speaking out. People are listening and noticing. Increasingly, the people perpetrating this atmosphere of truth shaming are getting stuck in a shrinking echo chamber. Soon it will be just them in there and the rest of us out here.

            Not sure if you speak in jest or not. We must realize its war. In war, you dont get fair treatment. Stop whining and proceed. Someone tell hannity, rush limb., and all the others. Its an info war. Were in it regardless. Win or perish- or praise allah.

            I've been suspended from twitter since Feb....had to make dummy acct.  But I got suspended after sharing truth about luciferian pedos and the left using the kids in Parkland.  Apparently the left hates anyone wanting to #SaveTheChildren.  And dorsey, well, he quotes satanic verses and speaks in pedo language...could be why, eh?
