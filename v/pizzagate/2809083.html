<p>WASHINGTON – Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine announced Tuesday that his office will open an investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in the local archdiocese.</p>
<p>Racine announced the move Tuesday during a regular breakfast meeting among Washington officials. The Washington Archdiocese has been shaken recently by a pair of high-profile sexual abuse scandals — but neither of them involved abuse that took place in Washington.</p>
<p>Racine\'s office has limited powers; all felony cases in the District of Columbia are handled by the U.S. Attorney\'s office. However he is focusing on his authority to enforce a Washington law governing nonprofit organizations. Racine also cites a local law that requires any adult to report suspected child abuse or neglect to authorities.</p>
<p>The mandatory reporting law carries only a three-year statute of limitations, however there\'s no such limit on the law governing nonprofit organizations, giving Racine the authority to explore decades of archdiocese history.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the law, nonprofits are required to work for a public purpose,&quot; Racine told a group of elected officials Tuesday morning. &quot;If they are in fact covering up child sex abuse, that is clearly not in the public interest.&quot;</p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday, the archdiocese said church officials had met with Racine in September to brief him on the church\'s anti-abuse policies and procedures.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a very productive exchange with the Attorney General and his staff,&quot; said Kim Viti Fiorentino, chancellor and general counsel for the archdiocese. &quot;We explained that the problem of sexual abuse of minors in the archdiocese was an historical one - that to our knowledge there had not been an incident of abuse of a minor by an archdiocesan clergy member for almost 20 years.&quot;    WHAT?  
</p>
<p>Racine, in an interview with The Associated Press, said his office, &quot;appreciated their outreach.&quot;    WHERE Is The Outrage???!!!</p>
<p>He said he decided to initiate the investigation after the August report by a Pennsylvania grand jury that detailed more than 1,000 abuse cases involving more than 300 priests dating back 70 years and a systematic cover-up by multiple church leaders. The report also detailed Cardinal Wuerl\'s alleged role in covering up cases and shuffling pedophile priests through multiple parishes.</p>
<p>The report, Racine said, &quot;raised concern about concealment of evidence. We want to make sure that none of that happened here in Washington.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this month in a bid for transparency, the local archdiocese released a list of 31 clergy members it said had been &quot;credibly accused&quot; of sexually abusing minors. Most of the cases date back multiple decades and only three of the alleged abuses took place after 2000. Of the 31 men listed, 16 are dead.</p>
<p>The Washington Archdiocese holds a powerful place in the American church hierarchy. In addition to being the home of the federal government, Washington contains important Catholic institutions like the Vatican\'s embassy and Georgetown University.</p>
<p>KARL RACINE  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Racine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Racine</a></p>
<p>Karl A. Racine (born 1963) is the first ever independently elected attorney general of the District of Columbia, a position he has held since January 2015.[1] Prior to his election, he was the managing partner of Venable LLP.[2][3][4] </p>
<p>Born in Haiti, Racine and his family fled the Duvalier regime and emigrated to Washington, D.C. when he was three years old.[5] He attended public schools until eighth grade and graduated from St. John\'s College High School,[5] and was a star high school basketball player.[4] </p>
<p>Racine attended the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Virginia School of Law, where he worked at a pro bono clinic representing migrant farm workers.[2][5] He said he was drawn to the law because of the role lawyers played in advancing civil rights.[5] While in law school, he and his mother produced the first Haitian Creole/English legal dictionary, intended to aid Haitian immigrants in the United States.[2] </p>
<p>After graduating from law school in 1989, Racine joined Venable LLP but left in 1992 to become a staff attorney at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia.[2][4] He then returned to private practice at Cacheris &amp; Treanor, where he handled large white-collar and civil cases,[2] and later served as associate White House counsel in the Clinton administration.[2][6] In addition, he served as a member of the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission,[7] a selection panel for judges. Racine returned to Venable in 2000 and was elected managing partner in 2006, becoming the first black managing partner of a top-100 law firm.[2][4][6] </p>
<p>He has also been active in aiding his native Haiti, raising $125,000 from Venable\'s lawyers, staff, and foundation to support relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake[23] and raising money for the Haitian Education and Leadership Program (HELP).[24] </p>
<p>Racine served as a board member of the Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia,[20] as a member of the steering committee of the Whitman-Walker Clinic\'s Legal Services Program[21] and as a board member of the local literacy organization Everybody Wins.[22] </p>

<p>Bill Clinton Endorses Karl Racine for DC Attorney General</p>
<p>Former President Bill Clinton is throwing his support behind Racine over four other candidates to become the District’s first elected attorney general, Racine’s campaign says. A few weeks ago, President Obama endorsed Muriel Bowser in the November 4 mayoral election.</p>
<p>Clinton is tapping Racine thanks to his work as an associate White House counsel during Clinton’s second term, during which time Racine worked on Clinton’s impeachment proceedings in the Monica Lewinsky affair.</p>

<p>Clinton Slated as Headliner at NYC Fundraiser for Women AG Candidates</p>
<p>Another special guest at this evening\'s fundraiser is Karl Racine, the Democrat AG in the District of Columbia who has sued the Trump administration over the Constitution\'s &quot;emoluments clause,&quot; for the president\'s ongoing financial stake in commercial interests such as the Trump Hotel in D.C.</p>
<p>I don\'t know, somehow I don\'t think this guy is going to dig really deep when it comes to investigating the DC diocese and their involvement in 
clerical sexual abuse of Our Children.  Do you?  
</p>
<p>In his Wiki it does not give the name of his Father or Mother and his birth year is 1963 (age 54-55) Which one is it, don\'t they know?  Hmm.</p>

<p>DC Attorney General Launches Investigation Into Catholic Church Abuse Cover-Up</p>
<p>Karl Racine made the announcement Tuesday at a breakfast with elected officials. It comes one day after the U.S. attorney for D.C., Jesse Liu, set up a sex abuse hotline to report crimes committed by priests in D.C., and less than two weeks after Cdl.

            No way he's gonna betray The Cannibal Queen and end up Arkancided.

            His job is to behave like an independent investigator that wants truth and justice to prevail. He'll make a show of really working hard (or hardly working?), and when exhausted, will proclaim The Foundation innocent of all the scurrilous lies and conspiracy theories. In other words, establish himself as an authority so he can exonerate those scumbags.

            You're right! One big dog and pony show.

             I stopped at Carmen's title. Have others, and I, not warned of the hidden evils in Racine? It is a man gay town for sure. Lot's of blackety guys named Racine from Haiti. Kenosha is a sister city and another story.

              Yes!  That is what caught my attention immediately.  What an odd name for someone that just happens to be a Dem AG.  His name is what made me look into it all.  This is a Veiled Message to us from the evil cabal.  They are slipping in another one of their clones.

              I met some Haitian refugees at a place I used to work. One was older. Her parents escaped from Papa Doc Duvalier's regime. She was only a child, but she said what was going on was unimaginable. At the time, I didn't know to ask these types of questions. The ones that left later said pretty much the same thing about the sick things that go on there

               Papa Doc, as he is commonly known, was not a good leader, from all views that I have access to. From my own opinion, from the outside, I would have to agree with the general status quo on that one. Someone else who might have been there or not, said the same thing.

             Dog and pony shows is what the Clintons are especially good at.  What a joke that he is connected to the Monica Lewinsky case.  Clinton being friends with Epstein making trips down to his island on the Lolita Express, and now we have a guy in place that will be looking into priests raping Our Children.  If this wasn't so sad and sick it would be laughable.  This is a True Farce.

              It is, but they've done this before. One of their own proclaims innocence Like Comey with Killary's emails. These priest ... ugh! And at least one of the incidents I was talking about involved a priest .. how could it not? I don't know if it's been posted before, but it pretty well sums up pizzagate ... as does this.

                 Yes!  I agree.  I heard that Republicans are beating Dems in the early voting and I now believe that's why the bombs were sent.  They are getting desperate.  I am one that believes they are all in on this.  The Deep State actors are guilty and Soros.  This means Rep. and Dems. I don't for one moment think that we are going to solve this with one election.  There is a crowd of them running that will be glad to take the place of bad actors, on both sides.  They have this all set up and it will take a lot to get rid of them.  The votes will be tampered with.  I have done a lot of research on early voting.  This is when they do the vote flipping on the machines.  Believe me.  They can flip votes on those machines from the parking lot.

            <p>
             Sexual abuse and coverups in the Catholic Church seem interminable because they are. The Pennsylvania report is by no means the first and it will not be the last. That’s about the only thing Morlino’s letter makes clear, though this was not his intent. Time and again we will find out about children sacrificed on the altar of the Catholic Church. This will not change as long as the church claims to wield divine authority, as long as it claims to speak for a god.
            </p>
            <p>
             Morlino concludes his letter: “(t)here is a lot of justified anger and passion … calling for real reform and ‘house cleaning’ of this type of depravity. I stand with them.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The only way to reform the Catholic Church, especially for anyone not in that Catholic hierarchy, is to quit. We know things have not changed. We know they will not change. At best, the church hierarchy will mouth a few “pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities,” to borrow from Dr. King, but it will not give up its power. So you must stop giving it power. You must stop giving your time and your tithe to an 
organization that is guaranteed to be involved in more of these scandals. It’s time to quit the Catholic Church.

             Pompous, arrogant flouncing around with their ridiculous expensive costumes as if they are royalty. They're Not Royalty.
            </p>
            <p>
             No they are not royalty is right.  They are suppose to be men of the cloth.  They are to live simple lives and give their life to God.  That is the purpose of a priest and to help others.  So far many have been doing nothing but living high off the hog and the alms of the poor and others.  They help themselves, to Our Children.  Time to Cast them out.  Now.

             Thank you for your comment.  I totally agree.  Yes, stop giving money.  If you are of the Catholic Faith or another Christian Faith, find a house of worship that speaks to the True Teachings of God.  Seek them out.  Catholics look for Churches that say the Traditional Mass.  If you find one, you can be assured you can help by volunteering and helping the poor through THAT Church.  We must be careful who we are supporting.  The devil sits in the Chair of St. Peter.

              I completely Agree carmencita!
             </p>
             <p>
              Many of us gave up.  We tried, I assure you I have been in a variety of denominations.  Across the board Vast corruption!
             </p>
             <p>
              Those who feel they can trust anybody. . .generally you can count them on one hand or you're being too trusting, well, they meet in small home groups.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many pastors in these churches at least 96% are obligated to report certain activity to Homeland Security.  I'm not talking about the criminal element either, I'm talking about those who don't succumb to the globalist programming.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those who step outside of the box!
             </p>
             <p>
              They will watch you, they will target you, they will facilitate institutions in your town to try to Force you into Submission!
             </p>
             <p>
              They are a Few good pastors left. . .very, very few.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a reason the remnant is not large!
             </p>
             <p>
              These pastors who signed that deal with Baa;. . .that 501c3 so the government Controls What they say and do, They Best get rid of it or get ready for Exposure!

              I am still shocked to have found that.  What really piqued my interest right away was that last name.  Racine.  I thought, No, that can't be, let me look.  Then OH MY.  Haiti?  As I looked and read I became even more shocked. Yes, this is truly sickening and so are they.  They think they have pulled the wool over our eyes.  We must spread the word.  I am now wondering about the other Investigators of other Diocese and if they really have their hearts in the right place.  This guy is no Josh Shapiro.

                  Chicago is a sure joke.  Rahm and his supporters and Cupich with all the Catholic pols there.  OH. I can't wait to see what I can find.   Here is a joke I found while just researching Bill C.

                    hoped to be. People need to do their research before 2016 arrives. The mysterious deaths of 52 people in the Clinton circle of friends and associates, should be fair warning that these people are not the good old folks they pretend to be. America could fix it’s own problems if left alone, but put a narcissist like Hillary in power and watch the problems grow and multiply. SHE WANTS TO CONTROL YOU! THIS IS NOT ABOUT MONEY! IT IS PURELY ABOUT POWER!!!

                       Sorry, had to go do soup for the fam.  Ive always said I wished they would just eat the freeze dried packets, you know, like the ones you get from Alamogordo when you're a kid, like at Holloman AFB.

                       This surely happened to hide her true heritage while putting her into positions of power.

                    Hold on to your hat.  Speaking of mob families, I just found a lulu.

                   <p>
                    Lisa Madigan I thought from other info, was the daughter of Michael Madigan the big wheeler dealer in Illinois for the Dem Party.  WELL.  Look at this.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Madigan was born Lisa Murray. She changed her name when she was 18 and was formally adopted in her 20s by Michael Madigan.[17][18] Madigan is married to cartoonist Pat Byrnes, and they have two daughters.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    WHAT?  Who adopts someone when the person is 20 and she is NOT even his daughter?  She was born Lisa Murray.  Now look at this.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    She  is the daughter of mobster Joel Murray.  Jewish.  This is amazing.   Read the article.  I am in shock.  She claims to be daughter of Mike Madigan and to be Irish.  WOW.
How are we suppose to believe what she comes up with when she is mob related.  I can't even.

To get ahead —- some employers are more kind towards Hispanics for example.  Promote them faster
To become closer to someone.   Maybe she feels he’s more of a dad than her own.

                      I feel a little sorry for some, they think they are really helping people.  They don't think these pols could be so evil.  But then they are playing right into their hands and keep it all going.  When will the Bleep hit the fan?  I am hoping it all comes crashing down.  They will be stunned out of their gourds.

                       I have gotten pretty frustrated with those who shouldn't put the blinders on.

                       It actually seems to be those who are not the super elite, but those who have means and live quite comfortably, so think the world is such a great place, with just a little bit of isolated evil.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       They have had Plenty of time and opportunities to search and read information for themselves, but refuse, because the world is Great for them, so who cares if other things are going on that don't directly affect them.  Their goo, having fun, taking their trips, "living in the moment," all while others are struggling and worse. . .being abused and tortured.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I want to shout at them, but I don't of course.  I want to yell and take out their ear plugs, tell them that It Will affect their children's children.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       They should think Beyond their own, little safe or what they perceive as safe, circle!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I waver between feeling angry at their self-indulgence and being so egocentric, to feeling bad that they may not be able to protect their own children and grand children for lack of knowledge or lack of willingness to stop buying into all the readily available distractions and get some truth!  It's there for the taking.  They simply prefer the self indulging.  Back to maddening Again!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Do you think Even when confronted with the brunt of it all they will ever admit it?  I feel for many, Pride will Still keep them from admitting there were huge crimes against the innocent the preferred to ignore.

                        I feel just about the same way as you do.  Thanks for your sincerity.  I think some tune it out because they can't handle it.  They don't want to believe it. I think they can't believe that people could be so evil.  Who would do that?  But then I get enraged again because They hear of so many horrid crimes through  msm, soc. media, etc.  Why can't they believe it?  I think they do not want to believe that the people THEY have voted for, donated to and campaigned for all those years, are doing such heinous things.  I will be spending Thanksgiving with a few of these people and it will take all I have to get through it.  Gritting My Teeth.  AARRGGHH!!!

You didn’t mention that Hillary’s dad was in the Chicago Mafia, one of the reason’s Bill Married Her.

                       Of course one of the Share Blue paid trolls gave him their typical name calling rhetoric they all pull, even on other platforms on here, but the article didn't seem to want to mention Tyler's info.
