<p>The poster name was in quotes but not the word poster itself. I clicked on Google Images and started looking. </p>
<p>I didn\'t find the poster, but 13 clicks down, I found the photo of a young girl who was shirtless, in her underwear, and wearing a fuzzy bunny costume on her head. She looks uncomfortable, as if she\'s cold because she has her arms wrapped around herself, and like she might be about to cry. The Google description says, &quot;Charlotte P,  and identifies the photo as being from a Yelp.com page of a New Orleans restaurant called Arabella Casa Di Pasta. I looked at their reviews and all the photos I could find, but that photo didn\'t turn up.</p>

<p>I have to think that this restaurant might very well not be involved in anything illegal. We don\'t know what it means that this photo is connected to them somehow. It may mean nothing. But it has made me wonder if restaurants, including Italian restaurants, should also be kept in mind in regards to pizzagate.</p>
<p>And any ideas about how that photo would turn up in Google as being from that yelp page, but wouldn\'t appear once someone went there?</p>
<p>This is the Google search results page with the image. I blurred out the girl\'s chest area somewhat because she seems to be developing a bit, or perhaps is suffering from poor nutrition, as she seems too young to be near puberty. </p>

            Here is a URL for one of the Arabella Casa photos, from their yelp page:
            <a href="https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VdGkgHHfzWO92bfy3R1uDA/o.jpg">
             https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VdGkgHHfzWO92bfy3R1uDA/o.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And here is the URL for the pic of the girl:
            <a href="https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/d2pKpJ2a3TI97hex2CzDwA/o.jpg">
             https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/d2pKpJ2a3TI97hex2CzDwA/o.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice the very similar URLs - it seems as though the girl photo was at some stage, part of the photo album on their yelp page! Whether it was by accident or not, it has since been deleted... maybe recently.
           </p>
           <p>
            Im not sure of the difference between bphoto and buphoto.. perhaps restaurant uploaded vs user uploaded.

             From doing a little more digging, I've discovered that the girl is almost certainly the daughter of the restaurant's owners - which doesn't explain why they'd take that sort of picture of her that seemed to accidentally end up on Yelp. Here she is at the restaurant, at night, with a stripper (from her mother's Instagram account):

            </p>
            <p>
             From the Yelp reviews, I thought Arabella was just an Italian restaurant, a family restaurant people went to for the food, but someone posted its Instagram account, and it's more in line with Comet Ping Pong's philosophy, it seems. It hosts dark shows with strippers and Satanic imagery.

            Could it be that the restaurant is just a restaurant, and that some pedo latched onto the word "pasta" and posted the child's pic? I mean, these people are sick in the head. Apparently, they love humiliating their own children. Just look at that gargoyle Luzzatto throwing her step grandchildren into the heated pool.

             It could be. Perhaps there are some people here who know more about what the possibilities might be.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems strange that the photo doesn't show up on the yelp page.
            </p>
            <p>
             And about the photo itself, I just noticed that there's a blanket on the chair behind the girl with stars and a moon on it - suggestions of Satanism, which turn up again and again in pizzagate. That seems like it very well might not be coincidental.

              Could very well be. Did you do a Tineye image search on it? Or on the name? If you go into the "Source" can you see what the picture is labeled? Don't know what to say to help you find it. Oh, maybe search for that person on Yelp? Or Instagram? It gets very frustrating tracking things down.

                Go to Tineye, load the pic and it will search for the same pic and show you if there's a match somewhere. I think there might be a better one, but that's the one I know of. I'd just go on Instagram or Tumblr--and definitely Yelp-- and see if you can find a user match. You never know.

                 But I discovered more about the restaurant, and it seems virtually certain that the girl is the owners' daughter. From the mother's Instagram account:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Rather than being a family friendly restaurant people go to for the food, it also hosts strippers and Satanic imagery, in the mode of Comet Pizza.

                 And none of that explains why they'd take such a photo of their daughter.

                  Yeah, there's a lot of bad parenting and then there's outright grooming children for things. Don't know what's happening here, but you've made a good start.
