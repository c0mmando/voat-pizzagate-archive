<p>The Watchtower Society has an established &quot;Watchtower Pedophile Policy&quot; that provides detail regarding how JW are instructed to deal with child abusers and pedophiles.

It is the main legal entity used worldwide by JW to direct, administer, and disseminate doctrines for the group and is often referred to by members as &quot;The Society.&quot;</p>
<p>Pedophilia court cases have been difficult to litigate.  Most of them are settled out of court with &quot;gag&quot; clauses so the public is unable to obtain full details.  Because of the difficulty with litigation, a legal hanbook was created called &quot;Jehovah\'s Witness and Sex Abuse - A Brief Handbook For Attorneys and Other Legal Professionals.&quot;  This handbook was created to &quot;help better understand the challenges in dealing with Jehovah Witnesses in litigating, addressing, and treating matters of child sexual abuse.&quot;  
</p>
<p>The JW has something that is called &quot;The Two Witness Rule,&quot; meaning that a second witness is required to the incident before they will remove an accused pedophile from their congregation.  Here are JW most up-to-date instructions:</p>
<p>&quot;There must be 2 or 3 eyewitnesses, not just people repeating hearsay; no action can be taken if there is only 1 witness.  If the accuser or accused is unwilling to meet with the elders or if the accused continues to deny the accusation of a single witness and the wrongdoing is not established, the elders will leave matters in Jehovah\'s hands.&quot;</p>

            Don't forget about the Mormons. Mormon fundamentalists are the visible part (

             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_Freemasonry
            </a>
            . There are many obvious religious ties between the Mormons and the Gnostics, but until I learned that Smith was a Freemason, I didn't understand how that occurred.

            I wish this religion was Pizzagate material. They have a lot of fucked up policies that have really come to light over time - the big one being what you mentioned with regards the 'two witness rule'. They also refuse to accept blood transfusions this day and age. You are encouraged to die for the religion (God) before you accept one.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have a lot of members, but they are struggling  with the advent of the internet and people being able to do their homework nowadays.

            Most of their growth comes from places other than NA.

            Great research.  Unfortunately, JW is just one of the many religious organizations that take similar approaches to child abuse.  Their concern seems never to be about the welfare of the child but is instead focused on protecting the adult.  Authorities have maintained a hands-off stance for the most part when dealing with abuses perpetrated under the guise of religious beliefs.  Of course laws governing abuse need to be enforced regardless of religious considerations, but the Dept. of Justice turns a blind eye when this doesn't happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Part of the problem lies with elected District Attorneys who want to be re-elected and therefore do whatever they can to increase their conviction rates, including choosing not to prosecute difficult cases, plea dealing down to meaningless sentences, handing out probation-only sentences or trading guilty pleas for community service or therapy instead of prison time--anything to bump up their conviction rate and give them something to compaign on in the next election.

              Mormons are crypto Jews, just like the Jewsuits.  And the Freemasons.

              The JW's have a group of guys that "run the show". They are referred to as 'the governing body'.  No one really knows who they are controlled by, but most feel that they are the ones calling the shots. They have a lot of fucked up policies.
