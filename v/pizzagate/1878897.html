The actuality of who really cares about any of us in the end is shone a light upon here, and although it does not answer the many questions that it throws up regarding the crimes, it does raise the profiles of not just one, but two vicious killings, and will hopefully give further voice to those that were either silenced or masked at the time, and so this is also the story of people trying to regain their personal and collective sense of empowerment from those who would, and have, taken this from them.</p>

            After watching it, I now hate Catholic church even more. Its a satanic occult, heavily veiled in Christianity and wallowing in a cesspool of its own cover-ups.

            Worth sharing, especially for the people who refuse to believe in cover ups in general. Might be a good "first step" for red pilling those who doesn't wnat to hear the word "pizzagate" - Maybe after watching they might at least listen. Thanks for sharing. I'm worried this will disappear, however, due to rule 1.
