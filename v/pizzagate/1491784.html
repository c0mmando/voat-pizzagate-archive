<p>Her family has been around a long time, with a dark, disturbing past.    Her family comes from the right area of Europe that practically invented the Vampire myth....which got me thinking about vampires in general.  Vampires are folklore that have existed in almost every culture, and they\'re usually described as very wealthy, powerful, VERY OLD, and dark hair/features.   I know Jews tend to be relatively wealthy and powerful, especially in hollywood and our government.  To be clear, I don\'t hate Jewish people at all.  I have Jewish friends, and I tend to view all reglion as BS so I don\'t really care what you believe.  Anyway; so then I found these websites:</p>

<p>Far out, right?  I know, I know.  But dig into a bit.  
</p>
<p>&quot;As mentioned, the belief in blood drinking demonic beings seems universal and is present in all ancient cultures. The iron toothed “asanbosam” of the African Ashanti is avampiric being that hunts people from trees. The Chinese “pinyin” kills the living byrobbing them of their life essence. The Philippinese “Mandurugo,” the Malaysian“Pennanggallan,” the Indonesian “Leyak” prey on pregnant women or their children. InIndia, the goddess Kali is linked to the drinking of blood, and the vetalas are undeadghouls who possess bodies. The Colombian “Tunda” and the “Soucouyant” of Trinidadare female monsters while the Aztec “Cihuateteo,” the spirits of those who died inchildbirth, steal children and drive the living insane by seducing them.The ancient Persians depicted blood drinking demons on pottery. The Babyloniangoddess Lamashtu is described as a “flesh eating, blood sucking monster” that preys on pregnant women, drinks the blood of newborn babies and eats them. The relatedBabylonian and/or Sumerian myth of Lilitu, which is at the origin of the Jewish myth of Lilith, also describes a female sexual predator, a demon who feeds on the blood of babies.In Greek mythology, Lamia feeds on sleeping children, and Empusa seduces men beforedrinking their blood. In Roman mythology the strix (from the Greek striges) are theundead; the Romanian “strigoi” are their direct descendants&quot;</p>
<p>(sorry for the formatting I copied/pasted)</p>
<p>So how does this get to Jews?</p>
<p>&quot;The connection between Jews and blood can be traced back to the blood curse inMatthew 27: 24-25 “His blood be on us and our children” which constitutes the basis for  blood libel: the accusation of human sacrifice performed for obtaining the blood of thevictim for ritual purposes. The function of the blood libel is to validate and maintain coreanti-Semitic beliefs (Dan, 2008). Accusations of blood libel against the Jews precedeChristianity: Apion of Alexandria accused the Jews of annually fattening a Greek in theTemple to offer his body as a sacrifice, and certainly there is a history of Islamic bloodlibel (Amasya 1545, Damascus 1840, Rhodes 1840), but the accusations of blood libelstarted proliferating in Europe after the 12th century. Typically the unexplained death or the disappearance of a Christian child was followed by the accusation that the Jewsmurdered the child in a re-enactment of the crucifixion, and collected the blood to beused as an essential component of the Passover Matzoth&quot;</p>
<p>Wow.  I never heard ANY of this before.  But let\'s see here:  Missing CHILDREN, a focus on blood, and jews.  Interesting.  Check out some of these images:</p>

<p>Now this seems super far out there, right?  But get this, even Ben-fucking-Franklin thought jews were vampires:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Prophecy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Prophecy</a></p>
<p>&quot;If they are not expelled from the United States by the Constitution within less than one hundred years, they will stream into this country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us and change our form of Government for which we Americans shed our blood and sacrificed our life, property and personal freedom. If the Jews are not excluded within two hundred years, our children will be working in the field to feed Jews while they remain in the counting houses, gleefully rubbing their hands.&quot;</p>
<p>WOW.  I never heard about this in History class.  And somewhere in the comments of these threads here on voat, someone mentioned this that recently, scientists have discovered that the blood of young mice rejuvinate older mice, and eliminate their ailments:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-rejuvenated-old-mice-with-the-blood-of-human-teenagers">http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-rejuvenated-old-mice-with-the-blood-of-human-teenagers</a>

<p>So my question, readers, is what do the rich and powerful want more than anything else in the world?  They already have power, and wealth...  TIME.  Think how profitable it would be if you could extend your life.   If you could bank up cash, reverse your age 30 years, get a new identity, and start somewhere else rich, would you do it?  Probably.   Now think how desirable this is.  People would be willing to do almost anything for it, yes, even eat children or drink blood.</p>
<p>My hypothesis:  Jewish or not, if people drink the blood of children and eat their organs, it will turn back the clock a bit.  It\'s very expensive and VERY damning, but the rich and powerful take part in this regardless of religious orientation.  Think of the demand here.  If you had a network to snatch unwanted children and use them for your own perversion, then sell them to people who would eat them for a TON of money, the pedophiles an the life extension people would be working together.</p>
<p>I admit this is a super, super tin foily theory.   But after seeing some of the imagery of cannibalism at Comet, this is where I\'m at.  Thoughts?  Am I totally off the deep end or is it possible this is what Phase 3 was all about?</p>',

            It's definitely a rejuvenation they are looking for, but it's organ and blood products transplants. The business of organ harvesting for money is a separate issue from the ritual.  You have to separate from that theory or just stick with satanic ritualism and what it entails, Actually . it's a very small part of child exploitation.

            I know a lot of people might be cool with all of this for the sake of longevity.  But this would be a difficult lifestyle to keep hidden all the time.  What does the elite do when they're out on the town and can't drink blood or eat human flesh?

             I'm thinking they don't need to do it that often.  If you don't eat/drink young blood, you age normally.  If you do, it slows it down.  If you really go nuts and consume a lot maybe it reverses.  Just a guess.

            I'm half Jewish. I'm 1/4 German. I'm 1/4 Anglo. I have Jewish priests, KKK and freemasons in my lineage.  My German side of the family came from the black forest region of the Rhineland.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe you have some of it right, as did Franklin, but this is in no way limited to the Jews. Add with many conspiracies, one side demonizes another to take the focus off of their side. There is a ladder or pyramid for pretty much all races/religions.  These stories are overblown to mask the truth. With all due respect, although I think all of this does have a pedophilia aspect, it's not as big out as primary as the underlying truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm in the middle of trying to lay all this out in a coherent way.  You can read back through my comments for some of the picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything ties together. Religion, witchcraft, the illuminati. Aliens. I'm trying to build my narrative in a gradient from 'things I'm pretty sure about' to 'pure conjecture' but there is no question there is a convergence/awakening/unveiling happening, and it's on multiple levels. I will not be hiding behind anonymity when I publish.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't believe you are entirely off base, but there is a reason for the success of the Jews over time and frankly much of it is'legit' if blindly biased.  However, I am POSITIVE that all branches of humanity have their own ladders/hierarchies/magic and it looks different for each tower.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe it's even possible there was an agreement not to mix races/cultures at some point... Ands this is one of the reasons everything is changing.
           </p>

            Hillary is one kind of Witch and trump is a different kind. Both are powerful and dangerous, IMO.

            There are several threads about th Coloboma and how the blood of a person with that is different, possibly life extending. Also Soros and a lot of baby pics on Insta had Colobomas. See

            It's already kind of become an accepted fact here that these ppl are into various occult shit which means their inspirations and traditions aren't random but come from the past. Who knows who the first asshole was to be convinced the voice of a demon told him killing kids and drinking blood was awesome and gives you power, we know from high school social studies that the Mayans did it though and they were pretty far from Jewish. That said, the whistleblowers I've heard come out about the Satanic shit all said the groups tend to promote to their members that their "religion" goes back to like ancient Egypt or farther etc so either 1. It does or 2. Somewhere along the way a bunch of white ppl decided "ooh let's try that" after researching fucked up religious/ritual practices and fashioned their own whatever around it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll admit though, when the blood thing with the mice came up in the other thread I couldn't help being reminded of Lady Gaga's Countess character in American Horror Story -Hotel with the stockpile of little blond kid blood and immediately pictured David Rockefeller's multiple heart having ass somewhere getting transfusions.

            Prion disease (mad cow, kuru, creutzfeld-jakob) can be transmitted by eating an infected person (as well as cattle, etc).  There is somewhat of a coverup going on regarding the prevalence of the disease and transmission routes.   It was theorized that Hillary may have had  a type of prions disease due to her symptoms (obviously we don't know any info regarding all of her health problems).

             Interesting, haven't heard that before, thanks.  What do you think of the vampires drinking blood / anybody drinking blood theory?  What if that's it?  What if the rich/powerful are trying to stay young?  And more importantly... what if it actually works?

              Drinking blood of a (scared/exited) person supposedly gives people a rush/high from the adrenaline and other chemicals released when a person is excited.  Blood from a young person is supposed to slow the aging process, as they've shown in mice via embryonic stem cells, this is likely the source of claims about vampires:

              Marina Abramovic is 70 years old for example, I can't prove she drinks human child blood, but she does partake in spirit cooking....
              <br/>
              And here is a link to info on sacrifices:
              <a href="http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/jewish_sacrifice.htm">
               http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/jewish_sacrifice.htm
              </a>
              and consider this... when people go to church (christians) they do practice mock cannibilism by eating the cracker and wine/grape juice.  It is an abrahamic religion after all.

            My opinion is, they definitely think they are some supernatural beings. You can call them wizards, vampires, mutants or whatever. You have a world of muggles that dont really live, only exist, and a hidden society of special people.
