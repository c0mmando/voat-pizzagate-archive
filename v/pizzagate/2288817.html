<p>Of course, the Lord\'s Prayer is a subject of recent interest because Pope Francis, on Dec. <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/theology/does-god-lead-us-sin-new-french-our-father-says-no">5, praised the French Bishops\' </a>decision to change the Our Father in the Mass. Pope Francis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The new French translation says &quot;don\'t let me fall into temptation. It\'s me who falls. It\'s not Him who pushes me into temptation, as if I fell. A father doesn\'t do that. A father helps you to get up right away. The one who leads into temptation is Satan.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from the fact that this is a primitive, faulty and limited interpretation of the Our Father, ignoring centuries of commentary by the Fathers of the Church and multiple saints on Jesus\' prayer, the sentence that is most important is the last: &quot;The one who leads into temptation is Satan.&quot; </p>
<p>This contradicts the teaching from the very beginning by the Fathers of the Church, who had closest access to the apostolic age and the oral traditions and manuscripts.<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/268/7/2.html"> St. Augustine affirms that it is indeed God who allows us to be tested</a>, who wills that we be proven in the fire of temptation, just like God did with Abraham in the Book of Genesis when<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac"> He led Abraham to Mount Moriah </a>and commands him to sacrifice his beloved son, though at the last moment, a ram is provided as a substitute. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.&quot; Genesis 22:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Augustine uses as his primary source Deuteronomy 13:3 which says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;\'You must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul, or not.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Yet another passage from the Bible which corroborate that God tests us, not Satan: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Moses said to the people, &quot;Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.&quot; (Exodus 20:20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A CLOSER LOOK AT DEUTERNOMY 12:29 -13:3</p>
<p>So, how does this relate to Q? If we read the entire passage of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+12-13&amp;version=NIV">Deuteronomy 12-13</a> which St. Augustine cites as his proof that God tests us, we find a most astonishing correlation with the current geopolitical situation and our own battle here on Voat with the Pizzagate controversy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>29 The Lord your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land, 30 and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same.” 31 <strong>You must not worship the Lord your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the Lord hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.</strong> (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>32 See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.</p>
<p>13 ]If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a sign or wonder, 2 and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, “Let us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,” 3 you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. 4 It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. 5 That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. That prophet or dreamer tried to turn you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is warning the Chosen People not to have anything to do with the pagans and evildoers whose lands they take in conquest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You must not worship the Lord your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the Lord hates.<strong>They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods</strong>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PETTY THEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT OR A SIGN OF SOMETHING MORE SINISTER?</p>
<p>Many people might tend to think the Pope is correct when he says, &quot;The one who leads us into temptation is Satan.&quot; which is a personal theological opinion of the Pope and not defined Catholic teaching. I would dare say, though, after reading several Biblical commentaries by the Fathers of the Church, that the consensus among the Fathers of the Church and saints is the exact opposite. </p>
<p>Why does it matter? If we say Satan leads us into temptation, perhaps we give more power to Satan who would then seem to have the power to control our lives and set up situations for us to fall into, whereas if we say it is God who allows us to be tested and even wills that we be tested sometimes, then we are acknowledging Him as having the ultimate control and power over His creation, and not Satan. Maybe that isn\'t correct; that\'s just my opinion.</p>
<p>It doesn\'t seem to be a coincidence that this discussion has popped up a few days after the brave SRA survivor from Philadelphia came out on Voat with her grisly story of being ritually abused by priests and clerics at St. Charles Seminary, and esp, her testimony that babies were being burned in incinerators in the 1960\'s. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2281855">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2281855</a></p>

<p>As tempting as it might be to say it doesn\'t really matter if it is God who tempts us, or Satan, I would venture to posit that it does indeed matter, and that ideas have consequences. It may seem of  little moment if a  handful of ancient scholars contradict the Pope\'s statement, but I believe his quasi-heretical, if not overtly heretical, statement does indeed have great significance because it might mean that the Pope may believe Satan has primacy over our lives, and not God.</p>',

            So a couple things here...the original bible is the kind james version. That is the only version you should read as a Christian. Even then to fully understand you need a strongs cordienece with Hebrew. Because Hebrew has several meanings sometimes for word (such a love, agope...means a different type of love then the other Greek word. So when you read a scripture and truly want to know it's meaning, look up which Hebrew word the writer actually intended.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, Read Job. Satan had to ask permission from god to tempt job, because job was found worthy. (When you sin, you invite in temptation ...) the Bible says God does not tempt you to sin also. So it's comlicated...but most likely means we open a gate way. Christians need to fully understand, as the Bible states, Satan has no power over you. Unless you involve yourself and don't repent.

            Lastly, any change in gods word is from the devil. God said his word is living and breathing, and Satan knows of he perverts it ...he can't lead you away from the power that is there.
           </p>
           <p>
            God will never cause you to sin, and he doesn't allow people to hurt children. Man has free will. He gave a way to save man. But man has that choice...and he said while on earth Satan is roaming around around to kill, steal and distroy, but his time is limited.

            Typical psychopathic abuse is to convince the victim that it is their own fault. Before the change, outside forces tempted us. After the change its like 'fingers crossed that I don't enter into temptation of my own volition'. I bet this works great to groom the kids. SICK.

            This alteration of the Lord's Prayer is pretty small beer. The proposed wording is a change of emphasis - nobody's belief-system is going to be shattered by this change - not like one of the Vatican 2 reforms in the 1960s (e.g. abolition of Latin Mass) which did shake the 'faithful' up. 
The Devil can - and often does - cite scripture ... You're making another mountain out of another Q molehill.

             Thanks so much for your comments. It may be that "Q" is a larp, but it's stunning to me that he/she would pick up on the current Lord's prayer controversy which is just about the last straw for many Catholics I know. It's the last in a long line of innovations by this pope that are very troubling, and the more one digs into the wording change, the more disastrous implications emerge.
            </p>
            <p>
             Apropos the I would the liturgical changes, I would posit that they helped prepare the way for the present theological devolution by this pope. As you pray, so you believe. Lex orandi legem credendi statuat.

             It's only a change of a few words, but it's a symptom of a thorny question in theology called the synoptic problem. Christianity doesn't have a robust solution to the synoptic problem, so it falls back to the Church Fathers for basic doctrine. In Christianity Christ identifies as the truth, so the existence of the synoptic problem means that the church is mediator between man and the truth of deity. Given the historical close relationship between the church and state and the state's interest in maintaining power, this isn't a great situation for Christians.

           <p>
            The first problem here is that testing and temptation are not the same thing. The second is that in modern language the word "allow" is used to describe causation or capability rather than permission. The third is that Augustine believed in the Trinitarian idea of "one essence, three persons", and that idea is incompatible with the Biblical description of Elohim (Elohim is translated as "God" in the Bible).
           </p>
           <p>
            To cut to the chase: YHWH tests but does not tempt, if the test isn't passed the he may act as an adversary, Elohim will sometimes lead people into temptation, and Satan is a title, not a proper name.

             Thanks for your comment. Very good point about "testing" and "temptation", although there is this passage in Genesis
            </p>
            <p>
             "And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am." Genesis 22:1
            </p>
            <p>
             When I have time later on today, I'll look up St. Augustine's commentary on this verse.

              You're welcome. To understand Genesis 22:1 you've got to distinguish between Elohim and YHWH, as the verse is talking about Elohim. Also, the Quran (Surah 37:102) talks about the idea to sacrifice his son originating in a dream.

            One thing I have learned is that the Bible has been through many transformations and today's Bible is not an original word for word document that comes from something original set in stone thousands of years ago. I can't give you a link that will prove it because understanding this takes much reading from many sources and a lot of time.
           </p>

           <p>
            The Bible derives it's passages from several sources written down by humans.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            An interpretation that tells me that a loving God created a global satanic pedophile ring that tortures children to test my faith in God to see if I would yield to temptation is not something I can believe in. That seems the inverse of something a loving God would do.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Some people are also attempting to interpret taking Palestine and Jerusalem from away from true Palestenian semites and giving it to Talmudic Jesus haters as a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The teachings attributed to Jesus would not agree with this and neither do I.

              I hope its mainly voat and does not spread. There is a strong trend in getting people to trust Freemasons going around like a virus. It needs to stop because I don't think some people understand who they are being lured into trusting, and some of it is also shills I think.

               The disinfo masons need to mix up their cover story too. "Truther" masons talk about the esoteric stuff but when mentioning the masons they all give, almost word for word the same each time, the canned response that the freemasons is a just fun drinking club for old dudes, which is it is for most, but is obviously BS when you see how many masons and other robe wearing faps are in key positions.

            Does God tempt us or Satan?
           </p>
           <p>
            I applaud your post ...The Pope is dispenser of false doctrines...the church refuses to accept the sovereignty of God and  constantly slanders His name.
           </p>
           <p>
            the question cannot be answered unless you have a biblical understanding of who God says He is . If God declares Himself to be all- knowing ,all-powerful ,love ,wisdom and Creator of all things...
           </p>
           <p>
            Isaiah 45:7 I form the light and create darkness I make peace and create evil ,I the Lord do all these things.
           </p>
           <p>
            then all things that happens must occur do to His love and direction( even pedophilia, I know tough ,one to get by but you have to believe in a SOVEREIGN God of love    )
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would God hav e to "tempt " man to find out what is in him ?
           </p>
           <p>
            God already knows what is in man (God creates and forms man as the clay is formed by the Potter)
But ...man is "tempted" to sin ? 
Man is "tempted to sin because he was created flesh(sin ,naked, carnal) he was born under the law of sin and death)ROMANs 8:2)....  he is subject to the lust of the flesh ,the lust of the eyes and the  pride of life...this condition is  inherit in his flesh(IJOHN 2;16) this is the world that God has created...God is not tempted by EVIL for He is it s creator and  purposes it .  Man is "tempted"  by what he is ... JAMES1:14 let no man say when he is "tempted",that. " God is tempting me", fo r God cannot be tempted by evil, NOR DOES HE TEMPT ANYONE( God already knows what man will do he needs not to tempt man to find out what is in him...  God is directing him as Sons or as tools) but each man is tempted by his OWN EVIL DESIRES and enticed.
           </p>
           <p>
            God creates all things
God controls all things
God controls satan
God controls man
           </p>
           <p>
            God has made man a prisoner of his flesh consumed by his passions and lusts,Man is sin born into Adam.... dying thou shalt die .
           </p>
           <p>
            God has created His adversary ...we wrestle not with flesh and blood but with principalities  against powers ,against rulers of darkness in this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places(our minds)
           </p>
           <p>
            These spirits(evil) invade our minds and cause us to think a certain way and act upon those thoughts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hence , we(man) sins do to the corrupted ,weak, flesh  which becomes fertile grounds for spirits which invade our thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            God is spirit ..He is not flesh and not tempted neither is His spirit which is sent in man to dwell and fight the good fight over our BEAST nature and the dragon(satan) which rides upon the beast(man)
           </p>
           <p>
            Man gives an account to God for the deeds done is his body(pedophilia) this act motivated by seducing spirits must be eradicated ..God will not allow such a spirit to inhabit His creation...The FIRE of God's word is "a consuming fire" which burns out all the lies of the adversary and gives us power over th e "beast" our carnal nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            This carnal nature which runs unchecked and easily manipulated by spirits, beyond its keen, will fall into temptation and lusts..pedophilia,murder,theft,etc...

             I believe God allows Satan to test us, sure. Anything Satan does is allowed by God as God is the more powerful of the two. The Bible assures us that while Satan hates us and tempts us for his own purposes, God keeps him on a proverbial leash. The Bible also assures us that God makes all things work together for the good of those that love Him. Secondly God took the form of a human, cut himself off (mostly) from his divine powers, allowed his frail human form to feel pain and temptation, and offered himself up as a sacrifice for our sins all to make a way out. He cannot overlook sin due to his attributes of perfect justice and truth, but He always throws a lifeline to us because of His mercy. Thank God for God! ☺ But we have to choose to grab on....

              Thanks for sharing your opinion.....but for God to sovereign He must have total control of all things which transpire in His creation. Nothing can enter or effect His creation without His design and purpose.
I understand man wants  to blame Satan or man for what happens. Attributing evil to " free will" but God does not slight His responsibility to His creation.
The hard truth is ,and few there be that find it, is that we ,mankind, are all the "chief of sinners" ..all mankind has the potential of all sin within them..  Podesta , Clintons, Pelosi, Biden ,Spacey, Bundy,Gacy,Manson, are products of th e flesh we all inhabit...we all have been given certain circumstance which define our lives and form who we become...no one is immune from the experiences which shape them.
             </p>
             <p>
              we are to give God an "account" of the things done in our body....we did not create the things we have done  in our body ..GOD DID..God is the Potter we are the clay
That includes our "choice" to choose HIM.. This is out of God as well as all things are..
             </p>
             <p>
              we ,as members of Adam(flesh), simply do not posses the ability to "choose" God. There is no good thing in our flesh only darkness.
             </p>
             <p>
              The light must penetrate the darkness...it is God not of us

               Nothing I said implies that we the sinners do not bear responsibility for our actions. I'm in full agreement with that. The rest of the stuff you are saying sounds suspiciously like the trash about predestination that the Jehovah's Witnesses peddle door to door. Those guys are bad news. The sexual abuse of children and incest is rife within that organization and let's not forget the fact that they've predicted the return of Christ how many times since the early 1900s now?

                the false doctrine of JW,Mormons ,Calvinists is made all to apparent by their crimes which follow them..Cavlin reveled in the death of people who disagreed with his theology yet many follow his slandering of God bc it appeals to their flesh... I would hesitate with associating doctrine with denominations...all man's denominations .have errors.. God has set error ,in the church,to help us "come out of her my people"(Babylon)... the truth is thereby substantiated through our time in heresies.

               <p>
                when we recognize that all sin(of every man) lies potentially in us (that the words of the bible  are written to us) we are to  live by every word ... the battle is between or old man (adam) and the new man (Christ) battling within us... That this Battle is God 's not ours... if we do not recognize God's sovereignty in all things ,including our own wills,PROVERB 21:1 the kings heart is in the Lord's hands.as the rivers of water,He  directs it wherever it goes.

            Some do not. Those people will drag us into the arms of the zionist deep state and I will keep pointing it out since it seems to be spreading like a brain virus. Its pizzagate against the deep state, not pizzagate joins the deep state zionist republican party. I will keep repeating this.

              is right. Posts from Q like "POTUS is our savior. Pray." is pure statism, and Zionism is basically a statist ideology.

              You partner with the deep state if you want to. Pizzagate became a movement because it trusted NO political party. I will try to prevent the brain virus of trusting a zionist deep state from spreading.
