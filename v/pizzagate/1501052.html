            It's not just that, regardless of the actions of said person, Obama still has the ability to pardon anyone. However you can't pardon someone who hasn't be accused of anything. AKA if Obama were to blindly "pardon" Hillary for some unknown reason he would only be throwing himself under the bridge because it would be like saying "Ya I know she did something wrong and I excuse her for it." So if no on accuses or does anything to warrant a crime investigation til the inauguration, the Democrats lose that power to be pardoned.

            That glasses thing is nothing, and comes across really silly, it's just a reflection geez, come on! Or maybe she can focus on vertical lines that close to her eye without going cross eyed and also decipher what those lines mean in English.

            Are you suggesting smart glasses inside her frames.  I was thinking it could also just be a reflection of a teleprompter.

            FBI probably has not been in touch because it sort of awkward to visit with one of the key players in the coming Clinton Foundation RICO indictments.

             That's mainly the reason I posted it here, if he hasn't been contacted since then, maybe something is happening which he and we don't know about.
