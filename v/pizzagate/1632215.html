<p>I heard of pizzagate some time ago and did not follow it. However, I was reintroduced to the topic a few days ago. </p>
<p>PREFACE: I noticed that <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/INQLTLB4LWQ/maxresdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/INQLTLB4LWQ/maxresdefault.jpg</a> this photo was posted on James Alefantis’ Instagram but he does not look like James. I don’t recall anyone ever mentioning who that person is (in fact, who are any of them?).</p>
<p>NOTE: Some of this may have been covered, but I did not see it addressed. I am going to start from the beginning of my small discovery that may or may not have anything to do with anything.</p>
<p>START: Last night, I was browsing around for more information on this horrific theory and found that Comet Pizza’s “General Manager” John Bryce Reh still has a Facebook. I didn’t find anything of particular note on his, but something that was glaring to me was the Comet Pizza-esque drag queen at the top of his friends list when I went to his page.</p>
<p>That man is named Joshua Ryan Vogelsong, but most of his page is hidden to the public. I found his Twitter, <a href="https://voat.co/user/DJJoshuaRyan">@DJJoshuaRyan</a> and he retweets things from Comet Pizza. It looks like he hasn’t used this Twitter since 2015 and I didn’t go through all of the posts, but I found it strange that a grown homosexual man connected to this theory in some way would use an avatar of a young boy with heart sunglasses.</p>
<p>This got me wondering who else the general manager has associations with and I sifted through his friends list on Facebook. I didn’t do much digging, but I did find someone named Jim Ball <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jim.ball.980?pnref=friends.search">https://www.facebook.com/jim.ball.980?pnref=friends.search</a> – The only reason he stood out to me was because he is the owner of La Boum Brunch. I had never heard of this strange term until I started looking at people’s pizzagate discoveries, and I immediately recalled that Comet Pizza had used La Boum in their restaurant as some reference to sex. I started looking at his page. He owns “L’Efant Cafe and Bar” in Washington, D.C. That is a strange coincidence.</p>
<p>I did not go through all of his posts. I decided instead to look at his photos, trying to visually connect him to the picture that we all know of the man with the L’Efant shirt. Strangely, I found several pictures of this guy inside of the White House and with the Obamas. I find that a little odd, considering that just the other day Donald Trump had a bunch of business owners in the White House who are massive contributors to our society who had never been to the white house before, yet the owner of some sexually charged French restaurant gets to go. </p>
<p>NOTE: I did not thoroughly browse his friends list or his posts, but there may be something there of interest or note.</p>
<p>Anyway, what is this restaurant? I seen on their Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LEnfant-Cafe-Bar-84640147699/">https://www.facebook.com/LEnfant-Cafe-Bar-84640147699/)</a>) that they offer spankings for $5, but I did not look much into them either. Instead I looked into Laboumbrunch.com, which was so successful that they are getting another location called Capitale! It was 3:00 AM at this point, so I stopped looking too deeply but to me it appears that this place is just somewhere that you go to have sex in a room with some food. All of that may be fine, but is it worthy of a White House visit and photo-op and what does he have to do with Comet?</p>',

            Obama spent 8 yrs spending taxpayers money on lush vacations.  $65,000 in "hot dogs" and entertained many scrupulous "guests". 
All of this on the taxpayers dime.
