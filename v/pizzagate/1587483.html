<p>I\'ve researched Jeffrey Epstein for a while. I\'ll give you a brief overview of my Epstein knowledge below but feel free to ask questions. I thought it may help. I also recently came across something that I hadn\'t caught before...
Nadia Bjorlin\'s mother claims that Epstein tried to recruit a young Nadia at age 13.
<a href="http://archive.is/qKHpA">http://archive.is/qKHpA</a>
What I missed from this article was that she was at Interlochen in Michigan when they (Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell) tried to recruit her. I\'d never looked into an Interlochen connection but I found something... well a couple things... First is an article from a 1995 issue of log home living. It says that Epstein funded new guest quarters for interlochen center for the arts and that the new facilities: Interlochin Epstein lodge!
<a href="http://archive.is/7J65I">http://archive.is/7J65I</a>
Second, I began looking for other Epstein/Interlochen connections and was having trouble. Nadia Bjorlin’s mom has claimed that Epstein was a big donor there, but I couldn\'t find anything. Then I noticed an entry in his little black book that was for an Interlochin home. I\'d never noticed this entry in the black book before. It\'s a small entry that I guess I wasn\'t looking for. But I can\'t find evidence that Epstein owns any property in Interlochen, MI. I think the Interlochen house could be the Epstein lodge. Hopefully better investigators can find more in Interlochin.

<p>Nadia Bjorlin’s mom had said that Epstein tried to recruit Nadia unsuccessfully, but I found entries for her in his black book. There are 3 phone number entries for Nadia Bjorlin in his black book (see link above). Also, I looked through flight logs and there was a flight on January 1, 2005 with Nadia Bjorlin’s name on the flight manifest, but it is marked through as if she didn’t get on the plane and then they wrote Zinta Brown in her place. The flight was FROM TIST (Cyril E. King Airport) in the USVI going to NQPF (Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport) in Anguilla. Her name is marked through, but was she in the USVI? The people who actually were on this flight we JE(Jeffrey Epstein), JLB (Jean Luc Brunel), SK (Sarah Kellen), DM (Flew a lot. No idea who this is?), and NM (Nadia Marcinko).

<p>When I read the story of Jeffrey Epstein it stuck with me so I have been looking into it for some time. I was horrified. I didn’t know this stuff could happen and I wanted to look into. Now I’m seeing there’s much more to this picture (pizzagate) and it’s frightening.</p>
<p>Here\'s a summary of some of my other Epstein research….</p>
<p>Police in Palm Beach, Florida began investigating Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 after they got a call from the mother of a 14 year old girl who was paid to strip and massage Epstein at his Palm Beach home. What police found was horrifying. There were many young victims and a lot of them gave statements to police. The evidence was overwhelming: first hand accounts, witnesses, and evidence from Epstein\'s Florida home(pictures of the victims, details that corroborated the victims stories, etc.). Yet, prosecutors found that evidence to be weak and Epstein got a plea deal. He pled guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution for a girl as young as 14. He served 13 months in jail. He is a level three sex offender.

<p>Florida Police Video: <a href="http://archive.is/vL30z">http://archive.is/vL30z</a></p>
<p>Details of plea deal: The circumstances around the plea deal are cloudy. Quote from the article below: “An “extraordinarily lenient” deal with a wealthy Palm Beach financier”):
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/victims-feds-hid-sweetheart-deal-sex-offender-deep/story?id=36843144">http://abcnews.go.com/US/victims-feds-hid-sweetheart-deal-sex-offender-deep/story?id=36843144</a>
More info: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4703400&amp;page=1">http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4703400&amp;page=1</a></p>
<p>From the plea deal we know that Jeffrey Epstein and any co-conspirators cannot be federally charged for these crimes now. His plea deal is described as a “sweetheart deal” in more than one of the linked articles. Some of the victims are still in litigation because the details of the plea deal were not disclosed to them prior to the deal being signed and they have sued. Almost all documents are sealed.</p>
<p>This man has the history as a serial abuser of young girls so how did he get off so easy? Why weren\'t co-conspirators charged or why didn’t they atleast leave the option open. Primary co-conspirators that I have identified are Sarah Kellen (Sarah Kensington/Sarah Vickers), Ghislaine Maxwell and Jean Luc Brunel.

<p>Epstein’s story raises more questions than answers. What is the extent of Epstein\'s crimes? The young victims in Florida made some pretty horrific claims to detectives, like that Nada Marcinkova (Nadia Marcinko/Global Girl) was bought by Epstein from Eastern Europe when she was 15 (see Florida police report above). How do the Florida detectives (who worked 11 months on this case) feel about the outcome? Was there any proof that Epstein had purchased Nada or engaged in any other human trafficking?</p>
<p>** Another big question mark: What does Jeffrey Epstein do for a living? This one should be easy, but not so much. Here’s what I have been able to gather.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein</a></p>
<p>Epstein previously worked at Bear Stearns. Became a partner there in 1980. In 1982, he formed his own firm : J. Epstein &amp; Co. In 1996, he changed his company’s name to Financial Trust Company and based it on the island of St. Thomas in the USVI. He also runs the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation (see more info under charities below)</p>

<p>We don’t know much more about where he made all his money. In March 2003 (prior to the police investigation in Florida), there was a piece written in Vanity Fair about the mysterious Mr. Epstein.

<p>The author of this piece, Vicky Ward, later wrote an article for The Daily Beast and stated that she knew, and the people around Epstein knew, that he was a predator (see link below). Vicky Ward even interviewed victims and put reports of abuse in her Vanity Fair story, but Epstein denied allegations and Vanity Fair took the girls out of the story. How much does Vicki Ward know?
**Vicky Ward article 2: <a href="http://archive.is/4EbMj">http://archive.is/4EbMj</a></p>
<p>It is also notable that Epstein is a world traveler. He owns a plane and his own island in the USVI. He has homes in Palm Beach, Paris, New Mexico and New York as well. Are we really supposed to believe that he only abused girls when he was in Florida? His little black book tells us otherwise, with many names listed under &quot;massages&quot; in each city. I really don’t understand why weren\'t there other investigations in other cities? Does anyone know if he was ever investigated elsewhere?

Archive article looks weird. Here\'s the og source: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.curbed.com/platform/amp/2015/1/9/10004040/jeffrey-epstein-property-real-estate-holdings?client=safari">https://www.google.com/amp/www.curbed.com/platform/amp/2015/1/9/10004040/jeffrey-epstein-property-real-estate-holdings?client=safari</a></p>
<p>There is so much more to this story. So many sealed documents. So many people who could be interviewed. It really seems everyone around him knew what was going on and remained silent. Some continue to stand by Epstein to this day.</p>

           There is so much more to this story. So many sealed documents. So many people who could be interviewed. It really seems everyone around him knew what was going on and remained silent. Some continue to stand by Epstein to this day.

            Also one of Epstein's planes shared a tail number with a Dyncorp/State Dept. Plane. Dyncorp has a long history of documented sex abuse anf human trafficking instances as well.

            I would highly advise you watch George Webb's videos. Start around Day 80 and it will fill in more about Epstein. Epstein is rich bc he's a brownstone operator for Dyncorp. He stayed out of jail bc he has blackmail evidence on many important people who pressured prosecutors to make it go away. During his "jail sentence" he would come in in the evening to "check in" and then leave. There are over a 100 victims currently involved in lawsuit against him. All "Jane Does". Low energy Jeb was Gov of FL when this went down.

            I'm thinking he could be mossad or CIA and that he's the blackmailer in chief. I have zero proof, but he's the sketchiest character for sure!

             He has been picked as a M o5 5d agent before. The word was that his whole island was set up by M0s 5 ad for the express purpose of blackmailing people of influence. Sorry, I cannot put my hands on the reference right now.

            A deal was made and the documents were sealed and none of the victims were called forward, only informed of The final verdict on punishment after the fact and the records sealed.  I read that early on...

             Yes, sorry for the confusion. The victims rights case that is currently in litigation is due to the fact that the plea deal was signed without the victims knowledge.  The part that I didn't really understand was the Dershowitz/Wexler extortion charges. Someone shared an article that explains it pretty well.

            Few people in history have risen so fast financially with so little fanfare. He was an obscure math teacher, and now he is a billionaire with his own island. He is very near the heart of all this, otherwise they wouldn't have risked so much to protect him. Lets not forget that KEN STARR got him that sweet plea deal, and Bill Clinton is also an old friend. If that doesn't scream "Shadow Government", I don't know what does...

                His ex-butler Alfredo Rodriguez took the book for protection?evidece? And he served time because he wouldn't hand it over the book. He's dead and no one knows where the hard copy is. I read the doc many times and I think it's real.. my opinion is that it's too thorough and detailed for it to not be real. Names on flight records and names in the black book overlap.

            I am currently reading
            <em>
             Trafficking
            </em>
            by Conchita Sarnoff which is about Epstein.  In the book, it says 100 brave girls came forward and they only charged him on two counts.  His incarceration was a joke.  His girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who procured and had sex in threesomes with Epstein and the underage girls, left the country before she could be questioned.  She is in her home country of the UK heading a charity Terra Mar, which thankfully has nothing to do with children, I hope.

            **MC2 Models / Karin Models / Jean Luc Brunel
Owned by Jean Luc Brunel who flew with Epstein frequently (see flight logs).
According to what I’ve read online, there was a 60 Minutes profile on trafficking in the fashion industry with a focus on Jean Luc Brunel that aired in 1988, but I can’t find this anywhere.  Has anyone watched this?

            **Susan (Sue) Hamblin was on flight logs in 2003 &amp; 2004. She flew a lot. And she has also been photographed with Epstein fairly recently. She still looks fairly young, but I cannot find anything about this girl online so I don’t know how old she is/was. She flew with Jeffrey, Ghislaine, Nadia, Sarah, Jean Luc Brunel, etc.
