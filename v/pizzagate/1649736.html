            There is a wiki on this Robert dude, I kinda agree that Robert is always injecting himself into shit trying to get attention or troll... that's why I think he is trying to inject himself into worldcorp. So I sorta believe what pine tree said.. I haven't looked closely at it because quite honestly as soon as Roberts name came up i immediately thought it was bs...

            Thanks for all the information, everybody, much appreciated.
           </p>
           <p>
            My final take on this: The validity of this being a legitimate relation to Pizzagate as opposed to being a false path to occupy the time of investigators is potential, but not confirmed.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the event the information is accurate, I also get the feeling that this is the equivalent of investigating a single individual pedophile, which although absolutely worthwhile and honorable, is not my personal idea of the best way to spend time, giving the wide reaching scope of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will personally not choose to investigate this particular avenue further, but full respect and power to those that do, and best of luck in uncovering a landmine!

            He most certainly is somehow connected, identical account names of worldcorpo and robinson have been found, paired with a picture of him, while following worldcorpo on twitter. This account was created and active at a time long before this came to light. When I posted this here the account was quickly deleted. I'm not willing to draw any conclusion on the videos, it could be anything and not even his own material.

            Robinson liked a photo from CPP-  a pic of two boys standing next to ping pong tables.  It was in one of the first posts by the guy who did the image map thing.   There might be more by now.  That gave me a heads up - it was just a random guy and website until I knew that he specifically looked at what he could scope out at CPP and liked it.   Hope that helps.

               If that like was post-pizzagate it could very well be trolling, but if it was before pizzagate broke it would be at least a little suspicious.

             NO&gt; there is a you tube video of robert Robinson and he talks quite a bit.  Sounds NOTHING at all like the Father video.  He has a you tube channel and it was on one of the threads from a day ago.

            I agree in a general sense, but 'time' is a resource, and for the people on this forum using their time to investigate, I feel that weighing the seperate factors in where time should be invested is reasonable.
           </p>
           <p>
            For me, this is simply too 'loose' to support investigating myself, as I feel there is likely more 'concrete' threads to pull on.
           </p>
           <p>
            To be clear, not discrediting or disproving, just trying to get a good grasp on the potential legitimacy of the situation (or lack thereof) for personal assessment, that's all!

            Okay, so to summarize...
           </p>
           <p>
            1) The vidoes being examined have no source for who found them, and simply just showed up on the forum one day.
2) The person that has been connected to owning the Corporation is a nobody, who only is known among the VOAT community for the fact that he showed up in the Forums himself, as did a 'Neighbor' of his, to validate the narrative.
3) The person connected to the company (Robert Robinson) is confirmed as a social shit-disturber
           </p>
           <p>
            Point 1 seems off for how instensely this community logs information... I have an incredibly hard time believing that something this 'potentially' important has no sourcing...
           </p>
           <p>
            Point 2 and 3 speak to mass coincidence, which in the scope of potential efforts to provide disinformation to the community, places this in a very, very precarious position in regards to being able to be trusted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Taking the above into consideration, along with the fact that is all apparently completely up to conjecture, and.... While I can't disprove it by any means, I think it's fair to say no more time will be put into investigating this portion of the story.

            Myles - This thread is getting minimal traction, understandable given the heavy information flow on this forum.

           <p>
            As a result, reaching out individually - Do you happen to be aware of the linkage between previous investigation and this new arm relating to WorldCorpo?

             Again not true.  Robert Robinson was linked to both WorldCorp and he liked a CPP photos of two boys playing ping pong.  Search for the big post with the image map from a day ago.

              Sure please do show me, but knowing Robert he may be just trying to inject himself or troll himself in anything that gets him attention..... I suspect this, and that's why I still don't buy that his idiotic ass is involved. But if he is, he isn't the one THAT RUNS the site. I know how the dude is and heard the rumors of his connection, I just don't believe it's a real true connection. That freeking toofless pedo couldn't pull this off.... uh nope...

               lol fair enough, and points for humor I have to say.

              <p>
               I have to go, but I'll sum it up for me- something floating around that makes thousands of people chatter all over the place about Podesta being a pedo - ultimately I think it is good.   We may have actually gone past the tipping point where the public thinks "theres not a thing to it"  because the media says so.  There are discussion all over the place about pizzagate.  Most people accept that something is going on.  Awareness is rising.  By 4 now.

            </p>
            <p>
             This random, small level pedophile with a youtube channel no one knows about is linked to a Company that is loosely correlated to a video that does admittedly sound like John Podesta, with pieces of validity being offered by both the presence of this particular pedophile in the Voat community, along with a member (maybe multiple?) that claim to know this exact person.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of this together, handed over coincidentally in pieces, with such specific access of information stemming from Voat, rather than pre-existing threads...
            </p>
            <p>
             Where everything else has branched years, or months, or been traced to 'Before the investigation', this all seems to be information or narrative that has all been found (or, arguably, created) after the investigation was in fully swing, which is where I get antsy about it all...

             in pgw to discuss and compile the validity of the videos. One more thing, the videos was published and known about in Dec last year (I think it was 4chan/Pol )but was  dismissed as a false flag until it was posted here by that account. I don't know if it was a seeding or just an investigator following a lead though.

            I'm all for this, actually... But the thing is, in order for me to support the movement towards it being misplaced in the Pizzagate section, removing ignorance from the potential validity is an important step.
           </p>
           <p>
            I currently have a 'lack' of knowledge. Most of my information gathering methods I don't trust anymore, hence my relying on a 'community' of discussion to achieve the full picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            Simply yelling 'It's fake' as a way of informing people of it's lack of validity is about the same as people shouting 'It's real' to reinforce it.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the same, I realize 'fake' is hard to prove, and I do appreciate the input, but please understand that gathering reliable information takes time, and space... Like on the page of this site.

            See, I realize this - It's honestly where a portion of my uncertainty comes from.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the Internet, there are (I imagine) trillions of videos and documents. When Pizzagate was being investigated, there was always a connection from one event or discovery to the next.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm hoping that someone can provide something that shows 'We knew to look here because of this, which we knew about because of this' as with most of the other substantial circumstantial evidence that we've been gathering.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus far, though, I've only encountered the narrative of 'It sounds like John Podesta', which I'll even admit to agreeing with. My question though: Who found the video, and how? As I mentioned, this may be well known to everyone but me, and if so, I apologize sincerely.
           </p>
           <p>
            Without that link, this is equivalent of finding a perfect needle in a the worlds biggest haystack... Which, to me, potentially falls under 'too good to be true'.

             This video was dropped on here literally out of no where. I've seen people speculate it may have been an insider leak to us. But other than that absolutely no explanation of how whoever got there in the first place. I'm not even sure I can find the original post because it's been posted sooo many times which is an automatic red flag. Because of how heavily it's been pushed I'm growing suspicious of the motive. Yeah sure it kinda sounds like him, but that's as far as that is going to go unless worldcorpo leaks the video of jp actually doing it like they claim they have...but who knows.
