<p>Cambodia rescinds expulsion of US charity workers   <a href="https://www.ksl.com/?nid=235&amp;sid=45508853&amp;title=cambodia-rescinds-expulsion-of-us-charity-workers">https://www.ksl.com/?nid=235&amp;sid=45508853&amp;title=cambodia-rescinds-expulsion-of-us-charity-workers</a> (Aug 22 2017)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodia\'s prime minister said Tuesday he has rescinded his decision to expel an American-led Christian organization that seeks to rescue and rehabilitate women working in the sex trade, accepting its apology and explanation that it did not intend to demean Cambodians.
<strong>Prime Minister Hun Sen said the Roseville, California-based group, Agape International Missions</strong>&amp;, would be allowed to continue its normal operations and that he hoped the group had learned a lesson from the controversy.</p>
<p><strong>Hun Sen ordered the group expelled three weeks ago</strong> after its personnel appeared in a CNN report about child prostitution in Cambodia. <strong>Hun Sen took offense that the report said Cambodian mothers sold their daughters into prostitution.</strong></p>
<p>Agape International Missions, founded by Don Brewster and his wife Bridget, opened its first center for former child sex workers in 2006, according to the group\'s website. Brewster of Lincoln, California, described child prostitution in the Svay Pak suburb of Phnom Penh in the CNN story, which was a follow-up to a 2013 report on the same subject.
The website says the <strong>group, also known as AIM, &quot;has been granted unique permission by the Cambodian government to conduct investigations, perform raids, make arrests and rescue victims of sex trafficking alongside local government officials within the country of Cambodia.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, naturally, it sparked my interest to find out why or how AIM received special exemptions to operate in Cambodia and found a few things.</p>
<p>Found this about Hillary\'s brother\'s, Tony\'s,  connections to Cambodia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton Has a Family Problem—and It’s Not Bill; The Rodham brothers have a history of embarrassing their sister.
<strong>Tony, meanwhile, landed a job as a field organizer with the Democratic National Committee and married Sen. Barbara Boxer’s daughter, Nicole.</strong> But he soon struck out on his own, launching a consulting firm. <strong>In 1997, he traveled with three business partners to Cambodia, where he met with newly installed dictator Hun Sen to discuss possible investments in the country</strong>. Hun Sen, who had come to power in a bloody coup, was gearing up for the upcoming election by intimidating his political opponents, and the US government had taken a hands-off approach to the regime. Rodham suggested that his visit might help the peace process and open up the nation to American business. “We came to see what fits here in Cambodia, and there are many fits,” he told reporters—speaking at a hotel, the Associated Press dryly noted, that was owned by a Cambodian businessman banned from doing business in the United States because of his alleged involvement in the drug trade.  <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/hillary-clinton-hugh-tony-rodham/">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/hillary-clinton-hugh-tony-rodham/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Bill Clinton\'s UNIQUE trade agreement with Cambodia </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In 1999, my administration executed a unique trade agreement with Cambodia</strong> that gave U.S. clothing companies the opportunity to be fair trade purchasers. <strong>We promised greater access to the U.S. market if the Cambodian factories applied both local labor laws and international labor standards, including a ban on forced labor and child labor--a big problem in factories in many developing nations.</strong> The International Labour Organization agreed to monitor them and to help companies meet the standards and correct the problems. As a result of the agreement, working conditions vastly improved; employment skyrocketed, producing new jobs for 270,000 workers (two-thirds of the industrial workforce); and exports to the United States increased 17 percent, through participating companies like Gap Inc., Nike, Sears, and others.   <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Bill_Clinton_Free_Trade.htm">http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Bill_Clinton_Free_Trade.htm</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Bill Clinton\'s <strong>surprise visit to a Cambodian Temple in 2010</strong> (This link would not post , but it is from Press Release Distribution)</p>
<p><strong>Hillary Clinton also visits Cambodia as Secretary of State and talks  human trafficking</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/video/hillary-clinton-visits-cambodia/C76A6314-1C51-46B1-81E2-DE98FBAAA791.html">http://www.wsj.com/video/hillary-clinton-visits-cambodia/C76A6314-1C51-46B1-81E2-DE98FBAAA791.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the prime minister kicked out an American NGO, and then three weeks later, reconsidered, and let them back in the country to operate under their own unique rules, to rescue girls from sex trafficking.  I am guessing somebody put some pressure on him to rethink things.</p>
<p>Here are some other interesting facts I found out about Cambodia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A UNICEF survey concluded that 35% of Cambodia\'s 15,000 prostitutes are children under the age of 16. Almost all of Cambodian brothels are Vietnamese-owned, with most of its prostitutes being of Vietnamese descent and captured sex slaves being of other ethnic groups. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Cambodia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Cambodia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Cambodia stopped international adoptions of its kids in 2003, which would explain why NGOs got in to rescuing victims, if they were in it for nefarious reasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to program irregularities and instances of children being sold to adoption agencies, this program has been suspended until such time as new procedures can be formulated and agreed upon. Information provided here will be updated as soon as new procedures are in force. In 2003, the number of children adopted by U.S. citizens dropped to less than half the previous year’s total due to the shutdown, from 254 in 2002 to 124 children in 2003. <a href="https://adoption.com/cambodia">https://adoption.com/cambodia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now, Cambodia\'s prime minister wants to kick out the US Peace Corps</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/09/15/535215/Cambodia-Hun-Sen-US-Peace-Corps">http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/09/15/535215/Cambodia-Hun-Sen-US-Peace-Corps</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could find very little about the people, Don and Bridget Brewster, who started the NGO, Agape International Mission. There is nothing about what work either did before they one day decided to sell everything and start a mission in Cambodia.  I could find nothing about who funds them either. </p>

            The Cambodian government claims that it is Vietnamese women selling their children, not Cambodian mothers.  There's apparently a long history of animosity between the two.

            Here's info on Don Brewster:

            If you are ever in any doubt about the authenticity of an anti-trafficking organisation, read who its affiliates are and to whom they're connected.  ANY links to Open Society, Gates Foundation, UNICEF, the UN, WHO, Amnesty, George Soros reveal that these organisations do not care for the welfare of women and girls.  An organisation which supports the Nordic Model of prostitution is the real deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brewster co-signed this letter expressing strong support for the Sex Trafficking Demand Reduction Act.   I have not checked all the names, but you can bet your bottom dollar that no Soros NGOs, Amnesty &amp; the UN were not contributors to that letter.

             Your comment is irrelevant. UNTAC left Cambodia 25 years ago. Cambodia has always been a Chinese protectorate. I'm on the ground and know that this is about politics.

            Hun Sen has accused the USA of interfering in the upcoming elections. You're reaching. This has everything to do with Hun Sen's "paranoia" about "colour revolutions" and nothing to do with child trafficking.

            Agape is one of the good guys.  It's just that the Cambodian authorities find the truth embarrassing and unpalatable.  Mothers DO traffic their own daughters.

             I agree, they do trafick their own daughters. But Hillary visiting Cambodia to discuss traficking is a red flag. And you have to wonder if agape and the Cambodia dictator had a fall out for another reason, that Hillary possibly smoothed out. Because a similar scenario played out in North Korea and Bill smoothed it out. Just speculation of course, but you can see where this would not be unlikely considering all we know. But I won't throw agape under the bus just yet.
