<p>I\'ve done a quick search for Mary Katherine Burke and found this linkedin account: http s://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-katherine-burke-727687a (Can\'t archive the linkedin page... perhaps because of robots.txt restriction)</p>

<p>Of course I cannot testify that this is the same Mary Katherine Burke, but here are some excerpts from her linkedin profile. She is a human right attorney in washington DC.</p>

<ul>
<li>Also found this article where she appears to be promoting the legalization of prostitution to stop sex trafficking <a href="https://archive.is/R4AS9">https://archive.is/R4AS9</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burke points out that police can be part of the problem as well in countries where prostitution and solicitation is a crime, often tied to illegal drug use and sale. Victims are wrongly arrested and incarcerated because the signs of trafficking are not recognized, according to Burke. For instance, Burke says the Washington, D.C. Metro Police Department told her it will “continue to arrest minors who are engaged in commercial sex” despite the new Safe Harbor legislation in place that recognizes these minors as victims.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mary Katherine Burke is also briefly mentioned in a document from the AWARE association. Didn\'t read the document but the title reads: Beyond Borders: Sex with children – Implementing extra-territorial legislation for singaporeans  (<a href="https://d2t1lspzrjtif2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Beyond-Borders-Sex-with-Children..pdf">https://d2t1lspzrjtif2.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Beyond-Borders-Sex-with-Children..pdf)</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe it\'s just another concidence and perhaps these are two different Mary Katherine Burke, I don\'t know. But I think it deserves further investigation.</p>',

            Is that kid getting its hair pulled out by the root or is it a cancer baby on chemo? Maybe the person is talking about saving the kid.

            I know Cambodia (too) well. Human trafficking is rife and has been for years. Yet there are more anti-trafficking NGOs than there are trafficked people, aamos.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's insane. Living there you initially wonder how poverty and exploitation are even possible with so many NGOs fighting it. Living there a bit longer you know exactly how.

            So using that logic, if we make heroin illegal it will stop drug trafficking as well. Hmm....

            It seems there is an uncanny, tangled web of people that love commenting on babies/children/pizza and ALSO work in the human trafficking industry (it's apparently quite a booming industry in DC and the East Coast).

            I suspect that it is indeed the fox guarding the hen hound, and a bonus for these pedos is that John Q. Public gets to pay their salaries and expenses.

            More and more, it is becoming crystal clear that in many of these charity and non-profit organizations purportedly working on behalf of children, they are actually a classic case of the Fox guarding the Hen House.

            Where do all these anti-trafficking jobs/advocates come from? I mean really, I've never even thought this was a thing outside law enforcement /fbi.  Maybe its just me but I've never heard about all these anti-trafficking people and groups until looking into the alleged traffickers, and you certainly don't EVER hear about them actually accomplishing anything...how odd.

             They do not only accomplish nothing, do not present any results of their job, but also their silence what Pizzagate/pedogate could mean to children is deafening...
You see they really care and are highly successful!

            So, I researched PizzaSlime pretty thoroughly awhile ago an d went through all his instagram photos and those of his followers. I didn't post about him because I came to the conclusion that, despite the guy's name and logo, connections with pizzagate were a bit of a leap and tentative at best. I didn't want to needlessly incriminate someone who might be innocent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like the guy is a T-shirt company. The only weird thing is that there is a section of his website (for ordering?) that's password protected.) Many sites that sell wholesale have password protected areas as they have to be vetted before getting wholesale prices.  I don't know, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, I encourage everyone to dig into it on their own, as you have. You may come to a different conclusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Burke angle is interesting.  I don't know that I went down that road.

             I get what you're saying about wholesale being that way, but t shirts? That's just weird, why would a t shirt company adopt that model? Bulk t shirts are not an item that most re-order so you would be cutting out most of your comustomers... but certainly proof of nothing except they have a login on their site.
