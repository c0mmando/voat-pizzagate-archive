Lots of rhetoric om the web thinks the former.</p>
<p>The Liddle Kidz Foundation founder is Tina Allen, a massage therapist from Los Angeles and once very connected to the entertainment community.  Her clientele consisted of celebrities, soap opera actors and actresses, and musicians.  Very early on, she had a great opportunity to provide massage therapy for those who would benefit most from touch, people who were considered to be &quot;untouchable&quot; - men, women, and children diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.  Through a series of choices, she then began researching anything that would relate to pediatric massage therapy, and together with a group of colleagues, began the first comprehensive massage program in the US.  Since then, she has gone on to create more pediatric massage programs internationally and started the nonprofit organization Liddle Kidz Foundation in 2009.</p>
<p>Tina Allen has lectured about and taught pediatric massage in almost every US state, Canadian Province, Europe, Thailand, Vietnam, and Japan and has received invitations to present in Turkey, Nepal, Australia, China, and India.  The Foundation also has an overseas outreach component using the power of touch to reach the world\'s most vulnerable children.  These children often have the effects of trauma associated with being isolated or abandoned as well as special healthcare needs.

<p>While Adam Schiff\'s connection is not quite clear at this time, his jurisdiction in CA covers the 818 area code number of the foundation\'s phone number, although Liddle Kidz claims an address in Vancouver, WA.  Liddle Kidz appears to be a relatively small operation.  On the last 990, filed for 2015, their total assets were $136,122.00.   One possibility that Adam Schiff is connected to child organizations is  his public Instagram which shows several pictures with young children.  This is not unusual for politicians, but in the link provided, there is a picture of a baby who does not appear happy, sitting in a big leather chair in front of Schiff\'s Congressional desk in 2017.  There is also a pic from April 2015 where he posts a pic of a child from &quot;our trip to Haiti last week...We visited two orpanages and a hospital...&quot;  This child doesn\'t look too happy either.</p>

<p>There\'s a great deal of in-your-face suspicion about Liddle Kidz Foundation.  Just one of many examples you can easily find is in the above link.  There is reference to Tina Allen\'s book, &quot;A Modern-Day Guide to Massage for Children,&quot; and what is a massage instruction book without a tie-in with pizza?</p>
<p>&quot;Let\'s try some tomatoes&quot; - Using soft cupped hands, place them andmove them in a circular motion on the back</p>
<p>&quot;And a little more cheese&quot; - Lightly tap fingers all over back</p>
<p>&quot;Now we just wait for the pizza to get nice and hot&quot; - Move your hands in a circular motion a few times</p>
<p>Research revealed a ton of entries, all of it repetitive, about Schiff\'s possible connection with the Liddle Kidz Foundation, even claiming that he was once on the Board of Directors.  This could not be verified.  As vast as this organization is, I was also unable to find any info about the current Board of Directors other than a few names that appear in the following February 2018 link in which &quot;4Plebs/Politically incorrect&quot; posted about Liddle Kidz being a possible pedophile connection and mentioned Adam Schiff\'s involvement.  There are lots of assumptions and piecing together of info, but it is fragmented.</p>

<p>My last link is a Facebook post from an unfamiliar group, &quot;QANON 5:5 Lounge&quot;  that claims Schiff was the vice- president of One World Adoption Agency in Broward County and that Liddle Kidz and One World Adoption are both connected to the Clinton Foundation and The Standard Hotel which was part of Schiff\'s district.</p>

<p>And yes, there are a lot of coincidences here, but it\'s certainly fair to say that Liddle Kidz and Liddle Adam Schiff are just another 2 bricks in the  wall.</p>',

Says more about the senate than him......no wonder he is worried.I trust this author's veracity .......used to correspond with someone he knew on waynemadsenreport......they are honest letting the chips fall where they may.https://rense.com/general96/adam-schiff-exposed-himself-as-ed-bucks-buddy-in-pizzagate-west.php?fbclid=IwAR1Dtw56mLKtWBmk6i0jKoO1zfLmAzjl0FWrcciJIiZ_

            The massage stuff with Children reminds me of the Olympic coach that abused the girls. He used to pretend he was doing stuff like that and Kids can easily be fooled into what is massage and what is sexual especially at a young age. Think Toddlers. Yuck 🤢

            Tina, her husband and child, travel all over the world in their tour bus (nice chunk of that $136,122 asset valuation) teaching 'Ped. Massage' to everyone from Thai orphanages to UCSF.
