            A different view on this might be how Hillary Clinton did, according to news reports, absolutely nothing to help Danny Pye, but lots to help Laura Silsby.  Maybe we've been looking at this the wrong way.  Why the focus on Silsby?

             Good point! Silsby and her crew were released from Haiti within a month, I think, while Daniel Pye sat in prison there for 5 months. I couldn't find anything in Hillary's e-mails about his case. The word "pye" occurs in one Hillary e-mail, but it was a word from a letter that was in Portuguese, not a name.

              Thanks.  Yes, I was thinking that sometimes we look for links that connect, when links that specifically, with no good reason,
              <strong>
               don't
              </strong>
              connect, might be the true path.
             </p>

              Hillary's State Department should have been all over Pye being detained, especially since it seemed that it was so unfair (what we knew at the time), but they totally ignored it while being focused on Silsby and her group instead.

            If someone can find an actual connection between Pye and Silsby, let us know. I've yet to locate one, but if one exists, it would be the clearest tie yet between a pedo and Hillary's Haiti romp/CGI.

             I don't think you are going to find one, but keep trying. Pye is just a pervert who is a sex tourist. I don't think there is anyway to construe him as a sex trafficker or organ harvester, otherwise he would be facing allegations of missing children and such. OnHoldWithBreitbart made a good point saying that the state dept likely reopened his case, so that is very interesting. Maybe he was picked on purpose to make a point or message.
