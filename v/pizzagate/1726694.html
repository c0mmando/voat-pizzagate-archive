            Tell me about it. Maybe some people are just sexually perverted, in that they might never go out to actually hurt somebody but for whatever reason neglect to consider the harm they do cause. Then there are people who either know full-well the harm they cause and have no concerns about it or even gain pleasure in seeing children suffer - I'd say that these are two different scenarios. I personally feel that the former can routinely be dealt with by means of compulsory mental health intervention, but where people are explicitly out to hurt children and there is clearly no attempt to be rehabilitated then that's where a bullet in the head becomes relevant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, there is clearly a systematic agenda of sorts which targets children in particular, something which clearly has an international reach, and whatever that may be I guess is what we're trying to get to the bottom of here.

            Thanks, yeah if there were a lot of strong independent countries left my theory wouldn't hold water, but since almost every country has been affected and is declining into degeneracy, and seeing what is happening with Russia/Us/China....it makes a lot of sense to me. Hopefully i'm wrong.

            The point is that they want paedophilia to be normalised, but the blackmail will still be available when they take people down to the Holy of Holies where a child is not being sodomised, but rather sacrificed. It's also a cover story for the bigger problem - this is damage limitation now, so they deflect the problem towards paedophilia when the stark reality is that the biggest problem is really about blood libel. I mean, it's one thing to target children sexually, but we're talking about mass murder here and that's what they don't want in the news. So I think they've given up with the blackmail in respect of the sexual crimes, it's too much in the open now, but the satanic side to it is still being kept quiet by the media and probably because that is, indeed, where the blackmail is most useful.

            That's a good question, i didn't ask myself that.  In 20 years from now what would be different that they wouldn't need the blackmail angle anymore?
           </p>
           <p>
            My immediate thoughts are like this - it would suggest whats happening now are end-game plans, the mother of all strategies that will clinch their total control over the world. If we look at the countries who can potentially fight back in current times, that list is dwindling. The white countries were saved for tearing down last because they would be the most difficult, especially the US with their gun ownership and Russia with their tough as nails culture, so they try to turn the two to fight each other and save them the early work, when they are sufficiently weak enough they come in and finish it. So basically once they have sufficient control of or destabilized most ethnic countries, they turn to the white countries using their planted officials and the people they corrupted in the ethnic countries to do the dirty work. They start with the weak liberal bleeding heart countries first because they are the easiest, most cowed and no guns like european countries and canada. They leave Russia and the US for last. China has been impenetrable for them to gain any real ground there to destabilize. So either 1) china is involved or 2) They were saved as the last non-white country to go after because of their impenetrability so they incite WW3 between the 3 global powers to weaken each other before the worlds last swan song.
           </p>
           <p>
            I imagine 20 years from now tech would have evolved to the point no one on earth can hide from them, no one can fight them even if they wanted to, they won't need blackmail. They brought down all the countries in the world and are in control, and another generation of MK robots to their bidding (and remember these people have been programming for how many decades now? Every generation that group keeps growing in numbers to train another new set of kids and they just multiply so imagine how many are walking around now)

            I like the fact that the article starts by explaining
            <strong>
             the difference
            </strong>
            between
            <strong>
             Pizzagate
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             Pedogate
            </strong>
            . They're not the same. PIZZAGATE is the Washington D.C. child trafficking SRA rings used to keep high level politicians in check. PEDOGATE is the Global Child Trafficking business mainly managed by the CIA and other countries' respective Secret Intelligence Agencies, for the Military Industrial Complex and other key Fortune 1000 companies scattered around the globe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also important to note is that "
            <strong>
             The USA
            </strong>
            has been painstakingly cultivated to function as the
            <strong>
             military arm of the New World Order
            </strong>
            (NWO). In this pivotal role the USA takes direction from the
            <strong>
             financial arm headquartered in the City of London
            </strong>
            as well as from the
            <strong>
             religious arm of the NWO located in Vatican
            </strong>
            ."

              You know, I've learned and grown a lot since this all began 3 months ago. It's been a blessing to share, discuss, disagree and reconcile with you and others on Voat. It's been a very interesting experience, one that I will never forget and that I am very grateful for :)

                 No it never got started.   The guy who made it announced it here maybe right at the New Year.  The first reaction was mistrust, is it a CIA site, etc... which is still a good question.  So it has just hung there for all this time. When I saw Ryan had been there I decided what the heck, I'd let them know what standards I'd like to see in a site before I invest my time there, and see what happened.   Not much to lose.

               You made my day.  Thanks for expressing that so beautifully.  This is definitely one for the history books!  And for soul growth.  Online, everything is stripped away, it's just who you really are even though we suppress a lot to stay anonymous. There is growth and good that is going to come out of this new awareness of ours, if we keep at it.  We have to stick it out together.

            Excellent piece!
           </p>
           <p>
            This will not be a popular comment, so ready your rocks for chunking, and I will say it anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a scripture that says a time is coming when what is revealed going on in the world will be so overwhelming that it will cause human hearts to stop from the shock.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is scripture that reveals what happens when a society rejects God, the breakdown is as follows:
           </p>
           <p>
            A sexual revolution (1960's)
A homosexual revolution (1990's)
And lastly, "God turns "them" over to a reprobate mind to do things that ought not to be done" (pedofilia? - being attempted now)
           </p>
           <p>
            I was born before cell phones and computers. When I was a teen, homosexuality was viewed with the same horror as pedofilia. Any suggestion that gay marriage would exist, and homosexuality would be sanctioned, was akin to saying that the ocean could be drained. It was a total impossibility and would never happen and those who spoke it were thought deranged. So.....the gay lobby went to work...
           </p>
           <p>
            And looky where we are now.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the SCOTUS sanctioned homosexual marriage, I stated to my millenial son that pedofilia would be next, because we were now on the slippery slope.
           </p>
           <p>
            He reacted with horror and looked at me as if I'd lost my mind,
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet only 30+ years ago, the thought of normalizing homosexuality elicited the same horrified reaction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Homosexuals had demanded their "rights" and got them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The premise of normalization was targeted to children....why?

           <p>
            Now...what is to stop pedofiles from demanding their "rights?"
           </p>
           <p>
            The newest Disney movie, Beauty and the Beast, has a gay scene.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, why?
           </p>
           <p>
            A movie marketed to children.
           </p>
           <p>
            There can only be a nefarious purpose in marketing sex of any kind to children....children are not naturally sexual by nature. I have 6 of them. I know.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not a homophobe. What two consenting adults do is their business and I dont care. That said, they should have kept it in their bedroom because when they target my child, for whatever nefarious purpose - and it must be so because there can be no valid purpose - they have now made it MY business and I'm not going to stand idly by and let it happen without a fight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Watch and see.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedofiles will soon demand their "rights."
           </p>
           <p>
            How can SCOTUS say "no?"
           </p>
           <p>
            They've already normalized and sanctioned what was for thousands of years considered perversion.
           </p>
           <p>
            How can they now say "no" when the next group of peversion, I understand they call themselves pedosexuals, come along and demand to be normalized and sanctioned?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok...rocks at the ready...fire away.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A sexual revolution (1960's) A homosexual revolution (1990's) And lastly, "God turns "them" over to a reprobate mind to do things that ought not to be done" (pedofilia? - being attempted now)
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The last point there, I'd read that as referring to sodomy. Of course, it already mentions homosexuality (not that being a gay man automatically implies sodomy, but I guess that's the key issue) - so if children are in any way relevant to this scripture then it could be alluding to sodomy against children. Clearly, paedophilia is dangerous enough when it comes to both the physical and spiritual health of children, but to sodomise them would be a far worse crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you look at the blatant gay agenda (I personally think Russia is correct on this one, about "gay propaganda" for instance and Beauty and the Beast would certainly qualify there) and an apparent pro-paedophilia agenda as well - then one has to wonder as to what the main agenda is really about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thing to worry about is young girls routinely being given contraceptive pills. If a child has only just began puberty, such drugs are going to cause them problems. There is no amount of testing to make it safe, it is not safe at all. Physical safety aside, it also normalises promiscuity in and of itself but also, and worse, at a young age.
            </p>
            <p>
             In essence, it looks to me like we're under attack. Corrupt the men, they corrupt the women, then they corrupt the children. When our children are so traumatised that they cannot sufficiently grow into normal people, then what hope do we have for the future? Well there you have it, our future is systematically being stifled and that is nothing other than deliberate. And thus an attack by something otherworldly.

               Great. I had to use this searchvoat.co tool to find the other missing search bar and sticky when creating my post on the subject. Even if the search bar at Voat PG is down, there's still some other way to search for older posts, which is such a relief.

                Such a effed up thing for them to do - and what an excuse.  Even if they aren't lying, deciding to do that with no announcement is just so thumb in your eye we couldn't care less about you guys.

            I have thought the same thing when I hear very confident alt right arguments that there is an agenda to normalize pedophilia - then what act do they go to for blackmailing.  Because you don't just normalize pedophilia and stop blackmail culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think this has been thought through.   My feeling is the argument would go something like "Well when they normalize pedophilia, they've won the world, and there is no need to blackmail anyone because they are in total control of everyone and everyone is a slave."   However I think this would be a hard sell to those who thrive on blackmail - the entire CIA.  Also it is just a sort of vague and weak argument in general.

            I don't know how far into this I am as someone has said it is very long.  I intend to read every word of it including the links.  This is voracious reading and I am so very engrossed.  I may need to read it twice.

             I've been following them a long time, they have the Ryan (Pegasus) thing and his interaction w/ Alefantis somewhere on there ... they get a little into astrological (or whatever) stuff sometimes, but always do a good job on pizza and pedo gate.

              I like that they also cover man past information that has affected the problems we have today and how it has mushroomed into what we must now fight.  Not done yet.

            That is probably the most thorough write-up I have seen. Everybody needs to be print a dozen copies of this each and "accidentally forget" them in pubs and cafes, on buses and planes.

             On the other hand, if that said "religion" is the truth, it is the least hazardous way forward. But yes, religion can be bondage. As with anything of value, it is quickly counterfeited. Could not this have happened with a "one true religion?" Of course it could.

            That is probably also the exact reason why they want Trump out. He is known as ''The accidental President'', there is a good chance that they might not have been able to have anything to blackmail him with. A chance, if they do? Trump won't help. On the other hand, if they don't, then they seem to infiltrate his lack of experience in order to get to him. ''They'' (those with tools for blackmail) need to keep this hidden at all costs.

            Some people knock this website because they sometimes get into some really over the top stuff - but I like it, it can be very informative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because a site goes a little off the rails sometimes doesn't necessarily mean it's intentional "pizzagate disinfo."

             I agree. State of the Nation is one of my go tos. They are affiliated with Millennium Report. I have relinked their articles many times in this sub. Some complain they don't have authors sourced besides "anonymous patriots." It is not a deal breaker for me.

                Zero Hedge runs "featured" authors quite often. But anything anonymous is by the pseudonym "Tyler Durdin" (I think a character in the movie Fight Club though I haven't seen it).

             I'm not familiar with that site, but in general I would say the track record speaks for itself.
            </p>
            <p>
             If a site consistently disseminates disinfo or goes "off the rails," one has to assume the site owners have some kind of agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             In ANY evaluation of the validity of info, the CREDIBILITY OF THE SOURCE is a huge factor.  We see this not only in journalism but in law.

              "I'm not familiar with the site, but the track record speaks for itself".  SO you don't know the site but you know the "track record".  "WE see this not only in journalism but in Law".  Who the fuck is "WE" Einstein?  What I can TELL YOU / WE is this is a very good article, well researched and well written so I think YOU/ WE are pedos and or PEDO enablers and you can suck my DICK!

              People are convicted and locked up all the time by felons who dissemble. Many sites have good intentions and have truth mixed with error, unintentionally. Life is a learning process, everybody at different levels. I would have missed a lot had I not checked into some of the most ridiculous you tubers :)

             I've found a lot of links worth checking, there are pieces of information everywhere, filtering takes some effort but that's an effort we must take. Even those sites obviously disinfo are, however, sharing nice pieces of information on the ways the disinfo community works, sometimes reading those using the "enemy point of view" helps to filter even better. This article by OP link is great, but rather a long read. It reveals a possible background and clearly brings in the size and relevance of pizzagate, but does not try to prove it - mentioning it in the end, that the concrete evidence is gathered in a special group. This group should be better proven as trustworthy.

              Good grief man, where have you been with your incredible reasonable thinking :)  This is exactly what I try and tell everyone. "Chew the meat and spit out the bones." Great comment, you've said it better than I probably ever would.

               Thanks a lot. I'm right behind my profile, just that I joined the undercover journalism at quite late time. Now I feel sorry for that, I should have taken it more seriously since the beginning, as every effort might be worth one life of a child... Your supportive comment keeps me rocking, thanks again!

                Don't ever blame yourself for any of the sordid disgusting things these perverts have done.  Do not think one child died or was tortured just because you did not step forward.  Everything must come down on their heads, and none of it must be blamed on any of us.  You are now a full fledged member of our researching army.  Welcome Aboard.  Pick out some really great members whose comments point you to doing research and latch on to them.  Ask questions, do they need help, Many will ask you to help dig dig dig.  This is how you will help uncover the dirt that will help this explode to the masses.
