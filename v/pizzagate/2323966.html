<p>Indeed, Mary. :). I\'m coming to town the week after next and will bring some walnuts! </p>

<p>So it seems Tom has a wife. I never had the misfortune of seeing her before, but did today:</p>

<p>Interesting that she\'s described on the cover as a Hellraiser. Probably apt to describe her that way. Note she\'s driving change at : Exxon, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook. Tall order, but what stood out for me was that big ugly tattoo she\'s sporting on that flaccid arm. What is it ?? The sun? Reminded me of Janet Jackson\'s nipple ring. I\'ll put a link to it here, but if you click, you\'re going to be grossed out so fair warning: </p>

<p>I decided to go dumpster diving and dig up what I could on the couple. The first thing I found was that she had six tattoos..Maybe if you put them together they spell, WINO FOREVER? Just a guess.</p>

<p>His wife, Kathryn &quot;Kat&quot; Taylor, loves spending long days running a small bank in a gritty part of Oakland. She is pragmatic, has an unfettered laugh and sports six tattoos, admitting, &quot;There\'s no doubt if I turned up for a black tie event at the Pacific Union Club, I might not be what people expect to see.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see another one of her subpar tats as well as an admission from Tom about drawing a cross on his left hand each day? WHAT? oKAY ... </p>
<p>Since there\'s all this fake news about them being such philanthropists, decided to dive deeper in the shit. Came up with this article that mentions the walnut sauce AND that the unattractive couple started an organization in India called ONE ROOF. They want kids to have computers even when they don\'t have food to eat. How else could pervs sent nudepics and ask minors to take off their shirts? </p>

<p>Came across another even more unflattering portrayal of the abysmal couple. </p>

<h1>A look behind the curtain hiding Tom Steyer\'s fortune</h1>
<p>Outside of the mainstream media, however, independent journalists and bloggers are doing deep-dive research into how Steyer made his own fortune running the Farallon Capital Management hedge fund.</p>
<h1>Fortune built on Asian coal</h1>
<p>It turns out that much of Steyer\'s wealth is the fruit of immensely profitable investments in development of Indonesian and Australian coal.</p>
<p>Indonesian interests produce half of the coal burned in Chinese power plants. Farallon was involved in a hedge-fund consortium in 2008 that invested heavily in Adaro Energy, one of Indonesia\'s biggest coal producers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I can summarize: TOM AND HIS WIFE ARE HYPOCRITES. </p>
<p>But what about that tattoo?  Ah, here\'s where it gets interesting. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://mindcontrolblackassassins.com/tag/marina-abramovic/">https://mindcontrolblackassassins.com/tag/marina-abramovic/</a></p>
<p>There isn’t anything strange or unusual about using walnut sauce on pasta, especially, for a fine, rich (billionaire) and cultured man like Steyer. James‘ brother is billionaire Tom Steyer. I suspect that both are interested in religion and theology. And, the Steyer brothers’ blood money in combination with George Soros and other Zionists are behind covert funding of Black Lives Matter. The Steyers’ father was Roy Henry Steyer, a law partner of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell should always raise a lot of red flags. It was the CIA MK ULTRA Allen Dulles and John Foster Dulles‘ powerful and clandestine law firm. The elder Steyer (Lt. Roy H. Steyer, USNR) was an OSS Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor. The Dulles brothers used their law firm partners to collaborate with and cherry pick SS-Knights of Black Sun and Nazis for Operation PAPERCLIP.</p>
<p>My Dear Lord. These are the BLOODLINES of the operators and conductors of the Vatican SS Nazi Ratlines, and the Guardians of Himmler’s– THE DEVIL’S GOLD. Don’t get it twisted. Of course, Jim Steyer knew exactly what Podesta was talking about. Podesta was the Steyer brothers’ advisor and teacher. Podesta was taught straight out of the Vatican and its vast ancient library. In ancient Satanic rituals, The Son of the Vatican goes all the way back to the secret mystery Greek Cult of Oxyrhynchus.</p>
<p>The City/Cult of Oxyrhynchus lies west of the main course of the River Nile. In ancient times, the city on the site was called Per-Medjed, named after the medjed, a species of elephantfish of the Nile worshiped there as the fish that ate the penis of Ausar (Osiris). After Alexander the Great entered Kemet in 332 BC, the city was reestablished as a Greek town, called Oxyrrhynkhoupolis. In Hellenistic times, Oxyrhynchus was a prosperous regional capital, the third-largest city in Egypt. After Egypt was Christianized, it became famous for its many churches and monasteries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the connections dredged up the photo of another least favorite person in the world: Kamala &quot;Whore&quot; Harris. And notice the reference to Nazis and the possibility of that amateurish tat being a modification of the &quot;Black Sun&quot; symbology. </p>
<p>And there is a photo of Tom and Kathryn with Paul &amp; Nancy Pelosi: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/nancy-pelosi-tom-steyers-hedge-fund-and-a-billion-taxpayer-dollars/">http://freebeacon.com/politics/nancy-pelosi-tom-steyers-hedge-fund-and-a-billion-taxpayer-dollars/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why so chummy? Oh, yeah! This is why: &gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A top House Democrat to whom billionaire liberal Tom Steyer has donated campaign funds steered more than a billion dollars to an infrastructure project that benefitted his hedge fund.</p>
<p>That hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, bought up large plots of real estate in San Francisco’s burgeoning Mission Bay neighborhood in 2004. The area is now booming and Farallon has sold most of its property there.</p>
<p>Steyer, who founded and led Farallon until late 2012, has used his fortune to elect Democratic senators and governors. He has pledged to spend $50 million of his own money in 2014 and to raise another $50 million.</p>
<p>Among the beneficiaries of his political largesse is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). &quot;&quot;We want to support Nancy as much as we can,&quot; Steyer said in an interview last year.</p>
<p>Pelosi, who did not respond to requests for comment, has also supported Steyer, though with less fanfare.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, she has steered federal subsidies to a light rail project designed to stimulate commercial and residential growth in Mission Bay. Experts say the project swelled real estate values in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;From a decrepit and seemingly abandoned old rail yard 15 years ago, Mission Bay has sprouted into San Francisco’s fastest-growing neighborhood,&quot; the San Francisco Business Times reported last year.</p>
<p>One of the beneficiaries has been Farallon, which bought two million square feet of Mission Bay commercial real estate space and a handful of residential properties in a $343 million deal in 2004.</p>

<p>But what about Tom\'s <s>ugly specter of a wife</s> ... I mean, better half ... </p>
<p>It wasn\'t until I checked out LinkedIn did I find that the way to her heart was through her stomach: </p>
<p>Link not accepted. Just look it up: </p>

<p>I included the Good Samaritan Family Center because I could swear someone did a post on them ... or maybe it just sounds similar, but the second one ... the TOMKAT RANCH really caught my eyes!</p>
<p>I held my breath and dived further into the garbage pile and came up with pure gold. </p>

<p>PIGS?!!!! They have a pig farm? WTH is it with these people? How many friends do you know that own a pig farm? And here are a bunch of degenerates that ALL seem to own one? Or carve time out of a busy walnut sauce?ing schedule to visit one!  
</p>
<p>But what about Pescadero and its distance from Truckee CA where Pedosta lived? Well, it\'s only about four hours away. And Pescadero is right on that coast. </p>

<p>So there you have it. The Cannibal Elite are all a stone\'s throw away and have those pigs on hand just in case. </p>

In ancient times, the city on the site was called Per-Medjed, named after the medjed, a species of elephantfish of the Nile worshiped there as the fish that ate the penis of Ausar (Osiris). After Alexander the Great entered Kemet in 332 BC, the city was reestablished as a Greek town, called Oxyrrhynkhoupolis. In Hellenistic times, Oxyrhynchus was a prosperous regional capital, the third-largest city in Egypt. After Egypt was Christianized, it became famous for its many churches and monasteries.

           But why so chummy? Oh, yeah! This is why: &gt;
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            A top House Democrat to whom billionaire liberal Tom Steyer has donated campaign funds steered more than a billion dollars to an infrastructure project that benefitted his hedge fund.
           </p>
           <p>
            That hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, bought up large plots of real estate in San Francisco’s burgeoning Mission Bay neighborhood in 2004. The area is now booming and Farallon has sold most of its property there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Steyer, who founded and led Farallon until late 2012, has used his fortune to elect Democratic senators and governors. He has pledged to spend $50 million of his own money in 2014 and to raise another $50 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among the beneficiaries of his political largesse is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). ""We want to support Nancy as much as we can," Steyer said in an interview last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pelosi, who did not respond to requests for comment, has also supported Steyer, though with less fanfare.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the past decade, she has steered federal subsidies to a light rail project designed to stimulate commercial and residential growth in Mission Bay. Experts say the project swelled real estate values in the area.
           </p>
           <p>
            "From a decrepit and seemingly abandoned old rail yard 15 years ago, Mission Bay has sprouted into San Francisco’s fastest-growing neighborhood," the San Francisco Business Times reported last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the beneficiaries has been Farallon, which bought two million square feet of Mission Bay commercial real estate space and a handful of residential properties in a $343 million deal in 2004.

             I wouldn't expect Mueller to do anything but be the douche he is. The only reason he does any investigation is to: (1) try to bring charges against our POTUS; and (2) see what holes there are so Killary &amp; friends can cover their buttholes from prosecution by someone actually concerned by illegalities.

            I have said it now for many months.  Well organized/financed campaigns against the Trump Presidency always appear  to be the perfect analog to asking the pedo elite to raise their hands and self identify.  Rob Reiner and his associates are another group of the usual suspects.

             I never heard of walnuts being used that way. I thought walnut was code for a person of color, but you could be right.

              Not sure how accurate that keycode sheet is. Some of it makes sense though. I’ve heard people say the brain and pineal look like a walnut before.

               Yes, the coding is jargon known only to those participants/members of the sick crowd. Be glad we don't know, but I'm sure as the legal rope tightens, someone will break and tell us all.

            Awesome research OP. I would only add that these ones at the top are most always married to trannys, Steyer included. That is a whole rabbit hole in and of itself. I don't know why there arent more threads on this topic because it ties in with the whole occult aspect of the MEN at the top and their occult proclivities.

             Thanks and I agree. For some reason, I wonder why, the shills get really hostile when you point out that a supposed wife is a transgender. It goes into the whole agenda of messing up kids from a young age. By messing with their heads, you not only get the men fulfilling wifely duties, but you get women acting like men which is way more pleasing to the elite males on top. Also men are known to be a hell of a lot more sexually permissive than their counterparts. Not saying some women aren't adventurous, we're going by the norm ... or what used to be the norm.

              True, and in my research through the years it seems like these luciferian MEN at the top truly do hate women and have no use for them whatsoever. They can't marry real women, most seem to be in or out of the closet gays or they have tranny wives, which basically are the same thing.  NO use for women. Like I said, thats a "whole nother" rabbit hole.

              <p>
               I notice also, that if the marriages aren't tranny/man, they're gay woman/man DeBlasio and the gay woman he's married to is an example. Because she's black, she got him elected mayor of New York. Kamala "Whore" Harris and the white guy they got her married off to is another example. In order to be presidential, she needs a rich white guy to pull in those votes.

            Excellent job.  There are a lot of wealthy people in Canada that own pig farms and they are always having parties there.  Sure the smell on a pig farm is where everyone wants to party.  This article speaks of these powerful women that are evil by the way, and their pig farms.

             Will definitely read. Keep thinking of the pig's eyes that Podesta used as a screensaver that creeped people out so much he had to remove it.

              You are right and he worked on that farm butchering pigs in high school or college.  When I was researching JA’s friends I came across an article about two guys that learned to butcher pigs for a hobby not for work.  They were bragging about how they cut the pigs with precision. I will try to find the article.

            If "walnut sauce" is said to mean black children &amp; Steyer deals in coal, maybe his shipments of children are covered in coal dust so appear black, because they're shipped with it.

             No. Walnut sauce is convenience processed human/child brain worked into consumables. Eating brain has Satanic value to them. Just google the phrase "Satanism Luciferism brain consuming".

            So if his legit biz interests are in Indonesia &amp; Australia,  but his pals are known for child trafficking, one could assume he sources Asian victims (funneled thru AUS), fantastic post btw.

            Awesome post this is why Steyer is so desperate to see Trump impeached. Setyer knows it's only a matter of time before he is arrested and prosecuted. I hope Q and his team will soon take Steyer out of action. He belongs in Gitmo with the other criminals along with his wife you'll notice the wives are always involved.

             Yes, wives are included now. They have to be part of the cabal. Same thing with stars. Anybody that goes to the top of the charts now has to sell his/he soul. If they don't they're crushed by having their will stripped from them.

                I"m not talking about the holocaust prick. I'm talking about REAL NAZIS, YOU KNOW, THE JESUITS, they would fuck you up and use you for firewood to burn your own mother because they hate everybody that was not born into the THE ORDER, and trust me, you aint in the club, other than you and your little fantasy clique you hang out with online. The Jesuits laugh at you.

                 Keep digging, im interested to learn exactly how far someone will go without accepting the JQ is historical fact.  Not elite or zionist or "fake" Jews, but the Jewish community as a whole.  minds can be reeducated but I guess cowardice has no limits.  Notice how few women, empathetic and averse to violence, accept it.  You're effectively a woman.  Ouch!

It's probably where u try on clothes in a Turkish store too.  Wait OMG I'm Don too....have you spotted another crypto shill?!

                    Yeah, like "shape shifter" for dumbasses that think reptilians are really lizard people. It all basically means "imposter" or being a "shifty person" pretending to be something you're not, like how you pretend to be a nazi because you think real nazis give a shit about you. If you think your buddies from Georgetown, University give a damn about you then you are wrong. You don't even understand who the Nazis really are. Jews and white people are all mixed up in this ordeal and the non jewish half would skin your pet dog and make you eat it.

                  Watch this video and learn something. After you watch it, tell me who is fighting "the jew" other than you and your imaginary little garage dwelling buddies drawing swastikas on the wall on Saturday night?

                  Study this post carefully. Especially the picture of different people in history throwing the triad sign. Hitler is pictured along with a lot of other people you know. If you think you are in that club then you are either too young to have learned anything past the word "jew" or just plain delusional as fuck. Trump is ass kissing who? Well no shit Sherlock, Israel. So that leaves exactly who to save your ass? The nazis don't give a fuck about you, they never have, and they never will....you were not born into their "family" and they would skin you alive and laugh at you.

                  Look fuck face, jews have different groups, different levels, and they all hate us. No shit sherlock. If you're education has not gone far enough to realize that the real nazis will burn you at the stake then you need to go back to conspiracy school because you have not learned shit. You were not born into their club. You will never be in their club. You are living in a fucking fantasy world of your own making.

            Invest heavily in foriegn coal assets, unleash hrc, dnc, and the like in "war on (American) coal". Kill the most efficient and prolific US coal producers and walk away with billions. Typical filthy leftists.

             "I am" is a phrase Satanist use to proclaim themselves god and take the lords name in vain. 777 is one of Crowleys writings. No surprise you called them filthy 'leftist" and ignored the other obvious implications. James Alefantis was a special contributer to the play I Am the Wind.

             Yup, and reviving the coal industry was the first promise our POTUS carried out. Yet another reason for Steyer to hate him. But that'll be nothing to when they're all thrown in prison.

              In what way is this true?  Trump promised to bring back coal jobs.  Did you believe Trump's lie about bringing back 50,000 jobs?  Right now in the whole country, we have 50,500 coal miners, not much more than we had in January.

              At recently as Jan 2015, we had 69,000 coal miners in this country.

              And it's not policy that effects coal jobs, it's economics.  Technology means you need less miners to get coal out of the ground.  Other forms of energy are getting cheaper so there is less demand in the US for coal.

              Exports got a bump this year, because Australia had issues producing the type of coal used in steel production.

              This is completely false.  There's no example of this prior to podesta's emails being released.  An anonymous used made a screenshot with this claim, but there's not one bit of evidence behind it.

              Pasta with Walnut Sauce is a genuine Northern Italian dish.  You can find dozens of recipes on the web.  You can find video of John Podesta cooking it from 2014.  The emails where this first come up are because the Clinton campaign met with a bunch of journalists who would be covering the 2016 campaign and Podesta served pasta with walnut sauce.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moreoever, this dish comes from Liguria where Podesta's grandfather is from.  It's from the same area where they make basil pesto (which contains nuts) and is sometimes called walnut pesto.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               My ‘Salsa di Noci’ (walnut sauce) recipe hails from Liguria, the region in northwestern  Italy. High above the Mediterranean, shielded by mountains, Liguria is a fertile region, making a name for itself with its famous pesto sauce (from basil) and focaccia bread. The thick, creamy walnut sauce is often associated with the region’s most famous city, Genoa, and the herb-laden hills to its north. ....
Though basil may be the most familiar to Americans, there are more than 70 different recipes for pesto from the province of Genoa alone, including a winter version, which calls for parsley instead of basil, as well as chard and borage.

                  Hi :) No, I am not.. the entire brain. Pineal glands are not useful for their intended purpose under normal conditions (DMT is made only under specific conditions and the glands have to be extracted at the right time before the made DMT dissolves again). The brains are mashed into goo, (the "sauce" reference).

               Nice of you to make a long speech about Podesta, but you seem to forget that this post is about Tom Steyer. If you're going to talk about Podesta, what you
               <em>
                should
               </em>
               be explaining is the $65,000 worth of hotdogs, the dominoes on pasta or cheese, the handerchief that is "map related", the Thelema favour and the spirit cooking.
              </p>
              <p>
               When you take all of that into account, it seems fair to assume that Steyer isn't just cooking walnut sauce on its own without any other food. When was the last time you prepared only walnut sauce for yourself?

                Spirit Cooking is a minor work from a provocative performance artist whose work is deliberately unsettling. She says a lot of pieces are about her own fears. You would have to be really into Ambramovic's career to even know about this work because she performed it one time 20 years ago. It was accompanied by a book of poetry "recipes."  The recipes are in no way literal.  Later she kept the name for some fund raising dinners she did.

                 For the record: Spirit Cooking is nothing but a little-known (and, measured in her ouvre, a rather throwaway) performance Abramovic did in an Italian gallery in 1996, in which she painted apparent instructions on the white wall with pigs blood. Instructions like: “with a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.” She also painted a small kind of icon in the corner with the blood too. It’s pretty repulsive and rather luridly aims to shock but it’s also clearly not serious. Abramovic also published a Spirit Cooking cookbook, containing comico-mystical, self-helpy instructions like: “spit inside your naval / until the lake is filled / lie motionless / listen to the heartbeat / of a dog.” You’re not really meant to actually do these things. As Abramovic said at London’s Royal Festival Hall last night in a launch event for her new memoir Walk Through Walls, it’s just poetry.

                 Spirit Cooking later evolved into a form of dinner party entertainment that Abramovic occasionally lays on for collectors, donors, and friends. That’s where John Podesta comes in—or doesn’t, since he never actually attended the dinner, where anyway guests simply made soup, not out of blood or any other bodily fluid, while overseen by Abramovic in full-on comedy schoolmarm mode.

                 They probably made a “golden ball” too, a recipe given to her by Tibetan monks after a meditation retreat in northern India. A golden ball is supposed to be eaten after a long period of fasting and meditation. I’ve had one, at the end of a “workshop” she gave to her students—I was her assistant at the time—in Andalusia in 2005. A golden ball consists, precisely, of seven almonds, three coriander seeds, two black peppercorns, one white peppercorn, and a dribble of honey, all ground together and wrapped in a sheet of 24 carat gold leaf. It was delicious, but I was confident that I wasn’t going to become a Buddhist by eating it.

                Dominoes on cheese or pasta just means playing dominoes after eating cheese or pasta.   There's no code in that email at all.   Podesta used to give out pasta as Christmas gifts and switched to cheese.  Spiriting cooking is a minor performance art piece and a book of poems.  It's really not well know to folks who follow Ambramovic.   She reused the name for a series of regular dinners she used for fund raising.

                 Must be purely coincidental that Podesta then engages in satanic shit with his "cutting deeply into the left middle finger and eat the pain", has had his voice compared to a child abuser's who is torturing a child, him and his brother look like McCann's kidnappers,

                  Also that it no way constitutes relevant evidence.  If some people use pizza or handerkerchief or parallel parking as code, does that mean everyone who is using these very common words are using them as code?  It is, of course, nonsensical to think so.

                   It started with an incredibly suspicious Podesta email which had skeptics suggesting they weren’t actually talking about pizza, but rather in code:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If this is not speaking in code, then it makes absolutely no sense. Not a single person from Podesta’s legal team nor mainstream media has been able to offer a coherent explanation on what this could mean if ACTUALLY pizza and map related.

                  Needless to say this is terrible reasoning.  I just provided a coherent explanation:
There is no code and it makes sense as written.  There was a cloth in the kitchen that had both a map and pizza on it.  Because it was found on the kitchen island, I assume the cloth was likely not a handkerchief but a tea towel.  The awkward phrasing is because the woman writing the email has not seen the cloth.
 You can find many, many kitchen cloths with maps or with food or with pizza.

                  Podesta does not engage in this eating the pain stuff.   Why do I know that?  Because nobody does.  It's a stupid poem.   You actually cite the fact that wackos compared Podesta's voice to  somebody's else as evidence of something?  You stop from claiming it's his voice, because you know that is false, but you still think this is evidence?

                    There are no code words.    The one piece of code that existed prior to Podesta's emails was CP.  CP was not even code because a lot of people knew what was meant by this.  So it was more slang.  CP stands for child porn and online communities like 4 Chan started finding other ways to say CP like "cheese pizza."  In Eastern Europe they say computer processors, I have also heard someone say copy paper is also used.

It is also possible for some users to request image dumping threads for CP (child pornography for short). If a thread is not unironic, it will be quickly deleted by moderators of the site because the posted contents can be illegal and violate their local law.
But the Post CP acronym is generally associated with the online forum game where the users actually post contents starting with the letters C and P.

                     Post CP is an acronym in which CP can have a variety of meanings. Initially used as an acronym for 4chan posters to indirectly mention or request a child pornography thread, in later years the acronym became commonly associated with the posting of other subjects with the same first letters (C &amp; P, most notably “Cheese Pizza”) to parody prohibited request threads or to troll those who hope to find child pornography.

                      'm going to ignore a lot of things, because you're talking about the 20th floor in the second extension of a structure, where the foundation doesn't exist.  If you can't prove A, I don't care if you connect Z to Y.....and all the way back to A.   A has to stand on its own.  And it does not in this case.  There's no code in the emails, no pedophilia whatsoever.   Take that away the Luzzato email is a grandmother trying to sound funny.  That is what it sounds like to people who don't think about kid fucking 24 hours a day.  People whose minds are in the gutter read it without giving the benefit of any doubt to the person, in fact, you deny her humanity and read the email not only not giving any doubt, but with actual malice and rancor.  That is witch-hunting, not investigation.

                      You want to find these little anomalies like why does this woman talk oddly and then try to make that oddness the entire basis of evaluation.  It's what conspiracists do.   It's their bread and butter next superficial, meaningless links and patterns.   Anomaly hunting it's called.  It's an attempt to shift the conversation away from the totality of the evidence into a paranoid discussions of little oddities.

                      <p>
                       In the early 1970s, while doing research in Harvard's Widener Library on the Salem witch hunts, John Demos realized that his connection to the subject wasn't just intellectual. He had run across one of many references to the role of the Putnam family when he abruptly became conscious of his own middle name: Putnam.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       "I literally jumped up from my seat and looked for a Putnam genealogy, and I traced the line right through," says Demos, now the Samuel Knight Professor of History at Yale.** He discovered himself to be a direct descendant of John Putnam Sr., progenitor of the witch-hunting Massachusetts Putnams. **"It took me all of ten minutes. It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck." Demos does not believe in karma, however. Or in witchcraft.

                      <p>
                       Demos expects witch hunts to recur, catalyzed by people who see the world as "bipolar." "It's good and evil, it's black and white, it's either you're with us or you're against us. And there's some cosmic threat at the bottom of things."

                       Resisting early is crucial. "A defining attribute of witch-hunting is the way the momentum builds. It's very hard to stop beyond a certain point -- because beyond a certain point, if you say 'Stop!' they'll call you a witch

                      <h1>
                       Favor
                      </h1>
                      <p>
                       So here's a question.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Why does this guy define Thelema as a favor?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Because that is not how Crowley defines it in any place I have seen.   In fact the Wikipedia entry on Thelema doesn't mention "favor" at all
                       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">
                        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema
                       </a>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       It does point out that there are thelema is not always associated with Crowley, in fact, it's an ancient Greek word that comes from
                       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint">
                        The Greek translation of the Old Testament in use at the time of Jesus

                      <blockquote>
                       <p>
                        As the primary Greek translation of the Old Testament, it is also called the Greek Old Testament. This translation is quoted a number of times in the New Testament,[1][2] particularly in Pauline epistles,[3]
                       </p>

                      <p>
                       Thelema in Greek is θέλημα and the English version is basically said by Christians all the time because it appears in the Lord's prayer

                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Here's a couple of dozen examples of this word from the Bible
                       <a href="https://www.billmounce.com/greekvocabulary/%CE%B8%CE%AD%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1-0">

                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So that is still the word defined as will.   Where is used as "favor?"

                       The only place I can find it is this Bible Study site.

                Bravo and just to add to that the email of the cookout in DC on Dec 28th (sure, hot that time of year) and it was taco and fresh tortillas flown in the day before from Mexico. And oh, by the way, please bring all children available. Sure you always say that on an invitation. Further, let’s not forget the kids in the pool provided for your entertainment in Lazatto’s email.

                  Today I was watching a video on DB Cooper the skyjacker who got away and an ex-FBI guy talks about why you have really stick to the facts and why you have to check yourself.  I thought it was pretty sound.
