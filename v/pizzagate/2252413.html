            Empowerment, at its core, is extremely Satanic. It all ties into "Being your own God" and all the other bullshit that Crowley taught, which is spread throughout the Mason Lodges and the secret societies. Crowley taught that "Might is Right" and that people who wanted to do something, regardless of what it was, should just DO IT, and to hell with what anyone says or thinks about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Empowerment simply means "DO WHAT THOU WILT."

             Exactly. But i have sensed that the word has suddenly become extremely popular as a hint between The Cabal. Its a good "warning light" for us researchers to look for.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The woman answered the snake: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, ‘You shall not eat it or even touch it, or else you will die.’”
             </p>
             <p>
              But the snake said to the woman: “You certainly will not die! God knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know good and evil.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and the tree was desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.

             Yep you got that right ! The lie that landed us where we are today! 
Using a serpent, or snake, as a mouthpiece, Satan implied that God was withholding something desirable from the woman and her husband. The angel told Eve that she and her husband would not die if they ate the forbidden fruit. Satan thus accused God of lying to His human children. The Deceiver presented disobedience to God as an appealing course that would lead to enlightenment and freedom. But this was all a lie—in fact, the first lie ever spoken on earth. The real point at issue involved God’s sovereignty, or supreme rulership—whether God has the right to rule and whether he exercises it in a righteous way and in the best interests of his subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eve believed Satan’s lie. She began to desire the fruit, and then she actually ate some of it. Later she gave some to her husband, and he also ate it. Thus they became sinners. That seemingly simple act was actually an expression of rebellion. By deliberately choosing to disobey God’s command, Adam and Eve rejected the rule of the Creator who had given them everything, including perfect life. Based on Genesis chapters 3-5 Revelation 12:9.

             Well since James in part of the fabulous LGBT community, I imagine his employees (at least some of them) are as well, and meth/coke use is common among fags. Sorry but its true. My roommate is a homo and he rails at least a line or two every single day, and gets drunk just about every night of the week, and every single one of his gay friends are the same exact way.

               He wasn't like this when he first moved in. I've known the guy for almost 15 years, so I'm not gonna just abandon him when he's having problems.

            Add in the comments about, "empowerment" and more imporantly, "trust" (what? who the fuck doesn't trust their waiter(or whatever) when they go out to eat?), and you have a very strange connection to that article indeed...

            Nothing else to add, agree that it's shady af though.
