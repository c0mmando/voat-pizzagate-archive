<p>most of the attacks by my family have been spiritually; evil entities + demons are VERY real. do NOT drink excessively, do drugs or masturbate excessively. all of these things make holes in your aura to let them in even more so they can harm you. they even implant thoughts in your head, for me it is a lot of sexually perverse ones. also many thoughts about my self worth (i.e. telling me i\'m not anything etc) ask your angels everyday to cover you in white light if you think that you\'re experiencing a lot of this. it seriously works. ♥ </p>
<p>please, if anything happens to brandon henry in omaha, nebraska spread my story + fight for justice like i know you all will. i don\'t mean this to come off as a self-serving post; i am trying to get to the point in my life where i will be able to help the light + have a plan of action. </p>

            Try and hook up with Nathan at Lift the Veil youtube channel.  He often has SRA survivors on his show and gives them an audience.  In this way it provides a level of protection on your part by getting your story out.  Good luck and thanks for sharing.

            Wear camo and your enemies will have a harder time locking on to you mentally. Failed lock on will reduce your evil encounters because they cant pin point your exact location. Plan your day and happiness will become present.

            Hi there Brandon. Welcome to Voat! I am giving this an "Unverified" flair because we have no way of corroborating your story and do get a lot of shills making fake posts in here, so that is our policy. It's no judgement of you, personally, just the way we handle survivor tales that haven't been backed up with supporting information like police reports or news articles or that kind of thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many survivors here. I hope you find it a great place to talk with others. :-)
           </p>
           <p>
            One word of warning...there are also nefarious characters who are paid to be here to sow distrust and confusion. We only ban those who violate the subverse and Voatwide rules due to the Voat commitment to free speech, so it's difficult to stop them. They often groom new users via private message where the old timers on this board can't see and call out their BS, so we recommend staying vigilant and keeping conversations public as much as possible where others can watch your back.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for contributing. :-)

             You are a complete idiot. You promoted Q even though nobody knows who is behind it. You promoted it and Stickied it.  You promoted that sealed indictments were going to lead to massive arrest. And how would you verify an SRA victim? Explain.

              In your dreams, Death. I put the list in the sidebar along with the link to the human trafficking arrest list so that we can all keep track of whether the claims made by Trump, Q, Bannon, Steve Pieczenik, and Assange bear fruit. Wanna try to explain how my making this easy for people to track "discredits" me?

            You sound like you are overwhelmed and lack support. I am asking God to send you strength and the people you need to move forward in a life that is not filled with fear. I hope you will find a way to be safe. We all keep talking about needing people to come forward but the biggest thing lacking is a support system and way to keep them safe. Perhaps you should think about being part of a movement that provides that for fellow victims. Whatever you do, value your life. You didn't make it here to let them take you out.

            Brandon - seek out Sara Ruth Ashcraft on Twitter or Gab.  She is the most accessible and most knowledgeable survivor of SRA.  I believe she is from the midwest as well.  Thanks for sharing.  God bless.

            I don't believe him, he may have been abused, but he's suicidal. He's happy at the idea of dying, especially if it could further some cause, MeToo, or pizzagate. In particular, he has a positive disposition toward his family which I find unexpected if his claim is true. He focuses on his potential method of death way too much. He has gotten financial support from FB for saying he is a SRA survivor.  Call 1-800-SUICIDE or 1-800-273-TALK and get help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a transcript of one of his videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hey there, my name is Brandon Henry, and I am a satanic ritual abuse survivor,
and I am currently living in Omaha Nebraska.
And um, as I have told you guys before on here, like, my family is very involved with
this whole plot against me, I guess, which I totally forgive them for, and I understand, um.
I just want to make my intention very clear, that it is not to defame anyone, and not to
hurt anyone's livelihood, it is not to expose anyone. I just want to live my life in peace.
Um. So yeah, I am currently working towards that, I have, uh, sort of a plan of action
I am working through. Um, it is very difficult, I feel kind of threatened when I'm, you know,
when I leave my apartment, uh, for instance yesterday there was a green Honda Accord in the 
parking lot waiting for me with someone inside of it, um. And also when I went out to the 
parking lot on a separate instance two men in a silver Toyota Corolla approached at a rapid speed,
so um, I'm just naming those so you will have facts and evidence if anything does happen,
but um, you know, one or both of those could be nothing, but when you are in this situation it
does make you have anxiety about sort of a lot of things. So, but something tell me they weren't
nothing. But, yeah, I want to thank you guys for your ongoing prayers, for your thoughts, for
your consideration. Um, I recently launched a new website, it is brandonhenryomaha.com 
please go check it out, um, it has, um, you know, just some more of my life story, I feel like
I'm not very good yet at speaking, obviously on here yet, but I'm um working towards getting better.
So, yeah, if anything does end up happening to me, if my life ends up being ended, please know
that every thought, that everything I am saying is true. The way to confirm that I am a big
crazy liar is for nothing to happen to me. So if something ends up happening to me you all will
know that, um wow, this is all real. So, I'm pleased if anything does happen to me, work towards
more victims being able to speak out, and you know, if I couldn't save my life, you know,
maybe you guys can help someone save theirs. So, um, yeah.
I think today's a good day, I'm so grateful for the oxygen I am breathing, for all the material
things that I have that don't really matter, for all of my friends on social media, all of my friends
on Facebook sending me support and love, thank you so much. It honestly means more than you know to me.
So, yeah, today is September 7th 2018, and that's kind of where I am at with this whole masonic deal,
in Omaha Nebraska. So, yeah, yesterday I actually blocked my grandmother's phone number, um, 
she has been financially supporting me, basically my entire life, which she dangles over me, sorry,
my cat's playing, he's playing with the bed, um, but yeah, she's kind of used her finances as a
means of control my entire life. And she said, basically, "I saw on your portfolio website that you
are talking about all this cult stuff, what is up with that?" and I said, you know the first time I 
made up a big lie about it, but I'm not doing that anymore, and then I texted her, "yeah, you know It
said it because it's all true" and I blocked her phone number, I don't care about her response, like,
I just don't care, um, she knows the truth, I do as well, as does my entire family. So, yes, please
keep the truth movement going, please tell everyone you know about this, that you feel comfortable with,
I realize that is a dark subject matter, it makes, you know, it can make people uncomfortable, 
which is understandable, but um yeah, this is a reality in America which we are going to have to face
at one time or another, so I don't know if you guys remember pizzagate from the 2016 election, but
that was a real thing if you look into the facts and check them and look into the evidence, that the
media doesn't want you to look into, um, that you will find, um, some startling truths in there,
I mean, I can't say it's true because I'm not a part of it, but I would say at least that there are
some very questionable things that we as a people could look into, so um, buy yeah, yet again, I don't
own any firearms, I have no intention of ever owning any weapons, I don't own any knifes sharp enough to
cut my flesh, I hardly own anything since I moved, so, if there's any suicide or anything like that,
or any car accident, please know that foul play is involved, and it is at the hand of the Omaha police
department, and the masonic shadow government here along with my family, so, yes, thank you guys very 
much and I am grateful for today.

            What they never expect is for humans to eat demons.

            They need you to fear in order to feed. But that opens them up. Reverse it and suck them dry. Eat their fear. They get so confused. Force them start eating each other. They cannot help it. Then you own them, have a direct link to their former master’s minds (whom they want to betray anyway) and can feast on the minds of their masters energies at will.
           </p>
           <p>
            Become the Draco they want to follow and own their corrupt masters that the slaves long to betray. Then consume them all with dragon fire!

            Hi Brandon, I listened to your YouTube video you linked in a comment on voat over a week ago. You're in my prayers &amp; what you're doing is a hugely brave thing! Agreeing with others, it's imperative if you can to get a support system in place. You're in such a heavy demonic area that it would be best to get away from there. Keep your Bible with you at all times &amp; be sure you're meditating in God's word every day. Praying for your safety, healing, &amp; comfort!!

            Hi Brandon. I hope that you have some kind of support system in place that you can trust. Going public on a site like this with videos on your website is one good move to get your story publicized and hopefully dissuade any malefactors to show their hand. You are blessed to have Faith as a support. We'll keep you in our prayers.

            Hi Brandon.  Do you have to live in Nebraska?  This is not a good place for you, considering your SRA.  I am presuming you have heard of the Franklin Scandal and also LE is seriously compromised.  Have you had any dealings with Law Enforcement?  I am assuming you belong to a generational cult.  Do you know anyone you can live with or near in another state?  From the sound of it, you are experiencing some serious problems and just in case you need to seek out Witness Protection, so this has me worried.
           </p>
           <p>
            You need to be very careful as to who helps you.  You should be getting help from a  trained SRA therapist.  They are the best.  I have this from a friend that is SRA Victim.  Also, others do not know what kind of information you can handle.  It can create serious flashbacks from the past.  Be very careful.

            Wow Brandon, you have really put yourself out there. Thanks for sharing. Please stay safe, and I'm not sure what your religious beliefs are but if you're looking for higher protection start reading the Bible. Keep us updated on how you are doing!

             thank you very much! jesus christ is so real + with me everyday as is archangel michael + hundreds of other divine light beings. a more powerful psychic healer than i confirmed this for me a few weeks ago. ♥
            </p>
            <p>
             i did not share my story for so long out of fear of being judged but once your life is on the line you give no fucks anymore. my grandmother who raised me was financially supporting me for a long time + i didn't want to rustle any trouble up + stop the money.
            </p>
            <p>
             at this point in my life the money is not worth the mental + spiritual abuse, i shouldn't be surrounding myself with that toxicity anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
             anyway, thank you for your comment ♥

              Simple test: Ask the spirits if Jesus Christ was born in the flesh and died for real and rose again in the flesh. That's the Biblical test of spirits and Angels.

               I've never understand the angels thing. Why do people bother asking the servants when their master said come to ME for whatever you need? Jesus said ask for things in HIS name. The Bible even instructs us to do this. The angels/white light/psychic healing etc just sounds like witchcraft to me, like a wicca or white witchcraft, but there you go, still witchcraft. I avoid such things, again, as the bible instructs. Not that i follow the bible to the letter, i get tempted the same as anyone else. Still, my point remains.

              I can't imagine what you are going through with all of this and how you find to deal with it. I just have to tell you, that what you describe is not Jesus. This is another spirit.  Jesus is founded on the truth of the written word of God, and anything psychic, and mediums, any light beings or other spirits are unlikely to be from God. You can only know by testing against God's word. We know that we're warned
              <em>
               against
              </em>
              going to mediums, and we're warned that Satan will disguise himself as a being of light. Both of these things send a big red flag with what you said.
I write this because there is a real Jesus and a real peace that comes through him, but it's from him and him alone.

              <p>
               i get what you guys are saying + i respect it. there were many months this summer before i fully accepted the truth of my family history where my mom + grandma would pretend to be of the light.
              </p>
              <p>
               however, my angels have guided me to sources of true divine light work + i have felt jesus here with me during their sessions! one of which i saw the largest orb i’ve ever seen above me...it was nearly the size of my entire ceiling...i never felt so much love + light....more than any dark energy could ever provide. jesus is such a calming, powerful energy.
              </p>
              <p>
               i have also seen archangel michaels orb more times than i can count. of course they are with us if we see them or not, but for me, i am skeptical and used to be in a lot of fear so seeing helps me. also, it runs in my bloodline to be clairvoyant...i am simply going to work for the light. thank you for your warnings though guys, i totally get what you’re saying +where you’re coming from.

                Hey Brandon - thanks for your kindhearted reply. I see you are set on the course that you are on, so if I may leave you with one thing to chew on later, it's this:
               </p>
               <p>
                From all of my knowledge, those beings, all of them, are deceitful and masquerading in false light. I believe I know what you are speaking of, and while I never went as far in my darkest times as to encounter any personally, I have heard from people who once did. At some point you may see cracks in the "peace" or contentment they provide. I whole-heartedly agree with what Rawrniation said below, including how to test the spirits. So I only ask that you keep that in mind should you decide on it later. Test and see. Likewise, call on the Lord and see.
               </p>
               <p>
                So I've said my bit. Thanks for reading, and stay safe.

               I am in agreement with you, but I also feel life and light from his words.
              </p>
              <p>
               Simple test: Ask the spirits if Jesus Christ was born in the flesh and died for real and rose again in the flesh. That's the Biblical test of spirits and Angels.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know exactly what the church has done to the Bible over the centuries, but I know that Seek and ye shall find is true.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus and God are much more capable than we give them credit for.
              </p>
              <p>
               All that said, getting away from anything involving psychic anything is a great idea!

Watch his interactions with defango before.
He’s been exposed and is trying to garner points and be a self proclaimed gate keeper.
The guys has changed his stripes many times, a tool.
