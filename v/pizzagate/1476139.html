            I think some seasoned Youtubers ought to set aside the evidence for the pedophile ring, and start churning out video after video detailing all the ways the MSM and social media - including Facebook, Twitter, Reddit - are trying to keep a lid on things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Make the story about censorship, and the fear the MSM clearly has in letting out the facts, and not the investigation itself. Two things result: one, it raises eyebrows, and people begin asking what the networks are afraid of...and two, they have a harder time shutting your channel down or deleting your videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they won't let us make the story about pedophile rings, then let's make the story about the fear of the MSM.
           </p>
           <p>
            No mention of CPP, no mention of pedophilia, just be non-specific and start cataloging the actions of "trusted" news sources - the WaPo article, accusations of Russian spy rings with no evidence, social media shutting people down for mentioning CPP or pizzagate, the whole "fake news" narrative...etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            People will, incidentally, start looking into Pizzagate if the story of the MSM's censorship becomes more prominent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, I'm not saying people should stop researching, just that we need some good Youtubers to start pumping the word out on the suppression, taking the fight to them rather than being reactionary. We need full-length documentaries, running through every instance of censorship, thoughtfully and carefully put together.
           </p>
           <p>
            Powerful people don't try to shut up liars. They try to shut up truth-tellers, and most folks know this instinctively.
