            Or something they did last night to put into a scene? Think about it from a psychological perspective as to the writers intent. If you wrote something tomorrow morning, what would you write about?

            It didn't sit well with me when I saw it, yet you of coarse should not watch such things if you are sensitive. The people behind the writing and such of coarse, there is an agenda. At the same time, this type of reaction, sounds like a trigger that you saw a piece of truth in humanitys history where this type of brutality was not just on a TV, it was in the streets of regular society. Now it is hidden, but the truth is, as this subject keeps unraveling, this brutality has been in our society for as long as we can look back. This still goes on not just on a TV. Monsters know how very well to hide in plain site and stay hidden and spreading this brutality internationally and right under our noses. I was made to watch and participate as a child in those type of brutality acts like the child and his family in this show, and it went on in the "nothing to see here, all is perfectly normal" suburban soccer mom town in Northern California. It makes sense why it is on our TV shows now although I don't agree with it, but these people will always show truth from the past or give you an insight into plans for the future.

            Did you expect rainbows and sunshine from a scene that takes place in Hell? I feel like that's an important detail in understanding why this scene is so gruesome. I'm not saying that makes any of it right, but to intentionally leave that out of your wall of text seems disingenuous.

            It was rating extremely low. It only got renewed because of the kikes and subversion involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's edgy bullshit derived from the Quentin Tarantino period of the 90s. The Harvey Weinstein era.
            <br/>
            The comic's writer essentially just goes to the same well every time. Good Goy Gen X "hip" cynicism
            <br/>
            masquerading as wokeness, with liberal sprinklings of lowbrow ("Le Deep") pop culture references.
            <br/>
            His crowning glory has to be "Crossed". His version of a zombie outbreak style of story.
            <br/>
            I don't recommend looking it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately there are a lot of goys who lap this stuff up like it's mana from heaven.
            <br/>
            But the show's ratings showed while those numbers will keep comic books running for years,
            <br/>
            it's an insignificant number for a TV production. And it's actual cultural penetration is nonexistent.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's worth noting that much of what we're seeing in the media at large that runs the most obvious
            <br/>
            cultural subversion game are being propped up by outside sources right now. Reviews are being

            outright faked or bought. Fraudulent reporting and PR stunts everywhere.

           <p>
            This shit is failing. And the more they artificially bouy it up, the more it annoys and red pills normies.

            Sounds Disgusting. Why I never watch any newer movies or sitcoms.  PBS no cable  We used to have Netflix but only watched Mystery type shows or Film Noir.  People need to stop going to movies in the theaters.  When they stop the flow of money it will stop.  Stop Netflix don't go see their movies.  You can rent older cartoons for your kids.  There are ways to get around this stuff.  We just need enough people to do it.  Kill the Profit.

             Being broke will stop even stupid people from going to the movies. 6 bucks used to get a movie and a huge bucket of popcorn (small/large soda with real sugar, depending on year and town). They even had real butter flowing through the metal tube sprayers. I still miss local dairies. That's what they did, destroy the country one piece at a time.

              The simple things of life.  They are quickly disappearing if not gone.  There are movie houses that play older movies or you can rent and invite friends.  We can't let them rule our lives.  Now you see Craft Beers all kinds of fancy things not seen before, people are spending money when they can't afford these things.  They forgot picnics in the park or family picnics and we used to just eat hot dogs on the porch summer nights with ice cream or old fashioned popcorn with movies at home.  We hardly went to the show.  Could not afford it.  Don't lets get started on Baseball Games.

                Yep.  They do.  And they are working on it every minute of the day.  They already have Muslim Sharia schools all over and there are two in Chicago.  Look up the Varkey Foundation they are connected to GEMS Education and the Clintons.

                  Not in Chicago.  Just have been researching it on and off since Rahm was with the Clintons. Also since I like a fool fell for Obama.  Researched St. Louis for a few months here on and off so now back to Chicago again.  So much to look into there, especially after what we have all found out about the Deep State. Obama Rahm Podestas Hillary Jarrett they all have stake in Chicago.  More people should look into it.

                   The entire town is a money stealing ponzi scheme, and yet they are still broke. The rest of the state would be better off separating it for tax reasons, if no other.

                    My friend is about ready to give up and move. Don’t blame her. She is sick of it. She told me this week there was a lawsuit and a family won 16m. A cop shot their Mom. She says there have been many of these. I don’t have time to look them up. To busy with the Missing Kids. You are right I am sure.

                     I have only been there on work, and it cost me so much money and stress that I will most likely never go back again. Tell your friend that there is a better place anywhere elsewhere.

                      She is one that puts everything off, I do worry about her.  She still has family so............  I know what you mean.  We visited NY and though I cried when I left, loved it so.  It really is not a place for normal people to live.  Smaller cities are the best.

                       It is not normal for people to move around much at all. This is just a symptom of economic /social manipulation. Notice politicians want to tax everything, but fail to explain the natural exodus of such decisions. How can a continually travelling workforce be good for the environment? Keeps the workforce broke though.

                        Families have been broken up because people need to move for jobs. People are all over the place. This causes a lot of heartache. Also children need grandparents. Very sad. Very hard for all.  Seems people are Just accepting it when in actuality it was never normal.
