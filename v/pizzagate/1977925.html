            Thanks for bringing this thing up. Just triggered some questions that were bugging me for a while.
           </p>
           <p>
            That Bauman guy's tweets shortly after that thread was posted were suspicious. As if that thread struck a nerve with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            This asks a question, the one that's been bugging me in all this.
           </p>
           <p>
            If that guy DOESN'T have blood ties to the group, WHY did that thread freak him out?
           </p>
           <p>
            Afterall, several suspicious characters, including David Brock were board members.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then it hit me. What if it was right to look into Bauman Foundation....but it was done "for the wrong reason"?

            I take no offense to this comment. Its cool.
           </p>
           <p>
            My own computer skills are well...shitty. I've said this before in the past. I'm also doing all my postings from my phone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since I want to help bring these bastards to justice and protect the "little ones" despite said ineptitude, What I do is try to look for suspicious things and bring them to voat's attention, or try to analyze what we do have to connect dots, based on the concept of "flip the chess board". If I get a tip, I bring it here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think along the premise of a "markerlight".
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I keep an eye out for possible false flags and bring them to voat's attention. I do that because I want to protect you and your work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I admit, Bauman Foundation was not as successful as I hoped it would be. I'm not by any means perfect. IIRC, the primary theory failed, but what we DID find has potential to be useful. IE the secondary objective of finding more potentially useful information to search was more successful than the primary objective.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd say the most successful thing I marked for attention was the Arcus Foundation.

            hompson was appointed Director-General on 21 May 2004.[5] He succeeded Greg Dyke, who resigned on 29 January 2004 in the aftermath of the Hutton Inquiry. Although he had originally stated he was not interested in the role of Director-General and would turn down any approach from the BBC, he changed his mind, saying the job was a "one-of-a-kind opportunity". The decision to appoint Thompson Director-General was made unanimously by the BBC Board of Governors, headed by the then new Chairman Michael Grade (another former chief executive of Channel 4). His appointment was widely praised: Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell, Shadow Culture Secretary Julie Kirkbride and Greg Dyke were amongst those who supported his selection. He took up the role of Director-General on 22 June 2004[5] (Mark Byford had been Acting Director-General since Dyke's resignation). On his first day he announced several management changes, including the replacement of the BBC's sixteen-person executive committee with a slimmed-down executive board of nine top managers.

            I can tell you each of these FAMILIES, although british, have American counterparts that have embedded themselves in all aspects of American business, commerce, and media. This means even here in America, ALL THESE BRITISH FAMILIES CONNECT, and many of them are duel citizens who work in state or government positions.

            The points on the Map connecting the dots across the US are the LEAST important. What makes the "Story" is who the people are in connecting the dots. With an accuracy that frightens, most of the time these individuals (families) connecting the dots are ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY those employed by State, County, and Federal agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            THAT IS THE REAL STORY and should be everyones focus.

            Great idea and appreciate you picking this up!  From what I was reading he had issues at the BBC..BUT would be interesting to look at his circle who promoted on to head the BBC...believe there were several names mentioned in just the Wiki about him...if we have ANON's on here, would be interesting to see if he popped up in any of the dark web stuff you were outing last year....

            <s>
             the CIA's Press Office
            </s>
            the Washington Post starts shitting on the guy too. I bet he's given the boot by the end of the year.
           </p>
           <p>
            And to any good people at the CIA please for the love of Christ can you stop associating with the Pedophile Elite and their Pedophacracy?
           </p>
           <p>
            I knew you had to take some moral shortcuts during the Cold War but holy fuck this is insanity squared. The absolute best thing right now is to bring this Cluster Fuck down immediately. Do not pass Go. Stop it now. Plea bargain, make some deals, do whatever you can do. You're playing with high explosives here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The evidence is so fucking toxic unless you control its dissemination things get ugly. And don't for one SECOND think whoever you've lined up to help carry out some martial law is going to follow orders when THEY learn about the toxic cesspool of depravity that underpins all of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Get it? You're severely mistaken if you think this thing goes viral and people in Law Enforcement and the Military are going to stay on side. They'll be 10 TIMES as rip shit as the normal American.
