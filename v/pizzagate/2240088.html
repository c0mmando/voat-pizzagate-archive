<p>“Shortly after becoming the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, the Washington Post published an article attacking me, my wife, my Foundation for Moral Law in Montgomery, Alabama, on my salary,” Moore announced to a crowd of about 100 supporters at the Huntsville Christian Academy:</p>
<p>They said I took over a million dollars. There were not a million dollars. I wish I had a million dollars. In fact, I didn’t take the money they awarded me for a salary because I had my own recognition and opted to embrace that salary myself and not take anything from the foundation. So my salary collection wasn’t so much. Over eight years it would have been about $87,000 a year—so I had to take a note and a mortgage for the rest of it. But I never got the money. So, the Washington Post finally realized this after they published an article saying my wife and I got a million dollars, saying, “you didn’t pay taxes for what you didn’t get.”</p>
<p>The audience laughed before Moore continued.</p>
<p>“So I was wondering where they got that idea—they talked about control of the money, we didn’t have control of the money,” Moore said. “Anyway, to make a long story short, they kind of failed. So about 30 days before the general election, just the other day, the Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign. These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue—and for which they will be sued.”</p>

<p>It\'s so funny, but that stupid salary item was what some crazy shill kept posting -- spamming my threads with that nonsense even after it\'s proven to be fake news!</p>',

            The Republican National Committee is withdrawing its support for besieged Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, leaving him increasingly isolated as he confronts charges of sexual misconduct with teenagers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The RNC is pulling out of a joint fundraising agreement it had with Moore, according to a senior party official briefed on the decision. It is also canceling a field program it had set up ahead of the state’s Dec. 12 special election. The committee had about a dozen paid canvassers in Alabama working for Moore. It will no longer transfer any money to the race.

                He was in his 30's when he was cruising that mall for underage twat. But I guess that's perfectly alright with you.

            My fellow conses aren't going to like me for this, but the man has basically admitted dating high school girls, one of the accusers is only fourteen. If that is true, that is abhorrent, whether he touched her inappropriately or not! What 30-something year old man of good moral character does this? Where is the outrage? I'm disgusted. If I have the facts wrong by all means correct me, but this is what I am reading.

             The allegation of what happened when the girl was fourteen-year-old is completely troublesome. If he did that, he should resign, but as any cop would notice, there's no MO here. It's why I doubt it happened. I really don't care about him dating a seventeen-year-old and kissing her twice. There's no hint of grooming of pushing her into something she wasn't ready for. She even admits she was thrilled, her mother was thrilled and gave permission for them to date. If it bothers you, we think differently. There was no sex. No pushing her into sex so for me, it's not an issue. The Olympic doctor who abused the gymnastic team is an issue for me. As are the allegations of the women being raped by various directors in PedoWood. That's violence ... that's sexual intimidation and job intimidation. Not going to argue with you about this. If you think it's wrong, don't let your daughter date  thirty-two-year-old man.

             But privately, Moore had arranged to receive a salary of $180,000 a year for part-time work at the Foundation for Moral Law, internal charity documents show. He collected more than $1 million as president from 2007 to 2012, compensation that far surpassed what the group disclosed in its public tax filings most of those years.
When the charity couldn’t afford the full amount, Moore in 2012 was given a promissory note for back pay eventually worth $540,000 or an equal stake of the charity’s most valuable asset, a historic building in Montgomery, Ala., mortgage records show. He holds that note even now, a charity official said.

             A Post spokeswoman told AL.com that the paper would not be issuing any corrections because its reporting is solid, adding that the campaign declined to comment when contacted by the Post.
"We stand by our reporting on the compensation Judge Roy Moore has received from the Foundation for Moral Law. On Oct. 11, we reported that his compensation -- in excess of $1 million -- included a promissory note currently valued at $540,000. A story published Oct. 20 reported that the foundation did not disclose on income reports to the IRS that it had given Moore the promissory note as a guarantee of payment, according to the charity's own documents. Five tax law and accounting specialists told The Washington Post that it appears the guaranteed payment should have been reported as compensation, in part because it could be cashed in on demand," said Kristine Coratti Kelly in an email. "Moore and his campaign have declined to answer The Post's questions about these matters."

             A man's life is being destroyed. That really is not amusing. If he's guilty, let the chips fall where they may, but if he's not, it really is no joking manner.

              Agreed. If he is being falsely accused then the accusers should stand trial. Sadly there's probably no way to prove what happened. That said he claims he DID date teens with the mom's permission. Mom needs to come forward and explain what the HELL she was thinking, and Moore should step down whether he touched the girls or not in my opinion. That is not the moral conduct of a leader.

                Should step down because he is not fit to be a leader. Sets himself up to be a morally upright man and isn't one. Represents the Christian right?! BARF. What a hypocrite. If he has any love for Jesus he would step down.
