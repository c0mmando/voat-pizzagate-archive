            The day before (video linked at the bottom of this post) video came out, Joe Biggs (previously of Infowars) made a tweet with a video showing a secret menu that had "supposedly" been hacked from Comet Ping Pong, allowing people to pay to torture children. Problem is, that document had already been debunked, in
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate
            </a>
            weeks before, and wasn't originally even allegedly stolen from comet, but from wethepizza. Read about the document here.

            I watched it unfold in real time when it first came out. It was 2 guys that had the most popular thread on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate
            </a>
            for 2 days. They started cracking when being pressured by the community for real evidence, kept postponing proof, talked about sharing 2gb of encrypted files that they supposedly stole from inside some pizza shop (wethepizza) they claimed was being used for child trafficking. Constantly changed their story and backtracked, avoiding answering any real questions. Then they said the cloned the pizza shops hard drive and were going to share the torrent of the encrypted hard drive. Over the course of two days they led the community on a wild goose chase, then apparently posted real CP (which was moronic). I'm not saying you have to believe it's fake, but everyone, including the the most prominent investigators/researchers came to the logical conclusion that they were either shills trying to get the subreddit shut down, or larpers just leading everyone on. Here is a file containing all pertinent threads from the
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate

            subreddit, read the threads and come to your own conclusions. But I watched it all unfold over two days, and personally believe it was fake as well.

            Below is a video with Biggs reading the fake document. SGTReport needs to take this video down, since the document has been proven false.
