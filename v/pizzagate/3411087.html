            Side note based on some comments: I realize that Wikipedia is controlled opposition. However, their rules still allow for the possibility that normies (non-elites) can get some truth onto the site. If you're new, it won't be easy. But for established Wikipedia editors who are really careful, it IS possible to get facts to stick. You might have to be very diligent as well, going back and reinserting stuff every now and then. But really, it is now our only option as far as controlled media is concerned (ie, the only media we really see thanks to Google's ownership of searches) to be able to have a voice.  And when you realize that Wikipedia is the top result on almost every topic, the possibility of getting some truth posted onto the site becomes very meaningful.

            Larry's sudden wokeness is absurd. Wikipedia is filled with pedophile editors who have been rewriting history and protecting their tribe for decades. Even executives at Wikipedia have made controversial statements seeming to be indifferent or even support pedophilia. Sanger's "Holy Crap. This is real." sudden fake shock/anger sounds like every other lying criminal who knows his time is up and is pretending to suddenly have a conscience and care about other people. He sees the hammer Trump is about to drop and is panicking to cover his own ass.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I rarely use all caps, but I am going to this time because I feel like screaming..." Good god. Totally contrived and pathetic. Just look at his picture on his Wikipedia page. He reeks of psychopathy and pedophilia.

             So, you took a year long break from voat and came back to just copy/paste the same comment twice in the span of five days? Sanger has been gone from wikipedia for almost two decades now and on top of that,
             <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/10104946">
              there is this
             </a>
             from 2010.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              This followed a complaint about "child pornography" to the FBI from another Wikipedia co-founder.
             </p>
             <p>
              In early April, the estranged co-founder, Larry Sanger, reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI, alleging that the organisation was "knowingly distributing child pornography".
             </p>
             <p>
              He later clarified that his concern was not about photographs of children, but "obscene visual representations of the abuse of children", which can include drawings and sculpture.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             You aren't wrong about wikipedia but as far as I can tell you are way off base regarding Sanger. Unless you have some actual evidence to present that shows otherwise it looks to me like you are spreading fake news.

              Glad to see you taking such interest in my posting history. Unfortunately, there is not enough for you to make a full-time career out of it so you will need to find another occupation.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for "spreading fake news", don't be one of the shoutdown crowd. Totalitarians are not cool.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sanger is free to defend himself, and his access to the bigger and louder propaganda forums is much greater than mine. He doesn't need you to defend him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Our job here is to detect the hidden and highly guarded corruption of pedophilia, not guard the reputations of public figures who cast themselves as heroes. "Actual evidence" is precisely the thing that is hard to come by since pedophiles work so diligently to cover their tracks and utilize all the high powered tools of government and technology to do so.
             </p>
             <p>
              Given that it is the strategy of some pedophiles to give themselves public cover by endorsing charities and loudly denouncing child abuse, etc., Sanger's public declarations should be suspect. Remember this guy?
              <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-says-columbia-student-who-campaigned-against-sexual-violence-had-child-porn-enticed-minor">
               https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-says-columbia-student-who-campaigned-against-sexual-violence-had-child-porn-enticed-minor
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              I also observe the very calculated and artificially sincere tenor of his recent posts. Another big red flag.
             </p>
             <p>
              And why, after decades of scandal and the well-known associations between big-tech, government, military intelligence, and media and their the deeply suspicious links to pedophilia rings is Sanger just coming out now with surprise and shock? Yet another big red flag.
             </p>
             <p>
              We'll see in the end what team he's playing for.

               I just find it interesting when people come back to pizzagate after long absences. Particularly when their first two comments are casting aspersions at a notable person who is currently shining light on the topic.

               Right. Actual evidence. By all means dig some up if you can find it. Thus far all you've done is state an opinion with no factual evidence and you are asserting it as true.

               Those are facts. Any number of conclusions can be drawn from them. Most of them erroneously. Did you consult a crystal ball whilst reading his tweets?

                I am stating my opinions as if they are my opinions. Opinions and facts are not the same. Do yourself a favor and learn the difference. If opinions always required well documented facts to back them up then none of us would be entitled to opinions. You simply don't like my opinions so you are looking for excuses to silence them. Very weak.

                Larry is a public figure, and has contributed significantly to the modern digital information architecture of the world. His thoughts/opinions carry much greater weight than yours or mine. So his sudden entry into the discussion, despite having much greater potential access to the underlying truths for many years, should be met with suspicion, even if we can leverage his comments to help bring light to our own cause.
               </p>
               <p>
                Larry's been absent from the debate for 9 years. I have been absent for 1 year. And if you are so interested in my posts then you can easily discover the tenor of my past comments is about finding truth and exposing evil, not playing cover for special interests or personalities.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think your time would be better spent researching big-tech's involvement in power/pedophilia rings rather than seeking to discredit other posters on this site. You might also try sharpening your intuition skills, although this takes life experience and is still not infallible. Best regards.

             <p>
              As per my exchange with SandHog above, I think Larry's "awakening" is a bit suspicious. While most of us think the attention his higher profile persona can give to the topic of Pizzagate/pedophilia is a positive thing, that does not mean that Larry himself should be automatically exculpated.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some would like to cast him as a hero now that he seems aligned with our cause. But I argue that his career and past associations entitle him to greater scrutiny. The tenor of his recent Twitter postings only increases my suspicions. They are strongly contrived and do not read like the average thoughts of a concerned citizen with genuine empathy, but instead as carefully crafted comments intended to convince others that he is genuinely surprised and concerned. In other words, it reads really, really fake. (Reread for yourself and see if you don't sense this.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe he's being genuine and simply does not have a good grasp of natural language or the normal emotional responses of average people (which would not be uncommon for someone with Asperger's for example, which many intelligent people suffer from, such as Bill Gates). But given his familiarity with digital media/communications/etc., I strongly doubt this. Instead it looks like he is awkwardly trying to mimic what he thinks would be the feelings of normal people to the discovery of Satanic pedophilia networks in the highest halls of power. (It's possible Larry even had help from a PR firm to craft his Tweets.)
             </p>
             <p>
              I think an obvious explanation for this would be that he is trying to give himself cover for possible association with bad actors. This doesn't necessarily mean he is a pedophile himself. But it suggests to me he at least knows he's been around and had business dealings with bad people, and now needs to definitively distance himself. So still a good guy in this scenario. But not a moral beacon either.
             </p>
             <p>
              But aside from his comments in 2010 about the Wikipedia forum possibly harboring pedophilia groups, Larry has remained silent on the topic ever since. Meanwhile, the rest of us have been alerted to the situation for many years (Epstein was first sent to prison in 2008), especially awakened when Pizzagate broke in 2016, wringing our hands and shouting to anyone who would listen. So where was Larry's shock and concern during this time? Only once one of the bad guys gets murdered in prison does Larry decide to register his concern and social obligation to root out evil. Strange, no?
             </p>
             <p>
              So you have to ask, does Larry now fear for his own life, and hence his loud Twitter production? Or is he fearing his own indictment? If so, he would not be alone in trying to get ahead of the coming exposure and prosecution that Trump's DOJ is bringing. But is he an actual offender? Or an unwitting accomplice? Or a genuinely concerned citizen? We don't know.
             </p>
             <p>
              I of course would be delighted if Larry were indeed a white night and legitimate advocate and now uses his notoriety and contacts to expose the guilty. But his actions suggest to me a different situation.
             </p>
             <p>
              In terms of Larry's looks, well clearly there is no common look to pedophiles. My comment was a bit extreme. Larry just looks like a garden variety nerd. I am instead keying off of Larry's facial expression/emotional response, which when viewed in light of his Twitter postings, timing, and past associations, makes me deeply suspicious of him. This is intuition working overtime. But in a world where hard facts and evidence of nefarious evil are in short supply, making subtle connections and insights is our most valuable skill.

               It doesn't matter what his motives are, this was meant to let people know that we have an "in" to spread the facts via replies to his tweet, or making additions to pages on Everipedia.

                Yes, we can exploit this situation to our own benefit. But his motives should be very important to all of us, just as motives are most very important to the law, since if it turns out he is actually a bad guy trying to ingratiate himself with the good guys, then we would want his crimes (if any) exposed and justice served. I think we all agree on this point.
