            Any and all sites are suspect of being used for trafficking. KIK, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Dropbox, you name it, it is suspect. These sickos use a plethora of methods and the more we expose, you'll see they are very high up, highly intelligent agents involved in trying to keep this covered up and also creating new pathways and sites and apps for them to exploit for trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            We all have noticed the obvious push to normalize pedophilia in the USA recently. They have no choice but to legalize or at least decriminalize it into a mental disorder, because we are on to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Digital footprints are easy to follow and using gps mapping, companies can cross target ips to localized areas. Catching these people is becoming far easier. The government knows they have to normalize it or stop using it as a control method for wealthy elites to indulge in.

             I dont think the truth has really sunk in to the folks here..
We think we r the norm ...and these abnormalities are hiding in crevaces for us to find out..
The truth is more like the animation movie monster inc..
The elite are running a human cattle farm...and we just woke up to find them carrying out their business as usual ...ie human cattle farming..
            </p>
            <p>
             Us waking up is the abnormality...Us thinking that they will stop theirnhuman cattle farming and imprison their own is the abnormality ...
..all u can do is to first get out of their debt game ..
..then talk about hoping they will get caught ...
Once u get out of the debt g ame u have the power to move the machine...else the machine moves u..or should i say ..Moos u

              Most people do not have a clue about age of consent laws, globally. They have no clue that until early twentieth century marrying 14 year olds was common place between people in their 30's. They have no idea that the word "teen" was developed during the post WWII era. No clue that during the middle ages, local lords, even fathers were obligated to take a girls virginity. No clue that young boys were "schooled" by tutors or nanny's and learned of life long before they could shave.

             There is a Janice that is 69 years old too.  Yes, Hispanics many times name the female Children after the mother just as boys and dads.

              Nothing different than any culture. What I have noticed is that certain Hispanics (broad term) use the next door neighbor's last name. Then they flee.Fake I D.'s are real y'all.
