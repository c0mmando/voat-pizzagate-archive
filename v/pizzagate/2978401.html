            Freemason worship Jehovah-Yahweh as God- Whereas any part of the Roman Catholic Church would declare it as heretical. I wonder which funding or schooling specified the agreement, along with greeting and thanks?

            The Catholic Church predates the Masons considerably.  The Catholic Church was founded in the 7th century AD.  The Masons started in the early 18th Century.  The Masons did start the Mormon Church:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The relationship between Mormonism and Freemasonry began early in the life Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, as his older brother Hyrum and possibly his father were Freemasons while the family lived near Palmyra, New York. Nevertheless, in the late 1820s, the western New York region was swept with anti-Masonic fervor.
            </p>
            <p>
             By the 1840s, however, Smith and several prominent Latter Day Saints had become Freemasons and founded a lodge in Nauvoo, Illinois, in March 1842. Soon after joining Freemasonry, Smith introduced a temple endowment ceremony including a number of symbolic elements that were very similar to those in Freemasonry. Smith remained a Freemason until his death; however, later leaders in the movement have distanced themselves from Freemasonry. In modern times, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the predominan --

            That's not to say that the Masons and the Catholic Church did not spring from the same root.  They did.  The Catholic Church was founded by Gnostic Satanists and split off from the real church.  The Catholic Church very likely started the religion of Islam as a way to conquer non-Catholic Christians in North Africa and the Middle East.  It is also very possible that the Communist Revolution in Russia was used to establish it's power over the Russian Orthodox Church.  It seems it was the Jesuits and Masons working together in Russia.

            Every pope since John Paul I has been a freemason or friendly with them.  Pope John Paul I, when elected, discovered he was surrounded by vipers and sought to clean up house.   He discovered the goings on at Banco Ambrosiano. Licio Gelli was grand master of P2 and was able to inject himself into the Vatican by way of Marcinkus. Banco Ambrosiano was used to make clean dirty money from the mafia. It was then used to line the pockets of friends and mafia bosses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pope John Paul I was handed a sheet with the names of 121 members of the Roman Curia to belong to Masonic lodges. Among others were the names of Cardinals Villot, Casaroli, Baggio, Poletti, Bishop Marcinkus and his confederates, and Pope Paul’s secretary, Pasquale Macchi.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pope John Paul I told Cardinal Vilot, Secretary of State, that he wanted Marcinkus fired immediately.  Pope John Paul was found dead the following morning by a nun.  Vilot took control of the matter and ensured that an autopsy was never carried out.
           </p>
           <p>
            The freemasons managed to have one of their own elected after they murdered John Paul I.  John Paul II, stopped all investigations into Ambrosiano and the people involved.  Marcinkus was then promoted by John Paul II and  was never investigated. He retired to Chicago.  Calvi was found hanging under London's Blackfriar's Bridge. P2 had referred to themselves as 'the blackfriars'.

            It's interesting that you say that the secret rite of the freemasons is sodomy.  This too was a rite of the Knights Templars, the precursors of freemasonry.  It's claimed that their insignia of two men riding on a horse was to portray their poverty.  But it's more telling of their sodomite practices.  Initiates were lead to rooms, which were then locked, and kissing of the navel, the back and the bottom were part of initiation. Initiates, who had to renounce all their worldly goods to the Templars, were instructed that they were to make themselves available at any time to other Templars who wanted to sodomise them. They shared beds and were told to have nothing to do with women.

            Pope , in his Christmas address, asked for pedophile priests to turn themselves in. He looked very subdued. The top 4 levels of freemasonry are satanic...so is the vatican. Would think they have been working together for a very long time. Esp. during WWII...hitler could not have done as well as he did if it were not for the vatican and US funding. Vatican helped transport top scientists and nazi spies to America after the war......vatican is more in control than average people know. All our supreme court justices are catholic, one is episcopalian  but brought up catholic. The jewish one is going..........

            Interesting points about Catholicism:
           </p>
           <p>
            Before the rise of Catholicism about 75% of Christian sects believed in reincarnation. Nowadays that would generate some laughs in the Christian community.
           </p>
           <p>
            The concept of Hell didnt exist until the Catholics taught everyone about fire and brimstone and eternal damnation. Fear has always been a great motivator and control mechanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            That led to the catholic church inventing all of their positions within the church and giving their higher ups some sort of false special spiritual significance.
           </p>
           <p>
            So then they tricked everybody into coming to mass and confessing their sins to the priest for fear of burning in Hell for all eternity...
           </p>
           <p>
            And christianity has never been the same.
Fuck Catholicism and fuck the pope

             There is still dissension between the Orthodox Church and Catholic. Have read that catholics branched off from the Orthodox. Orthodox believe that God reveals himself to man...Catholics think you have to have an intermediary...priests. There are still wars over these two factions. Russia and Greece are both Orthodox and neither country has been treated well by the west. With an intermediary , there is way more control. The vatican controls the world through the city of london....read this link concerning finances..https://geopolitics.co/2019/01/15/more-undeniable-signs-that-the-global-criminal-cabal-is-going-down/?fbclid=IwAR2jSEbxfitm7WvaGOw7CfzM5xynQa7r

              Yes, if you look at the history of the Catholic church, you will see that the Orthodox are truer to Catholicism`s roots.

             The day I learned about the origin of Hell was the day I started to wake up and that was in 2001. Sadly some who say they are Christians still believe in the lie.

            Freemasonry is controlled by the jesuit vatican controlled, so this is them opening up finally to the truth.  They always lied about "banning" freemasonry, but they controlled it from the top to get all their fake "churches" in unity together.  The Bible warns us about deception in the last days, and here's the pope to lead the way to deception.  Catholicism was always a lie.

             Where does that leave the billions who follow the teachings of Christ? They are trying to live up to the ideals. They are good people living honest lives.  Are you making a distinction between Catholicism and Christianity?

              Catholicism is not Christian.  Catholicism didn't even exist for over 300 years after the Bible was complete and compiled.  Catholicism has a false gospel of works that leads to hell (Galatians 1:6-9).  Jesus said the way to heaven is narrow, and few find it.  "Purgatory" doesn't exist, and there is no "pope" or "vatican" in the Bible.  Catholicism is a money and child abuse cult.  It leads to eternal torment in the lake of fire.
             </p>
             <p>
              The true way to heaven and to avoid hell, is by believing in Jesus for eternal life, without adding any of your own works (Romans 4:5).  That easy.  Jesus is God and Jesus died on the cross to pay for all of our sins, and then Jesus resurrected from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).  It is too late to be saved, after death.

              Catholicism says works for salvation, but that leads to hell (Galatians 1:6-9).  Christian says believe in Jesus, without adding any works (Romans 4:5), to get to heaven and avoid hell.  So the two are as different as heaven and hell.  It is too late to be saved, after death.  Jesus is God and Jesus died on the cross to pay for our sins in full, and then Jesus resurrected from the dead.  P.S.  James 2 has nothing to do with heaven and hell.  It is about helping others, which requires works.  But anyone that thinks James 2 is about heaven and hell, believes a false gospel that leads to hell.

             That "ban" was always a deception.  Freemasonry is controlled by the jesuits, so it's all a ruse.  The Bible warns us about deceivers, and they'll lie about everything.
