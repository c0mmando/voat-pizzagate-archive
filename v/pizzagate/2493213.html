<p>Canadian humanitarian worker Peter Dalglish, who helped found the charity Street Kids International, was taken in by police in Nepal on Sunday (April 8), Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>\'Under the guise of community worker, claiming to educate poor kids and provide necessary support, he had been sexually exploiting these children.

<p>Dalglish had been running the Himalayan Community Foundation in the country since 2015. Prior to his stint in Nepal, he had worked for a number of United Nations agencies and was the U.N.-Habitat country representative for Afghanistan.</p>

            UN and WHO and many Charities have been infiltrated by pedophiles.  This is a very sad situation.  They never molest just one child.  There are usually many especially if they are up in years.

            I WONDER IF BLUM KNOWS DALGLISH?
"On April 25, 2009, Blum was honored with the Berkeley Medal by UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgenau in front of the 14th Dalai Lama. The talk was sponsored by his American Himalayan Foundation and the Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley.[4]"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Blum has a strong interest in Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism. In 1981 he attempted to climb Mount Everest from the Tibetan side with Sir Edmund Hillary. He is the chairman and founder of the apolitical American Himalayan Foundation, or AHF, which has given millions of dollars to build hospitals and schools in Tibet and Nepal but has refrained from political involvement with the Chinese control of Tibet.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to the AHF, Blum’s not-for-profit endeavors include service as Trustee of The Carter Center; former Co-Chairman of The World Conference of Religions for Peace; Member of Governing Council of The Wilderness Society;[7] member of the Board of Trustees of The Brookings Institution; member of the Board of Trustees of the American Cancer Society Foundation; member of the Board of Directors of the National Democratic Institute;[8] and the founder and a Member of the Board of Trustees of the Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley. The Center is focused on finding solutions to address the crisis of extreme poverty and disease in the developing world.[9]"

             I saw a very disturbing post on here just recently featuring the Dali Lama and also some Buddhist Monks.  I know some Buddhists and they are very peaceful and loving people, but all religions have been infiltrated. So sad.  If this Blum is connected to the DL I would venture to say he may be compromised as well.  and know of know of Dalglish.
