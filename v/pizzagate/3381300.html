            I searched and couldn't find where anyone brought up Burroughs novel...Naked Lunch. It was banned in 1962 due to obscenity ( child murder and acts of pedophilia). Later the ban was removed.

            The reason I began to look into this started with James Dean, believe it or not. Dean was a good friend of John Gilmore. Gilmore claimed that he and Dean had sexual experiences together. In fact many in the gay community say that Dean was the first gay icon. During the Beat Generation in the 1960's Gilmore was befriended by Burroughs.  Gilmore was also a friend of Marilyn Monroe.
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            To make it in Hollywood one must sell their soul, and body. No doubt in my mind Dean was allowed to rise to stardom because of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway getting back to the book by Burroughs, it was believed that some of it was based on his life experiences. I have not read it, but would like to know if he observed or was involved in the child murders or pedophilia.

            Nobody needed you to tell them there's an agenda to make our kids gay and trannies (if nothing else so they won't procreate).

            They need you to tell them organized international Jewry is the one doing it.
