            There is no doubt Alex Jones was threatened somehow but he and everyone involved in pizzagate knew who they were taking on. This is a battle on many fronts, primarily to stop the suffering of the children, but also on the alt-media. Every battle needs a hero and this was Alex Jones chance to prove himself to be that hero but alas Alex you obviously are not.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand that his foe was the elite, a David and Goliath fight but this battle is one of good v evil, light v dark and who would of thought David would win that one!
           </p>
           <p>
            It would of been an excellent platform in the legal system to air all of the absolutely brilliant research that the fantastic pizzagate community have unearthed to gain public awareness whereas now he has just set it right back.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are no truther, fighter of justice and definitely no hero Alex Jones!
           </p>
           <p>
            I watched a guy on you tube l think called Patrick on AMTV and he tried defending Alex Jones and yes it is easy for me to say what l'd do while not in his situation and l get that. He then talked about Alex 'stuck in a fox hole with the sound of bullets whizzing by', well to me the sounds of the childrens screams of terror would totally blank out the sounds of whizzing bullets.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's my take.

            AJ only apologized to Alefantis.
Explain to us, shill, why you try to turn an apoplogy to Alefantis into a denouncement of pizzagate?
           </p>
           <p>
            He did not denounce pizzagate as a whole.
AJ is THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON in making people aware of a pedosatanic elite.
