<p>Hey guys:)</p>
<p>Seems like I don\'t have enough &quot;CCP&quot; to make a new thread yet, could any of you post this for me? Would be great, here is the full text:</p>
<p>First, a flashback: As you may remember, there was a big pedo network unveiled in Norway some years ago, called Darkroom. About 60 people were arrested, including 2 politicians, a policeman and a judge. The police were traumatized by the videos they found, which showed rape and torture of children, in some cases people had done this to their own children. They also had international connections (so probably some direct links to Pizzagate). Mainstream media outlets have largely buried this story, some of the big international ones even deleted their articles about it.</p>
<p>Now, a few years later, the police have undercovered yet another pedo network in Norway.</p>
<p>Some key facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network has been active since the late 90s</li>
<li>Millions of pics and videos were seized, the victims are most likely children from all over the world </li>
<li>The perpetrators <strong>used secret symbols to identify each other</strong></li>
<li>They used custom-made computers that were encrypted in sophisticated ways, only 20 % of the material has been uncovered from them</li>
<li>One of the perpetrators had written a school book on cryptography</li>
<li>Many of the perpetrators are previously convicted of sex offences, and many of them were involved in places where there were many children</li>
</ul>

           <p>
            As someone else mentioned, one of the couples involved in this case were indeed planning to start orphanages in other countries.

            Yeah a billionaire gambling mogul/Hollywood celebrity made a personal crusade against pedophilia, sounds legit.

             LUKS is just as easy to set up, with the bonus that you're not reliant on the 4.1 or later kernel, which is going to go to shut without Linus.
