<p>I\'ve got an idea I would like to discuss and develop with you. I have made camapigns before so I just thought \'How about using our skills all together?\' What if we do some awarness weeks? Every week another aspect until the whole thing is rolled out. To do that, we have to really do our homework and depend on one another. My plan would be to honour every single information we\'ve got in a well planned order. We would have a special topic every week and work on it like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Youtubers do videos about [Topic]</li>
<li>Bloggers blog about [Topic], </li>
<li>everybody tweets/facebook/etc. on [Topic]</li>
<li>sharing petititions</li>
<li>doing artworks/songs/cartoons/flyer/calls to action</li>
<li>reporting crimes (all together)</li>
<li>witting letters to officials, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>This way we get usefull bundles every week where everyone concentrates on the same facts. Maybe we can shake the crowd this way. 
I suggest that we start with those facts that everybody can agree needs something to be done about.</p>

            Not very good with the computer but would love to help where I can? Tend to read and absorb and try and remind in other posts.

            How easy is it to create a new subvoat? Could mods keep different categories as stickies?

            I think this is a great idea. In fact it is using their own strategy against them. They by the pedo elite, use a repetitive message that does not deviate. If we were to the same thing it would reach more people, the more unified the message the more convincing it will be on a broader range of people across the board. Now I have a question, what is the next step?

            I'm pretty sure Navy seal Craig Sawyer may be able to use a campaign for his network org he is starting. They will have federal,Local law enforcement and political allies within this org. They are strictly going after the Pedogate network.  If everyone starts joining up forces, who knows how powerful this new lobby against pedogate will become.

            I've beent thinking similary to OP, how to organize and what to do for the publicity. So far, things have been going on quite well - Everything done by now has forced the evil side to take hasty and bad moves, so at least let's keep up what we're doing already and let's not make any radical changes for those areas already working.
           </p>
           <p>
            In organizing, we should keep in mind that trolls and shills are eager to join those organizations to mix/frustrate/mislead the work done. In a bigger scale (unorganized) they have less options for this, but of course the good side works slower without organizing. This is a difficult one. The children on top, I guess we could have some organizing to help them faster.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reducing the troll/shill effect, one thing that might be helpful (in organized work) is to aim towards sharing clear claims, making sure in advance that there's no factual proof to debunk those claims. Another (maybe even better) way is to work towards great questions, demanding answers for those. Any false answers trying to debunk a valuable question are easy to recognize. Just my 2 cents. The OP's topic is valuable, thanks.

             Thanks for you 2 cents. I guess you are right about the derailing factor. AND: It's never good to let your enemy know what you are planning to do. Don't act, just think ! ;) So whatever I plan on doing, it should never be revealed somewhere. You are totally right.

              What if we use the MSM's tactics against them? In each topic of the week, we have them use some of the same verbiage or tag line like in the following "Conan O'Brian Exposes Media Scripting" video:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=42920">
               http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=42920
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              That might also help eliminate shills, while providing an organized campaign with repetition.

               what this video (and many others) show is just that they are using the info from a press agency without editing it. We can try to contact some of thoose agencies later on!

              A question I've been asking occasionally, so far left unanswered by any journalist, is:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "The pedophile bust in California in the end of January 2017 was the biggest in the nations history. What stopped it from entering the main stream media news?"
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              While left unanswered, this pretty much proofs the cover up in the media. News value for such a historical fact is huge.

               I was a journalist and political activist myself. I just can explain it from my point of view:
              </p>
              <p>
               I stopped this job because I got frustrated how the whole business (in fact, that it is a business kind of is the problem itself :-) ) was all about incidents and lost the will to give context. Any article I wrote about connections between incidents was rejected by the editors, any article that tried to talk about "divide et impera" and that we would be distracted from the whole history, when I tried to raise some sympathy between political opponents …
              </p>
              <p>
               It's just not wanted. I ended writing for MSM about a year ago. After taking a step outside the scene I noticed who everything had changed from being about information to being a sellable product. I am done with it. There is no use to it. It's another market in capitalism, nothing more.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've lost some friends who still work for the media. They are caught in the bubble I was in. I can not blame them for not recognizing what they are doing.

            Well done! An organized effort will generate an harder impact toward the sleeping public. It's almost April and in my "naive" mind I thought that Podesta would be exposed by now. The Deep-State is showing its full strength in my opinion. So let step it up and Show them our Full Strength. More Discipline Less Drama.

            Hi. I know pizzagate is an American paedophile campaign but paedogate is a global issue. What about organizing a global day of action. I dont know if l'll get flamed for suggesting a group of people who obviously have world wide connections and who have experience at organizing rallys/demonstrations. I'm talking about Anonymous. They have posted loads about pizzagate so are obviously onboard.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a suggestion.

But yes, involving Anonymous would surely be a good thing to do.

            I have extensive call center experience. I am handy at mass robocall/text campaigns. I have access to sources of data to contact. Such as filtering phone numbers down to age range(i.e. Millennial target vs 40+) and location selection etc
