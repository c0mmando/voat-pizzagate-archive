<p>United Arab Emirates have donated a fair amount to the Clinton campaign and also to Childrens charities.  Is there anything in this or is it just good charitable donations and me being cynical.  I haven\'t looked too deep into this but some information below.</p>

<p>&quot;In 2009, the UAE donated an eye-popping $150 million to Washington Children’s Hospital. (Several years later, Otaiba and his wife had a child who also needed critical surgery at the facility.)&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Otaiba’s entrée to D.C. was aided by the UAE’s willingness to pour astronomical sums of money into improving its public standing in the U.S. It now spends more money on lobbying than any other foreign government ($14.2 million dollars in 2013). That’s in addition to hundreds of millions in philanthropic giving (UAE entities have given at least $3 million to the Clinton Foundation alone), as well as billion-dollar investments in U.S businesses. In a 2010 Aspen appearance, Otaiba made a point of remarking that the U.S. “is actually a beneficiary of our oil revenues,&quot; by way of at least $10 billion that the UAE had invested in various US projects just that year. One Washington operative who has the UAE as a client even created a video mashup of Dubai Ports World news footage, which he shows to wealthy Emirati to remind them of the importance of D.C.-oriented giving.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He interviewed Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, the UAE foreign minister who donated a million dollars to the Children’s Ball.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This year, most guests were flown to the event in a private 747; once on the ground, BMWs ferried them to the Emirates Palace Hotel, where there is a gold bullion machine in the lobby&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ambassador began working with Children’s National in 2009, when the government of Abu Dhabi gifted the hospital $150 million, creating the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation.&quot;</p>

            I don't know which one it is, but one of the princes in UAE is a secret humanitarian against Sharia law.

            I do not or can not say if it is the same.

            Also one of them is a major share holder of FOX media, which has been the least biased news media of all the MSM.

            I don't want to look for a common denominator here but somebody else will be, I'm sure, so we better.
