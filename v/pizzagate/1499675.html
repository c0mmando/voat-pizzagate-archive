Podesta\'s custom van matches the van at the site of a child trafficking bust and cover-up in Arizona: <a href="http://www.12news.com/news/local/valley/ahwatukee-house-under-investigation-for-human-smuggling/345861378">http://www.12news.com/news/local/valley/ahwatukee-house-under-investigation-for-human-smuggling/345861378</a>
When the story initially broke on Nov 1, 2016 this (and other reports) said there was a &quot;large scale human trafficking ring&quot; with &quot;north of 12 kids,&quot; &quot;there were implications of African Human trafficking, weapons and immigration violations&quot; and an &quot;International component to this [investigation].&quot;  This report  also said that &quot;video of the raid shows about 6-10 kids leaving the home&quot; and that the bust was conducted by the Postal Service with assistance by Arizona SWAT &quot;because Postal inspectors didn\'t have the manpower to search the house&quot;
This report was filed at 1:48 PM November 1, 2016 and other news stations reported similar &quot;Human Trafficking Headlines.&quot;  Google &quot;Ahwatukee human trafficking&quot; for other local news articles.</p>
<p>The cover up:
After the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia gets involved, the news stories change.  This is incredibly chilling.  Youth are shown getting into the &quot;Molesta Van&quot; and being driven away. One reporter said vans showed up a couple times during the day with multiple youths in the vans.  The drivers would talk to investigators for a few seconds and then be on their way.  Investigators even let drivers enter the house, which is insane for a federal investigation!!!!!  Reporters were not allowed to interview the youth in the vans &quot;because they were minors.&quot;  Also, no one was led away in handcuffs.  See:  <a href="http://www.kgun9.com/news/official-human-smuggling-ring-busted-in-ahwatukee">http://www.kgun9.com/news/official-human-smuggling-ring-busted-in-ahwatukee</a></p>
<p>Almost as soon as local news stations reported on the investigation they were told &quot;to stop saying the Ahwatukee incident was human trafficking.&quot; News articles and video reports were scrubbed and/or updated.  This police action was not reported on national news and new reports were produced with ridiculous headlines such as: &quot;Mysterious Incident&quot; and &quot;Investigation into renter in upscale Ahwatukee neighborhood, no charges have been filed.&quot;  Here is one example: <a href="http://www.12news.com/news/local/valley/investigation-in-ahwatukee-neighborhood/345948940">http://www.12news.com/news/local/valley/investigation-in-ahwatukee-neighborhood/345948940</a> </p>
<p>Clinton called a “lying killer”:
In an interview on August 17, 2016, Governor of Arizona Jan Brewer made national headlines the with the following remarkable statement &quot;people are tired of the lying killer Hillary Clinton.&quot;  See: <a href="http://www.cbs46.com/story/32793953/former-az-governor-brewer-calls-hillary-clinton-a-lying-killer">http://www.cbs46.com/story/32793953/former-az-governor-brewer-calls-hillary-clinton-a-lying-killer</a></p>
<p>After researching child sex trafficking in Arizona, I think we can take Governor Brewer’s statement literally.  Child sex trafficking is booming in Arizona, and we can see there is nothing to stop it because it gets covered-up as evidenced here.  It should also be noted that Governor Brewer created the Arizona Human Trafficking Council to combat human trafficking in Arizona. </p>
<p>The Podesta “Molesta Vans”:
The vans are Merecedes Sprinters and are custom built.  They can carry about 10 people.  Please note that these vans are supposed to be for corporate people who are commuting between NY and DC hotels, yet the vans have purple neon lighting in the ceiling.  I believe this is a reference to “purple light district” where the purple light indicates a sexual preference for gays or transsexuals.  Take this into account since the news reports said there were multiple vans filled with African boys.
We know the &quot;official&quot; route of these vans make several stops at hotels in Chevy Chase district which is at the center of #Pizzagate.  The van owner of the Royal Traveler “Royal Sprinter” line is Andrew Seligman who owns Jumbo Slice Pizza <a href="http://archive.is/ArcHE">http://archive.is/ArcHE</a> (thank you Washington post--at least you’re good for something).  Both Jumbo Slice Pizza and Royal Traveler are legally represented by who else:  Andrew J. Kline.  See <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1487301">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1487301</a> for the full Andrew J. Kline explanation.  So once, again we have arrived at #Pizzagate, Andrew J. Kline and the whole Comet Pizza.  And yes, Jumbo Slice Pizza has all the telltale signs of #Pizzagate, including the usual pictures of babies next to pizza on its yelp page, and esoteric symbols marking the outside of the building.</p>
<p>Podesta the Molesta link:
You remember that sick e-mail about kids providing “entertainment” in a pool at party where adults are recommended to wear sweaters because it\'s cold:  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39175">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39175</a>
Well, it is one of the attendees of the sick farm party, Luke Albee that shared a picture of the &quot;Molesta Van&quot; with Podesta:  See original wikileaks see : <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736</a></p>

              Smoky mountain, satanic caves. Alot of denial and mocking witnesses/victims, where the mocking has to take major hours to type and maintain those blogs. Same as with UK and other cases. From Utube shows and blogs, the ones mocking pedo are often even ones accused or in networks. The amount of TIME to do and keep up the mocking is fanatic. If not true, why the obsessive fanatic focus to exert?

            The YouTube ones fall under "entertainment," to stay up; cartoons, switch clips fast, very schizo like. Some followers use pics of Crowley type descendent's. Their comments ts are quite revealing of their inside jokes and linguistics. Alot, also shared a Utube on a rock band of satanic and posted, " this is great, will have to listen more."

            Timing of CA warehouse and Tenn fires odd. Dolly comes in to save the day. Warehouses are common for clubs, band practice, more. DollyPark and rich drown stores barely touched. Wildlife affected, not a focus, no animal groups coming in as usually do? Smoky mtns, satanic caves.

              Oddly, state ward, orphan kids are never listed for public to know about and adopt. Ones get mad that animal rescuers help shelter animals, yet they can get access to know what most animals are in need. In St Pete area, a black, young teen, under state ward; saw a news camera as state ward kids were taken out for ice cream. He got on news, and beg to be adopted by any race that would be a nice parent.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Anyone else, ever think.its odd that state ward kids are not listed; so public knows who is available to adopt?
            </p>
            <p>
             Find it odd, how many state ward, Fosters are pit on psych drugs. Foster parents must adhere vs choose their own medical route. To adopt, takes years, and cannot foster another kid in many states, if trying to adopt. Kids are in a unhealthy, stressful tension of instability as not even know if good foster parents will be able to adopt. Crime victims with me talk labels and psychotropics are made deficient as crime victims, mental is often blamed. Yet, all top resesrch shows that non violent mental, disabled are top crime victims!!! The dangers of the mental label. The failure to physically diagnose or DC the social construct that is abuse, blaming victim who would often heal and fare quite well, simply in healthy environment and support systems or with accurate physical Dx and medical care.
            </p>
            <p>
             The extensive negative affects of psychotropics, as never proven to cure, and a psychotropic vs human support systems that dehumanize the basic needs of bond/ support in all mammals and humans.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look up the report on chemical restraints, restraint overuse in all medical, hospital, institution settings. Death rate is very high. Also, psychotropics with heart conditions as contradictions, brain organ structure/chemical changes/damages, organ damage of liver/kidneys, causing leukopenia in blood, etc. Dosed as medical safety not adhered to or monitored.

            Here's what this lady a supposed former cia mind control slave has to say about the vans.
            <a href="http://www.gailallen.com/theo/Secrets-of-the-CIA-Global-Sex-Slave-Industry-by-Dr-Sue-Arrigo.html">
             http://www.gailallen.com/theo/Secrets-of-the-CIA-Global-Sex-Slave-Industry-by-Dr-Sue-Arrigo.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            That means that their own vehicle license plate numbers are a weak point for them. If the buyers are front organizations for the bosses and the CIA, then those license plates may be “unregistered” — fakes that do not link up to a real name anywhere in the world. But the numbers still help one track the trade, just like the numbers on the rendition planes.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the van owners are free lance brothel owners — then those vehicle numbers may go to a person who the police might be willing to prosecute in the sex slave business. Like in the drug trade, the police will prosecute the free-lancers to make it look like they are doing their jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The free lancers are often fairly obvious — they are less rich and more varied in appearance both personally and in their vehicles. The rich often buy a vehicle, use it for a few months and then turn around and sell it for another purpose. The VIN numbers could be a problem for them even though the plates are false.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, almost all of the vehicles that the rich use to transport the sex slaves on land in the US are made at one plant in the US. That plant in in Atlanta, I believe. It is the only plant that make vans with holes in the bottom of an enamel type of floor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cattle do not have to be hidden in transport, so this combination of having to be hidden and having to be hosed down and needing some ventilation but good sound-proofing is almost unique in the automotive industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in the 80s she said the vans were chevy products but I could see them having custom made Mercedes now that we are approaching 2017.

            Somehow, and unwillingly, my mind has been working hard to debunk #pizzagate. After weeks lurking here, and initially being convinced of the entire shithole, I had started to reassess my sanity. Raised some serious questions and made myself belief i was trapped in one giant tunnel full of confirmation bias, and cognitive dissonance. This post however brings me back right into the hard and dark reality of pizzagate. It's all real again. Great work!

            Wow! its amazing that whenever a case of human trafficking involving children comes up it somehow gets squashed... the power these people have is incredible - they are the law and there is no accountability for their evils!

            McCain is as crooked as they come...&amp; he'll sell his Mom, wife, whatever for a few bucks! So, I'm certain he is directly involved. No factual proof, other than I've been around him &amp; he's a POS.
I did have a question, though, what's with bringing in the US Attorney of VA? (I know you mentioned it as a red flag above). My question is when child/human trafficking is exposed, is it SOP to bring in US Atty from another state (VA, DC, etc)?
Keep up the great work, everyone! This is ABSOLUTELY incredible &amp; has restored my faith that there are good people out there... :-)
Thanks!

            Why did you bring up the name Jason Derek Brown? Did I miss something in this research? He's not mentioned in any of the articles. I read that he has ties to California, Arizona, and Utah &amp; is wanted for murder. I'm just curious as to how or why Brown (or whatever alias he uses) would be pertinent to this cover-up.
Thanks!

            After searching all emails received by Luke according to sent date,  this email is the one sent the day before the black van pic.  He mentions being on the best bus (van?) and asks Podesta (if he's ever tried it). On way to New York.  It is literally written the evening before.  His next email sent was the picture of black van saying this is the pic.  I definitely  do not think Podesta has anything  to do with this particular  van.  Nor does Luke.  Let's Keep digging guys!  Proud of all of us!

            I think that you made a mistake, in that the vans appear to be different. I'm involved in the film industry, and the first van appears to be different, in that it appears to be taller and longer. That's just my estimation, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anybody been able to identify the brand of van in the video? My computer is too old, and everything seems blurred out.
           </p>
           <p>
            The important thing is that the vans don't have to be an exact match. We just have to confirm that they are using the vans for bad purposes.

            Titan Transport doesn't manufacture the vans, they lease them and have $2 Million insurance limitt and they do not seem to operate in Arizona.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, it would be interesting to know the origin of the van and where it went. I did not notice any DOT numbers, which would allow us to learn more. If it was owned by a company for commercial transport, the numbers should have been visible.

            Bill Warner is really good.  I've watched that a couple times over the years.  I am big on researching history which is hidden or seemingly forbidden.

            Interesting. Took a minute to see it. Unless there is some connection to pizza perps, though, I think you may want to rest your mind and chalk it up to confirmation bias.

            Great work to all who are working on this investigation. I would comment and upvoat every thread but Boats (on mobile) won't allow me to see who's commenting, leave comments or upvoat. So, just know people are out there reviewing what you've been finding and appreciate all the work you're doing on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I went down the rabbit hole a little bit on this when it was breaking news on The Donald and 4chan and what I seen was enough to supply my nightmares forever. The Instagram screenshots, the spirit cooking videos, the comet pizza "concert", all of it. I can't imagine what you've all seen throughout these months that this has gone on for and can't imagine what the NYPD had to review on Anthony Weiner's laptop. You're all doing work I could not do. Again, thank you for bringing this to light so we can make sure these people are caught and so we can take action for protecting our own children against these people.

            Ok, the only thing I see here that is interesting is the Kline lawyer, if the facts stated above are correct.
           </p>
           <p>

            They are a culture of infiltration and sabotage who are taught and guided by a privatized culture of infiltration and sabotage that originated with the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.

            Bribery/blackmail are the political tool in which to control every government and they fool the world to make it seem like that isn't the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are probably plenty of good people in the CIA, but there is a culture of infiltration that has allowed every agency to be compromised by organized crime.

            I have had this theory for a while now that they used sports teams, ballet groups, and other covers as means to avoid suspicion when moving a lot of kids around. How else do you move 30+ kids at a time without raising any red flags? How often is a cop going to even stop a team bus and ID every kid on it? How easy would it be to suppress suspicions even if police did wonder? Given the extent of the pedo-cult networks, I would find it easy for officers to be scoffed at for even wondering if some sports team from some distant place happened to pass through their area was actually something nefarious. Dance teams, ballet, soccer, whatever. I wouldn't be surprised if this is already documented even somewhere. If we are to lock these people out of any positions of power we need to dismantle their fronts, and figure out methods for the future generations to continue to keep them out of power.

            I suspect following the treasure(as they see it) is the important approach. I really doubt they have any true loyalty to their "religion", but rather they all see it as a mutual system of both blackmail and "legitimacy" for the things they really enjoy doing. I suspect these rituals even vary quite a bit even with the same participants at different times. Sociopaths consider taboos to be exciting, like everyone does, but they lack any inhibition or remorse to rein in the extremes of their taboos. They still want and need social stimulation like regular folks though. They get lonely, they get bored, and they want very much to be legitimized as much as possible. Any way to rationalize whatever extremes they want to go to. To them this is a big fun club and everyone is in on a fine joke and a good time(except the victims, but they're just commoners anyway). Do any of them really believe the blood of children will give them power? Hard to say, but when you see a lot of people in power doing crazy stuff like this, there's bound to be a few dumb enough or desperate enough to try it. There is a long history of weird occult practices among the rich and wealthy; many of them are nonsensical like Egyptian themed parties with fake prayers to Ra, but there is definitely a history of much darker ritual societies too. The rich don't want to murder people less than the poor do, but the rich at outward appearance are much less homicidal. In systems where money is holy and endless pursuit of power is the normal, it's really not surprising that demented psychopaths would end up running the show. This ritual stuff all reminds me a lot of weird frat party hazing rituals; putting pledges through weird cult rituals to embarrass them and establish a sort of mutual blackmail that is used to establish trust within organizations made up of murderous psychos with no moral standards.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would really like to know if there is some fraternity connections to all this and if anything in this relates to some goofy attempt to emulate the ancient Greek child sacrifice rituals. Even back then the rich were murdering the kids of the poor for fun and delusion of power. Its a seriously old problem that needs to be ruthlessly purged from our systems and kept out forever.

            Springfield is about 20 miles south west of DC. Seems convenient for short trips.  There have been multiple children murdered in a near by town, Berryville I think.  All little girls, There was 5.  When the bodies were found, they had similar markings. Pubic hair shaved, bound, naked, bruises in similar areas. This rash of abductions and murders was in the early 2000. I used to live there, and I remember how frightened parents were. One family had two of there daughters taken at the same time.

            Ahwatukee is right by Tempe where Hillary gave a speech the day after this story broke, if the poster has the date right.
            <br/>
            If you had seen that van going down I-10 on 11/01/16 you'd have reasonable suspicion that it was secret service or other advance people in it.

            It's like some of you are either stupid or trying to make this investigation sound stupid. There is nothing in your evidence that ties Podesta to this bust. The same kind of van isn't evidence, those vans are extremely common as other posters have pointed out. Yet this ridiculous post gets top spot and the familiar chorus of "OMG YOU'VE CRACKED THE CASE!!!!!!" are here to upvote it there and downvote rightfully critical commentary.

             Dude. READ the fucking connection: 
The van owner of the Royal Traveler “Royal Sprinter” line is Andrew Seligman who owns Jumbo Slice Pizza

              http://archive.is/ArcHE
             </a>
             (thank you Washington post--at least you’re good for something). Both Jumbo Slice Pizza and Royal Traveler are legally represented by who else: Andrew J. Kline. See
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1487301">

             </a>
             for the full Andrew J. Kline explanation. So once, again we have arrived at #Pizzagate, Andrew J. Kline and the whole Comet Pizza.

               There's value in the two stories in the body but they are not related in the manner proposed and the title is terribly misleading. So don't count it out totally, just if all you saw was the title you would really have the wrong idea

             Indeed. Did you see the creepy one he received through the Georgetown faculty email about "Beanie Babies" for sale?

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Georgetown Law Faculty and Staff,
             </p>
             <p>
              My parents are visiting this weekend, and I need to sell my enormous collection of beanie babies! I've approximately 480 little creatures of joy, and I'm selling each one for $20.00. You must buy all 480, though. It is a collection (not an auction)... They are very respectful and amicable with one another, and they are (for the most part) cat and dog friendly. Some are sassier than others, naturally.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please let me know! My parents can't find out.
             </p>

            My initial impression is that that looks more like a standard van, not a Sprinter-type van.  The word "Explorer" is visible near the back end.  I didn't compare closely though.

            This deserves scrutiny to  be sure.

            For the record, i'm not convinced that there's a direct or indirect connection between that particular van poking out of the garage and anything going on 'pizzagate' related.
           </p>
           <p>
            i've been digging through the owner of that residence's connections all morning, and nothing even remotely promising turns up...yet.

            Note: 'WakeUpAndCare' - comments here has also claimed below that Titan Made the vehicles among other things.

            The Titan vans are Mercedes sprinters in obsidian black with the customisations done by Premier Sprinter

            . The vans in the video are stock sprinters bar one detail the area around the license place appears to not be stock.

            Currently I find 0 link between these stories, though there appears to be some merit to both. This is starting to feel like planted disinfo given the veracity of the comments everyone seems to be jumping the gun here, taking a leap of faith with no info to back it up.

            Just the black van alone was not enough to convince me, but when you add the human trafficking elements, the suppression of the idea that it was human trafficking, and the last-minute involvement of the US attorney's office from Virginia getting involved...it looks remarkably strange.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who owns the black van?
Who called the neighbor and what did he say to convince him to stop saying human trafficking?

              I understand where you're coming from.  I feel a little upset about it because it appears that these people have been getting way with it for so long without any intervention from the media or law-enforcement.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's also important, however, to recognize that it's going to be very hard to "prove" anything by looking at articles and records on the Internet.  we are only going to be able to put enough evidence together to raise the issue.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not a hacker and I'm not going to be able to crack the password to comet ping pong to prove that their company is trading child porn.  Short of that, I try to hold myself to a high standard of thought.  We can't say for sure what anything "is" ( i.e. so-and-so is a child molester).  We can only say what things look like.   I hope other people adopt this attitude.   I always upvote micha because he or she looks at things with a critical eye first, and an open mind second.  We should all strive to do both.

               Yes we definitely have a great deal of limitations in this investigation we can agree on that. We also agree we aren't the ones who are going to be able to prove anything and need true investigation. I think you and I basically agree. I do. And I agree there is a place for what you are advocating and I think it is a good idea and needed. Also would probably agree some of us have other info or experience and skills to use this info that is not necessarily present in this thread. That is part of why I feel this is a strong lead and want it investigated and not dismissed so early or quickly. Make sense? I think we are largely in agreement

            It seems like the OP was claiming the van in use was directly connected to Podesta/Clinton somehow. He called it "Podesta's molesta van." We aren't seeing a connection there, but the AZ trafficking case definitely looks worth looking into. Just the claim that it connects to the Podesta crew appears to have nothing backing it up.

             The van owner of the Royal Traveler “Royal Sprinter” line is Andrew Seligman who owns Jumbo Slice Pizza

            How are the vans a "match"? Just because they're both black and similar-looking? There are thousands of black Mercedes sprinter vans being driven all over the world. Not seeing how the van is a relevant connection to anything. There doesn't seem to be a substantive link to the AZ situation/van to Clinton or Podesta in any way.
           </p>
           <p>
            The AZ trafficking cover up looks worth getting into, but the Jan Brewer comment and black vans are weak/nonexistent connections IMO. Hillary did plenty of lying and killing from what she did during her tenure as Sec. of State, so how are we connecting Brewer's comment and the AZ tracfficking with Clinton other than the existence of two black mercedes sprinter vans? Am I missing something here?
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I can tell, Podesta's personal van has not been connected to the situation in AZ in any way....at all. This all smacks of gun-jumping sensationalism without making any substantive links IMO.

             THIS: 
The van owner of the Royal Traveler “Royal Sprinter” line is Andrew Seligman who owns Jumbo Slice Pizza

             (thank you Washington post--at least you’re good for something). Both Jumbo Slice Pizza and Royal Traveler are legally represented by who else: Andrew J. Kline. See

              What does it mean that this line of vans is "owned" by Andrew Seligman? Seligman owns every Mercedes van of this type in the world? I'm still missing something, as I don't see how this line of Mercedes vans can all be owned by that one guy, nor where the OP found the info showing this to be the case.

               Van came by to pick up groups of kids, several times. And they answered no questions.. Nothing suspicious there?
              </p>
              <p>
               Don' trace the van, trace what's going on. Look at the names involved in these incidents. They are direct connections to human trafficking and the same people come up again and again, while we watch their activities get whitewashed by MSM.

            Although I think you have some very strong points, the Arizona tie in seems weak. A similar van yes, but without license plates or other identifiers it is too vague. They may be people that are linked in other ways.

            Can you be a bit more clear on this link? As far as I see, no Luke Albee appears in the email you suggest nor is there any attachment or link provided to such a picture of a van.

              Im very familiar with this email chain and still do not see what is being suggested to be in there. Please post the excerpt where Luke Albee is mentioned and where the van is discussed / mentioned / linked / attached. As far as I can tell at this point, there is no connection to these emails other than these ambiguous claims

            no good ties to anything at the moment, and none of the normal corporate websites can verify that that address is associated with anything related to pizzagate - but still dig dig dig.

            and do a "find on page" search for the word "vehicle." This should take you to the middle of the page. Here you will find extensive and specific info on how vans are used in child trafficking rings.

             Yes, she describes this very well. But I don't think these are the vans she is describing. The vans used to move kids around are generally stripped down and "utilified" (meaning, they are cleanable). These vans are  high-end luxury taxis and very expensive, used like a limo would be by hotels, resorts, corporations, etc.

            So there was a van a the scene of a house in ARIZONA.  These black vans are rather common.  Most hotels have them.  As do many companies.
           </p>
           <p>
            So all the way in Arizona an inference is drawn because of a van the Podesta clan may own?
           </p>
           <p>
            I am having trouble seeing the connection here.  If the only connection is that there are 2 similar vans, then this is not substantive.
           </p>
           <p>
            What am I missing?

             To my eyes, perhaps the important part of the story is the apparent cover up taking place. If some new evidence came to light my opinion might change though.

             The Titan vans are Mercedes sprinters in obsidian black with the customisations done by Premier Sprinter

             . The vans in the video are stock sprinters bar one detail the area around the license place appears to not be stock.

             edit: funny how the customisation companys only real review id from an assistant manager at tacobell

             Currently I find 0 link between these stories, though there appears to be some merit to both. This is starting to feel like disinfo given the veracity of the comments everyone seems to be jumping the gun here with no info to back it up.

               Yeah that appears as far as I can see to be correct, so there's two actual stories here, but linking an arizona and DC connection over a common black van is a bridge too far.

              Couldn't agree more. Another one of these posts making "connections" that don't exist and strings of comments saying "Wow amazing work, great research!" despite that tese vans are used all over the world, and there is zilch connecting the AZ incident or the AZ van to Podesta/Clinton. At least not anywhere in the info OP provided.

                But the connection is a false lead because the model of van isn't unique or exclusive to that one guy, making it a non-lead.

               I'm going to agree too. Also, the titile is unnecessarily sensational. And, these vans are all over the country and used by hotels, resorts, high-end companies, vehicle rental companies. You could suggest that they are used to move around high-end clientele, as they are expensive,  but it is completely unrealistic to suggest they would be used to move kids like they are probably moved (think The FINDERS van).

              It looks like a private transport company vehicle, I don't know why we think it's owned by Podesta. He probably used it. The one in the video doesn't have the same markings, either.

              Anyway the police should be investigated, seems like they covered something up.

            Well they can't operate if they are known about. Consider this. We, as Americans, are very aware that this country and other countries had slavery. This practice was mostly reserved to private property, in colonial states of, Britain, Belgium,Spain, Portugal. This wasn't really openly practiced in the home countries, and if it was, they weren't black. This huge extremely profitable empire of human trafficking that existed then, is still here on this planet. It would be extremely naive to think it went away, just because we "abolished" the practice in the US. The human trafficking has only increased since that time.

            </a>
            . Another thing to remember in this investigation, is that human trafficking is a blanket term for the alphabet agencies. It's a nice way of saying slaver/pedophilia/porn/organ harvesting.

             It is important to remember that there was, and is, an Arab slave trade.  Western universities cover up its existence, but it's important I think.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, Saudi Arabia had slavery by statutory law until 1962.  Under sharia, Saudi Arabia still has slavery today.   Slavery and the resulting sex abuse is so bad in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia has made it illegal for its citizens to travel and work there as domestic help.

              Yeah I remember reading an article about the rampant use of slaves from India being used to build Qatar, and the Arab Imirates. They recruited the workers from India, they promised them a free place to stay, and to be paid. Once they all got there through the agency that recruited them, they found that they were going to be living in pens basically, they weren't paid, they couldn't contact their families, they were treated like slaves, because they were.

              One of my pet peeves, for decades, is people who talk about historical slavery as a big deal (which it was, until it ended) but don't give a damn about the rampant slavery in the modern world -- 40 million people, including children, estimated I think I read.

              The NYT reports that 6 kids were being abused by a cult and two people were arrested. Two days later, after CIA tanked the investigation, The NYT changed the names of the arrested people and said the kids were not being abused by a cult.

              It's based on how the media stories changed away from the idea that there was human trafficking.  At first, they referenced human trafficking (
              <a href="http://www.12news.com/news/local/valley/ahwatukee-house-under-investigation-for-human-smuggling/345861378">

              </a>
              ).  In later articles, it was vaguely referred to as an investigation (
              <a href="http://www.12news.com/news/local/valley/investigation-in-ahwatukee-neighborhood/345948940">
               http://www.12news.com/news/local/valley/investigation-in-ahwatukee-neighborhood/345948940)

              ).

             <p>
              It's hard to say its 100% proof because we arent able to interview people and subpoena records, but it kinda looks like a cover up

               The OP title explicitly states the vans in this news story are Podestas and they are not or have not been shown to belong to him. Media have always covered up these stories that is nothing new.

               That' your interpetation. The headline of that article claims otherwise.
The article is even claiming facts about a wikileaks email which doesn't exist.

                 <p>
                  The problem with this email is that the date doesn't line up with the farm party.

            Another fantastic post ... what are the chances human traffickers and Podesta would use the same vans? And there was at least one other email (possibly more) where someone was put in charge of getting "vans" for transportation? Was it Eryn? Great stuff! Lots of leads ... let's find that one piece of evidence that blows the lid off this thing.

             Do you mean with fatastic, that even the wikileaks picture of the van is not existing?
That there is zero evidences with sources?
Why do you claim that a factless sensationalist garbage was "fantastic"?

             Who would take the case? Paid media cannot report it and DOJ and intelligence agencies protect the perpetrators. The alternative media is doing the right thing by continuing to humiliate the corporate media in their complicit behavior. Keep going, who knows what will come of this.

            Good work. No time to look out sources just now , but there was a Madron Seligman associated with Ted Heath (ex Prime Minister UK and child abuser) who toured Germany with him jsut before second world war (when heath was said to have been turned into German DVD agent blackmailed due to his paedophilia) and also Heath was godfather to his child. Maybe they are related to this Seligman that you mention
