            Psychology is a bunk pseudo-science. Really, the whole discipline is composed of 40% smug appeal to authority, 40% freshman level statistics, and 20% Talmudic war on reality.

            Conspiracy theories affect both folks on the left and right and the brilliant and the less so.   It's a function of the human brain and the fact we are more irrational than we realize.  We are all susceptible to conspiracy thinking or making far too much out of random coincidences.
            <br/>
            You kind of actually have to be aware of your irrationality and train yourself to think critically.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every Tetris?  Ever play Candy Crush?  Our brains love to find patterns and make connections.  The brain actually releases a small bit of dopamine when you make a connection.  It's a reward chemical for the brain.  It's also released during gambling, when you in love or on drugs.   It feels good to make connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me give an example of our how brains work.   My brother's first car was a Chrysler Cordoba.  I had never heard of or seen one of these before he bough it.  After he bought it I saw them everywhere.   Did they just get more popular after he got one?  No.  I just noticed them now.  I probably had seen them before and it was just background noise to me.  Once I knew about them, I could see them out of the corner of my eye.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is also a psychological phenomenon called priming.  Researching did an experiment where they had college kids do a find the world puzzle.   One group got a control puzzle and one got a puzzle with words like wrinkled, grey, and other words associated with the eldery.  Then they asked the group to walk to another classroom and do a new puzzle.   The grew that got the elderly puzzle walked slower.     Ever go into a store and see a jacket for $195?  Is that price a good price?   Well if the store put a sign saying Price Slash $595 next to it, you're more likely to think $195 is a steal.

            Yea, I think this article is right on about this whole thing. Also I think one thing that happens with conspiracy theories is that the claims and evidence rarely get MORE specific, instead the evidence remains shallow and simply the scope of it grows.  Like if you were investigating a murder you would start to question people and come up with some hypotheses and then start to narrow them down with more evidence to figure out actually what happened. Instead with conspiracies the evidence rarely gets more specific it just leads to things that aren't related to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like how this started about pedophilia among the DNC people.  And then Marina Abramovic  was mentioned so satanism was thrown in, and then people started looking into the pizza place and coming up with stuff about Alefantis, and then people started looking into the places AROUND the pizzeria.  Also the number of people complicit in this is growing exponentially.  At first it would have to be all the DNC people that were in those email lists, and now it's grown to basically all of the MSM has to be complicit and the cops and pretty much that whole block where the pizza place is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry, obviously not a pizzagate believer I've just been really interested in it.  Hope you don't mind me being here I just read stuff I don't upvote or downvote things or anything.

            Yeah I know. Everyone is pointing to this discrepency, which does nothing for me. I used Google Streetview and virtually walked around the building. The back side has garages. Garages don't have a level beneath them.

             I'm picking up what you are putting down, and I'm not denying that there is quite possibly some weird thing goin on with Podesta and Alefantis, but honestly I think the Comet Ping Pong thing is just BS.
            </p>
            <p>
             A LOT of speculation with zero, absolutely zero proof of anything. Maybe it will turn out to be something, maybe it won't - but one thing is obvious: the researchers in this forum, for the most part, won't give up and will defend nearly every rabbit-hole leap of conjecture even while ignoring facts that prove otherwise. For example: The whole traffic camera thing. People are claiming it's pointed towards Comet Ping Pong right now, it's not. It's clearly CLEARLY facing Northwest, and CPP is on the SE corner of the intersection - but when I point it out, I'm called a shill, and people blast me with 100000 other posts that said the traffic camera is pointing at comet ping pong as proof. (if you look at the camera, for crissakes, its NOT, but I digress).. anyway.. people are latching onto complete and total misinformation, regurgitating it, and it's giving the whole investigation a black eye. Very few people are being objective, seems everyone is looking for something that they can't quite find.... I'm giving my addiction into pizzagate up today. I finally saw the light. This whole thing is maybe 5% truth and 95% bullshit.. But yes, there is possibly some shenanigans going on with Podesta and Alefantis.. I will admit that.
