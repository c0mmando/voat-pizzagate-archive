            I'm sure many of you know that blog "crazy days and nights" where the "ENT Lawyer" writes lots of information of celeb scandals, often they will leave out the name and let people guess (and often figure it out) in the comments section. I saw one a few weeks ago that was about child trafficking and I think people figured out it was about Marcos (Philippines) and JP Getty, that human trafficking was a really easy thing from the Philippines. I am mentioning it because it sounds similar even tho its a different part of the world.

             There's a lot of documented info on Aquino and the satanic pedo shit he was involved in. Look into the franklin scandal and you will see it links to him. Look into John Decamp and Paul Bonacci. Decamp was a lawyer involved in the case and wrote a book about it. Aquino is sick trash. Oh, and ignore are we sure. He's trash too

            Hi, you are quoting Sputnik a Russian propaganda outlet.  One of Russia's desired foreign policy goals is to get Turkey to kick out this air base.  They run fake news about this quite often.  During the election they ran a fake report that 7,000 Turkish police surrounded and shut down this air base.  The Trump campaign weeks later claimed the media were not reporting on a terrorist attack on Incirlik. It was completely false.  There was a bunch of anti-US protestors and not attack whatsoever.
           </p>
           <p>
            They took the real news and wrapped it up with bullshit and packaged it as propaganda.  They do it all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The basis for this repacked bullshit is Turkey just showed a reality TV show about two sibling who had been adopted to the US to two different families.  They learned they were adopted and found each other and then went to look for their family in Turkey.  There are in their mid 20's.  They did not allege abuse or organ trafficking or any of that stuff.   They were taken to the US and raised in American families as Christians.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://cdni0.trtworld.com/w960/q75/25468_TUR-20180112-sisters_1515748848792.jpg">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The TV show had other people come forward to say that illegal cash adoptions went on.  They are not alleging it still happens.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Following the reports, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office in Adana released a statement acknowledging the allegations of US soldiers working at the Incirlik base “adopting a number of babies in exchange for money and taking them outside of the country between the 1980s and 1990s.”

            Sadly I dont think that it has ANYTHING TO DO WITH RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY and much ado about deviancy. I suppose it was an easier softer way to write the article though. It doesnt get the point across of the kind of demons we are dealing with making it sound like it has something to do with radicals and religion.

            But "too logical" could indicate fake news, of course.

             Comey was at the head of Lockheed decades ago.  Also there has been much sexual criminal abuse of children going on at Army Bases all over the world, imo.  There was an article on here last year of soldiers arrested at an Army Base in Columbia.  They were raping young teens and filming it for CP.  The Elite in the Armed Forces have been condoning and encouraging this for a long long time.

              One of my first posts here was about the incident with the contractors in Afghanistan and the underage kids on the base. The mods deleted it because it was not "pizza gate related". Then more got uncovered and it is now a part of pizzagate.

              There is also the child porn ring that was in the pentagon. It is to the point where it may need to be a separate operation, a full investigation into DOD and contractor child sex abuses. Then again, this is also a direct connection to hillary clinton and john podesta do to their lobbying and work with the contractors in question.

               Black Water.  Eric Prince.  I believe he had a part in it as well.  Dyncorp though along with the CIA.  Yes, all those people at the DOD watching porn was a dead give away.

                Someone should go back over the old posts/news stories, get all the individuals who were busted, and post it so we can look into their connections. It is also possible that some of these people got inadvertantly caught up in Brownstone Operations. If, as Wikileaks Vault 7 revealed, the CIA has the ability to plant material on people's computers, it would be the perfect way to take out their enemies. From what I've been reading about the deep state war that is probably going on behind the scenes, DIA and CIA are on opposite sides. If I recall correctly, some have theorized this was part of the argument about why the Pentagon was hit on 9/11.

                 I completely agree that the CIA would have the ability to plant material on people's computers.  Jeffrey Epstein has a Dyncorp plane as we have seen on here, and he also has cameras all around his home in Fla. for that very purpose, to catch people "in the act".  I suspect the CIA and Dyncorp are working together. So why not just create the act?  Planting Evidence.  Not really that hard to do.  As you know  I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to posting.

             Really sad, if only the Afghans knew what they were selling their children for.  If it were for conversion to Christianity, it would be have been a literal God send.   :'(  It is too horrific to imagine their fate over all these years.

            The US soldiers in Afghanistan who reported child sex abuse were punished.
The poor bastards, never got the Pentagon memo institutionalizing faggotry, pedophilia and child trafficking.
            <br/>
            Now buying kids - possibly for their organs, tissues and other spare parts. It seems to be perfectly in line with American political ethos these days.
You won't see "Karma Airline" coming at you. And all of you gullible ghouls "supporting our troupes", there is child blood dripping from your dirty, greasy, gelatinous hands.
