            I seriously don't get this shit, as a woman i don't get why other women try to like laugh it off when shit like this happens, like are you worried you'll get called a bitch for saying something? Getting raped is one thing and belive me been there too and thats some scary shit, had some guy tackle me then try to drag me into his room at a party, I kicked and bit and punched for all I was worth and when I did get him off me I didnt stop kicking, I made sure that mother fucker knew how bad he had just fucked up, don't get me wrong I got lucky there, the guy was scrawny but even then he was just as strong if not stronger than me but also trashed and I'm NOT going down with out a fight, you better knock me out or kill me. But groped? fuck no. you slap that fucker in the mouth and call him out for the pervy little shit he is, if he wants to get violent about it, so be it, I'm not going to roll over for you and I WILL fight and any decent guy or girl in the area will have my back. Make it known that it is not acceptable behavior EVER. You care to much about your image and not enough about yourselves I think because if anyone pulled this creepy shit with me VP or not that would imediatly be met with, "Excuse me but what the fuck do you think your doing?" or in the case of the creepy over the shoulder rubs and hair sniffing a solid elbow to the gut. I got picked up and slamed onto a table and my shirt/bra pulled up at a party once by a widely known woman abuser at the party because he thought it would be a funny thing to do... I didn't. I got into a straight up fist fight with that guy and won, Sparta kicked that piece of shit in the throat and didnt stop hitting him until I got pulled off. You know what that guy never did in front of me again? Fucked with women. Those men are cowards who buckle at the first sign of resistance, Stand the fuck up for yourselves ladies and this wouldn't be as big of an issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ugh... sorry for the word wall I just get so mad when I see shit like this and the lady does nothing or just laughs it off, dont you know that your just reinforcing the bad behaivor by not punishing it? If it's wanted attention thats one thing but any good man isn't going to be groping you publicly because he likes you, he's doing it because he thinks he can get away with it, show him he can't. Trust me, anyone who does that is NOT your friend and you shouldn't feel bad about hurting them because they obviously dont feel bad about hurting you. Reeeing in the streets about all men being rapists is not only not effective, its down right stupid and untrue and makes people dismiss a REAL problem. Be the change you want to happen ladies, learn some basic self-defence and stand the fuck up for yourselves in the moment not later on when everyone else is doing it and you can jump on the victim bandwagon. Don't be a sheep, be the wolf.

             Narcissists approach people from a position of power from a position of authority. They intimidate and manipulate people they pick people who are likely to be good sources of Narcissistic Supply I.e. co-depends. Those are the people who think "if I go along with this my treatment won't be so bad" go along to get along types.

            Video of Joe Biden groping, trying to kiss, stroking hair, hands all over, and making comments about the appearance of grade school girls, and some teenage girls. We’ve all seen it. He’s a pedo pervert. Run Joe, run. Those videos will light up, and the whole world will know who, and what you are.

            I can wish all I want for decrepit child-groper Joe Biden to be it. We know there’s a lot of documented shit on that dimwit that could make the days preceding the 2020 election highly entertaining, with a big dose of sickening. Biden 2020 won’t happen. Harris is a better Dem choice, at least so far. Hell, Gagag would poll better than Joe.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, if I had to bet right now, my money would be on Michelle Obama. Beloved to the left, no matter what. She’s as untouchable as her lying sack husband has proven to be. Republicans will have the heavy burden of meticulously crafting EVERY WORD of criticism aimed at a black, woman candidate, let alone that she’s been adored by the left, for more than eight LONG years.

             I don't think they'll run Michelle, not yet. She has no political experience and she will have to do a turn in the house or senate first like Hillary did. They'll set Chelsea groomed up with a seat somewhere too unless Hillary gets locked away. No, they'll likely run somebody who appears to have a bit of distance from them in 2020 like Kamala, but I really hope they're stupid and arrogant enough to run Joe.

            Not playing devil's advocate because I think Biden is definitely a creepo BUT....psychologically, do you think his groping is some weird reaction to his wife and one-year-old daughter dying in a car crash? Any experts here care to weigh in?

             <em>
              On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after the election, Biden's wife and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware.

             Wouldn't be surprised if this was actually a ritual sacrifice Biden had to agree to in order to become an insider, or something like that. Similar to how Polanski had his family murdered in 1969. All a satanic ritual, no doubt.

             Power and success increase sex drive - a well-known fact. Being a single and surrounded by career women who would not want to make a fuss causing them their careers probably helped elevate that to new levels. I think it also became so much cliche that people see fun in it - similar to the notorious heart breaker at school who all the girls had to find out what he was about, or pop stars known to invite their groupies after a concert and having them stand in line, and such. Or similar to the boss who always makes inappropriate jokes and everyone smiles politely...

            He is not insane he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Their personality through time gets surplanted with the attention seeking/ addicted "False Self". They are not grounded in reality - check out Sam Vaknin's seminal work on the subject on YT.

I have put a link above to one of Sam Vaknin's best video's explaining it.
