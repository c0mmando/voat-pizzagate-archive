            The footage of Sheikah Latifa Mohammed Al Maktoum, 32, was released by her lawyer after she reportedly went missing off the coast of Goa, in India. Dubai’s Drug Addicted, Bisexual Crown Prince

            Wikileaks exposed documents written by American diplomats stating that the heir to Dubai’s throne was an out of control drug addict that’s been in and out of rehab for years, and that he’s a bisexual party boy that enjoys flying in male and female escorts to his father’s desert kingdom for weekend orgies. According to the Dec. 2, 2012 post “, Drug-addicted Dubai Crown Prince Hamdan: following the usual footsteps of the Arab Royal Family,” posted on the blog The Muslim Issue, Worldwide, within a few days of the cables’ disclosure they were removed from Wikileaks’ website, which to this day makes them the only documents concerning a member of a royal family to have been successfully expunged from their database. This is apparently but one example of the drastic measures the Sheik Mohammed bin Rasheed al Maktoum of Dubai is willing to take in order to salvage the reputation of his favorite son and designated heir. An equestrian, he is the founder of the Maktoum family-owned Godolphin racing stable and the owner of Darley, the thoroughbred breeding operation with operations in six countries; in 2012, he rode the horse Madji Du Pont 160 km to take the FEI World Endurance Championship

            Sheikh Hamdan “Fazza”, who male escorts claim prefers naked boys and has managed to remain unmarried. Rashid was on a cocaine binge the night before he died. According to wikileaks reports a few years back Rashid was sent to secret detox clinics in Europe several times but his addiction was so deep they failed to get him clean.

            Both Dubai crown prince’s have drug problems but the eldest one, Rashid, was apparently the one who was the worse off. Another little known fact is that Rashid was a murderer. According to a confidential report leaked by wikileaks from David Williams, Acting Consul General, Consulate Dubai, Rashid killed a royal assistant in his father’s office sometime before 2008.

            Rashid’s drug addition was so bad that his father considered him unstable and unreliable for office and kept him hidden from the public for the past few years. You can barely find photos of him anymore.

            She claims she was drugged in hospital by doctors to stop her rebelling. Latifa was understood to be hiding on a yacht off the coast of southern India and is expected to seek political asylum in the United States where she had made contact with a lawyer.
           </p>
           <p>
            She released her claims in a video from her hideout on Friday, March 9.
           </p>
           <p>
            But charity Detained in Dubai, which has been in contact with Latifa, says she has since issued a distress message followed by a "panicked and frightened" phone call.
           </p>
           <p>
            Detained in Dubai say she rang them and said: "Please help. There are men outside. I hear gunshots and I am hiding with my friend."
           </p>
           <p>
            A Whatsapp message from Latifa added: "Please help. I don't know what's happening." A website for information on the missing woman has been launched.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Haigh added: "The story of the missing princess has touched the hearts of so many. We have had offers of help from as far away as Peru from people that followed her on her Instagram account, now deleted, to here at home with so many Leeds United fans following her story"
