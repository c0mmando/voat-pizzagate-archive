              Magic Johnson has taken life after sports to a new level. Not only does he own everything from his now trademark Magic Johnson Theaters to Starbucks and Fatburger’s franchises, now he’s building schools. Next week, Johnson opens two new locations of his Magic Johnson’s Bridgescape Academy in the Chicago area. These schools add to the 15 other Magic Johnson schools around the country, geared toward helping high school dropouts get their diplomas.

            Deborah Bond-Upson, M.Div., Chief Education Officer
Intrepid education innovator,
           </p>
           <p>
            Deborah Bond-Upson, has been writing stories all her life. At Swarthmore College, she was an English Literature major and taught in West Philadelphia schools.
           </p>
           <p>
            After graduation she embarked on an MFA in painting and ceramics in Mexico before beginning seminary at Starr King School for the Ministry.
           </p>
           <p>
            An ordained minister, Deborah has found her work in education, building networks to support students and teachers. Much of Deborah's work over the past 30+ years has been in using story, media and assessment to engage students and individualize learning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Deborah has served as VP of Product Development at Kaplan, later EVP at Knowledge Universe, and founding CEO of Teacher Universe, Best Practice Networks and lead the online development of GALAXY Classroom.
           </p>
           <p>
            In all of these learning organizations, Deborah has worked closely with teachers, students, staff and developers, convening in-person and online conferences. She has worked with scientists, screenwriters, producers, technical developers and public broadcasting to build and deliver story-driven, hands-on science curriculum and teacher professional development for K-6, with career technical teachers and administrators to build a full range of high school blended learning courses, and has developed assessments and courses funded by state legislators and delivered state-wide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Awesome Stories is the perfect marriage, Deborah feels, of technology, evidence and story. Most exciting is the potential to take fiction and non-fiction stories and support them with evidence, creating a model for teachers and students to research and build their own learning experiences. Technology can finally fuel investigation and creation for teachers, students and families. Awesome Stories provides the platform to facilitate this exciting creative work.

            Both Unitarian Universalist ministers, for years we worked together in education before I began serving the Petaluma Unitarian Universalist Congregation as their regular preacher.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ten years ago we moved from California to Miami to work on her company’s education initiative, delivering inquiry-based science to district teachers and students.  For the first year, we developed and delivered online and personal tutoring for migrant children in agriculture camps of south Florida. It was illuminating and enriching to work with the families. After successfully piloting the science program in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, we moved back to California and I began my preparation for interim ministry.
           </p>
           <p>
            My first interim church was the First Unitarian Church of Honolulu. My wife and I loved it there. She found she was able to do her education work from Hawaii, so she has stayed there ever since. She works from there with mainland and Hawaii educators and co-founded Parents for Public Schools-Hawaii. She maintains our family home on Oahu, visiting me on the mainland, and I am there as I am able. Since then I have served UU congregations in Fayetteville, AR; Bellingham, WA; Santa Barbara, CA, Vancouver, WA, and the Piedmont Unitarian Universalist Church in Charlotte NC

            <p>
             At the beginning of Nov, 1960, The Chicago Tribune reports that the film ‘Bridge to the Sun’ Is Ready for Filming.  The lead actress (Caroll Baker?), the paper notes, will go to Honolulu, Hawaii, to give a WAIF benefit performance on Nov. 4, 1960, the very day, one supposes, that Barack Hussein Obama is allegedly conceived! [Note, the tribune page is no longer accessible]

             Miss Russell championed the passage of the Federal Orphan Adoption Amendment of 1953, which allowed, for the first time, children of American servicemen born overseas to be placed for adoption in the United States The ensuing years have allowed single parents to adopt, for children to be moved across state lines for adoptive placement, and most recently, the implementation of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act which mandates the reform of the adoption and foster care system in all 50 states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Proxy adoptions revealed how inadequate federal policy was in dealing with family-making across national borders. Until passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1961, which incorporated international adoption, the migration of foreign-born children to the U.S. had no place in permanent law.
            </p>
            <p>
             Such an adoption program would explain the known anomalies about Obama’s birth story:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               His personal claim of different birth times and places.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               His mother’s ability to attend college and support a newborn.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               His mother’s ability to travel to Washington State immediately after birth, yet not know how to change a diaper.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Barrack Hussein Obama Sr.’s indifference to the child, who was supposedly his son.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               News reports and statements of friends that he was born in Kenya, Indonesia and/or Hawaii.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Dr. Fukino’s statement in July, that there are “vital records”, in the plural, which establish his birth facts. (Hawaii law seals original certificate and regards the new one generated for adopted parents as the real one; repleat with a new birth place and date of birth, ostensibly.)
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The famous, baby Obama on a blanket photo, without parents; in the style used in adoption records.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Might explain the cryptic remark that Stanley Ann Dunham made to a high school friend in Washington State, before moving to Hawaii:  “I can have a baby without getting married.”
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Thus an adopted, foreign-born child, can truthfully say he was born in two places at two different times; because in one sense he refers to his natural birth, in the other to his legally recognized adoptive-birth.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Remember
              <strong>
               Awe Kooda Bilaxpak Kuxshish?
              </strong>
              In May 2008, that was the adopted name given to the pResident by Hartford and Mary Black Eagle, Crow Reservation, Lodge Grass, Montana during an adoption ceremony. “One Who Helps People Throughout This Land” was the translated meaning of Obama’s new identity. The adoption of Obama by the Crows has been a mystery to us. This adoption took place prior to the election, and according to their traditions the adoption linked Obama to five generations of Native Americans.   Sasha and Malia were told they were being introduced to their grandparents when meeting the Black Eagles. On one hand, that is a good thing, as we know Obama’s father and step-father had died;  so Black Eagle could fit into the slot of their deceased relatives, Obama, Sr., Lolo Soetoro, or great grandfather, Stanley Dunham. Little did we know that like the many before her, Grandma Madelyn Dunham would pass away before she could witness the elevation of her grandson to the presidency.
             </p>
             <p>
              We were told by the Obama press that Grandma Madelyn passed just before the election, yet Obama didn’t choose to celebrate her life by attending a funeral for her because it would have interfered with the post election celebrations.  The woman that cared for him, supported him, and loved him was put into a casket and left alone in some morgue somewhere. According to news reports, she was placed into a closed casket to be mourned by others in a public memorial service in Hawaii.   Common decency and respect for the dead were put aside so Obama and Michelle could relish their day in the sun and treasure their momentous victory. While sucking in the adulation of their fawning supporters who voted him to victory, Grandma was either in her casket or put on ice.
We really aren’t sure if Grandma died. Yet to diminish suspicions, there was a photo-op of him supposedly spreading her ashes over the ocean in late December while on his vacation trip to Hawaii. One wonders why grandma wasn’t laid to rest next to her husband as that is the normal custom of Christians. We would assume that Madelyn buried her husband and fully expected to lay beside him when she died. No, Madelyn was not laid to rest next to the man who was her daily companion for 52 years. Instead, she was consumed by fire and her remains thrown over a rocky cliff into the ocean in a less than solemn situation. You see, not surprisingly, Obama invited reporters to photograph the event. For prosperity, and ever more, that photograph is supposed to prove that he tossed his loving Grandma’s dust to the waiting fish.   Curiously, no records of Madelyn Dunham’s death and cremation have been found. Yet, we know there is a photo of her dust.
             </p>
             <p>
              One could think in very sinister terms, that grandma was cremated, so that no DNA could be traced to the Dunham family if one needed to exhume the body.  If tested, the body might prove that Obama was not related to the Dunham family.   Although I know nothing about genetics, it has been noted that many criminals have been released from prison in the past year because their DNA didn’t match the evidential properties found at a crime scene.  With all of his relatives deceased, there is no trace of Obama’s true origins, or is there?  Wouldn’t he have some of the same or matching genes like his Uncle Charlie or his half brother, Mark?
             </p>
             <p>
              In one of my dreams of audacity,  I had lunch with Obama. After the meal, when everyone was shaking hands, unobtrusively I grabbed his napkin, glass and fork from the table and shoved them into my purse. In another part of the country, my accomplices were interviewing Uncle Charlie. They did the identical thing that  I had done. They snatched the coffee cup, water glass, and a spoon that Uncle Charlie used while being interviewed, and put them into a sealed plastic evidence bag. Both my accomplices and I sent our valuable samples to a famous lab for comparison genetic testing. The evidence was to be scientifically tested and the results would be the proof needed to either confirm or deny Obama’s relationship to the Dunham family.   Weeks later, with the investigation completed of the comparisons between the samples, we received the news. With trembling hands, I read the report. It read, “No Match.”
             </p>
             <p>
              With no match of Obama’s DNA to Uncle Charlie’s, the testing proved what others have been unable to do through legal means. Without a genetic tie to the Dunhams, his fraudulent relationships, photographs, and lies would finally be undeniably exposed. We can dream audaciously, now can’t we?

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Now, if I were backed by a major media outlet, I would be on the first plane to Lodge Grass, Montana to do some real investigative research and reporting. I would be seeing if there were any new schools, roads, hospitals, or homes being built or were built in the last year? Has Grandma Mary replaced her traditional elk tooth coat, made of deep-pink wool, with others?    Does she now wear shoes instead of moccasins, and does her closet have shoes that would put Imelda to shame? Have they recently renovated their home and is it newly  furnished?   Like Grandma Sarah in Africa, have they created an “Awe Kooda Bilaxpak Kuxshish Trust Fund”?   Have they started or are they promoting a Crow Foundation that was created and is now funded by mysterious donors? Next, I might investigate how much money from January’s non-Stimulus package allocated to Indian tribes was approved for the Crows to stimulate OUR economy. Oh, the questions, I would ask, and the evidence I would document!
              </p>
              <p>
               Prompted by my own question about the Stimulus, I read through some articles. The long neglected Indian tribes throughout the US were afforded the opportunity to apply for the approximately $3 billion allocated to them in the Stimulus Package. These funds were to be used for infrastructure projects and to assist domestic economic growth during these hard economic times.
              </p>
              <p>
               Greg Guedel, from Native Legal, reported that Montana’s Crow Tribe was given $1,033,610 for the first phase of a sewer lagoon that would serve 564 families.1
              </p>
              <p>
               Reznet News reported on May 27, that $250 Million was pledged for tribal housing. Additionally, they added, a statement by Crow Chairman Cedric Black Eagle who said, “You can tell my brother we are glad he has not forgotten us.” According to that same reporter, on Obama’s trip to receive his official adoption recognition by the Crow reservation, Obama “pledged, if elected, to improve reservation housing and work more closely with tribal leaders than previous administrations.” 2
              </p>
              <p>
               Nationwide, the Department of Justice was awarded more than $224 million in stimulus funds and is using that money to help tribes curb crime on their reservations.  (How many jobs would that produce?)    I didn’t find specific information related to the Crows as recipients. There is another proposal by 3 Rivers Telephone Cooperative, Inc., Montana, being considered worth $24,977,000 to provide advanced broadband services to tribal areas where there is limited access. [They don’t have sewers, but they will have the internet!]
              </p>
              <p>
               Bresnan’s Proposal for $70,007,425 is to develop a fiber optic network statewide. They are working in conjunction with the State of Montana &amp; the Tribal governments of Montana’s 7 Native American Reservations, i.e., Crows.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not to slight the Crows in any way, since all of these projects are important. It is just very interesting that they are so well cared for in the Stimulus Bill that is to create JOBS.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dreaming doesn’t take away my suspicions nor those of millions of citizens. The questions remain,  why would Obama would be accepted by the Crow tribe as an adopted son? This popped into my consciousness again today when I read John Carlton’s article,  “Obama concedes he’s not a Natural Born Citizen, in Obama vs. Keys 2004 Debate.”  He wrote, “In course work assigned by Lecturer Obama to his class, they were required to read Vattle’s “Historical Foundations” that talked about Indian rights and involved questions of native born and citizenship rights. Without having access to that historical paper, I wonder what else Vattel discussed about Indian rights and adoptions that might be applied to this Obama’s background scenario?   Would this adoption supercede or take priority over those arrived at by birth? Would the proxy adoption cover Obama’s birth issue if he indeed was someone who came to the US via The World Adoption International Fund, and would this old law cover him now?” 5,6,7 .
              </p>
              <p>
               We want to know why the Crows adopted Obama. Then what promises were made by Obama to the Crows for their assistance in giving him an assumed lineage. Are these the adoption papers that are being held in Hawaii that are meant to satisfy the requirements as a natural born citizen? Does he think that we would be hoodwinked into thinking that this adoption satisfies the requirements of a natural born citizen if his parents are not who he said they were?
              </p>
              <p>
               If we find the answers, will the Crows be guilty of a Pay-to-Play scheme designed specifically to give cover in some strange way to the pResident? One is also left to wonder why Obama claimed in one of his books that his great-grandmother Leona McCurry was half Cherokee, when genealogists have been unable to verify the fact.   More questions and thoughts to ponder about the real identity of the person dodging and lodging in our White House.
              </p>
              <p>
               After writing about this a week ago, it was interesting to see our pResident’s inappropriate address to Dr. Joe Medicine Crow-High Bird after a Tribal Nations Conference at the White House on November 5. Embarrassingly, Obama stated that Dr. Crow was the recipient of the Congressional Metal of Honor when it was the Medal of Freedom Award that Obama himself had placed around his neck last August. Surely, Dr. Crow deserved a mature and dignified announcement in front of other tribes for having received the honor. Instead his honorable mention consisted of a juvenile, and undignified statement, “ I want to give a shout-out to Joe Medicine Crow.” This from one with whom he now shares familial ties. The insult of misinformation and disgrace is levied against the speaker and not the receiver.
              </p>
              <p>
               The questions remain: Who got what in the agreement between Awe Kooda Bilaxpak Kuxshish and the Crows? Is this another backdoor way for Obama to redistribute our wealth and bankrupt our economy? How do the Native Americans fit into his Marxist scenario? Why did they adopt him and what are they getting in return? We will continue to look for answers to these questions, as well as to seek out the authentic and legitimate identity of Awe Kooda Bilaxpak Kuxshish. When we find that answer, we will have something to crow about.

               I'm sure it did. But no, there's no notification. I've actually been thinking of stickying it to the
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               front page, since it's slowly sliding down and it's got so much new info in it.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are multiple "front pages", also:
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               's,
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/all">
                v/all
               </a>
               /HOT , and "front" (which is the landing page for Voat if you're not logged in, or your personally customized front page if you are). If you want it to get tracks on the third one (widest audience, hardest to climb) you have to post it to
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/QRV">
                v/QRV
               </a>
               or

                v/whatever
               </a>
               where there are hundreds and hundreds more viewers than in here, which is mostly diehards now. The number of current viewers (and views of the post) is in the sidebar.

                 I would, because they allow Link submissions and we do not. If you do a Discuss submission here, and then crosspost a Link submission there to the post here, most of the comments will end up in the main thread. It's good form to include Crosspost in the titles of the Link submissions, in case people see the three show up at the same time on their front page.

              IT IS HUGE!  That's why I copied the transcript (sorry no line breaks) in case YewT00b removes it under their new censor-everything guidelines.
 Not safe for work as he abused a 6 yea old relative handed over to him for repeated abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              My takeaway grown-up abused children become attractive teens and are farmed out to celbs and sports figures by 'handlers'.  A whole  industry of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I recall some saying at a playoff type NBA game (Knicks ... years ago) the court-side seats seemed filled with hookers.  Evidently young beautiful women who had childhoods like that poor 6 year old niece. His whole family full of incest and child rape it seems. Maybe for generations.  And I wonder if big time entertainment "star-makers" don't select these types for control reasons.

             When Disney Co. president Michael Ovitz first joined the studio a little over a year ago, he took an active role at ABC that rapidly diminished on the heels of complaints from top web execs to Disney chairman Michael Eisner.

            <p>
             What do a lot of Hollywood luciferians and Pedowood suspects have in common? Certain talent agencies. UTA also works for Johnny Depp. Creative Artists Agency works with Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise, Nichole Kidman, Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Madonna, Sean Penn, Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, and Jared Leto.
            </p>

             Michael Rosenfeld was one of the founders of Creative Artists Agency. Producer of Fatal Vision TV movie. May have been involved in Judith Barsi’s murder.

             CAA has a foundation. Ties to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (major red flag).
            </p>
            <p>
             Michael Ovitz via Robert Strauss has ties to the Bushes. Bush as we all know is linked to the CIA. Also connected to the Bronfman crime family, just like Steven Spielberg. He himself is also a suspected mobster. Hollywood was LONG been under mob control. Ovitz was a former high up at Disney.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ronald Meyer, one of the founders of CAA is now vice chairman of NBCUniversal. NBC of course being part of the MSM who are players in Operation Mockingbird.

            Maybe someone has mentioned it but I did see that Geraldine Laybourne (born Geraldine Bond) is connected to Acumen as an advisor.
which if you research it leads you people like  Dr. Muhammad Yunus,  George Soros (huge topic)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Acumen Fund is a social enterprise investment fund that uses “patient capital” as an alternative to traditional aid or pure market approaches to address the critical problems of poverty in the developing world.
            </p>
            <p>

             Ralph M. Parsons, founder of the Ralph M. Parsons Company, one of the largest engineering and construction concerns in the country, died yesterday in San Marino, Calif., where he lived. His age was 78.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Parsons had held the title of founder chairman since April. Earlier, he had been board chairman and chief executive officer, positions he had held since forming the company in Pasadena, Calif., in 1944.
            </p>
            <p>
             A few years ago the company was involved in engineering construction projects of $1.2‐billion, which put it just behind the Bechtel Corporation in its field.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Parsons had been interested in engineering from his earliest childhood. At the age of 13 he and his brother, without capital, opened a garage and machine shop in Amagansett, L. I.
            </p>
            <p>
             He went on to study steam and machine design at Pratt Institute and graduated in 1916. He enlisted in the Navy as a machinist's mate and was discharged in 1921 as a lieutenant (j.g.). He took a job as a
             <strong>
              civilian aeronautical engineer for the Navy
             </strong>
             and left in the mid‐nineteen‐twenties to specialize in oil refinery engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In World War II, Mr. Parsons formed a partnership with Stephen D. Bechtel, who later became his chief rival, and John A. McCone, who later headed the Central Intelligence Agency.

            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Parsons's work in recent years included the
             <strong>
              construction of large and modern petroleum refineries, chemical plants and mining and metallurgical facilities. He also was a pioneer in building missile and space vehicle launching facilities and nuclear plants.

             When Jack Parsons (right) and L. Ron Hubbard (left) engaged in the Babalon Working, there was plenty of sexual excitement going on. Parsons was copulating with Cameron (his wife) on the altar and Hubbard was scrying and tapping the energy. Geometric incantations were used along with symbols, not unlike what Hubbard referred to in the book I had discovered. They were deliberately working with the same energies and some of the protocols that John Dee and Edward Kelly had used during the reign ofQueen Elizabeth I (Dee was her court astrologer). An earnest communication had been made with the territory known as the unconscious or the great unknown.

             Many believe that the 1946 Babalon Working was responsible for or tied to the UFO phenomena which became so abundant after that period. This was confirmed forCameron when she witnessed a UFO shortly after the Babalon Working. She said that the sight filled her with an insurmountable joy. Cameron and her brother were working at the jet Propulsion Laboratory during this period and had seen a UFO while taking a nature walk in the area. Although she warned her brother not to say a word about it, he blabbed and was ridiculed to the point where he had to leave his job due to embarrassment. He ended up working for the Ralph Parsons Corporation, a huge international conglomerate who builds
             <strong>
              underground railways and cities among many other things.

               There are several of us who try to ping users we know would be interested in a thread. A lot of submitters who are newer just don't even know who to ping. I know, because I know who folks are and what their interests are, and I often do a quick check on SearchVoat of the subject matter and see who else has posted on it to ping them. But...it's a bit of a crapshoot. :-)

               According to John DeCamp, FirsTier Bank "was the bank Larry King's pilfered $40 million passed through, without anybody batting an eye."
              </p>
              <p>
               FirsTier was also closely tied to California Energy and Magma Power Co. (a Nevada corporation).  In  a 1995  proxy statement for MAGMA POWER COMPANY, 4365 Executive Drive, Suite 900, San Diego, California 92121 a meeting to be held in Omaha, Nebraska, was announced by chairman David Sokol at which Magma stockholders would consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 5, among Magma, California Energy Company, Inc. ("CECI") and CE Acquisition Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CECI ("CE Sub"), pursuant to which CE Sub will be merged with and into Magma (the "Merger").  The statement also contained the following information:

               Kiewit Energy Company ("Kiewit Energy"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Peter Kiewit Sons', Inc. ("PKS"), is an approximate 43% stockholder (on a fully diluted basis) in CECI. PKS, a Delaware corporation, is a large employee-owned company which had approximately $2.2 billion in revenues in 1993 from its interests in construction, mining, energy and telecommunications. PKS is one of the largest construction companies in North America and has been in the construction business since 1884. PKS is a joint venture participant in a number of CECI's international private power projects. The principal executive offices of CECI and CE Sub are located at 10831Old Mill Road, Omaha, Nebraska 68154 and their telephone number is (402) 330-8900. CE Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of CECI and has not conducted any business except in connection with the Offer. CECI and CE Sub were incorporated in 1971 and 1994, respectively, under the laws of the State of Delaware. The principal executive offices of PKS are located at 1000 Kiewit Plaza, Omaha, Nebraska 68131, and its telephone number is (402) 342-2052.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                1985 "First some background: Under the Lend-Lease Act of 1941, the United States sent billions of dollars of war materiel to its allies while postponing the question of payment until after the war. In the euphoria of victory, the United States forgave all except materiel which would be useful to the postwar civilian economy (trucks, for example). In the case of the Soviet Union, this residual civilian-type lend-lease was valued by the United States at $2.6 billion (out of total lend-lease to the Soviet Union of $10.8 billion). The Soviet government at first offered to pay $170 million.
               </p>
               <p>
                Negotiations dragged on intermittently for 25 years. Then in 1972 agreement was reached on $722 million to be paid in installments running through 2001. The catch was that the lend-lease settlement was dependent on implementation of a trade agreement under which the US would extend most-favored-nation treatment to the Soviet Union. The trade agreement was scuttled by the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which made most-favored-nation treatment contingent on Soviet liberalization of Jewish emigration. When the Soviets balked on emigration, the trade and lend-lease agreements came crashing down. By that point, the Soviets had actually paid $48 million, leaving a balance of $674 million.

             Great additions. Human Rights First sounds like it might need it's own thread. Same with the media conference that seemed to be a who's who. One of our current big challenges is that Voat comments are only searchable via Google, which is very hit or miss, because

             doesn't crawl them yet. I'm lobbying for it. Everything added here in comments will be very hard to find by future researchers.

              For now I'm using this more as a catalogue of leads (more and more keep coming). But once its fully fleshed out I will redo it as a post about either the laybournes or nickelodeon

               I seem to have removed you as a submitter on my sub prematurely. If you need me to add you back so you can work on submissions before posting them to PG sub I would be happy to have you. If you don't need it, that's okay too.

                Thank you for the offer. I would say I simply prefer to not post posts online at all until I feel I've researched and verified the content personally.
               </p>
               <p>
                That isn't to say I dont want to be a submitter, but I probably wont ever use the sub for the purpose of "parking" posts while researching them/writing them. I prefer to do all of that dirty work (writing, editing, &amp; researching) offline.

                         I would even be happy being able to grab 99 pages, download them, and delete them, and get the next 99. I've got 402  DMs I've left marked "unread" because I wanted to come back to them, and many more I don't want to delete for research reasons. Sent box, too. Ya know...in case I ever want to write a Meme War Memoire ;-).

What are the opportunities this new and expanding world offer to kids and parents today? And, how do parents navigate through this media saturated playground? What is the impact on kids and what are the implications for our society? Join us as we look at the new and evolving partnership between parents and media.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Media critic Ken Auletta staged a frontal assault on three executives representing Big Media on Monday night at the opening event of Beyond Primetime, a conference on social responsibility in media hosted by Commonsense Media and the Aspen Institute at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan. Despite Auletta's best efforts, however, the three execs--Brian Roberts, chairman and CEO of Comcast, Geraldine Laybourne, founder and CEO of Oxygen, and Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and CEO of Warner Music Group--held the line tenaciously in their discussion of media and parenting. Above all, media companies are no substitute for parents, and the blame for children's failings belongs chiefly to the parents who neglect them.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's not to say Auletta didn't try. In his opening salvo he asked the panelists whether their companies offered any content they wouldn't want their children to see. He needled them further by naming specific examples of controversial content produced or distributed by the three companies, including Oxygen's "Bad Girls' Club" and Warner's roster of gangster rap.
            </p>
            <p>
             But he immediately encountered staunch resistance, with all three executives shifting responsibility back to parents--in this case, themselves. Existing methods of parental policing were duly noted. Roberts explained how he and his wife use parental control features on TV and Internet content to block out risqué or violent material. Likewise, Bronfman--father of seven--said his children aren't allowed to listen to any music that's stickered as explicit.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, it fell to Laybourne to take the offensive. She noted that Oxygen isn't intended for children, while many cable channels are suitable for children. The problem, she suggested, lies with parents who are unable to engage their children in a dialogue to guide their viewing. She recommended that parents watch TV shows with their children "and tell them when 'we don't approve of these values.'"
            </p>
            <p>
             Roberts affirmed that "there's no conversation" at the national level about the importance of parenting, leaving media companies as scapegoats for societal ills. Then Bronfman tried to roll back Auletta's earlier questions, challenging what he said was a basic premise that "anything controversial shouldn't be aired," conflating parental and corporate responsibility. Bronfman noted that some controversial material, like the lyrics of Tupac Shakur (a Warner artist) later gains respect. Here Laybourne added that even Oxygen's most risqué programming is empowering--for women in the appropriate age group.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bronfman also argued that eliminating controversial material is simply unrealistic from the perspective of capitalism--"the engine that drives our society." In support of this, Roberts noted the discrepancy in ratings for different episodes of E!'s "True Hollywood Stories": those that end with the subject dead enjoy ratings about twice as high as those on a subject still living. Roberts concluded: "Now yes, that's pathetic. But at the end of the day it's the consumer, parented or not, that decides."
            </p>
            <p>
             But the apparent sincerity of the panel was undercut somewhat when Auletta turned the target elsewhere, observing: "It's easier to police or have parental guidance for TV--how do you have policing for YouTube?" Now the panel reversed course. Bronfman descried the availability of questionable content, pointing specifically to peer-to-peer social networks as purveyors of questionable material. Likewise, Roberts noted the exponential growth in YouTube--which now takes up 4% of Comcast's bit traffic--and issued a call for regulation by some industry body, if not the government itself. For her part, Laybourne shifted attention from TV to the Internet by describing the difficulty of policing the latter: "It's not getting any better--think about the Internet! It's endless!"

            “Advertising for Prestige”: Publicity in Canada-United States Arctic Defence Cooperation
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The joint Canadian-US Military Cooperation Committee was busy drawing up a grandiose plan for a continental air-defence system that was never instituted and the United States had sought permission to construct a chain of weather stations across the Canadian Arctic. The stations would be operated by the United States Weather Bureau, a civilian agency, but they were clearly military in intent.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was something new for Canada. Prior to 1940, there had been virtually no Canada-United States defence relationship. American troops or installations, civil or military, on Canadian soil, or joint Canadian-American defence planning, would have been unheard of.
            </p>
            <p>
             Canadian government’s effort to keep the details of the new Canada-United States defence partnership under cover was not helped by an incident that took place in late September 1946. In an off-the-record conversation with Time magazine correspondent Larry Laybourne during a visit to New York, Secretary of State Paul Martin said that the Canadian government faced important decisions in the field of joint defence and that he was “staggered by the expense of the installations which Canada would have to finance.” Martin was undoubtedly referring to the MCC’s soon-to-be-shelved air defence plans.
            </p>
            <p>
             Laybourne then contacted American government officials to try to pry more information out of them but was told that any publicity regarding Canada-United States defence activities at that point would embarrass US Secretary of State James Byrnes, then attending the Paris Peace Conference. Laybourne chose to sit on the story but Time’s representative in Ottawa tried to get details about Arctic defence installations from the United States embassy there. At the same time Maclean’s reporter Blair Fraser and the Financial Post’s Wilson were also poking around. Ottawa asked the State Department to help and Laybourne was contacted a second time and told to back off but not before the Canadians were reminded “where the responsibility for putting Time magazine on the trail lay.” The Americans might not have been so compliant if they were not “alive to the danger of prejudicing Canadian Government decisions by unfortunate publicity.”

              <p>
               August Vanistendael (Birtley (Great Britain), 9 January 1917 - Leuven, 8 September 2003) was a
               <strong>
                Belgian trade union leader and minister of State.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                After his secondary studies in Hechtel and Sint-Truiden Vanistendael became a clerk at the BAC, the bank of the Christian workers' movement. In 1938, Vanistendael moved to the Christian trade union and became secretary of the ACV powerhouse in the hospitality industry and in 1941 he became secretary of the umbrella of tourism. In 1944, Vanistendael became secretary of the National Service Center.
               </p>
               <p>
                After the Second World War Vanistendael started a career with the International Christian Trade Union (ICV) and in 1947 he became deputy secretary general. In 1952 he became secretary-general of the ICV. Under the impetus of Vanistendael, the ICV broadened its horizons. Trade unions that were inspired by other world religions could also join Saigon after the 1959 congress.
               </p>
               <p>
                Vanistendael went even further. Also
                <strong>
                 starting trade unions from the new countries of South America, Africa and Asia
                </strong>
                joined. Vanistendael traveled to these countries and
                <strong>
                 set up training institutes for the new leaders and executives
                </strong>
                .
                <em>
                 From the ICV, debates were organized about the course of development and
                 <strong>
                  the need for development aid
                 </strong>
                 for these countries.
                </em>
                In 1968, the ICV changed its name to the more neutral
                <strong>
                 World Alliance of Labor.
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Vanistendael was very respected and became the personal adviser to the West German Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Cardinal Joseph Frings, the Archbishop of Cologne. During the Second Vatican Council he was one of the six lay auditors.
               </p>
               <p>
                Vanistendael was the founder-chairman of the organizations Cooperation and Solidarity in 1961, which awarded scholarships to students from developing countries and Pro Mundi Vita, a research and information center for development aid. In 1963 he was appointed lecturer at the Institute for the Study of Developing Countries at the Catholic University of Leuven. He continued to teach there until 1976.
               </p>
               <p>
                In
                <strong>
                 1967 Vanistendael was specifically involved in development aid and became secretary of the newly established Coöperation Internationale Pour le Développement Socio-Economique (CIDSE), a Catholic network of non-governmental organizations that provide development aid.
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                In 1975 he became president of Caritas Catholica Belgica and remained until his retirement in 1983. Even then he remained active within organizations such as Pax Christi.
               </p>
               <p>
                In 1983, August Vanistendael was appointed Minister of State by King Baudouin and in 1988 he received an honorary doctorate from the Catholic University of Louvain.

            Nice work Vindicator, anyone that is following Q, Alex Jones, Pizzagate, CDAN, all of you and any of you are coming to the understanding that Oprah is INTIMATELY connected to the Clinton Machine, John of God, EPSTEIN and the entire PIZZAGATE Saga, hopefully soon god willing a new thread I'll be working on that revolves around Jussie Smollet is going to ferret out many of these connections.

             <p>
              Laybourne, Everett Broadstone (94) A prominent member of the California bar for the last seven decades, died December 25, 2005, at his Bel-Air home. The cause of death was heart failure. Mr. Laybourne was born in Springfield, Ohio, on October 26, 1911. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Ohio State University in 1932 majoring in English, he received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1935, and was admitted to the California bar a year later. His corporate law practice evolved through a succession of law firms, starting with Macdonald, Schultheis &amp; Pettit in the late 1930's and continuing on to Macdonald, Halsted &amp; Laybourne in the late 1960's. Mr. Laybourne was a senior partner there when the firm merged with Baker McKenzie in 1988. He later had an office at Morrison &amp; Foerster, until 2004.
             </p>
             <p>
              During World War II, Mr. Laybourne served in the United States Navy and saw action in the South Pacific while serving on the staff of the commander of a squadron of attack transports. He was honorably discharged in 1946 as a Lieutenant. At various times during his long legal career, Mr. Laybourne represented the California Energy Commission, the National Gypsum Company, Teleprompter Corporation, Federal Signal Corporation, and Viking Industries, Inc. On behalf of Hughes Aircraft Company, he negotiated commercial transactions in Japan, Venezuela, and the United Kingdom, as well as a Lend-Lease settlement with the USSR.

              </strong>
              during this time. He served as
              <strong>

            <p>
             Lawrence E. Laybourne, who retired last year as
             <strong>
              Time magazine's director of corporate affairs in Washington
             </strong>
             , died of cancer yesterday at his home there. He was 62 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Laybourne started his journalistic career in 1934 as a reporter on The St. Louis PostDispatch. Ten years later, he joined Time as its first staff correspondent in Canada, with headquarters at Ottawa. In 1946, he was Washington news editor. He transferred here in
             <strong>
              1949 to head Time's domestic news service.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1957, he went back to Canada to become managing director of Time International of Canada Ltd. He was appointed assistant publisher in 1962 and, five years later, went to Tokyo as managing director of TimeLife International in Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two years later, he was appointed international editor of Time‐Life Books, then assumed his last post in 1970.

            P.S.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't say if this is a valid connection, but Lawrence E. Laybourne is cited regarding the 1950's NY adoption scheme (i've previously written about it being a CIA operation involving AHEPA)

              <p>
               Gwendolyn Stenehjem Bond, 84, of Somerset died at home March 31 of complications following a stroke.
              </p>
              <p>
               Born on a farm in North Dakota, Mrs. Bond graduated from North Dakota State University and became a drama teacher for the
               <strong>
                University of Wisconsin
               </strong>
               . She drove throughout the Midwest, and
               <strong>
                started local theater groups in farm communities.

              </p>
              <p>
               She came to Washington, D.C. during World War II, and met and married Paterson Bond, a Navy officer making the North Atlantic run between the United States and England. They married in 1945 in the chapel at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               After the war, they moved to New Jersey, where she raised their four children and served as chairman of the Board of Vocational Education for Somerset County and, later, with the Middlesex County College's Division of Community Services.
              </p>
              <p>
               After her husband died in 1990, Mrs. Bond moved to Somerset where she lived until her death. She was a resident of Somerset and was active in the political campaigns of candidates for the Somerset Town Council. She was also an avid supporter of the drama program at Somerset Elementary School.
              </p>
              <p>
               She is survived by her four children, Ellnor Martin of Chevy Chase, Geraldine Laybourne of New York City, Deborah Bond-Upson of Kentfield, Calif., and Charles Bond of Larkspur, Calif.; 12 grandchildren and one great-grandson.

                 Dr. Anne Kendall received her B.A. from Sarah Lawrence College and then earned a Master of Arts in Teaching from Wesleyan University. After teaching history in high school and middle school for 7 years, she realized she was more interested in how students learn than what they learn. She received a Ph.D. in School Psychology from the University of Maryland. Dr. Kendall worked at The Kingsbury Center before starting this practice in 1990 with Dr. Wake. Since then she has focused on treatment of children, adolescents and adults. Her approach to therapy follows a cognitive and behavioral therapy orientation. Often family work is a part of her intervention. She is very interested in learning issues as well as emotional concerns, and works closely with schools to help children and adolescents. She has consulted with many area schools and presented training workshops on a variety of subjects: how to deal with children with anxiety and depression; how findings from neuropsychology give guidance into what teaching strategies work best; understanding learning differences and exploring what strategies can help. In addition to individual therapy, Dr. Kendall enjoys working with couples where she follows an Emotion Focused Therapy (EFT) approach. She has also taught child development and abnormal behavior at American University, The Washington School of Psychiatry and the Jewish Social Services Association. Currently Dr. Kendall is a member of the Dialectical Behavior Therapy team at Wake Kendall and has presented the DBT program in many settings. She is the coauthor with Georgia DeGangi of Effective Parenting for the Hard-to-Manage Child, which was published by Routledge Press in 2008. She frequently works with parents on managing difficult children and has lectured on parenting techniques.

            Recently, TV producer and educator
            <strong>
             Kit Laybourne
            </strong>
            ** was lying on his back, head first, on a staircase inside Vassar’s New England Hall, surrounded by a group of grinning middle school students.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was “selfie” day at Vassar’s Digital Literacy Camp, a two-week experience for Poughkeepsie Middle School students who are learning how to maximize the potential of the smartphones most of them carry with them every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Posing for some goofy “selfies” was part of the day’s activities, and Kit Laybourne was an enthusiastic participant.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Statistics show kids are watching screens for the better part of nine hours every day,” he said, “but they’re only doing creative stuff about 3 percent of the time. We want to show them there’s a better way to use these incredibly powerful devices.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Thirteen-year-old Jameel Richardson said he was having a lot of fun experimenting with self-portraits. “Definitely, selfies can be art,” he said.

            Laybourne, husband of Vassar Trustee Geraldine Laybourne ’69, is part of a team that also includes Vassar students, faculty and alums who hatched the idea for the
            <strong>
             camp this spring
            </strong>
            **.
           </p>
           <p>
            KIT took part in a spring semester class at Vassar on
            <em>
             teens’ use of smartphones taught by Sociology Prof. William Hoynes and Psychological Science Prof. Abigail Baird. Vassar alum Mary Ellen Iatropoulos ’05, director of experience at Art Effect,
            </em>
            **** a Poughkeepsie-based arts and media organization, also attended the class and worked with Laybourne and the students and faculty from the class to develop a curriculum for the camp.

             Can I ask a question, Nomo? How are you finding all this stuff? Maybe you can give some pointers to all the rest of diggers. You seem to have an uncanny knack for turning over treasure in every shovelful.

              A couple of things, I've been stewing on some of this Nick stuff for a while. I considered it all smoke and not worthy of posting until I could make a more compelling presentation. So my earliest comments on this post were my archived stuff.

              Beyond cataloguing info, my strategy search strategy is brute force (like cracking a numerical password)
             </p>

             <p>
              1-1-2 "geffen" + "spielberg" + "Gerry laybourne"
             </p>
             <p>
              1-1-3 "geffen" + "spielberg" + "geraldine laybourne"

             <p>
              I consistently cross search people against previous pgate suspects and keywords. I try to do searches in multiple engines if I'm not getting suspected results. I switch up platforms and purchase a new burner device every few months. I've found search results display differently depending on device/os/browser, even when using the same engine.
             </p>
             <p>
              More recently I've been trying to trace lineages as I suspect abuse is intergenerational. Following the family tree of a suspect is very helpful.
             </p>
             <p>
              A lot of it is probably intuition and early research experience from debate clubs.
             </p>
             <p>
              BTW, i get more results through Google than any other engine. It's censored, but dumbly. (By keyword) If you switch up words and think laterally, you can usually work around it.

                More recently I've been trying to trace lineages as I suspect abuse is intergenerational. Following the family tree of a suspect is very helpful.

                BTW, i get more results through Google than any other engine. It's censored, but dumbly. (By keyword) If you switch up words and think laterally, you can usually work around it.

            Geraldine and Meryl Streep

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Oxygen Media co-founder Geraldine Laybourne has known Streep since she was 18. “She was so funny, and so smart,” Laybourne said. “She was already talented, we already knew, we watched her in plays, and she had talent. But she didn’t always have dates. And that was a very interesting thing, because I also didn’t always have dates, and we would watch her friends—I don’t know what was so great about her friends—but they seemed to always have dates. But we would just watch out the window as they would take off on their dates, and we’d howl and laugh and have fun.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Laybourne added that Streep is a great trustee of Vassar, which two of her daughters also attended. “She is an eloquent spokesperson for liberal arts education, and just as good a human being as you could imagine.”

            </a>
            contains some pertinent info and a mention of Gerry being a co-founder and that it is funded in-part by Betaworks.

             Kandu helps kids learn to code, but don't call it an education app
            </h2>
            <p>
             What makes Kandu, an until-now stealth iPad app funded by Betaworks and operating in closed beta, different is that its makers don't want you to think of it as an education app. With a team that includes an ex-President of MTV and an ex-President at Nickelodeon, Kandu is being pushed as pure entertainment, designed to compete against YouTube videos and Angry Birds for children's precious time, not other learning apps.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Although the game doesn't teach programming languages, it does show kids the fundamentals of object-oriented programming where different classes of actions and attributes are applied to images and concepts. A blue monster might explode when it comes into contact with a octopus. Or gameplay might end after a user drags a ball into a hoop. It also teaches kids how to organize all of these actions in a clean way, promoting best coding practices before even teaching a line of code, says Kandu CEO David Bennahum.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Again though, the educational benefits of the app are secondary to the team's mission statement, which is to build a fun entertainment product tailored to children's digital tablet-friendly consumption habits that also encourages self-expression and connectivity. At Nickelodeon, Kandu co-founder Gerry Laybourne put shows like "You Can't Do That on Television" and "Double Dare" on TV, spending a great deal of time with kids and thinking about their consumption habits. Later she worked on Disney Imagineering to imagine "what an interactive world would be for kids."
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             "Disney didn't get it," she said, adding that the company thought porting Mickey Mouse to a website was all it took to engage kids online. But with games, TV shows, and YouTube videos all attracting kids' attention on their iPads, it takes more than talking Disney princesses to keep youngsters interested. According to Common Sense Media, 3/4 of all US children have access to a mobile device at home, and 10 percent of kids under two have used a smartphone or tablet. "They love these devices," Laybourne says. The trick is "to convert that usage into actual creation."
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             To determine how to make this creative "hacker"-style of building fun, they recruited young testers from anywhere they could, including public schools, nonprofits like Girls Who Code, and the team's own family and friends. Board member Sara Levinson, ex-President of MTV, says she was riding in a cab one day and recruited the driver's child to be part of the test group.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             So far, Kandu has raised a $2.4 million seed round led by Betaworks. Other investors include ex-Discovery president and former Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Judith McHale and Akamai chairman George Conrades. It's also in early talks to possibly raise a Series A round.

            </h2>
            <p>
             Alloy, Inc. (also known as Alloy Online) was founded in 1996 by James K. Johnson and Matthew Diamond as a holding company for Alloy, a teen-oriented magazine and website. By the time the company went public in May 1999, the website earned $15.5 million in monthly revenue and 1.3 million registered users. In January 2000, they purchased book publisher 17th Street Productions, renaming it Alloy Entertainment.[10]
            </p>
            <p>
             Alloy's additional early assets included Delia's (acquired 2003, spun-off in 2005), CCS.com (acquired 2000, sold to Foot Locker in 2008), and Channel One News (acquired 2007, sold to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2014).[11]

            <p>
             In 2009, Alloy created a division called Alloy Digital Networks to hold its online properties.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alloy was then made private through acquisition by an investment group led by Zelnick Media Capital in 2010, and was re-incorporated as Alloy Digital in 2011. Within the next two years, Alloy Digital acquired Smosh,[12] Themis Media (parent company of The Escapist and WarCry Network),[13] Generate LA-NY, and Clevver Media.[14] Zelnick also sold Alloy Entertainment to Warner Bros. Television in 2012.

             In October 2013, Alloy Digital and Break Media merged to become Defy Media. The deal was brokered by RBC Capital Markets, and the resulting entity was owned in part by Zelnick Media, ABS Capital Partners, and Lionsgate.[15]
            </p>
            <p>
             Viacom purchased a stake of Defy Media in 2014, in exchange for ownership of GameTrailers, Addicting Games, and Shockwave.[16] In 2016, Defy settled a $70MM investment by Wellington Management Company, and Zelnick Media exited from investment in 2017.

                    I'm not personally sure if Reiner is a pedo himself, though there's plenty of reason to be suspicious of him, his influence and the company he keeps.

                      No worries. I give no shits what shills, trolls or even angry users call me. Wouldn't be here still if I weren't willing to be the Designated Asshole when needed. :-)  I know some people wig out over removals. Comes with the territory.

           </p>
           <p>
            1) whether the person in question has been discussed on

             v/pizzagate

           <p>
            and
           </p>
           <p>
            2) google all names (i.e. put all names in different search engines), and keywords like 'sexual abuse', 'rape' and 'trafficking'.

            <p>
             Dan Schneider: I didn't have any big expectations for All That because, at the time, I knew almost nothing about the world of kids TV. Creating All That was a ton of fun and I gave it my best because I wanted it to be good and successful. But I just considered it a temp job. I was an actor. I never thought becoming a writer/producer would turn into a full-time thing for me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyways, after we made the All That pilot, about six months went by and I didn't hear much of anything from Brian or the network. At some point, I called Brian and asked him if the network was planning to pick up the show. He wasn't sure. Then I heard that the pilot "hadn't tested great." You see, whenever you make a new TV pilot, the network tests the show with focus groups. So, for All That, they got a bunch of kids—boys, girls, different age groups—and they let them watch the show, and then moderators ask them questions, sort of like a group review. I actually still have the results from those tests. Basically, the people who ran the testing wrote a report—a summary—and they said that while kids might like some aspects of the show, overall, kids wouldn't like All That. I think that's why nothing happened for six months. The pilot only tested "so-so,” so the network was nervous about picking it up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then, if I recall correctly, I heard that the president of Nickelodeon (at the time), a woman named Geraldine Laybourne, watched the All That pilot and loved it. She said something like, "This show is great. Why haven't we picked this up yet? Let's make it." Next thing I knew, we were back in Orlando, where we'd shot the pilot, and we were making a bunch of episodes of All That. It was a blast. I loved every minute of it.

             Emmy Laybourne took the stage with her younger brother, Sam. It was a benefit night at the Kitchen for the Center for Discovery, a camp for people with severe disabilities, and the audience wasn’t the usual alternative comedy crowd, but men in suits and women in cocktail dresses. A tape started playing a schmaltzy melody, and Ms. Laybourne, dressed in a sleeveless red top and long black skirt, began to sing lyrics she’d written: “We could walk on sandy beaches,” Emmy began innocently enough. “We could backpack through Europe,” Sam responded.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soon brother and sister were chiming in on a disturbing chorus: “But we can’t make love–because we are related! It’s taboo for me and you!” They danced lasciviously with each other, then backed off guiltily.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the audience were the Laybournes’ mother and father–Geraldine Laybourne, the former head of Nickelodeon and now potentate of the new women’s cable and Internet channel, Oxygen, and Kit Laybourne, the former head of the Colossal Pictures animation studio who is now developing programming for Oxygen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The little duet kept going: “I used to watch you sleeping when you were a little child,” sang Emmy. “And I thought to myself as I saw you, so weak, so defenseless–man, it would be wild!” To which Sam replied: “I used to watch you bathing when you went through puberty. And I thought to myself as I saw you emerge from the water–why can’t she be with me?”
            </p>
            <p>
             At the end of the number, the Laybourne parents applauded loudly for Emmy’s paean to incest. What parent wouldn’t be proud?
            </p>
            <p>
             “She was born creative,” Geraldine Laybourne said after the show. “She really didn’t have a choice. This poor kid was tortured. She and Sam used to say, ‘Please, Mom, no more TV!'”

             She rearranged Nickelodeon with the force of a tornado, starting as a consultant at the network launch in 1979. After getting a master's degree in elementary education at the University of Philadelphia, she formed an independent production studio and, with her husband, Kit, an independent filmmaker, was creating pilots for the network. The following year, Laybourne joined as a programming manager and was elevated to general manager in 1986. At the time, Nickelodeon was losing $10 million a year as a commercial-free channel with the lowest ratings in cable. It was the "spinach channel," bitter tasting--but good for kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             Guided by rigorous focus groups with children, Laybourne honed a philosophy for the network based on the mind-set that growing up is tough. But the network had little money for developing programs to help kids cope, so Laybourne bought cheap old shows and packaged them to look cool. She started accepting advertising and retooling the economics of production to make originals affordable. Game shows came first, with "Double Dare" debuting in 1986, shattering the myth that kids would only watch nimation. She produced the show with neighborhood kids in the basement of her New Jersey home.

             A sense of community is still a part of their life. At their vacation house 45 minutes outside Telluride, the Laybournes built two oversized bunk beds in the living room, with curtains that can be drawn for privacy. (Their own bed is in another room, on rollers, railroad-style, so that they can sleep under the stars on the balcony at the end of the tracks.) Kit says weekend guests love the bunk beds: "There is something lewd about adults sleeping together in one room."

               Will someone do a separate thread on "The Perverts of Nickelodeon" with all the best links/evidence of each of them? Do you have that material handy Nomo?
              </p>
              <p>
               I will turn it into a Twitter thread we can drop into people's timelines like a nice little pizza grenade. Telling images I can pretty up each tweet, as well as links to make a string of tweets would be awesome.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would do it, but I'm hunkered down doing taxes for the next couple weeks. :-/

              One of the most wonderful things that has happened for me this summer is that I have started supporting a small orphanage in Uganda:

              e. ❤️
It is run by a kind, resourceful and devoted man, Joseph Nsereko. I recently sent them a relatively small amount of money and had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing the giant vat of chicken soup it allowed Joseph to serve them, not to mention this awesome video!

               Interesting! So Emily's List might be one of the things Q was referring to when he said "Follow the wives." One of the founders was
               <a href="https://archive.fo/Fjo2o">
                Anne Wexler
               </a>
               . She gave Hillary her first job in politics, and was close friends with Hunter S. Thompson:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                She managed the 1970 United States Senate campaign in Connecticut for Democrat Joseph Duffey, a Democrat who came in second to Republican Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., with incumbent Thomas J. Dodd coming in third.[1] Bill and Hillary Clinton, then students at Yale Law School, were recruited among the campaign's volunteer workers. (Mrs. Clinton, while running for President in 2008, credited Wexler with providing her first political job.)[3]
               </p>
               <p>
                Called the "Rolodex Queen" for the number and scope of her contacts, and lauded by Washingtonian magazine as "easily the most influential female lobbyist" in the capital, she credited her success to fulfilling the lobbyist's responsibility of guiding legislators through the pros and cons of complex legislation, a process that "government officials are not comfortable making... by themselves."[1][7]
               </p>
               <p>
                Rolling Stone magazine hired Wexler as an associate publisher in 1973, where her duties managing political reporting included overseeing the notoriously unconventional Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who would sometimes stay at the Duffey-Wexler residence while in Washington, D.C.[1]

               One thing jumped out at me was the name of the political action group: E-M-I-L-Y stands for "Early Money Is Like Yeast". This may be subtle Christian mocking. It reminds me of a passage from St. Paul:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <h1 id="md-corinthians-5-new-revised-standard-version-nrsv">
                1 Corinthians 5 New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)

               <h2 id="md-sexual-immorality-defiles-the-church">
                Sexual Immorality Defiles the Church
               </h2>
               <p>
                5 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not found even among pagans; for a man is living with his father’s wife. 2 And you are arrogant! Should you not rather have mourned, so that he who has done this would have been removed from among you?
               </p>
               <p>
                3 For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present I have already pronounced judgment 4 in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing.[a] When you are assembled, and my spirit is present with the power of our Lord Jesus, 5 you are to hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.[b]
               </p>
               <p>
                6 Your boasting is not a good thing. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? 7 Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch, as you really are unleavened. For our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed. 8 Therefore, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

                Quite possibly, if not a reference to Laybourne also, come to think of it.

                Eeeh... maybe. More likely a reference to the little amount of yeast required in making bread(money).

               <p>
                "Early money is like yeast", meaning that wise use of early money(investment) can lead to something more lucrative.

                 That was my thought. As big as these freaks are into child sacrifice, though, I didn't want to leave any stone unturned. The fact that Scripture passage refers to incest, and the Laybourne kids did a skit on incest... That's a weird thing to have popping up multiple times.

             In 1964,[3] Noyes created the animated film Clay or Origin of the Species [4] which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.[5] The film is considered one of the earliest examples of clay stop-animation[6] and is cited by Wallace and Gromit creators, Peter Lord and David Sproxton as a large influence on their work.[7]

IBM, ABC, Cummins Engine, UPS, and Enron, among many others, owe Rand their graphical heritage.[5] One of his strengths, as Moholy-Nagy pointed out,[4] was his ability as a salesman to explain the needs his identities would address for the corporation.~

             NeXT started porting the NeXTSTEP operating system to IBM PC compatible computers using the Intel 80486 processor in late 1991. The operating system was ported to Intel's architecture because of a change in NeXT's business strategy, which was then to remove themselves from the hardware business entirely.

            <p>
             ~NeXTSTEP gained popularity at institutions such as First Chicago NBD, Swiss Bank Corporation, O'Connor and Company, and other organizations owing to its programming model.[51] It was also used by many American federal agencies, such as United States Naval Research Laboratory, the National Security Agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the
             <strong>
              Central Intelligence Agency
             </strong>

              Ellen Wayland-Smith, a professor of writing at USC, counts two of Noyes’ sisters among her great-great-great grandmothers, has just published a gimlet-eyed book about her family history. Oneida: From Free Love to the Well-Set Table
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               On a more sinister note, what is remembered as “free love” wasn’t exactly free; Noyes had the power to dictate who was fucking and breeding with whom, resulting in plenty of situations that look a lot like coercion—and even rape—to contemporary eyes. He insisted on personally initiating young virgins into what was termed the “social life” of the Community. “The women were introduced to sex whether they wanted it or not, when they were 12 to 14,” says Wayland-Smith, noting that the age of consent in New York at the time was also, unfortunately, 12. “The thing that bothers me is that the people who initially signed on to this thing were consenting adults. Then what happened, once the new generation came up, was they were born into it. They didn’t know anything else. Their parents gave them over to the Community and part of being in the Community was that you had to have sex. And they were not consenting because they weren’t of age [by contemporary standards].” The darkness didn’t end there. Noyes believed in “avunculate marriage” (between uncles and nieces) and held up certain forms of incest as ideal; Wayland-Smith writes that it’s still unclear whether he slept with his sisters.

             <p>
              In my researches, I ran across a JOHN HUMPHREY NOYSE. He was the originator of the ONEIDA COMMUNITY, 1848-1881, a perfectionistic, religious, communistic, “Free Love”, eugenic settlement which supported itself with making beautiful silverware, among other things.
             </p>
             <p>
              It makes for fascinating reading, and I tried to find an obvious connection to the Derry/Eliot Noyes family, but better researchers than I will have to try for that, if it matters. Nevertheless -
             </p>
             <p>
              IF and I say “IF” it is the same family, how very interesting.
             </p>
             <p>
              I could find nothing about the origins of Eliot F. Noyes’s father Atherton, except that he was born in 1862, “had deep Boston roots,” and taught English literature at Harvard. The reason for going to Colorado had been because Atherton had wanted to be a physician, but contracted tuberculosis and went on a different career path. The time spent in Colorado when Eliot Fette was little, was for Atherton’s health. Atherton’s time of birth could plausibly put his antecedents with the Oneidas, but I have NO PROOF of that.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                His son, Rev. James Noyes II of Stonington, Connecticut, was one of the first trustees of Yale College, a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known as "The Founders". Their engraved names line the facade of Woodbridge Hall at Yale University. The building is named for Timothy Woodbridge, cousin to Rev. James Noyes II and one of the other ten founding ministers of the college
               </p>
               <p>
                The Noyes Family continues a long tradition at Yale with notable persons having contributed to the University. Rev. James Noyes II was the first Senior Fellow (Chair) of the Board of Trustees, and his younger brother Rev. Moses Noyes also served as a member of the Trustees.
                <strong>
                 Rev. Daniel Parker Noyes graduated Yale 1840,
                </strong>
                as did his two sons Edward Parish Noyes, 1880, and
                <strong>
                 Frederic A. Noyes,
                </strong>
                1862. Theodore R. Noyes receive a Yale medical degree 1867. Haskell Noyes graduated Yale 1908. Herbert MacArthur Noyes graduated Yale 1914. Newbold Noyes, Jr. graduated Yale 1941. Herbert MacArthur Noyes Jr. graduated Yale 1949. Thomas E. Noyes graduated Yale 1953. Professor Edward Simpson Noyes, PhD (1892-1967) was chairman of the Board of Admissions for 18 years, director of the Master of Arts in Teaching program, and received the Yale Medal of Honor in 1968. His son Edward MacArthur Noyes II (1919-1999), who was also presented with the Yale Medal of Honor for his lifetime service to Yale in 1996, served as president of the Yale Club of New Haven.
               </p>
               <p>
                His son James Noyes II (born 11 March 1640, Newbury – 30 December 1719, Stonington, Connecticut) was also a clergyman and founded Yale College. He graduated from Harvard in 1659, began to preach in 1664, and was pastor of the church in Stonington, Connecticut from 1674 until his death. A councilor in civil affairs in the critical periods of his colony, James Noyes II also practiced medicine with success.
               </p>
               <p>
                Early Noyes descendants often were ministers and teachers, and sometimes distinguished – for example, the Salem Witch Trials (James's nephew Nicholas Noyes) and the founding of Yale College.
               </p>
               <p>
                On 14 November 1692, during the Salem Witch Trials, 17-year-old Mary Herrick accused Noyes' daughter, Sarah Noyes Hale (wife of John Hale), and the ghost of executed Mary Eastey of afflicting her, but she was never formally charged with witchcraft or arrested.[20] A later commentator on the trials, Charles Upham suggests that this accusation was one that helped turn public opinion to end the prosecutions, and spurred John Hale's willingness to reconsider his support of the trials.[21]
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Rev James Noyes I is also the ancestor of John Humphrey Noyes, leader of the Perfectionist movement and founder of the Oneida Community.

                I was using geni.com to look, but hadn't checked all siblings and ancestors properly. Geni also hits a dead end at Lemuel Noyes. However, using ancestry.com and findagrave.com to cross reference, it's still difficult to confirm due to more dead ends and discrepancies, but it's quite likely that the common ancestor is Rev. William Noyes.

              Alan Buder, one of Eli’s partners is deceased. He was a committed environmentalist. He had gone to Colgate, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, and Yale. He started numerous businesses, primarily in animation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Alan co-founded Climate Cartoons (not with Noyes, that I could find - but the Alligator Planet website appears to be carrying them in their listings) to educate the next generation about the implications of climate change. He was also a founding member of E2, Environmental Entrepreneurs.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the cartoon films of Alan’s found cited at imdb.com is “Lucy: Daughter of the Devil.”

             <p>
              I spent quite a bit of time digging to try to connect Ralph Guggenheim, Eli’s other Alligator Planet LLC partner with “THE” Guggenheims. I was able to find a family tree of “THE” Guggenheims, but if Ralph is one of “THEIR” family members, he does not seem to be publicly or liberally acknowledged.
             </p>
             <p>
              He has an impressive film background and was apparently, according to some, Pixar before there was a Pixar.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ralph was a NY native, went to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg. He studied photography and computer science. He was working at NY Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab. Lucasfilm hired him and moved him to California in 1981.
             </p>
             <p>
              “…After his research lab at Lucasfilm was sold to Steve Jobs and renamed Pixar, Guggenheim continued to work in the world of graphics and animation. Guggenheim, a respected founder of Pixar, eventually became Vice President of Feature Animation and was a lead producer for Toy Story. Guggenheim left the company in 1997 after Disney forced Pixar to remove him as producer from Toy Story 2....”
             </p>
             <p>
              The article does not explain why Disney did not want Ralph working on Toy Story 2.
             </p>
             <p>
              He then co-founded the Alligator Planet LLC with Alan and Eli.

              Eli Noye’s wiki page has a number of titles listed of his work. However, the one that caught my eye (as I suspect it will yours too) was his work with Disney on…….

              The 1991 Disney series, “ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.”
             </p>
             <p>
              I looked that up with the friendly little link wiki thoughtfully provided, and found this:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_in_Wonderland">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_in_Wonderland
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              “Adventures in Wonderland is a live-action/puppet musical television series based on Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll. In the series, Alice (played by Elisabeth Harnois), was portrayed as a girl who can come and go from Wonderland simply by walking through her mirror (a reference to Alice Through the Looking Glass).
             </p>
             <p>
              The series originally ran from March 23, 1992 to 1995 (with reruns continuing until at least 1997) on The Disney Channel and on stations across the country. Like many Disney Channel original shows, Adventures in Wonderland was originally taped at Disney-MGM Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, with two sound stages used exclusively for the show, but only for its first 40 episodes. Afterward, shooting was moved to Los Angeles, CA.”
             </p>
             <p>
              “Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released three VHS tapes of certain episodes.”
             </p>
             <p>
              “The puppets for some of the characters were created by Chiodo Bros. Inc.”
             </p>
             <p>
              There were a number of credits listed for the various actors associated with the film. Terry Garr was “The Duchess” - (and was really the only name I recognized.)
             </p>
             <p>
              The article included some notes about the characters in the series, and how they interact with each other. They are the characters we are familiar with from the Lewis Carroll story. Alice, the Red Queen, the White Rabbit, etc. I found them to be enlightening, in view of our Q studies.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2005, Alligator Planet produced “Here Comes Peter Cottontail” - another endearing story featuring a rabbit.
             </p>
             <p>
              (As far as I’m concerned, Brother Ei has here an honestly earned Red flag.)
             </p>
             <p>
              So, while I have been unable to place Eli Noyse directly with Laurel Canyon, both he and his living partner, Ralph, have both worked with Disney in Hollywood.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have the understanding from previous digs that Disney was involved up to his cute little mustache in the secret CIA film making facility in Laurel Canyon. Eli and Ralph at different times both worked for Disney’s company. So, while there does not seem to be a direct Laurel Canyon tie, one could possibly make a case for an implied one, or indirect one.
             </p>

              STRANGENESS:
I found near the end of my searches, a link to some US Post Office stamp art work done by Derry, which was dedicated to the theme, “Animal Rescue: Adopt a Shelter Pet Stamp.”

              The Post Office was promoting it, giving instructions for how to obtain first day covers. They also produced an article about the stamps:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://about.usps.com/news/state-releases/ny/2010/ny_2010_0504.htm">
               https://about.usps.com/news/state-releases/ny/2010/ny_2010_0504.htm
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              In the article the Post Office posted in May of 2010, it is noted that the stamps were originally unveiled on the ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW on March 17, 2010.
             </p>
             <p>
              This “Gee Whiz” factoid caught my eye in the instructions for how to obtain a first day issue:
             </p>
             <p>
              “…. Customers have 60 days to obtain the first day of issue postmark by mail. They may purchase new stamps at their local Post Office™, at The Postal Store® at www.usps.com/shop or by calling 800-STAMP-24. They should affix the stamps to envelopes of their choice, address the envelopes to themselves or others and place them in a larger envelope addressed to: Animal Rescue: Adopt A Shelter Pet Stamps C/O POSTMASTER 7035 LAUREL CANYON BLVD. HOLLYWOOD, CA 91605-9998…”
             </p>
             <p>
              So I leave it in your capable hands to decide if Derry and the Noyes family have a genuine “Laurel Canyon” dot-connect.
             </p>
             <p>
              Derry Noyes Craig DOES have a very genuinely interesting family full of bright talented people. My conclusion remains, as I have previously indicated that Derry brought a lot to Gregg Craig when he married her talented self, and into her exceptionally creative family.

              Derry Noyes Craig’s sister lives a very quiet life, as far as Wikipedia is concerned. None of the Wiki stories I initially read made direct mention of her, only that Eliot and Molly Noyes had “four children.” Eli, Frederick and Derry were named, but not Mary - until I found their mother’s obituary.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mary seems to be an impressive, lovely woman. She got her nursing degree from Columbia in 1981. She has served as the director of Occupational Health Services at Rockefeller University in Manhattan.
             </p>
             <p>
              She is an enthusiastic flutists, who plays often in a woodwind quintet.
             </p>
             <p>
              I found several web sites which list her as a moderate donor to some educational and artistic fund raisers. Not flashy, or “LOOK AT ME!” at all.
             </p>
             <p>
              Quiet, purposeful life. Based on what I have learned about her, I admire her.
             </p>
             <p>
              She is married to a doctor, quite a famous one, Dr. John C. M. Brust of New York. He is a professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and the director of neurology at Harlem Hospital Center. He also has been involved with the New York and Presbyterian Hospital in New York.
             </p>
             <p>
              He as been in practice since 1962. He has not ever been involved in any malpractice actions of any kind according to two different sites I looked at.
             </p>
             <p>
              One scientific research paper in which he participated, was an examination of the effects and safety of medical marijuana in selected neurologic disorders. In certain circumstances, the studies’ researchers stated they found the substance to be helpful.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meridee’s and Dr John’s son, Dr. James Charles Morrison Brust, was married to Dr Sophia Dolly Lin in the Noyes house, built by his grandfather Eliot.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Dr. Brust, 33, is an infectious diseases specialist at Montefiore Medical Center and an assistant professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, both in the Bronx. He conducts research on H.I.V. and drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa. He graduated magna cum laude from Columbia, from which he also received his medical degree.”
             </p>
             <p>
              In another article, I read that he is now living in Africa,(at the time of the article) and (presumably) researching HIV there.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also can’t help but wonder if he and his dad and Uncle Frederick had some conversations about “epigenetics” and other such considerations of the microscopic and submicroscopic levels. We’re still holding up the day glo pink flag.
             </p>
             <p>
              So even quiet Meridee, Derry’s sister, Greg’s siste in-law, brings enhancements to the Greg Craig career track. Two noted doctors in Greg’s brother-in-law and nephew, and a prominent accomplished nurse sister-in-law in a major NY hospital, are in Greg’s circle of connections.
             </p>

             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Frederick Noyes followed his father’s footsteps and is also a well known architect. He first studied biology at Harvard, then in graduate school, he studied architecture. He has taught both subjects at the college level.
             </p>
             <p>
              He “has been most closely associated with Boston Architectural College, for which he has developed curricula and programs and chaired the board. His Boston architectural practice mainly builds hospitals and houses.”
             </p>
             <p>
              In an interview for iconichouses.org, he was asked what was next for him. He gave the following reply:
             </p>
             <p>
              “There are exciting developments in neurobiology and epigenetics. I want to better understand those…”
             </p>
             <p>
              Me too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wikipedia defines “epigenetics” as:
             </p>
             <p>
              “Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. The Greek prefix ‘ in epigenetics implies features that are “on top of” or “in addition to” the traditional genetic basis for inheritance….”
             </p>
             <p>
              “…One example of an epigenetic change in eukaryotic biology is the process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, as a single fertilized egg cell – the zygote – continues to divide, the resulting daughter cells change into all the different cell types in an organism, including neurons, muscle cells, epithelium, endothelium of blood vessels, etc., by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others….”
             </p>
             <p>
              To me this says he’s interested in the exploration of the NON-DNA transmission of genetic expression. In the developing embryo, they are studying how certain cells are caused to begin their differentiations. I’m certain that my understanding is woefully incomplete.
             </p>
             <p>
              I’m wondering if he is getting into this research (genetics/DNA/epigenetics) which is seeming to preoccupy so many of the Cabal, like the 23 and Me people. Is it his natural direction of curiosity, or has his curiosity been helped along and encouraged a bit somehow or another? I don’t know, but I have perhaps, not a red flag here, but perhaps a day-glo pink one, especially in light of other relatives we learn of later.

             Obama's White House Counsel is married to Eli Noyes' sister (Kit Laybourne's Animation Partner's sister)
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Upon learning that Greg Craig, Obama’s White House Counsel, had obtained legal representation, I realized I did not really know much about him. Being mindful of my assignment by Swordmaker (who echos Q,) to “follow the wives,” I’ve also researched and learned a little bit about Greg Craig’s wife, Derry and her family.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_B._Craig">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_B._Craig
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Greg Craig was a student at Exeter. He went to Harvard, and reportedly became acquainted with Henry Kissinger and other faculty there. After earning honors there, he became active in anti-Vietnam War and liberal activities. Craig received a medical deferment for a shoulder injury.
             </p>
             <p>
              He went on to Yale Law school, where some of HIS FELLOW CLASSMATES WERE BILL CLINTON, HILLARY RODHAM, AND DAVID E. KENDALL. Kendall, it will be remembered, was Clinton’s lawyer during the impeachment proceedings.
             </p>
             <p>
              Craig was on EDWARD M. (TED) KENNEDY’S STAFF, and held other notable positions and worked on prominent cases in his career.
             </p>
             <p>
              HE WAS ON THE TEAM IN 1981, WHO REPRESENTED JOHN W. HINCKLEY JR. AFTER THE SHOOTING OF PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1996, Bill Clinton offered him the post of White House Counsel, but declined. Secretary of State MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT APPOINTED CRAIG TO the post of director of policy planning at the State Department in 1997. “In October 1997, Albright gave Craig the additional post of special coordinator for Tibetan affairs, in order “to focus attention on China’s suppression of Tibet’s cultural and religious traditions.””
             </p>
             <p>
              He accepted a position on Clinton’s IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE counsel team.
             </p>
             <p>
              He worked with the legal team representing Juan Miguel Gonzales, the Cuban father of six year old ELIAN GONZALEZ, which resulted in Elian’s return to Cuba.
             </p>
             <p>
              He served as an advisor to the Obama campaign. It is reported in the Wiki article that it had been speculated that he had hoped for Secretary of State, but was offered and ACCEPTED THE POSITION OF WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL. The article lists details of what some of his activities were in that position.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was subjected to an OUSTER CAMPAIGN, thought to have been spearheaded partly by Rahm Emanuel, who leaked documents, as reported by Nina Totenberg. “Craig’s resignation took effect on January 3, 2010. He became the highest-ranking official to leave the Obama administration up until that point.”
             </p>
             <p>
              After his resignation, he obtained the position as a Global Policy and Litigation Strategy Practice Group partner for the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom, LLP.
             </p>
             <p>
              The firm was representing Goldman Sachs, and hired Craig to advise them in their civil lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
             </p>
             <p>
              He also represented JOHN EDWARDS, gaining acquittal, in the misuse of campaign funds in the RIELLE HUNTER cover up case.
             </p>
             <p>
              And this is where we can sit up and see how the Manafort plea deal exposes the Podesta actions in the Ukraine thereby peeling some onion layers back, … and there is our man Greg right in the middle!
             </p>
             <p>
              “CRAIG LED A TEAM OF LAWYERS FROM SKADDEN, ARPS WHO WERE COMMISSIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE under President Viktor Yanukovich to look into errors in the trial of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko on abuse-of-power charges.”…”Experts say that Craig should have registered as a foreign agent, as lobbyists are required to do when they lobby on behalf of foreign governments.”
             </p>
             <p>
              He resigned from the firm of Skadden et al, in April 2018 because one of the firm’s London lawyers was indicted by Mueller, and pleaded guilty to making false statements.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was reported by CNN and NBC, that following a referral from Mueller’s office, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York was investigating Craig and others, including ex-lobbyist TONY PODESTA and former Republican U.S. Representative Vin Weber, as part of a broader investigation into the activities of Paul Manafort.

              </h1>
              <p>
               In April 2018, Craig resigned from the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, following the indictment of Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer at the firm's London office. Craig was the lead attorney supervising the firm's work for former Ukrainian president Yanukovich, in which Zwann participated. Zwaan was later charged by Mueller investigation and pleaded guilty to making false statements.[42][44] Later in 2018, NBC and CNN reported that following a referral from Mueller's office, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was investigating Craig and others, including ex-lobbyist Tony Podesta and former Republican U.S. Representative Vin Weber, as part of a broader investigation into the activities of Paul Manafort.[45]

            From
            <a href="https://archive.fo/8ikM5">
             this 2012 New York Times
            </a>
            piece:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Whistle’s executives believe that their audience can be found among the tens of millions of children who play organized sports and who navigate with increasing ease between televisions, computers, tablets, cellphones, apps and social media.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Timing is everything,” said John West, the Whistle’s chairman, who founded the media company with Jeff Urban, a former Gatorade senior vice president, and Kit Laybourne, a former executive producer of Nickelodeon. “Start-ups are innovators. And there’s a massive disruption going on in the media. New technology is giving us distribution wherever you turn.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The programming will not resemble ESPN’s cut down to child’s size; no mini-Chris Bermans will be shouting nicknames of Little Leaguers while reciting song lyrics from the ’90s. Rather, it will put youngsters at the center of the mix, inviting them to upload their videos of backyard and organized games; to interact with pro athletes like DeMarcus Ware; to become sportscasters; and to re-enact some of the greatest plays in sports history.
            </p>
            <p>
             It will also provide games, instructional and animated shows, and programming created from footage leased from leagues and other entities.
            </p>
            <p>
             The venture’s investors include Derek Jeter, Peyton Manning and Mia Hamm; Bob DuPuy, the former president of Major League Baseball; and Bob Pittman, the chairman of Clear Channel Communications, who ran MTV in the 1980s. Last year, West said that the company raised $4 million from 50 investors. This year, he said the plan was raise up to $20 million, enough to be profitable in a year.

            The other day in Manhattan, Hillary Clinton supporters met for lunch at the home of the media executive Geraldine Laybourne. A group of 50, mostly women, was determined to generate excitement for Clinton’s campaign for president. They were frustrated to see her lagging again among younger voters, and their invited speaker was Kenyatta Cheese, a young Obama campaign veteran and internet impresario.

            Herbert J. Allen Jr.'s male-dominated annual power powwow in Sun Valley, Idaho, is breaking with tradition. Not only are there more female executives on the corporate guest list this year than usual--a whopping six out of 104 or so--there will be a first-ever panel discussion led by and about women and business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Allen's famed, though secretive, annual confab, which runs July 7 to 12, is the 16th edition and has become a sort of high-powered male-bonding session for some of the world's most influential investors, chief executives and media moguls including the likes of Warren Buffett, Paul Allen, Rupert Murdoch, Sumner Redstone, John Malone, Gerald Levin, Michael Eisner, David Geffen, Barry Diller, Edgar Bronfman Jr., Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Herbert Siegel and Philip Knight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Allen--Wall Street's mighty investment banker to the (media) stars--encourages his guests to bring their wives and kids along to the mountain retreat, billed as a family getaway with planned activities ranging from ice skating and kickball to fly-fishing and a rodeo.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the family is at play, the moguls huddle to talk about changes in the industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the number of top female executives on hand representing corporations in any given year has been few and far between--as they are in the industry in general. Last year, Mattel Inc. President and CEO Jill Barad became the first female CEO ever invited to make a company presentation.
           </p>
           <p>
            This year, Barad is one of four women at the conference speaking on a panel titled "Women and Business," along with Washington Post Chairwoman Katherine Graham, former Disney/ABC Cable Networks President Geraldine Laybourne, and fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg. ABC's Prime Time Live co-host Diane Sawyer will moderate. (Pleasant T. Rowland, who just sold her doll company to Mattel in a $700-million deal engineered by Allen &amp; Co., is the other female executive guest, though she will not be on the panel).
           </p>
           <p>
            Graham, Laybourne and Von Furstenberg also have been executive guests at the conference before. Von Furstenberg runs in media circles as a close friend of Barry Diller. And it helps to be an Allen &amp; Co. client. The investment bank is actively raising money for Laybourne, who recently started her own production company with her former lawyer--Lisa Hall, who left her practice--to serve the quickly converging Internet and television worlds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another new and seemingly politically correct addition is a panel called "Race in the Workplace: Past Practices/Future Challenges," which Tom Brokaw, another Allen friend, will moderate. Panelists include Time Warner President Richard Parsons, Black Entertainment Television founder Robert Johnson, Eastman Kodak's George Fisher, Washington Post Co. Chairman Donald Graham, and Leslie Jones, a student at the Roberto C. Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Atlanta.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like Geraldine has connections to many that we have researched before.  David Geffen, Barry Diller, Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Diane von Furstenberg to name just a few.

                Thanks!  I just couldn't pull up his name.  I have been fasting for 10 days and my brain is water logged LOL.   I read that in Fla. there is a low sentence for trafficking about 2 years?  Hmm.  Wonder why.

              Bingo. Those were my exact thoughts. I had horrid visions of the Childten being brought there. Wonder if everyone made it out alive. Scary.

               That is an interesting link. It does express reservation for comparing it to something like Bohemian Grove and that the subjects of the conference are rather banal but that still doesn't mean subjects are not talked about and arrangements made. This Herbert J Allen and his successor Herbert Allen III (Yale/ Probably Skull and Bones)are some very interesting fellows and made their fortune in corporate takeover.

               There's a lot to read there.  I started it but will continue and get back to you.  TTT pops in no matter what.  I think you should do a post on this.  Not our fault if he posts the usual.  This needs to be seen.  This is an EPIC Find.

              BTW, I was getting a sinking feeling about what else might be going on at Sun Valley.  Especially with Geffen and Diller there. When I read that they brought their children, I immediately thought of the swimming pool and the grandchildren in the Podesta emails.  Creepy.

              Another connection between Laybournes and Bill Gates is the school Kit Laybourne sits on the board of: Bard High School. It's a school for gifted rich kids started with money from the Gates Foundation. Their claim to fame is kids start college two years early (only two years of high school). There didn't appear to be any pedo teacher scandals associated with the school(s) though.
