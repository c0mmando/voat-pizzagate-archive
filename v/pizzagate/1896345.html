            I'm looking down on her for vile evil creature that she is.
           </p>
           <p>
            She's scared and knows we know the truth which is why she's desperately trying to convince people that pedogate is a conspiracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            So why should I have been molested as a child exactly?  I don't understand?  When does any child deserve to be raped?  When does any adult have the right to rape innocence?

            Hillary is crazy. She has Parkinson's and one of the symptoms is psychosis. I wish I was making this up but I'm not.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1893977">
             I wrote a post about it here.
            </a>
            Don't be fooled by the lack of a hand tremor. She's got a Deep Brain Simulator to hide it. During the election a Radiologist who is also a Deplorable Shit Lord explained the type of MRI she gets, it's only for for people with metal in their head, plates, wires etc. In her case it's the wire from a DPS for her Parkinson's.

             You can't blame this in her Parkinsons though.  They're all crazy - without Parkinsons.
            </p>
            <p>
             She knows pedogate is real and she's scared.  She's trying to spread the idea that "right wing nuts are cooking up crazy conspiracy theories" before more people become woke.
            </p>
            <p>
             None of them have reason and accountability.  Just look at the responses to Manchester.  "Respond with love not hate.  It's so nice to see a Muslim cab driver driving the concert goers to safety for free. If we weren't racist, this wouldn't have happened.  He was a lone wolf."  Blah blah blah blah
            </p>
            <p>
             They're ALL nuts.  I truly believe something is not wired properly in all of their brains or maybe there's some credibility to the birth control pill frontal lobe damage theory.  The one world order elites, though, are more than that.  They're EVIL.

               Yes.  That's a given when you consider most "elites" but I'm seeing extremely disordered thinking by the general population.  Having a run and a concert and laying flowers at the Manchester arena isn't going to solve anything- not going to prevent a similar attack from happening again.  I get they need to grieve and heal, so I'm not against such activities.  But they literally think love is the answer.  How can they not see how ridiculous their thinking is.  Love will not fix people that blow up little girls along with themselves with nail bombs.  And this is just one of MANY examples of disordered thinking I'm seeing right now.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another one is sanctuary cities.  Cities that protect people breaking the law?  Wtf?!  Another is example is their saying requiring an ID required to vote would be racist??  The left elites have an agenda with this so it makes more sense for them to spin it. But the people who are falling for the spin are nuts.  How can they not see through this?
