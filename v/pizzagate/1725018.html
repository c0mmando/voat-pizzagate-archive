<p>Flynn Jr is not simply a pizzagate supporter who is unaware that these people are disinfo shills.  <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/michael-g-flynn-son-children-family-lieutenant-general-national-security-adviser-donald-trump/">He works with his father at their &quot;Flynn Intel Group Inc&quot; company and acted as his fathers chief of staff</a>.  He is plugged into what is going on and is not choosing to re-tweet the major players of the pizzagate disinformation campaign by accident.</p>
<p>Flynn Jr was also fired by the Trump campaign over the controversy created by his pizzagate tweets.  Hit pieces were written that falsely accused the administration of requesting a security clearance for Flynn Jr:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/12/07/before-they-fired-michael-flynn-jr-over-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory-they-wanted-to-give-him-security-clearance/">Before they fired Michael Flynn Jr. over Pizzagate conspiracy theory, Donald Trump’s transition team wanted to give him security clearance</a></p>
<p>The claim that a security clearance was being requested for Flynn Jr was refuted by the Trump administration:
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/michael-flynn-jr-security-clearance-mike-pence-232270">Pence aide denies security clearance was requested for Flynn Jr.</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The elder Flynn has also been intentionally making problems for Trump:</p>
<p>Recently, there were new hit pieces on Michael T Flynn recently for his firm doing lobbying for a Turkey firm just prior to the new administration taking office: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/08/michael-flynn-received-530000-from-turkish-client-during-trump-campaign/98917184/">Turkish client paid $530,000 to Michael Flynn\'s consulting firm</a></p>
<p>Of course, previously Flynn has been criticized for <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/14/kellyanne-conway-key-michael-flynn-was-misleading-/">misleading vice president, others</a> about a phone call with the Russian ambassador</p>
<p>Michael T Flynn likely concealed his Turkey lobbying work from The Trump administration: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-aide-flynn-lobbying-helped-turkey-46011946">White House: Trump unaware of Flynn\'s foreign agent work</a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The Flynns were (and still are) making problems for Trump.  These are smart and well-connected people that know their actions were and are creating these problems.  They were also likely part of a plan to fabricate &quot;Russian connection&quot; nonsense (<a href="http://archive.is/oB8V3">MSM been attempting to sell the narrative that Russian propaganda had an effect on the election and they may be attempting to use pizzagate as this propaganda</a>).  
</p>
<p>I believe that Flynn was canned from his role as National Security Advisor for being part of a massive controlled opposition smear campaign.</p>

            The Flynn's can disseminate what ever information they like. They are are not leading this investigation, people on here and 4chan are. The real researchers on this pedobust know what bites are bullshit because they've already done the digging. A tweet from Mike Flynn &amp; Mike Flynn Jr. is not steering anyone off course. We all k ow what is solid evidence and what it a shill's stink bomb.

              Not sure. I never know who is moderating. Flynn Jr. has been calling out the elite, even though his father is not in Trump's cabinet officially, do not underestimate the people behind Trump. My thought is that, Flynn may not have an official role but he is there.
Also, if Flynn was with the elites they would have not wanted him out of Trump's cabinet.
Anyone, trying to make money off of reporting about Pizzagate is in my book is suspicious.

               Say:  "Anyone, trying to make money off of reporting about Pizzagate is in my book is suspicious."  But they help spread the word and awareness.
              </p>
              <p>
               If bloggers etc think there are clicks in pizzagate, then we are pushing on an open door.  If they think their viewers and readers are no longer interested, that's when the problems begin.
