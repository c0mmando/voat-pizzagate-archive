            Does anyone else think Mattâ€™s over-the-top outrage video might be an after-the-fact act to try and sefend himself from charges because he left tracks watching/spreading this vile material?  He was so very emotional I kept waiting to hear he has personal reasons for being on the warpath.  I agree with hiw evil and twisted all of this yoo toob dark stuff is, but I would expect a more clinical, factual, rational presentation, especially from a man on a mission to stop it.

             It is possible. It is also possible that he was selected by TPTB because of his questionable on-line history. They knew he'd play ball.

            Thought what he was exposing was great, but then I thought it was weird how he stayed on the little girls in compromised positions a little too long. Anyone else think that was a red flag?

            Wow, yes it is looking like this Matt guy is pretty shady. A couple of things stood out to me last night. I noticed he had streamed earlier in the day with an update. When I went to check it out, I noticed he had ads running every 10 minutes which I thought was pretty ridiculous and noticed a few other people were commenting about it to him too. If he was just doing this to raise awareness why so many ads?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I seen him streaming again last night trying to get in contact with Keemstar. He was live on air complaining that he didn't have a twitter account and proceeded to create one live so he could contact Keemstar on there. Didn't watch much, but I found it very suspect that a guy that had a youtube channel, who knew how to share screens, livestream, etc. didn't already have a twitter account? I don't know something just seemed off about him and seemed like he was attention seeking. Good work Keemstar for looking into this further.
           </p>
           <p>
            As much as YouTube pisses me off, it is a platform that I still support, as it one of the best ways to get info out to the masses. You guys are right, so many videos are posted on pizzagate, elsagate, pedogate that don't gain even a quarter of the attention this one has. I guess our biggest red flag should have been how it blew up so quickly...now that I think about it, it was on "popular" on reddit yesterday...reddit that is known for deleting videos and posts they don't want seen. I wonder if this a calculated move to bring down youtube and take away our voices?

            Thanks for your vigilance

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            I watched all of the Matt guy's video. A couple of things bothered me. First, he zips through content too fast for people to replicate his search and report the same accounts. Second, at :30 he looks down and away from the camera and repeatedly touches his chin as he says "Pedophiles are trading social media contacts". He looks down right before he says it, and touches his chin right after "Pedophiles are". Typically, any time someone breaks eye contact and touches their mouth or nose when saying something, it's a good bet they are lying -- their hand unconsciously tries to block what is coming out of their mouth. At 12:57, right after he makes his rant about YouTube and says "How are they not doing more? How does this even EXIST?" he puts his hand over his mouth. That could be because, as Keemster says, he knows they ARE doing stuff about it, and knows he's lying about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            At 13:58, right after he says he wants YouTube to shit the bed, when he says "I've made maybe a thousand bucks off my little tiny baby channel" he sticks his finger in his ear and looks down and away, like he doesn't want to hear what's coming out of his own mouth.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the other hand, I'm not at all certain the guy Keemster made the video about is the same guy, or just someone who looks very similar. It seems highly unlikely that someone pissed at pedos on YouTube who is getting such high exposure for it would also have videos where he propositioning a girl to be in an adult video. I don't know Keemster at all, so no idea how reliable he might be.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will say that the video Keemster posted on Twitter raises just as many red flags for me, though, because it is really tightly zoomed in so you can't see any context. At :31 Keemster says he "spoke to him last night" but doesn't show evidence of that, or the guy's response. Around 1:05 he says he "called into his show" explaining the damage he was causing YouTubers, and Matt denied he had a Twitter. But again, no proof of this happening. And, no proof of that Twitter account being the same guy. And no information about the supposed YouTube account by the same guy. To me, the Twitter guy looks puffy and fat, and the original Matt YouTube looks pretty lean. He also seems to have darker hair than the Twitter guy Keemster claims is him. You can't really tell much, because the YouTube pedo busting Matt video has few colors and he's wearing a black shirt. At 15:06 he raises his arm to turn off his webcam and it looks fairly lean, but who knows.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we need to keep in mind this might be an unfair smear job against a guy YouTubers fear might jeopardize their livelihood.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also noticed at 2:09, where Matt logs into the VPN in the original video, it says his current location is Toronto. The Twitter account listed by Keemster as being the same guy lists British Columbia as its home location. Not conclusive of anything, of course, but odd.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will flair the original "accuracy in question" and crosslink to this comment in this thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, even though the guy might be a prick trying to get followers by jumping on the pizzagate bandwagon, the problems with YouTube are legit, and we SHOULD be notifying advertisers their products are appearing on child exploitation videos. This is true,
            <em>
             even if Matt the pedo buster is a pedo himself
            </em>
            . We just need to do our due diligence.

            Gosh I hope not.  We have worked hard to shine the light on those Vile Elsagate Porn for Kiddies.  That's what it is.  Just heard on the news  that screen time for Toddlers has doubled.  Yep, doubled.  I imagine many of them have been watching that garbage.  Thanks for covering this!

           <p>
            Screen time for kids under 2 has more than doubled since 1997, according to a study released Monday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Researchers found that the amount of time young children spend daily watching television or using devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers has skyrocketed over the past two decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            Between 1997 to 2014, the amount of daily screen time for kids under 2 climbed from 1.32 hours to 3.05 hours. The study found that television accounted for over 2.5 hours of screen time in 2014, compared to just half an hour in 1997.
           </p>
           <p>
            Previous studies have suggested a link between excessive screen time and delays in cognitive, verbal, and social growth in young children, as well as an increased risk of obesity and sleep problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think these Toddlers are pulling out their debit cards and ordering this stuff shipped to the house.  We know who is doing it.

              Oh yes.  Very suspicious. I agree.  I think that parents are letting their Children sit and watch these horrid youtube videos and they have not clue.  Stupid Idiots is all I can say.  Yes, I also think there is definitely something highly suspicious about him.  Seems we are getting it from all sides lately.  The fire at CPP and the attacks on pizzagate.  We know youtube is totally irresponsible when it comes to policing their site.  When reported they just ignore.
