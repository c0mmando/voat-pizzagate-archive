<p>Prince Andrew sparked a Buckingham Palace security breach by inviting an \'unvetted\' female masseuse to his bedroom, MailOnline can reveal.</p>
<p>Monique Giannelloni says she wasn\'t searched and didn\'t sign in during her palace visit to see the Duke after being introduced to him by Jeffrey Epstein\'s alleged \'fixer\', Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>In an alarming set of security lapses, Monique arrived at the palace and was simply asked for her car registration number by aides before being waved inside.</p>
<p>She doesn\'t believe any background checks were done on her after a telephone booking made by the Duke\'s then-Assistant Private Secretary, Charlotte Manley.</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Monique says: \'It was so easy to get into the palace and it troubled me because I could have been anyone.\'</p>
<p>\'I didn\'t know Andrew and never met anyone from the royal household. Nobody knew me. I wasn\'t spoken to by a Royal Protection officer or asked any questions at all.\'</p>
<p>\'Nobody checked my bag when I arrived or when I left. I certainly expected more stringent security checks.\' </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monique, who was a member of the British Register of Complementary Practitioners, was working at a clinic in Kensington and doing home visits at the time of the royal encounter on June 30, 2000, and counted Ms Maxwell among her clients.</p>
<p>After one appointment, Ms Maxwell, who is accused of procuring young girls for paedophile Epstein, told her: \'I am going to introduce you to someone more famous than God.\'</p>
<p>She had been to the socialite\'s Belgravia home on two occasions and given her a massage upstairs with 67-year-old Epstein present.</p>
<p>She said initially she had never heard of her wealthy client, who asked her when they met: \'Don\'t you know who I am darling? You should read the tabloids I am a celebrity.\'</p>
<p>Later Monique researched her online and saw her pictured with Andrew at a wedding then realising she was the daughter of the disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell.</p>
<p>\'When she told me about that person more famous than God, I thought she may have meant an actor or something.</p>
<p>\'Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be royalty.\'</p>
<p>A few weeks later Monique received a call from Andrew\'s Ms Manley, inviting her to give the royal a treatment.</p>
<p>She recalled that she was \'very nervous\' about the invitation to Buckingham Palace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="break"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In her interview she also shed new light on that now notorious photo of Andrew with his arm around the waist of his sex accuser Virginia Roberts, taken in Ms Maxwell\'s Belgravia home in 2001.</p>
<p>In his \'car crash\' BBC Newnight interview he suggested the picture may have been faked â€“ and said he had never been upstairs in Ms Maxwell\'s London home.</p>
<p>But Monique insisted it was taken on the upstairs landing and said the room where she massaged Ms Maxwell is on the left.</p>
<p>She said she first came into contact with Ms Maxwell when she received a call to her mobile phone from the socialite\'s secretary.</p>
<p>She said she had been working in London as a massage therapist for four years and worked with a number of celebrity and high net worth clients.</p>
<p>She said: \'Out of the blue I got a call from Ghislaine\'s secretary, I can\'t remember her name, but she was based in New York.</p>
<p>\'It was at night and she said her boss was coming into London late that evening. She wanted to book a massage at 11pm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to describe Monique\'s interactions with and around Epstein and Maxwell, some of it cringe-worthy.</p>
<p>Here\'s one that stands out, won\'t get into quoting the rest though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'[The second appointment] was all rather awkward because Epstein was there. I felt I wasn\'t giving a good treatment and she wasn\'t getting much out of it.</p>
<p>\'Epstein was creepy, seedy and very pretentious. I got the impression he and Ghislaine were either brother-and-sister or business partners, never a couple.\'</p>
<p>\'She told me about a yacht party she was hosting and asked me if I would be prepared to go and give massages. </p>
<p>\'She told me that I would have to keep private what happened on the yacht. I assumed she meant \'anything goes.\'</p>
<p>\'I politely declined the invitation because it did not sound like the sort of thing I wanted to be involved with.</p>
<p>\'I thought she was very distasteful and pretentious, the way she spoke. I didn\'t like her attitude or her at all.</p>

            Hmm. Sounds like one of the little hazing tactics Ghiz and E'Stain used to recruit was for him to hang around like a creeper while she was getting a rubdown and see how the target reacted. If their target put up with that, and late-night home-visit massages, then it was "Come to the yacht." "Sign a confidentiality agreement."
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagine if this 35 year old had been 25. Or younger, and much more easily tempted with glamour.

            Such scum.
