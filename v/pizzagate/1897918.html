<p>P.S. This may sound peculiar, but when the NonFBIAnon\'s picture of the pink-shirted mayor of Columbus <a href="https://imgtc.com/lDkzpBU">https://imgtc.com/lDkzpBU</a> was making the rounds, the fact that one of the buttons on Andy\'s shirt was sewn on with black thread while the others had white thread was a tiny red flag that something was not right. Sure, one could always say that Andy or his wife was in a hurry and sewed the button on at the last minute as he was going out the door, but one can\'t help but wonder if it was a sign of deeper domestic trouble. That sounds really stupid, I know, but in a person of such prominence as the mayor, surely one expects little details like that to be taken care of in a very efficient and capable way? At any rate, Andy\'s poignant statement @ the arrest of his father leads one to wonder if his family and home life might be more than a little hellish:</p>

            It is reported that Russia stopped adoptions to the US in Jan 2013. From Time -
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Over the past 20 years, more than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted by American families, and 19 of them have died in their care through negligence or domestic violence. Each death is a tragedy, but the rate of child mortality, deprivation and abuse in Russian orphanages is far higher. Pushkov admits as much. “But if the U.S. federal authorities wanted, they could act to at least restore a sense of justice,” he says. “These parents adopt children to get extra welfare benefits, to get money, or they just began to hate this child. It doesn’t matter. There needs to be justice. It is a nationwide consensus. That is why we initiated this.”

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As of 2011 from the numbers presented from Russia at the UN states that, Russia has over 650,000 children who are registered orphans, 70% of which arrived in the orphanages in the 1990s. Of these, 370,000 are in state-run institutions while the others are either in foster care or have been adopted. Reports have ranged saying that between 66-95% of all of these children are considered social orphans, meaning that one or more of their birth parents are still alive.

            I don't know who Teal Swan is, but I have purchased these shirts for hubby for a long time, different color thread in the stitching of the bottom button of a button-up shirt is there to guide a man so he can button himself up w/out any help.

            the black button thread is there to show men how to line up their buttons without wifes help. It's on the bottom of the shirt because non-slobs tuck it in so it is never seen.

            I haven't even looked into the other two. I'm still trying to find Jazmin. :-) I know she's not related to this case but it's like she doesn't exist.

            And have a look at Mama Ginther.....
           </p>
           <p>
            "Norma Ginther received her masters degree in social work from The Ohio State University in 1988, and has thirty-five years of child welfare practice and training experience. She has worked in both public and private child welfare agencies as a family services caseworker, a foster care program development specialist, in a physical abuse assessment and treatment unit, and in an adolescent services unit.......
           </p>
           <p>
            The Ginther family served as a professional treatment foster home for twenty years, and cared for forty-six adolescents with emotional and behavioral disturbance. The Ginthers are also adoptive parents."

            This is a rabbit trail but posting to validate adoption assertion. According to these court docs, Mr Jeffrey Ginther fostered 46 children. Other sad info in there as well that validates OP assertion that family life may have been "hellish".

            Normally, one can find inmate records on Vine or official records on a county clerks website. I am unable to find any official records for a Jazmin Ginther.

            I did find a partial list of kid's names but I don't see how that is relevant to Seth Rich so I didn't post.

            I dont know if you sew but thats not just something one does on the spur of the moment. Its kind of a pain and has to be done carefully to line up with the button correctly. That is weird.

            You know I just looked at that pic again and not only is the button sewn with black thread, but it appears that the stitching around the buttonhole is also black. If that is the case, it was deliberate because buttonholes are done on a sewing machine

            No, not at all. Im with ya. Someone of that "stature" would have just changed their shirt I would think instead of quickly sewing a button with wrong thread. It doesnt make sense to me either.
