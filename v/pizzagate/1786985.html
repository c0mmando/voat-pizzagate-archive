It was a music video discretely exposing pizzagate and the title of the video was called &quot;surprise&quot; and it sounded like it was by rae scremmod. So when I woke up I felt an extra urge to investigate. I went to google and typed in &quot;ray scremmod surprise&quot; (I spelled &quot;Rae&quot; wrong but thought that\'s how it was spelled&quot;)... and first thing to come up, you guessed it, a fucking sketch ball pizza shop near the border of Mexico in Arizona. Like wtf. But wait it gets weirder. I went the yelp and the 4th picture listed was a creepy cartoon painting of an older women feeding some fucked up looking baby a piece of pepperoni pizza. (In Billy mays voice) but wait that\'s not all. The reviews were completely controversial some of them talked about how the cheese pizza was amazing, best they\'ve ever had(like a lot of comments said this). Then some of comments were like &quot;seen the reviews and was stoked to try it but after getting it the pizza wasn\'t good at all, mediocre at best&quot;, a lot of comments just like that. I\'m telling you guys something is weird with this place. They even have a surprise part of the menu on their website. Please someone who can find hidden messages look through this one for me. I\'ll post the yelp and the link to their webpage.</p>
