<p>Okay, so first off, I\'ve been led to believe the official Swordfish leaks are not official. I don\'t know for certain that they\'re not, but even if they\'re bogus, they were posted, so I decided to follow up on the third one, the one about Lady Gaga and a talented young singer named Lina Morgana. This is the link: </p>

<p>So the story in a nutshell is that Rob Fusari is a producer coaching a young talented singer named Lina Morgana. He introduced Lina to Stefani Germanotta (Lady Gaga) in 2007. Lina ended up committing suicide by jumping off the roof of a hotel during a coin convention. After the death, Stefani, took the name Lady Gaga (Rob came up with it and supposedly coached the hell out of her), and overnight Stefani stole Lina Morgana\'s identity. You can see if from a music video. I wanted to check out a video so I could see if it was true that Stefani actually stole, copied, absorbed Lina\'s identity and it\'s absolutely true. The blonde wig, the poses, the styling, everything was appropriated by the talentless auto-tuned faux singer. Here see for yourself. Here is the talented one, the original, Lina: </p>

<p>I started looking through more videos and came upon one that blew my mind. The freaky part starts at 1:25.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zfOgda4xyc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zfOgda4xyc</a> </p>
<p>SUMMARY: Rob Fusari starts talking about how he and Lina ate some pizza. They left the pizza shop when a stranger came running up to them and said, &quot;God has sent me to tell you something.&quot; Rob waved him away, and &quot;shortly after&quot; Lina committed suicide. Rob says he regrets not listening because he would have liked to hear what God sent that man to say. </p>
<p>Okay, a totally creepy story. I have no idea how long &quot;shorty after&quot; is. A day? A week? That night? But is this part of the farce the Cannibal Elite put on? Do they expect people to play along with this performance? Or were they only playing mind games with Lina? </p>
<p>I thought I would post it. Again, this leak is not supposed to be from Swordfish, but I\'m finding this whole thing fascinating and if Swordfish has something even better, I CAN\'T WAIT!!!</p>',

             Yeah, this is horrible! If he has the goods, he'll get through. And there are enough places to park it so people can see. SF69 is a smart guy/girl so I have faith in hiim/her getting the job one. The question is whether he has the goods?

            Yesterday was the first time I've ever heard of Lina Morgana, and the whole story is disturbing.  Then I also find that Ms Gaga has an 'alter ego' called "Morgana Devacelli".

             Didn't know about the alter ego. So she took Morgana's name? That's royally screwed up. Wonder what they did to that girl? Maybe Morgana wouldn't play along?  I notice in the video, Rob said he was interested in Lina's "dark side." Maybe they were exploiting some things that happened to her? Whatever happened is perverse, diabolical, and outright evil.

             More like an obsession. No wonder Morgana Devacelli seeks out whores like Maria Abramovic to ease her conscience and tell her what she did was right. In fact, now that I'm thinking about it, Abramovic said she'd met "her twin". It was when she was first starting out and before she made her millions. Such a weird story, but then who are we talking about?

              i never said she wasn't auto tuned, all pop stars are auto tuned. but gaga has a much stronger voice. when they auto tune, they only do it for small parts of the song, i don't see how you can have a career and be auto tuned 100% of the time. so i can hear gaga's real voice easily, and she can sing. the other chick was breathy &amp; pitchy, two things i don't like. however, i'm not that into pop music, more into metal &amp; blues.

               You just said it ... you're not into pop music.
              </p>
              <p>
               This isn't about whose better. You think there aren't a lot of people who are better singers than Madonna? The thing was she was different. She had a style. Style is almost more important than talent ... as are song choices. It's Lina's style ... her identity she stole ... and that shot her to the top. Now that you've seen Lina, look at Stefani's old shit.
              </p>

              <p>
               THAT'S what her act was! It was the polished, mesmerizing performance of Lina. Stefani didn't have the wigs or wardrobe. You can see that for yourself. Lina was doing that. So then why did Stefani start doing it after Lina was dead? Answer: because she STOLE it! She copied it. That combined with Fusari's coaching propelled her to the top. Everyone thought she was so "ORIGINAL". Yeah! Originality that was COPIED.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look, I'm not going to explain this to you anymore. You clearly don't get it. But if any of those metal or blues singers/groups you like copied someone you like, you'd know it right? You'd go, "Hey! They just copied the song of such and such CD!" It's considered being non-original and bad form to do it, but if you want to give the spirit cooking monster named Gaga a pass, so be it.

              There's dozens of professional backup singers with great voices who aren't stars.

             <p>
              In addition to singing, she's an instrumentalist and a songwriter.  She plays piano and guitar, which basically lets you write songs in a lot of genres.
             </p>
             <p>
              She was working at the top levels of the music industry as a songwriter before she put out an album.

               In addition to writing all the tracks on her album, GaGa has previously written for Fergie, the Pussycat Dolls, Britney Spears and New Kids on the Block.

              This was when when she was like 22 years old.   I don't like pop acts, but the woman is talented.

             Ok, what is going on with the Swordfish/Swordfish69? SF69 has researched a shit ton here so now we say it's fake? That makes zero sense. Maybe s/he set up multiple acts that are similar &amp; not exact. Or what am I missing?

               . Confused a bit now. I read that line from SF69 differently than that. I guess if SF69 wasn't the same SF of the ultimatum, that should have been way more clear, bcuz in same thread, this was said

                On a side note.. Voat is being really weird today. I replied to your comment once probably about 10 minutes ago and it isn't showing up.?.

                 It is beyond interesting.  It is scary.  We never did things like that.  We teased about your last name or things like that.  The boys did not even swear in front of the girls.  Now the girls swear like truck drivers or dock workers.  This is degrading and wearing on our moral fiber.  I don't mean like letting a word go here and there, I mean constantly and bragging about it.  It shows they have little respect for who they are with and for themselves.

                  It's true. And videoing them bullying and committing violence. Forget about the police, my parents would have had me in lockdown for about a hundred years.

                  But notice this is all being done when the alt left is touting PCness and sensitivity. How can it be all right for kids to kill each other in high school bathrooms when you can't wear a Hawaiian shirt to a barbecue because it's culturally appropriation? We're nitpicker Nazis about nonsense and letting major crimes go by the wayside? Yup, drugs and violence are just fine, but don't you dare wear that shirt!

                    Yes. It goes along with the government deciding what's best and they're a bunch of apologists. The parents reflect that. Anything their kids do is fine because the government says drugs dealers are cool, gangs are family, and fornication with children is okay.

                      People are waking up. The problem is that we rely heavily on what we see. So if someone tells us a theoretical story about what is happening, and we don't see the effect, say, of legislation passed, we intellectually grasp the concept, but don't rush into action. In other words, nothing in our community is changed, so why should I be worried about one bad piece of legislation that seems not to have caused detrimental damage. But there's been enough time that these lizards have been in office to SEE the damage! We see kids out of control, our schools being used as breeding grounds for bullying and teaching kids how to pass tests and not to think, and our jobs evaporating! Forget about the homeless and drugs that are overtaking every city and neighborhood. It's why what happened in the last election is so important.

                       The one thing that really upsets me is the homeless.  There are so many single moms and also veterans.  When I think of all the homes that are just sitting around that are on the verge of being torn down, why were they not given a chance at these homes.  We can find money to build all kinds of things like sprucing up all kinds of sports arenas, but people that have been kicked aside, NO.  They have convinced so many that these people just did not do what it takes to succeed.  I am getting off my soap box.

            This is certainly a tragic but tantalizing (I mean that as mysterious) case.  Lina is a very close image of Lady Gaga and visa versa.  What a spoof on Lady G's public.  If this is revealed she will be reviled. And rightly so. Upvoat4U

             This about FAR more than simply trafficking and abuse.

             Thanks. Just the taking over of identity is so freakin' weird! And remember in the beginning of Lady Gaga's career? She'd only show one side of her face. The other side was covered. Wonder if that went back to the "coin" convention where Lina died?
            </p>
            <p>
             I really about fell over when Rob mentioned "eating pizza". He stumbled around for words and came up with "eating pizza". Reminded me of Pedosta's "eating pizza for about an hour." And Gaga has this manufactured narrative about  being so "nice". Not nice what she did.

              You can bet if she got away with that, she had no problem graduating to other things, thinking there would be people to cover for her. Lina looks so much like her and G mimics her perfectly.  Especially the blonde wig.  Crazy.  Absolutely Crazy,

               It really is. Gaga had to be into satanic stuff. I had a discussion with someone about a model named Ruslana who committed suicide by jumping off the roof. There was a Paris vogue spread featuring satanism where another model dressed up complete with wig so she looked identical to Ruslana. The model dressed up to look like Ruslana was posed as if she were dead and had fallen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's the link to Ruslana jumping:

                The Russian model jumping to her death happened in the same year as Morgana's death: 2008.  Notice that the newspaper articles only mention the Rose of the World Cult but give no more information.  I'm very curious about them because of this recent article about Madonna's twins..look at what they are wearing:

When asked by The Daily Beast in a recent phone interview if he had "any regrets" about his involvement with Raising Malawi, Sachs paused so long he had to be asked if he was still there and offered no immediate answer. In response to a follow up email, Trowbridge issued the statement that "Professor Sachs was and is appreciative of Madonna's leadership to support education and poverty-alleviation in Malawi.”

                 Oh, absolutely! Dressing up like the person is jinxing them. Hence the voodoo dolls you dress like the person you want to cast a spell on. I think the Stones did it on one of their album covers, but it's been done for centuries.

                  I wonder if they also add the MK Ultra in to the mix and that just spurs them on.  Like they know exactly what is expected and then follow through.  It is so horrible.

                   It is. And there is the mind control aspect. It is frightening, but I can't figure out what that stranger saying he had a message from God meant.

                    Maybe he knew something.  Something of what was going to happen, because he was informed or had been told and felt God wanted him to tell the truth, to do the right thing at the last minute.  Just think how that person feels.  He could have saved her life had he grabbed him and shouted.  No, You must listen to me I have a secret, something that will happen.  But he did not.  He is more at fault, really.  Agents and producers have many people always nagging them.  The whole thing is tragic and horrid and I hope it comes out.  Now some one has posted that Swordfish69 is a fake and that it is just Swordfish that released the ultimatum.  This whole thing is getting out of hand and crazy.  I cannot wait til the waiting is over.

                     I agree if the stranger was trying to help. But what if he were part of the plan? An actor with a defined role in the ritual. Think about it that way.

                     Like I said, I don't know Swordfish69.  I only remember posts he made and they were really good. He was a great investigator. I don't remember shills coming out of the woodwork to discredit someone. I know they've only done it with me when I've posted something that hit a nerve ... and my harassment wasn't to this level. What's happening here is unprecedented. It makes me believe SF69 has the goods.

                      What does that mean then?  Did he fake it then?  Is it really just Swordfish and not Swordfish69 that did the original release?  This is beyond imaginable.  Please explain this to me if you can.
