<p>This woman placed this 2 year old little girl named Devani Hileman with David and Barbara Frodsham after seizing her from her loving family. They ran a pedophile ring out of a state sponsored foster home. She was sold to multiple people and raped constantly. Then when they were arrested and caught she was given to a woman who burned 80 percent of her body in scalding hot water. She had to get multiple amputations.</p>
<p>The woman who burned her in boiling water after she was rescued from the pedophile ring is named Samantha Osteraas. This is her. </p>

<p>They took her under false pretenses. Her parents had a verbal fight and police were called. The child was not even at the home and was at her grandmas. Norel Alviti illegally seized this child without any warrant at all. </p>
<p>Shame every single one of these motherfuckers. Put their photo\'s everywhere. I hope the people of Tuscon find out and give her street justice. Evil bitch.</p>

            Thinking about how people who do this stuff have faced consequences in spite of official coverups.
           </p>
           <p>
            The case of Lawrence E. King of the Franklin Scandal is interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            He spent 10 years in jail (for financial fraud at the Franklin Savings and Loan, the higher-ups made sure he was never charged for pedophilia.)
           </p>
           <p>
            When he got out, a wealthy friend from his pedophile ring days, who owned the BMW of Sterling car dealership in Virginia, gave him a job,
           </p>
           <p>
            Larry King's new job was exposed on voat:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1870461">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1870461
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1854685">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1854685
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            and some local Pizzagaters actually contacted the dealership staff to ask if they knew they were working with a pedophile:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1859618">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1859618
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            and Larry King disappeared from the dealership.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there anyone local to Tucson who could publicise the fact that anyone listing their house with this woman is doing business with a woman who destroyed the life of a toddler after kidnapping her?
           </p>
           <p>
            Should this woman be doxed, or just allowed to have a new career and put what she did behind her?

            I can state with 100 percent confidence if the state tried to take me from my parents at that age there would be dead pigs anywhere they stood in my Dads way.
           </p>

            How can parents just let it go?  Id fight and run with the kid and for fucking sure only way they taking em would be over piles of bodies.

             What if you were not at home?  What if a wife or gf was there and she was not of the same strength?  Also they have other ways.  If you think it will be at your home, they will take them from school.  They can now get away with anything.  They can come and take them from a doctor's office if you refuse any of their stupid vac rules or as we discussed before, just for not making a future dental appt. for your child (Medical Kidnap article).  We have to start pushing really hard on this stuff.  We missed our chance years ago when this first started.  That was their hope, that no one would notice til it was too late.

            Honestly, when I was young I saw a kid steal from the neighbor, I like small child ran and told my brothers, the kid around the corner stole some items out of a garage, where the cops called, hell no, my brothers rolled over there and told the kid, it was an old lady he was stealing from, and they took the items back, then for good measure took his bike and told him, to have his parents come get it from the house to stole from, Ms Mathesin was not surprised to find the items returned and the bike sat in her garage for about a week then the kid spilled it...to this day, the guy Neal- we still call him Stealy Nealy....I introduced my grandson to him at the local swap meet...as STEALY NEALY, this is 40 years ago, and his name still sticks.  Why isn't Norel afforded the same luxury, you earn these titles you fucking scumbags- its not hard to be a good citizen it really isn't- you don't get a free pass in my world lady.
