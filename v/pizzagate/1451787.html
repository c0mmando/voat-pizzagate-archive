<p>Not only is the image on the right extremely creepy, but the ad on the left features a heart symbol. It\'s a wedding planning called The Wediquette, owned by a man called Jacob Sutler, a school guidance counselor. Strangely, he has been active on The Wediquette\'s Twitter account since this incident and has frequently been partaking in arguments and bizarre occult conversations with a few pizzagate investigators provoking him.</p>
<p>It\'s worth noting that this man\'s tweets are reminiscent of an uneducated teenager and/or someone with some type of mental disorder... really poor grammar &amp; spelling, psychotic rants, weird leaps in logic, &amp; random references to spiritual/occult ideas and art. To be blunt, the man is clearly unstable. So, we\'ve got an erratic guidance counselor who owns a business which is being advertised inside of Besta Pizza next to a creepy photo seemingly hinting at trafficking and abuse. He also looks incredibly creepy. Definitely fits the profile of a potential pedo, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Let\'s look at his occult tweets.</p>
<p>He retweeted this:</p>

<p>This animation is FILLED with symbols referencing the occult, the illuminati, satanism, globalism/NWO, sexual &amp; religious imagery, war, false flag/disaster events, etc.... There are many analysis articles and videos online about this film that I highly encourage you to read to get a better understanding of the huge amount of symbolism packed into every frame. A few things to note off the top of my head: owl logo (Minerva? Moloch?), many different satanic references, white and black checkered room hinting at mkultra/abuse (the checkered handkerchief memento thing), phallic shapes, semen, Egyptian/illuminati symbols, the double heart pedo symbol shown on the &quot;antichrist Jesus&quot; figure, and much more... </p>
<p>Besides the analysis articles/videos online, the company who made the animation, Heliofant, has some really interesting info directly on their website!</p>

<p>This one is especially creepy, as it looks to be hinting that Obama is related to sinister activities involving these children. Folks, this appears to be satanic ritual abuse, just like we have been discovering in all of the other leads.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that Bush was also depicted in the animation, and on 9/11 he was reading &quot;Pet Goat&quot; to children in a classroom during the events. This seems really out there, but when you look at all of these things together... could this have been some sort of ritual? Or some sort of boasting or hinting?</p>
<p>Anyway, this is all speculation, but a lot of this ties in with everything else we\'ve been finding. I also think this Jacob Sutler guy deserves more investigation. He\'s extremely creepy, and his business was being advertised inside of Besta. He could be some kind of middleman or low level networking guy for the ring, using his wedding business as a cover. DIG ON HIM!</p>',
