            So let's shut down Americans' rights based on some b.s. theory 'it's the Russians.'
           </p>
           <p>
            For decades leftists laughed at conservatives saying it was the 'Red Scare" and "Witch Hunt" to be worried about the Russians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that the Russians are post-Soviet and a Christian nation with (admittedly) a thug leader Putin they are the bad boys.
           </p>
           <p>
            Didn't Obama LAUGH at Romney when he said Russia was a threat?    Yes. He did.
