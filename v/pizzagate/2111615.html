            Some loose ends:  Soros &amp; Rothschild lawyers represented Julian Assange when he first started taking flak. Wikileaks helped take down Clinton &amp; are alleged to minimally target Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of the Russians involved with Trump's finances are also allegedly Jewish mobsters. Trump has Goldman Sachs executives in prime roles. His daughter converted &amp; his Jewish son-in-law is a top advisor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ironically this distances him from neo-Nazis by default but granted he is a wild card he likely isn't too far removed from banksters &amp; Zionists.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a stretch to think ANY American president can stray too far from the Deep State/NWO though there are factional splits at times, also the Zionists are the primary banksters &amp; top of the hierarchy OVER the Globalists/NWO including most major media.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ultimately left/right, liberal/conservative etc. all serve the elite banksters.

             This much does make sense. Even Trump will have to kiss a few rings. I feel like Trump is weakening on some of his positions. I think there was something on the news today about DACA. That will likely alienate his base but will put him in great company as far as Presidents go. Smh.

            Yes Trump once took a business loan out from Soros. The business relationship turned ugly which is the norm with Soros.
           </p>
           <p>
            Putin kicked Soros out of Russia for trying to destroy Russia's economy. Then he put the international financier on a "most wanted list." Soros retaliated by 100% backing Hillary who wanted a proxy war with Russia in the Mid East. One of the reasons Hillary was said to indirectly back ISIS/DAESH.
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros also financially backed ANY Republican candidate willing to speak out against Trump. Dirty politics. Long ago Trump had switched his business loans to Russian financiers. Trump does not want a proxy war let alone a real direct war with Russia. Those in the Republican Party with certain ties want to destroy Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            To say Soros backs Trump currently is beyond ridiculous and crazy. By the way Soros was also aligned with both Bush's. He also financed the vast majority of Barack Obama's run for POTUS.

            do not agree 
what I read was that trump went to rothchilds for a loan.   paid it off early.  rothchilds not happy about it.
I read that trump was lowest illuminiti member.   believes but hes not all in,
I don't think trump can take down soros.  but who knows right
           </p>
           <p>
            here it is what I read:
None of this new however. If you've been following Trumps cabinet picks, you might remember Wilbur Ross?. Working for Rothschild inc in 1990 Ross helped Trump avoid bankruptcy after the latter missed multiple bond payments on the struggling Taj Mahal. At the time it was known Trumps finances were unravelling and he'd been unable to secure finances until Rothschild Inc sent Ross to save the day.
When asked why he'd made a deal with Trump, Ross insisted that Trump was worth saving. "“The Trump name is still very much an asset,” he said.
The Rothschild were wise to deploy Mercer &amp; Ross to assist Trump over the years, they certainly seem to have acquired
 a prime asset in Trump, no doubt. The President of the United States is fully under Rothschild/Cabal control. A traitor 
is in the White House.
           </p>
           <p>
            also :
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump isn't a Rothschild asset at all, the Rothschild's are furious about Trump getting into power.
What's going on is actually very simple, we have Gloablists Vs Zionists, the Globalists are the ones who prioritize setting up a UN world government funded by climate taxes - Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros are key players, Hillary, Obama etc work for them. UN and EU is all part of this agenda.
The Zionists are the ones who prioritize Israel-first, protecting Israel and taking control of the countries surrounding them
. As long as you leave these guys alone, they won't bother you, unless you are a neighbor. Some of the top ones aren't
 very visible, the more visible players are Rupert Murdoch, Breitbart, Infowars, WikiLeaks, Trump, Brexit campaign etc.
These guys all used to work together, but now that the globalist plan is in it's advanced stages, Soros and Co had decided that 
a firm hand would be needed with Israel, as otherwise nobody would trust the world government if Israel could get away with
 whatever they wanted. The Zionists weren't happy with the way things were going, so they've now started to dismantle bit
 by bit the Globalist project for world government. That is what Brexit is about, that is what Trump is about, that is why Trump is not going along with the climate change agenda, as those taxes are to fund the Globalist world government. The Zionists have allied with nationalists, and they are fast gaining ground on the Globalists.
Of course, the Globalists know exactly who was trying to influence the US election using WikiLeaks etc, but nobody is allowed
 to say it, so instead they publicity blame Russia who actually had very little to do with it, though were pleased with the result.
This is an unusual moment when the Zionists are currently allied with most people on /conspiracy, everyone is needed onboard to defeat the Globalist project, it is like at the end of the film Avatar where all tribes around the planet had to unite to fight the mos
t powerful and evil enemy of all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Update Part 2 The Globalist Vs Zionist Split Part II - In 2012 Zionist media kingpin Rupert Murdoch slammed the 'Jewish-owned' press for behaving 'anti-Israel' while Israel was sending rockets into Gaza
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump isn't a Rothschild asset at all, the Rothschild's are furious about Trump getting into power.
Why did the Rothschilds intervene to bailout the bankrupt Trump when everyone else was ready to foreclose on him? Why did the Rothschilds continue to funnel money to him for years after the fact, including supporting his candidacy through their
 subsidiaries like the CNP?
It is a particularly odd thing because no one running casinos on the up and up goes bankrupt. There are actual welfare states (Indian tribes with free health care, college, universal income / monthly stipend checks, etc.) that function on the back of a single
 casino. One casino easily funds more aid for tens of thousands of people than the average American gets.
What's going on is actually very simple, we have Gloablists Vs Zionists, the Globalists are the ones who prioritize setting up
 a UN world government funded by climate taxes - Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros are key players, Hillary, Obama etc work 
for them. UN and EU is all part of this agenda.
 British intelligence (home of global freemasonry) and the Rothschild banking dynasty were merged no later than the swindle after
 the Battle of Waterloo. This, of course, precedes the creation of zionism. Zionism was a manufactured movement all the way
 through. It is introduced to the world by Palmerston, agent of British intelligence and not a jew. False flags like the Dreyfus
 affair in the lead up to the great wars were highly publicized but ineffective at convincing any sizable portion of jews to become
 zionists.  . The Golden Circle, a freemasonic front financed by British loyalists, is well known to have financed violent abolitionists as well as pro-slavery factions in the decades leading up to the war. Despite their best efforts at stirring up violence, when the civil war was launched a peculiar thing happened: only a single state, the home of Albert Pike (Arkansas), actually voted in favor of secession. So once again you have this myth of popular support among the masses but it is a completely transparent fraud. Only the power elites wanted the civil war in the south, not the average person as we saw was the case with zionism.

            You ought to be able to tell from the above that there is a "they" which operates on a global scale, but "globalism" is a bit of a misnomer. You are brainwashed into this "one world government" stuff but their entire history of behavior is the opposite, balkanization: splitting countries up, pitting half the population against the other, running central banks to buy hard assets for free, looting the masses.
So when you let go off this ephemeral "globalists" name and start naming their activity, things get a lot clearer.
Divide and conquer. Hate the "other": immigrants and muslims are destroying you, not central banks! 
 ISIS is a genuine movement and we need boots on the ground to defeat them! Never mind simply halting shipments of weapons, trucks, and crates of cash from Langley! SJWs are destroying society, not Goldman Sachs!
Corporatism. Tax cuts for the rich will save you! Trickle down is real! Also, screw public infrastructure: let's pay private corporations to build it and then let them own it and double dip charging you to use it!
Basically, Trump follows the "globalist" agenda perfectly. You only have to stop calling it by the stupid name that was forced down your throat and realize what it really is: a corporate looting of wealth from the average person into the hands of the oligarchy operating under the cover of synthetic, contrived, artificial tension."

               Hillary is such a piece isn't she?  however, even though she is gone per say, we still aren't say.
policies are in place from decades ago, like gun consfication etc.   trump is only holding back the flood gates.
both sides of the gov. is compromised.....

               I actually don't think that is Koch Brothers strategy and it's certainly not Soros's stategy, he was pretty much 100% partisan in his donations.

                Certainly there are still ways to support a candidate without making the donation or

                  This is true -- and in fact Jane Mayer speaks to the fact of the hidden history of the Koch Bros, 
to their secrecy and the fact their organization is called "Kochtopus."

                 <p>
                  Koch Bros. not only were involved in the EARLY funding of the DLC, recruiting of Bill Clinton as well ... but their
representative were actually on the Executive Board of the DLC and in close relationship with Joe Lieberman.

                  a project of the Center for Media &amp; Democracy, the brothers are "leading contributors to the Koch family foundations, which supports a network of Conservative organizations and think tanks, including Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Manhattan Institute the Heartland Institute,

                  "Freeing Democrats from being, well, Democrats has been the Democratic Leadership Council's mission since its founding 16 years ago by Al Gore, Chuck Robb, and a handful of other conservative, mostly southern Dems as a rump faction of disaffected elected officials and party activists. Producing and directing the DLC is Al From, its founder and CEO, who's been the leader, visionary, and energizing force behind the New Democrat movement since Day One." --Robert Dreyfuss, The American Prospect, April 23, 2001.

                   Funding
                  </strong>
                  An August, 2000 Newsweek story on Joe Lieberman, The Soul And The Steel[1] reveals that some of the
                  <strong>
                   early funding
                  </strong>
                  came from ARCO, Chevron, Merck, Du Pont, Microsoft, Philip Morris and Koch Industries:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  His selection may also complicate Gore's efforts to depict Bush as a patsy for big business. Since 1995 Lieberman has chaired the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the centrist think tank that eschews liberal dogma and promotes market-oriented approaches to policy.
                  <strong>
                   Like many similar groups, the DLC (of which Gore is a founding member) has never disclosed its funding sources. But last week, in response to requests from NEWSWEEK, it turned over a list of top donors.
                  </strong>
                  If Gore still hopes to score populist points by bashing Big Oil and pharmaceutical companies that oppose his plan to add a prescription-drug entitlement to Medicare, he may have some explaining to do. Among the DLC's biggest benefactors last year (contributions of between $50,000 and $100,000) were ARCO, Chevron and the drug giant Merck. Other big underwriters include Du Pont, Microsoft and Philip Morris (which has kicked in $500,000 since Lieberman became DLC chairman). There is no evidence that the DLC has trimmed policies to accommodate its patrons, but some contributors say **the money has helped ensure an open door to Lieberman. "We've been able to have a dialogue with the senator and his staff," said Jay Rosser, spokesman for another DLC benefactor, Koch Industries, an oil-pipeline firm that is also a big GOP donor.

                    What are you talking about ...
CLEARLY you see that Koch Bros. and other large corporations were involved
in funding the DLC -- and, true -- that goes back decades ....

                   <p>
                    which is the POINT about how long Elites/Koch Bros. and other large corporations
have controlled the Democratic Party.

                   <p>
                    Who said Koch Bros. gave "equally" to either party ... in fact, it looks more
like it may have cost more to buy out the Dem Party.

                   <p>
                    Koch Bros. have long had an agenda of ending democracy in the US -- an agenda begun
by the family with the entire family involved -- and again they are John Birch Society.

            Yes it is true that Cerberus is tied to Dyncrop.  Think Jeffrey Epstein.  Executives with the three hedge funds could not be reached for comment.  Hmm.  I can see why not.

             So Soros and Epstein are connected. And here's another thing: Epstein frequents Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, with its employees' skimpy outfits and other covert sexual matters taking place there.

              Trump permanently kicked Epstein out of his resort when the pedo tried to aggressively solicit his young teen employees. They complained. Trump responded. Almost all wealthy elites in the world have dealings with each other and/or interactions through shared financial advisers, legitimate art auctions of investments, etc. Afterwards many become strict adversaries due to various accusations.

              We are not allowed to do any Trump bashing on this site as you may have noticed.  We used to get along much better and overlook each other's political views but it that is no longer allowed.  We must put up with the take down of our candidates but not theirs.  All pummeling allowed except not on Trump.  Yo shall be lambasted and attacked and over run.  Yes, I have seen that report but it always gets debunked.  Hmm.  Very Odd don't you think?

               Nobody wants to think badly of Trump. It's devastating for those of us that that voted for him. But people, if he's corrupted, WE NEED TO KNOW. Give us hard evidence though. And it's got to be better than past business deals with Epstein. I can give him the benefit of the doubt if he had deals with him, pre -indictment. Trump gave money to the Clintons, even. Fuck if I know why, but he has been honest about it. I supported him knowing that he did some wacky shit. He's not the perfect candidate, but he sure as hell beats Hillary. That said if he's dirty in the way the Clintons are dirty I definitely want to know, heartbreak or not. Any sane person is going to be of that mindset.

                I agree. I did not vote for him or Her but am willing to give him a chance. Mainly to Drain the Swamp.  But it seems there is such secrecy and that we can find out nothing of what is being done behind the scenes.  I know there are left overs from BO and GB years so that is what we call The Deep State.  I want to see hard evidence on ANY one before we label them such a horrible thing as a pedophile.  Suspicion or of this or that because I or someone else looks at things through a different political lens is not a reason to convict.  I have seen quite a few mentions on here about Trump and accusations but I did not pile on because I did not see concrete proof and thought this may be a shill or someone that just wants to boil him in oil.  Besides we are here to help the children not aggravate each other by taking down someone's candidate because we can. Also we have to watch what we say because others that are just coming on to the site will start believing what they see even though it may not be true.  It is respect for each other is what I call it.  I intend to keep doing that no matter what.
