<p>A fifth man has accused Seattle Mayor Ed Murray of sexual abuse decades ago.</p>
<p>The Seattle Times reported Tuesday that the man is Murray’s first cousin once removed, Joseph Dyer.</p>
<p>Dyer told the newspaper he was 13 and that Murray was in his early 20s when Murray came to live with Dyer’s family in Medford, New York and the alleged abuse happened.</p>
<p>Murray has denied the allegations, and he blamed Dyer’s on bad relations between their families.</p>
<p>Murray said he has no plans to resign before his term is over at the end of this year.</p>

Quote from SeattleTimes: </p>
<p>&quot;
Joseph Dyer, a younger cousin of Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, says he wants Murray punished, alleging he repeatedly molested him in the 1970s in New York. “I have had enough ... Something has got to be done.” Murray denies abusing Dyer, blaming a yearslong family rift.
&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;
Joseph Dyer, 54, a dialysis technician and Air Force veteran, says he was 13 when Murray forced him into sex for about a year while the two shared a bedroom in Dyer’s mother’s home in the Long Island town of Medford, New York.</p>
<p>“There would be times when I would fake sleeping because I didn’t want him touching me,” Dyer, a married father who now lives in another state, recalled during an interview with The Seattle Times.</p>
<p>“And that’s when he would molest me. And my mother would be right there in the house, she’d be in the living room … watching TV, at that time it was probably “M<em>A</em>S<em>H.” And my sisters would be in their rooms, sleeping. And I would be in my room, and he would be in there, molesting me.”&quot;</em>*</p>',

            Was Murray a child himself when he was being the abuser?  I'M NOT SAYING THAT TO DEFEND ANYTHING, I just think it's important to know either way.

            you know that anti_idle is a racist right, look at the subverses he posts on. also what sub do i i own that is pedo? i am not denying pedophilia (ephebophilia for those of you who like nuances). just saying that your claim that i own some pedo sub is bullshit. you can be dumb or you can be dishonest, but one of the two is true.

             I live in Seattle and was an active Democrat for a while and I have never been given a direct answer as to whether or not Fred Podesta is related to the others. I've asked several times since the email leaks and the people that must know have rolled their eyes and refused to answer yes or no directly "why would that matter?" "Who cares?" "I don't know, it wouldn't matter even if he was" - I want to know if, and if so, in what way. It mattered to me as a member (@ the time) of that party being destroyed by John Podesta &amp; pals...

             If this "behind the barn" shit was between parties of a similar size and age and was not abusive and coercive it might be more like what these movie makers imagine. But I have never heard of a case that did not involve considerable screaming and bleeding and at least an eighty lb size difference.

              Exactly. The thing is that the youngster is almost always the stooge, even when convinced otherwise. The older, wise POS has done this so many times that it's serial molestation. Quite often the youngster walks away thinking it was their fault. Just ridiculous.
