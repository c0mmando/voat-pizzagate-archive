<p>I personally believe his testimony because it seems like too ridiculous of a story to make up on the fly.

I also want to give credit to <a href="https://voat.co/user/isThisGameofThrones">@isThisGameofThrones</a> for his courage on outing JA.  He has taken many steps to continue to provide proof and, as noted in his latest video, has removed his t-shirt site so no longer can be labeled as a profiteer on this scandal.  So thanks for your work Ryan!</p>
<p>There\'s a relatively easy way <a href="https://voat.co/user/isThisgameofthrones">@isThisgameofthrones</a> can prove his conversation with Alefantis.  By now everyone knows what JA\'s cell phone number is.  It was provided in the Pegasus building permit as exposed already <a href="https://i.sli.mg/Ctc1Jw.png">https://i.sli.mg/Ctc1Jw.png</a>.  I also verified myself using the caller-id app that <a href="https://voat.co/user/IsThisGameofThrones">@IsThisGameofThrones</a> showed in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQRM7XckuvA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQRM7XckuvA</a>.  Since we all know the #, he could just post a video / picture of his call log without the number blocked out.  I know the live stream is also an option but seems a bit more cumbersome.  Has someone not thought of this already?</p>
<p>It would be easy to line up the photo or video to his previous call log. <a href="https://i.sli.mg/7Mn5Ya.png">https://i.sli.mg/7Mn5Ya.png</a></p>',

            I can completely understand why he would not want to do anything else related to Alefantis, ESPECIALLY showing his number online or anything else at all.

            It would be sticking another stick in a bee's nest and wiggling it around.  Not smart at all.  Consider this chapter closed.

            The only way I would believe it is if it's reported in the mainstream media and Alefantis comments on it. Not because the MSM is the only reliable source for info, but because if it's put out there publicly they can't take it back. Most anything else, barring an audio recording, could be faked. Especially if there were sophisticated powers involved, and there most certainly could be. I know, I'm really going out on a limb there. Let's go back to the argument that it must be true because it's just too crazy a story to be made up.... Sorry, you lost me there.

            posted a screenshot of the duration of his purported calls with Alefantis. I recall seeing a screenshot of his call log, but don't recall any details about whether the calls were incoming/outgoing or how long they lasted. All

            has to do is click the "i" icon next to Alefantis' name to reveal details regarding duration. Would you be able to provide us with that info, Mr. O'Neal?

             Indeed. Even if it were proven real, it might be some part of a psyop. Most likely it would be.

             I understand your take but a threat like that would insinuate Alefantis guiltiness.  If he wasn't guilty he would just block or ignore all this shit.

              Well he's guilty as hell in the court of public opinion if you've actually looked into, seen the instagrams, and all of the other connections. The fake museum, the fact that people have been saying this stuff for years, what else does the Clinton Foundation and Dyncorps, John Podesta and the cia do all day. if not this?
