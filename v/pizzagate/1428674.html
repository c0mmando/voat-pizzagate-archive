            so what happened is that wikileaks dropped some emails that had some "code words" that are supposedly used by pedophile rings (because you know, those are an organized thing that have agreed upon customs all over the world). basically a couple of pizza joints are owned by some politicians that are linked with a couple of known pedophiles (who happen to be major funders of politicians or former politicians or current politicians) and they have these "code words" in pizza shop websites. supposedly they are involved with some missing children and a potential child prostitution thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            its feasible sure. but i don't think there is any real smoking gun here. the code words could be for any number of things that they don't want to openly talk about (insider stock trading for one, or tax evasion using shell companies for two).
           </p>
           <p>
            now a bunch of internet social justice warriors are on the witch hunt. which i think is stupid, but hey i'm not gonna get in their way, they got the torches ready. not sure what they plan on accomplishing. a lot of them seem to believe that the NSA, FBI, justice system, and CIA are all compromised and part of the plot. they must have stopped thinking, because if that is true, than it is more likely the idiot investigating pizza gate is going to end up in prison than the powerful politician is.
           </p>
           <p>
            i wouldn't get too caught up in it. there is a possibility that the whole thing is some elaborate honey pot designed to capture all the quack pot conspiracy theorists. part of this conspiracy is the idea that wikileaks itself was compromised and may be leaking false information or planted information. the FBI has been known to do that type of stuff before. definitely don't download any large files if you don't know what is in them, that is begging to paint yourself as a target if there is any big blowback.

Pizzagate is very real (Clinton human trafficking).  Unfortunately, there were a few "tinfoil hats" on Reddit (AKA NK), and people used this to discredit the whole idea.
