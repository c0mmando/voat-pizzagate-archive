<p><strong>U.S. Soldiers Told to Ignore Sexual Abuse of Boys by Afghan Allies</strong></p>
<p>KABUL, Afghanistan — In his last phone call home, Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley Jr. told his father what was troubling him: From his bunk in southern Afghanistan, he could hear Afghan police officers sexually abusing boys they had brought to the base.</p>
<p>“At night we can hear them screaming, but we’re not allowed to do anything about it,” the Marine’s father, Gregory Buckley Sr., recalled his son telling him before he was shot to death at the base in 2012. He urged his son to tell his superiors. “My son said that his officers told him to look the other way because it’s their culture.”</p>
<p>Rampant sexual abuse of children has long been a problem in Afghanistan, particularly among armed commanders who dominate much of the rural landscape and can bully the population. The practice is called bacha bazi, literally “boy play,” and American soldiers and Marines have been instructed not to intervene — in some cases, not even when their Afghan allies have abused boys on military bases, according to interviews and court records.</p>
<p>The policy has endured as American forces have recruited and organized Afghan militias to help hold territory against the Taliban. But soldiers and Marines have been increasingly troubled that instead of weeding out pedophiles, the American military was arming them in some cases and placing them as the commanders of villages — and doing little when they began abusing children.</p>
<p>“The reason we were here is because we heard the terrible things the Taliban were doing to people, how they were taking away human rights,” said Dan Quinn, a former Special Forces captain who beat up an American-backed militia commander for keeping a boy chained to his bed as a sex slave. “But we were putting people into power who would do things that were worse than the Taliban did — that was something village elders voiced to me.”</p>
<p>The policy of instructing soldiers to ignore child sexual abuse by their Afghan allies is coming under new scrutiny, particularly as it emerges that service members like Captain Quinn have faced discipline, even career ruin, for disobeying it.</p>
<p>After the beating, the Army relieved Captain Quinn of his command and pulled him from Afghanistan. He has since left the military.</p>
<p>Four years later, the Army is also trying to forcibly retire Sgt. First Class Charles Martland, a Special Forces member who joined Captain Quinn in beating up the commander.</p>
<p>“The Army contends that Martland and others should have looked the other way (a contention that I believe is nonsense),” Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who hopes to save Sergeant Martland’s career, wrote last week to the Pentagon’s inspector general.</p>
<p>In Sergeant Martland’s case, the Army said it could not comment because of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>When asked about American military policy, the spokesman for the American command in Afghanistan, Col. Brian Tribus, wrote in an email: “Generally, allegations of child sexual abuse by Afghan military or police personnel would be a matter of domestic Afghan criminal law.” He added that “there would be no express requirement that U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan report it.” An exception, he said, is when rape is being used as a weapon of war.</p>
<p>The American policy of nonintervention is intended to maintain good relations with the Afghan police and militia units the United States has trained to fight the Taliban. It also reflects a reluctance to impose cultural values in a country where pederasty is rife, particularly among powerful men, for whom being surrounded by young teenagers can be a mark of social status.</p>
<p>Gregory Buckley Sr. believes the policy of looking the other way was a factor in his son\'s killing.  ...</p>

            It was just the same  for British troops out there, they stood guard on quite a few houses on Man Love Thursday and heard the youngsters screaming as they were raped.

            Very poor but pretty boys are bought from their fathers by very powerful, high status military commanders after promises of being taught a worthy trade. In reality they're given young women's clothing, makeup, and bells for their ankles and wrists. After dancing the drunk men will bid on their services, or engage one after the other.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the US wanted an alliance with the Afghanis they were told not to interfere with their cultural traditions. Still a high number of American servicemen had PTSD after witnessing reapeated rapes of young males.

            If the Afghans want to liberate the "dancing boys" or whatever they are, let them do it. And I don't mean the US giving them weapons to do it either.
