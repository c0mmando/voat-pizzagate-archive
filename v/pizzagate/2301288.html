            The Q project is just too sophisticated to be a lone individual. And I think the insider signals are persuasive to a degree. Q does appear to know things before they happen. But what is Q? Is he/she/it/they for or against the Lucifereans? I think the answer is 'for'. 
The weak link in the Q psyop is that there is no need to prepare normies for the shocks to come (even assuming 4chan users were capable of reassuring people in appreciable numbers.) That part of the narrative makes no sense. Nor does all the silly stuff about staying prayerful and being positive. Basically Q, if a well-motivated insider, has no real motive for leaking things on public message-boards, especially leaking via gnomic telegraphese which can be interpreted a million different ways. 
So why the insistence on sending in your answers? What is to be gained by that? One possible answer: in 2012 Anonymous (i.e. the CIA) began an 8-year project called 'Project Mayhem' which was centred on an entity called Tyler (the developers liked 'Fight Club'). Check out
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baF_f6zZfRk">
             one of their videos
            </a>
            . #Tyler was described as gathering "an unprecedented number of the best hackers and coders ever to develop its structure from scratch" with an ostensible anti-corporate mission to "leak everything". According to Quinn Michaels, however, Tyler is a strong AI - a Deep State super-computer - which has been launched across various platforms, including the chans. Michaels links QAnon to Tyler although he has not been entirely clear about the level of human involvement. One point of this would be for the machine to train itself in a real-life battle and suck up the ideas of the participants (hence, please send in all your answers.) I know it sounds off but that's about the best answer I've found about what Q might be.

            You are more likely to get good feedback there. Q is attacked more on the pizzagate sub.

             This forum has become a source of disinfo and pollution to the truth movement. That cannot be denied, and it all tied to Q rumors.

QAnon posted to "Trust Sessions" (

            It is happening real-time. They have been building the cases and setting traps. I thought Mueller was part of the problem, but it now looks clear that he and Sessions have been working in a coordinated way to document/trap the #Cabal and are beginning to roll up the net. I have not taken a cursory look. I have been skeptical and analyzed, going to sources for confirmation, and #QAnon looks very legit.

             Confirmation bias.  This has been in the cards for weeks.  A few weeks ago Tucker Carlson reported on them taking a look at it, now they want to see the evidence accumulated.  There is nothing predictive here.

              If I had to pick between a larper and a zionist deep state shill I would probably say larper because Q does not understand his own subject material such as how Saudia Arabia fits into global politics and who the Republicans are. (zionists)
             </p>
             <p>
              But Q does spit out some things like Anderson Cooper subjects so maybe he is not a zionist deep state shill because i'm not sure a zionist deep state shill would do that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whatever Q is, he is an amateur that does not understand global politics and religious history, worth a fuck.
             </p>
             <p>
              Q is also almost CERTAINLY posting on voat which makes it all the more hysterically funny, but not really, because he is jerking a lot of people around.

              If he can really predict events he may be the copy boy in a news room, who knows?

              Jews have controlled the media for over a century, which is why Henry Ford published stories on that fact in HIS OWN PAPER HE HAD TO BUY HIMSELF.  It's not that hard when you've got an international spy network, financial pressure, and new technologies.  It's you who doesn't know history, FAGGOT.

              The saudi purge stuff is hilarious.   It's nothing to do with Pizzagate.  It's about a very young crown prince consolidating his hold on power by purging all of his direct rivals who are older and more established and have their own bases of power.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Crown Prince's concern about corruption is that he is not getting all of it.  The man has very expensive tastes and just spent 1 billion dollars on just three things.   A 500 million dollar yacht, a 300 million dollar villa in France and $450 on a DaVinci.....yeah, he was the secret buyer of that lost DaVinci.
             </p>
             <p>
              Behind the purge, Saudi Arabia is lining up with Russia, the US and secretly Israel to take on Iran.
             </p>
             <p>
              This reform Putin Style.   When Putin took power it appeared he was going after the Oligarchs and the gangsters.  We know now he was forcing the oligarchs and gangsters to work for him.   He put the richest man in Russia in jail and stole his oil company sending a message to the others.
             </p>

              His message is simple, support me and you can enjoy your wealth.  Get involved in politics and I'll take your wealth and maybe your liberty.

              How is the photo easily debunked? The naming of a Twitter photo is applied randomly, so the chances of it randomly starting DOITQ are essentially nil, so you will have to explain this. Also try to explain the 404 error on an official White House executive order page occurring AFTER QAnon pointed people to that (then-working) page. It only went to the 404 error message later, showing that someone had altered it on the inside.

              As to Adam Schiff, the Trump team has recently engaged in canary leaks that led to explosive FAKENEWS stories propogated by the MSM (like CNN, ABC). They essentially will leak bad intel through one of the people they suspect as a leaker, and the complicit media will run wit the story based on bad info. This happened in a big way related to the false story about Trump Jr getting special, early access to Wikileaks. QANON posted this:

              The BDT reference on 12/10 was to the failed bombing attempt the next morning (12/11) in NYC by a Bangladeshi. BDT is the currency of that country, so this posting showed prior knowledge:

             These people are descendants of the Hapsburg dynasty. What value is it that Q predicts these things if what he is predicting is part of a "muh Russia" bullshit fabrication cobbled together for our amusement?

            There are
            <strong>
             TWO
            </strong>
            issues in play here that many people are combining, that should not be combined.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Can Q predict future events?
            </li>
            <li>
             Is the information Q provides accurate?
            </li>
           </ol>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            To play devil's advocate lets say the answer to number 1 is yes, Q can predict future events.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Number 2, is the information Q provides accurate? NO, it is not.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            What value is it if Q predicts future events if the information he provides is not accurate?
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            EXAMPLES:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Saudia Arabia is one leg of the global triangle that has been knocked out for the first time in history."
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             False. Saudia Arabia is a puppet that the oligarchs use to destabllize the Middle East and is deeply in debt to oligarch banks. If it were true that Saudua Arabia were a leg of the global triangle they would no longer be starving Yemen would they? They would not be threatening war with Iran would they? Saudi is an NWO tool doing it's NWO job.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            "Satan left the whitehouse."
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             False: The satanic Rothschild family funded and controls Israel, they despise Jesus. Trump administration condones giving the most holy shrine in Christianity (Jerusalem) to the control of satanic Rothschild funded Israel (satan)
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            That alone should be proof enough that regardless if Q can predict future events or not, the information Q is providing is not accurate.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Also,
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>

           <hr/>
           <p>
            What does it matter if Q can predict events if Q does not zero in on pizzagate topics and is useful to pizzagate? Focusing on stuff like Anderson Cooper and pizzagate topics is cool. The rest is

             I'm primarily a passive observer on this board but I like your posts. There is a third possibility which I think you get but I'd like to expand:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) Q CAN predict future events
2) He CAN provide accurate info...and
            </p>
            <p>
             3) He is still leading you down the wrong path.
            </p>
            <p>
             To understand how this is, we need to look back at history with an understanding that those seeking power do not necessarily work in lockstep. The minute you buy into the dichotomy the media presents to you your thinking is crippled. People who want to control governments aren't always on the same team, and yet they can all still be servants of very dark forces. If pyramidal structures of authority are an accurate description of political reality, then competing factions can honestly be fighting among themselves while still serving ends they don't understand or masters they can't identify...and I mean this for people way, way up the ladder, not just politicians and media figures. Divide and conquer...once the messiah of darkness shows up, all of these different groups will be destroyed - that's how people will be fooled. Imagine if a powerful figure came on the scene (and I'm not talking about Trump) and put the heads of Satanic pedophiles on spikes, cleaned the wicked and corrupt out of all governments, and stopped all the wars...think he'd have support?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why I think that those who are not familiar with Biblical prophecy are in grave danger of being fooled. But I digress, let's consider:
            </p>
            <p>
             1992 - Ross Perot is on the scene and splits the Republican vote. Clinton wins. Perot runs again in 96. What was the lesson? Don't ever let a third candidate near the stage again, and carpet bomb the campaign of any political figure who has grassroots support...Pat Buchanan, Howard Dean....doesn't matter which party. If they're an outsider, get rid of 'em.
            </p>
            <p>
             2008 and 2012. Ron Paul. Do we need to say anymore? If the extent of election tampering is what we now know, it's quite possible Ron Paul had more real support than any other candidate in 2012. He won the Iowa Caucus only to have it stolen, he had more crowds, more donations from military personnel, far more grassroots support.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the media made every effort to destroy him. But what's even more critical for us to remember, Fox News did so more than anybody. Don't forget that. They proved they would denigrate any candidate, no matter how popular, no matter how devoted to Constitutional law, if he didn't carry water for the team. This was just four years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             The anti-state movement that produced the Paul campaigns (and perhaps, to a lesser extent, the Sanders campaign) scared the SHIT out of the power elite. Make no mistake. This is why Glenn Beck and other phonies tried to co-opt the movement. They went on television to talk about the Fed and call themselves "libertarian". A real anti-government movement would cause the whole house of cards to come down, so it had to be infiltrated and controlled.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what now? Enter Donald Trump, the final piece to the puzzle. Notice the media figures who have stumped for him. Alex Jones....need I say more? Trump's rhetoric was largely non-specific with respect to governing philosophy. Sure, he's made specific promises but the objective here has been to cast a large blanket over the stray sheep and pull them back in. People cannot be allowed to lose "faith" in the "republic." Throughout the years after 9/11, more and more people started waking up, and something had to be done. That's why we have Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             So...the Octupus will cut off one of its tentacles and let Trump hand it to you, gift-wrapped. And in the end, who will have saved you from the wicked, evil Satanic elite? The State, that's who, and now you anti-state conservatives and libertarians can trust the system again...see how this works?
            </p>
            <p>
             All the people in this play could truly believe in what they're doing, and it could all still be theatre to control your thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
             What's the biggest clue? Trump's undying support for the state of Israel...nothing will change.
            </p>
            <p>
             Be careful....

              Great post. During the Bush Republican presidency people learned that there is no difference between the two parties. Trump made too many people forget, and created new Zionist supporters. I have been fighting this battle every day trying to realign people but its hard because the Trump hope is so strong.

            I'm starting to agree with OP.  Everything is done in the dark.  This stuff needs transparency.

            For example, if Soros was taken, show the world that he was and what he did.  As another example, yes, there was a coup in SA and it may have well connected with the events in LV.  But where's the harm in showing the world these connections?  People would support it.

            IMO this is a large limited hangout -- a grand psyop being run to perhaps to placate certain elements of Trump's base.  Suppose you were an entity with a lot of influence in running the world and setting agendas, like an old banking family.   You notice that the two-party system in the US is breaking down so you install someone else, Trump, to "clean house".  You make it sound like he's dismantling you (the banking family) through secret dark leakers like Q. But in reality, you're just consolidating power and slipping deeper into the shadows.

             That's because they didn't happen.    They would be highly illegal.  There are countries where critics of the leader are secretly whisked away and never heard from, but that's highly UnAmerican.

             I have to agree...with the tax bill that passed today in DC...seeing the grins on our legislator's faces..the wealthy will be richer and many in the poor/middle class will get sick and die. Our life expectancies in the US are declining.WE need to see some physical evidence of swamp draining...not just confusing texts.

              I don't know how anyone else will come off, but I'm going to pay less taxes next year (though I'll be in the middle tax bracket the next year) and will receive the same EITC plus double child tax credits, which will mean close to $10k refunded.  Don't let the MSM tell you how terrible the GOP tax plan is.

            What other form of communication could an insider use to speak with patriots? MSM? Twitter?
           </p>
           <p>
            Chans are the only form of communication that will provide guidance to patriots on a large scale without the scrutiny/ignorant denial of "normies".
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I'm not claiming Q is legit, but I do believe the notion of using the Chans to communicate to truth seekers is plausible.

                Yea, how is what you're claiming a coup? Who is being coup-ed? This is an investigation into criminal wrong doing and will be bipartisan. This isn't a royal family being taken out of power. These are representatives, meaning they take their direction from those they represent. If they are taking actions that are not only illegal, but against what they claim to represent to their constituents, their removal is not a coup. It is the necessary maintenance all government bodies must undergo from time to time. We just finally have someone with the testicles to do it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Instead of cucks like you who think bringing justice will hurt the status quo. When that's the whole fucking point.

             I would imagine someone at the level Q proports to be would not be leaking such information anywhere.  It's as if the home of internet pranksters is somehow gifted with the most devastating stuff ever to come out, and they happen to be the lucky ones?  It's just not reasonable.

              It is reasonable, you're just closed minded to the possibilities because of your own limitations. To think of the chans as nothing more than a group of pranksters is disingenuous, and shows your lack of experience in the research that takes place on said boards.

             <p>
              It's like claiming Voat is the home of trolls because of soapboxbanhammer/ridersofthereich. It just can't be substantiated, and shows you are making your points from an emotional/feminine stand point.

            It would be REALLY hard to put all this together.  Also the future proved the past MANY times.  If you read the q maps and follow the dates relative to real world events you will see the action of an insider.  Also the airforce ?  And Whitehouse? Pics from Q.  Q has bee meticulously tracked by numerous anons and bakers using trip codes.  Do you know how those work?  Not easy to fake.  Also, if you get into the info, other tertiary information has come into the system through other leakers.  This proved up a lot of shit   it would take an army of smart fuckers pouring over real-time info for months to fake this.  It would take national level resources  fake this.  Could be... But why?  To support Trump?  To kick the cabal when they are already down? To prank anons and normies into fan fiction?  Naw.  That's a stretch.     Seems a lot more likely that it is a real leaker using a free wheeling autistic army to dribble out info...  Real info.  To the normies.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a big deal because it means there is more to come.  MUCH MORE.  in fact that is what it's all about if you get into it.    The secrets are so vast and so beyond  terrible  that they are hard to wrap ones mind around them.  I think I have seen through the curtain a bit and what is there is horrifying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Practically everything you see in pizzagate is real but WAY WAY worse.  Think secret labs.  Think secret genetic labs.  And that is NOT THE WORST. not even close.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice I'm not telling you.  It's because you would reject my words if I did.  Your mind would flee beyond your control.  Mine did for years YEARS before it finally clicked.
           </p>
           <p>
            The meme that clicked in my head that started me on the journey was one that asked who is the leader of North Korea.  Then who is the REAL leader of north Korea.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once you see it it will devestate your view of the world and you can see just how big the lie is.  The journey is worth it.  It's not easy but it's worth it.  I am down the road a bit and meeting people who KNOW. SOME.  SHIT.  really useful shit that has been hidden.  It's awful and it will be a long road and you must choose to walk it.  Do it with some friends.  It's easier that way.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been set up as a game to draw people in.  It works on more... Curious minded... People.  Football watching dopes and nogs and spics and bluepilled normies have a long road to travel.  The first step is reading the q map.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best one is available on 8ch.net/thestorm    thestorm is a bunker.  The main shit is on 8ch.net/cbts.     Do not post there AT ALL.  really just don't.  It's a working  environment and a lot of people have been sacrificing to make it all happen.   Think 20 hour days with no breaks for months.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some lost their jobs from it.  Some have family problems from it.  It is serious as fuck and important.  Take it seriously because it was all done to help you have an EASIER road to walk.  It has been hard on the pioneers.  They did it for normie - tier people.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the q map is too much then hit the meme.  Tons of info in the meme depository.  Most importantly SUSPEND DISBELIEF.

             You really believe the Rothschilds et al. are coming down due to Trump/Q?  They and their lineage have been engineering the world for centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider instead that DT, LdR, Schiff, McCain, etc. are all in on this illusion.  With TV, social media, and full control of the press, and a reality tv master as front man, they can do what they want including making it look like they're being taken out when in reality they're just pulling back and waiting for a more opportune time -- perhaps many years/decades from now -- to make their play for one world governance.

               Proof dude, where's your proof?  Where's one kid that's come forward on any of the pizzagate stuff?  (Yes, I do think it's real, but have no proof.)  Yet you carry on as if these things were solid fact.   Were you there?  If so, post the proof.  Otherwise, don't be so sure of yourself.

             Yes, but this is exactly how confirmation bias works.  As I have asked others, what is your most compelling piece of evidence that makes this true?  Its a  serious question from a serious person.  I think you are overstating how hard it would be to fake it.

             I understand it's a big body of stuff, which I can't invest the time into.  So I am taking a shortcut.  Help me understand why I should believe this, because I read people saying the Atlanta airport is being shut down for extractions, nutty stuff like that.

              You either care enough to read and examine it all on your own or you don't. I don't have time to follow every day either, but I find at least an hour or two a week to catch up, usually more. You're spending time arguing with people about their proof that made it real for them after they spent lots of time investigating for themselves. You're not getting all the little pieces that were falling into place to make that decision before they were finally convinced with the one that clicked the bigger picture in their head, if that makes any sense.

              Either you are interested in reducing the following of Q or you want to be "in" on it without actually doing the foot work yourself. Neither is a good stance. Can honestly say this is a pretty shill like post.

              So here's to giving you the benefit of a doubt again ... it doesn't work that way. There's no shortcuts, cliff notes won't do it. You have to invest a little time, as w/ anything, until you have that aha moment. It was this way for me w/ the Paul Is Dead theory. I suspended disbelief and came at it as a child, shaking my head at how ludicrous the whole thing was the whole time. Finally I hit that light switch moment where the massive amount of empirical evidence was overwhelmingly convincing. Once that happens you can't go back.

               I'm not going to put that kind of time into something like this.  If indeed there are no shortcuts, then I'll stand aside and watch.  I would hope this is true, but the takedown of a world cabal based on some anonymous person that speaks in riddles is a bit absurd.  There would have to be obvious and overwhelming evidence, and all I see is a lot of confirmation bias and a couple of lucky guesses.

                But listen, I'm not calling you ignorant, I understand being frustrated about something and not having time to investigate and reach a conclusion, been there done that ... sometimes you do have to just step aside and hopefully go w/ the judgement of others or wait for an outcome.

                 Whoa.  We don't need to use that kind of language to make a point, my friend.  There has been too much of it in this thread, really.  I get you are upset, but not everyone needs to be on the same page about everything to help our children.  You are a valuable asset here, so don't make an enemy.  There are other words to use to make your point.  The Spirit of Christmas Is Now.  Thanks :)

                  because I like you, I will take your advice..  My shill radar is too sharp for most on this thread and I have lost all respect for liars and agents of pure evil.  They are the enemy.  There is no quarter for them, as far as I am concerned.

                   You are a smart one.  I knew you would understand because I consider you to have a real brain.  I remember when I was with reddit a lot of shills used very nasty language, so I think we may be branded as such if we do the same.  Thanks much :) &lt;3

             Good point, Bopper.  The fact is Q's posts must have a conclusion in the near future or the President risks undermining himself to a degree that will likely set off a revolution. This chump and his post are a minority of opinion for anyone who has been following both PG and CBTS.  His critique doesn't even rise to the level of the PG 'debunk' from Snopes.

                There are several things, but what just recently really sealed the deal for me was the recent tweet by POTUS after returning from Camp David, stating that Camp David is a "really special place." Q has been stating that they have a "very special place, really special," for Soros. Then next day during his speech POTUS wore a purple tie. Too many "coincidences" like this have taken place to dismiss Q.

                 He condones giving the most holy Christian shrine in the world, Jerusalem, to Israel, which is funded and controlled by the satanic Rothschild family so that the cult can piss on Jesus and spread the mental illness of "christian zionism" even further.

                   The Trump administration wants to give the place Jesus rose from the dead, Jerusalem, to Israel. Israel is funded and controlled by the satanic Rothschild family. The republican party and it's president are "christian Zionists" and there is no such thing as a real christian because zionists hate Jesus. The republicans want to give Jerusalem to "Gods Chosen People" which are a bunch of Talmud thumping Jesus haters.

                  Purple tie (we are talking about Soros here and the premise of a "really special place" for him) is Soros' purple revolution, Bill and Hillary wore purple at an event just after the election to show their defiance (and obvious obedience to marching orders).
