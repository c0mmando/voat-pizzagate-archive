<p>As Allison Mack and Keith Raniere await trial for their part in a twisted celebrity sex trafficking ring, neighbors of the cult’s headquarters in Knox Woods are coming forward with statements about what they saw while the cult was in town. Although the full extent of the accusations against Mack and Raniere were underreported in the mainstream media, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children. The prosecution has not yet released the evidence that they have of pedophilia, as they are likely saving it for court so the defense has less time to prepare. However, a recent interview given by a neighbor reveals disturbing details about an encounter that Allison Mack had with an 8-year-old gymnast.</p>',

            Where does it say that child sex trafficking is the main charge? Couldn't find it in the document they posted.

            "The prosecution has not yet released the evidence that they have of pedophilia, as they are likely saving it for court so the defense has less time to prepare."
Huh???
Prosecutors don't have to give the defense their evidence? In what universe? Discovery compels production of all state's evidence. Maybe they are both keeping it from the media but they aren't doing it to the defense.

             And even if the incident Vindicator mentions actually happened, prosecutors have none of that as the person didn't go to the police.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are not keeping it from anyone because they would have to publically charge the defendants with the crime and they have not.  No crime like this is mentioned in the indictment which is a public document.

              I suppose it is possible they are holding it over her head or planning to charge that separately... I don't know as I have spent no time looking into her case, I was only commenting on that one sentence since it is obviously false under the laws of every state and under Federal rules. A lot of false statements or ideas that people would have no reason to know any better about get spread through the internet.
