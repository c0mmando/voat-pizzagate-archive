<p>Lebaron clan’s connection to Nxivm and possible motives for the killings.</p>
<p>The women/children were attacked Monday as they traveled in three SUVs through the mountains between the states of Sonora and Chihuahua.</p>
<p>The cult-like LeBaron clan have lived in northern Mexico, for decades after splitting from the LDS over the Church’s crackdown on </p>
<p>polygamy. The Utah Mormon church does not consider them members, (LeBaron clan are usually referred to as Mormons).</p>
<p>Former LeBaron clan leader the late Ervil LeBaron.</p>
<p>The cult has a long history of polygamy/pedophilia and an estimated 40 murders. Ervil LeBaron, the clan’s former leader, had at least 13 wives and over 50 children. Ervil reportedly utilized his wives and daughters to murder defectors and dissidents. He ordered murders from his Utah jail cell. LeBaron clan has a long and bloody history in Mexico. They had also challenged the drug gangs and were lobbying to be allowed to create their own ‘security force.’ They had clashed with local farmers over water rights.</p>
<p>Several members of the LeBaron Clan have been Nxivm members.</p>
<p>Samantha LeBaron</p>
<p>Samantha LeBaron is reportedly still a member of Nxivm and a DOS slave. It is unclear whether Cynthia LeBaron remains with the Nxivm cult. Both women formerly lived in Clifton Park. The LeBaron Girls Came to Clifton Park to Be Taught by Raniere In 2016, when  Keith Alan Raniere was actively seeking a virgin to anoint as his future “successor” and assigned several of his slaves to seek them, DOS First Line Slave Master Rosa Laura Junco invited 11 girls from Chihuahua to come to Albany to take part in a special Pilot Project for teen girls created by Raniere. At least four of the girls’s last names were LeBaron and it is believed all of them came from the LeBaron clan. The LeBaron clan had been persuaded to send the girls to Clifton Park NY, because Nxivm offered them a special Pilot Project for free. The curriculum – in the form of modules – was written especially for teen girls and would lead to female empowerment, they were told. While in New York, the girls were offered opportunities to do rewarding work to earn money.</p>

<p>Rosa Laura Junco invited girls from Chihuahua to come to her house and learn from Keith Raniere. When the girls arrived, they were </p>
<p>housed in Nxivm members’ homes including Junco’s and Dr. Brandon Porter’s. The girls ranged in ages from 13 – 17. Junco’s teenage daughter also attended classes held in Junco’s home. Rosa Laura Junco’s mansion in Clifton Park where 11 teenage girls were taught Keith Raniere’s lessons for teenage girls.</p>
<p>DOS slave Sahajo Haertel taught the LeBaron girls. Haertel was formerly a member of the Osho sex cult before joining Raniere and</p>
<p>becoming his sex slave The teens were quickly disappointed. They had been told they were going to be taught a high school curriculum equivalent. Instead they were only taught classes in English and NXIVM modules. As for meaningful work, the girls were assigned to work</p>
<p>for Delagates, India Oxenberg’s company which was set up to run errands and clean houses for Nxivm members. The girls cleaned houses, preformed childcare, and prepared food including baking deserts for Nxivm Intensives. Raniere personally came to mentor the girls and apparently one or more incidents occurred that was inappropriate and possibly sexual in nature. the girls fled back home to Chihuahua. According to one source, there may have been a threat of a police report and Raniere and others in Nxivm seemed to have been deeply worried for several days just prior to the girls’ sudden departure. One eyewitness said she saw Raniere sitting with some of the girls and was shocked when she saw him kiss them on the lips in greeting. He was sitting near them, holding hands and touching them on their bodies in a playful manner. “The girls had been told he was a great teacher, and not to be disrespected. </p>
<p>One side product of the events was that Rosa Laura Junco offered her daughter to Raniere as his virgin successor.</p>
<p>These girls were not the first to flee Raniere. in 1990, a 13 year old girl, Rhiannon, fled from Raniere after he raped her some 60 times. Raniere was supposed to teach her algebra and Latin. The LeBaron girls were to supposed to get a unique and special education from Raniere.</p>
<p>“The girls were completely grossed out by Keith”‘ said the source. “They felt Keith was a ‘lech’ and creepy. They felt he had sexual intentions. They told their parents. Whether he did more, I don’t know. Keith knows what the laws are regarding age of consent.”</p>
<p>Keith Raniere was seeking virgins for “successors”.</p>

            But why take your Children over the boarder into Chihuahua and Sonora? They are completely controlled by the cartel. Stupid.

            , thank you.  I had the feeling there was more to that story, it didn't sound 'random' to me when I heard about it.  I thought maybe it was a message sent to someone, whether about testifying over something or some other nefarious reason (like child trafficking).

            you need to be careful with your links, Because of the '=' after the first link it doesn't work. A space before the = will work.
