<p><strong>Relevance:</strong>  <em>Recently I posted about  <strong><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2543258">Stephen Feinberg (CEO of Cerberus)</a></strong> and then found out that his father just happened to be living in <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-feinbergs-dad-lives-in-newtown-2012-12?IR=T">Newtown when the shooting happened</a>. Then I came across an image of <strong>Gene Rosen</strong> with an odd painting of a child on his wall and the news that Rosen was a retired psychologist from a notorious state hospital.   And a Harvard psychiatrist who specializes in trauma and belonged to the UN Baha\'i Faith just happened to move to Newtown shortly before the shooting. Looking further I find Oxenberg links which takes us to <strong>NXIVM</strong>.  How manipulated is our reality ?</em></p>

<p>As discussed in various articles on this website the ‘green philosophy’ that is rapidly permeating our society has been fostered since its inception by the Club of Rome and its affiliated organisations. Members of the CoR triad include Al Gore, Javier Solana, Mikhail Gorbachev, David Rockefeller, Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton, Maurice Strong, Robert Muller, Bill Gates, Jimmy Carter and many other influential leaders. </p>
<p>The Baha’i community has, as a duly accredited non-governmental organization, long worked closely with the <strong>United Nations</strong>, supporting many of its goals and programs, and taking a leadership role in several international gatherings. Its involvement in the United Nations dates back to the founding of the UN in 1945. </p>
<p>The Baha’i organisation claims to have a close working relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO) and with the United Nations Environment Programme. It is also involved in joint activities with UNIFEM and UNICEF as well as many other religious, environmental and social programs within the UN. <strong>The Baha’i spiritual beliefs mirror almost exactly those described by the Lucis Trust</strong> and AAC described above. They too are waiting for the imminent arrival of an ‘Enlightened Being’ who will lead humanity into a ‘new world order</p>

           <p>
            As discussed in various articles on this website the ‘green philosophy’ that is rapidly permeating our society has been fostered since its inception by the Club of Rome and its affiliated organisations. Members of the CoR triad include Al Gore, Javier Solana, Mikhail Gorbachev, David Rockefeller, Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton, Maurice Strong, Robert Muller, Bill Gates, Jimmy Carter and many other influential leaders.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Baha’i community has, as a duly accredited non-governmental organization, long worked closely with the
            <strong>
             United Nations
            </strong>
            , supporting many of its goals and programs, and taking a leadership role in several international gatherings. Its involvement in the United Nations dates back to the founding of the UN in 1945.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Baha’i organisation claims to have a close working relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO) and with the United Nations Environment Programme. It is also involved in joint activities with UNIFEM and UNICEF as well as many other religious, environmental and social programs within the UN.
            <strong>
             The Baha’i spiritual beliefs mirror almost exactly those described by the Lucis Trust
            </strong>
            and AAC described above. They too are waiting for the imminent arrival of an ‘Enlightened Being’ who will lead humanity into a ‘new world order

            The painting on  Gene Rosen's wall is a portion of a mural from the Masonic Denver airport. The series of murals basically spelled out the plans for the New World Order agenda. The airport was named the New World Airport, and has a plaque of Freemasons over a box with instruction of a date in the future when the box will be opened.

            <p>
             Jesus the high priest returns as Joshua the high priest the same way he left (Acts 1:11) which was in a state of not being recognized, false accusation, sacrifice, and general rejection. You could say the high priest aspect of Jesus Christ, symbolized by the ramp stone that was broken out of the grand gallery by the pyramid builders, returns 2000 years later as Joshua the high priest symbolized by the capstone. The teachings of the capstone are the whole “point” of the pyramid. “He is ‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the capstone.’”

            <p>
             In 2007, a 10-year-old girl from Fort Smith named Ivy Brake became the responsibility of the state. Her mother, Ivy recalled, was loving, sweet and unstable. She struggled with substance abuse and chronic health issues for most of Ivy's childhood. She periodically got clean — once for a year — until, when Ivy was 10, an old boyfriend returned, and her mother started using again. Ivy and her 12-year-old sister, Kristin, left to stay with a relative, but soon after they arrived, the police showed up, asking questions about their life at home.
            </p>
            <p>
             The police, Kristin said, were going to wait for the girls' grandmother to come take them from the relative's house, but the Arkansas Department of Human Services' Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) got there first. They took the sisters to the Fort Smith Emergency Shelter, a short-term residential facility for children awaiting placement with a foster family. A juvenile court then held a probable cause hearing to determine whether the children should remain in DCFS custody.
            </p>
            <p>
             Relatives told Ivy that her grandmother, who lived nearby, and an aunt in Texas both tried to get custody of the sisters but were told that they didn't have sufficient space and that "that wasn't what was best for our lives." Instead, Ivy began a long chain of placements in foster homes and group residential facilities:..

             <p>
              DAVOS, Switzerland, January 26, 2018 - Companies, Governments and NGOs urgently need trusted metrics and relevant indices to understand and drive progress toward implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The 17 SDGs include economic, nutritional, health and education-related goals aimed at helping to build a better society. At the same time, the next generation urgently needs to be included in the global dialogue about how to achieve SDG implementation. Today, the United Nations Global Sustainability Index Institute Foundation (UNGSII Foundation) and United Way announce a new strategic partnership for SDG implementation that creates synergies reaching both goals.

             Lucis Trust is bad news
            </p>
            <p>
             Alice Bailey 
Who is this Alice Bailey? In the early 1920’s she founded a publishing company called Lucifer Publishing Company (You may have heard of Lucifer!). Bailey used her "demonic" publishing company to disseminate her radical New Age ideas around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most people were not inclined to seriously consider adopting views produced by Lucifer Publishing. When the negative effects of the company's name became apparent, Bailey shortened the name to Lucis Trust. Amazingly, Lucis Trust was headquartered at the United Nations Plaza for many years. Recently, it was moved to Wall Street.

            Was running in and out this weekend and my SO turned on ABC TV on Sun. morn. and they had people on discussing the Santa Fe Shooting.  And guess what?  They had 3 people on and one of them was someone that suffered through the Sandy Hook Shooting.  I could not listen had to go but I was in shock.  They are still trotting them out after all this time.  Am trying to find the interview.  I believe it was on George Stefanopoulos.  Also this was extremely fake to me.

             Dr Oz keeps pushing this horseshit all the time too. About six months ago he had the sandy hook “families” on and they were crying with no tears coming out. It was so obvious and fake and it was all about the guns laws. The Texas shooting was definitely another MK ultra kid programmed to go in and do it. They had a tv news interview with a teen boy would got shot in the head who was sitting on the porch of his house with his family being interviewed not even two days after the shooting with a strange looking bandage on one side of his head. No cognitive difficulties whatsoever.  The more they push this anti gun stuff the more I think everyone needs one for the NWO and I’m not a gun person either.

              I was actually for gun control until I got wised up about all the stuff they have been pulling on us. That''s when I started questioning everything including the guns.  I wondered why Dems never got things passed when Obama had a Dem House.  It then dawned on me that they really never will due to the fact that that's how they make their money for their office runs.  They will take some away, but not all.  They just can't.  But they know just how many they need to take.  I think all the states probably have tanks put away now.  I saw one on the news.  That was just once, because I think many people must have called in and they never have shown another.  My friend from another state said she saw one on TV too around the same time.  They were really nervy putting that out there.  Yes, when I think of the days I sat on my couch crying for those kids it makes me livid.  That's how they convince people.  No one believes they would pull on our Heartstrings like that.  Oh Yes, they would.  In a NY Minute.   Oz too like all the others.  If they are on TV they have been bought.

            911 &amp; Sandy Hook is what brought me here. The two reasons I no longer believe a fucking word what governments or so say authority figures say anymore.  They fucked up, from that day forward I will question absolutely anything and everything. I will make up my own mind on things, not just what the governments, scientists or news tells me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately it's a fucked up position to be in when you can no longer believe or trust any fucker in authority. It sometimes makes you question your own beliefs that you have held from a small child, when these same people, Illuminati, Jesuits, Freemasons, Black Nobility, Skull N Bones, Scroll N Keys, Governments are all saying the same thing, then you know for sure you're being fucking lied to. As crazy as all this shit is it's why I will keep an open mind to anything and everything, even if it's as crazy as the earth being flat. I will look at any and all evidence in future and make my own fucking mind up.

             Speaking of flat earth, what I don’t understand is why it matters either way &amp; if it’s flat, then why won’t they admit it? To TPTB, what’s the up/down side to both theories.
            </p>

             <p>
              Ok let me clear something up here before I go on, I'm not 100% sure what we're living on. I honestly can't say if the earth is flat or a globe anymore. What I do know is that the more you look into it, the flat earth theory has more going for it than the globe theory does. The only so say real evidence we have for the globe theory is from Nasa or from space agencies associated with them, from so say photos or live video from space, take those thing away you are left with how it all started out, just a theory.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, do I believe we walked on the moon, no I don't believe that anymore, I don't believe it for the following reasons - 99% of all Astronauts are either freemasons or belong to secret societies, this fact alone should be enough to set alarm bells ringing. I have also studied what's left of the 33 reels of moon landing footage, the reels that Nasa no longer has, the 33 reels that they accidentally erased. One of the clips shows an Astronaut hammering a pole into the ground, sound can be clearly heard when there should be none in the vacuum of space. Under the moon lander are small stones where there should be at least scorch marks if not a crater where the lander would have needed thrust to land. I could go on and on but I would suggest watching all the clips for yourself.
             </p>
             <p>
              If we never landed on the moon this makes Nasa (which just happens to mean 'to deceive in hebrew') a bunch of Freemason liars.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would they lie to us, what are they hiding, why does it matter??
             </p>
             <p>
              The globe theory that was created by a Freemason matters because it means Newton's theory of gravity, or Einstein's theory of relativity are no longer required for a flat earth model. They are replaced with buoyancy and density, this would mean that physics and science has been held back thousands of years because of false teaching. The only guy that seemed to know the truth was Nikola Tesla, maybe that's why they had to shut him up and confiscate or destroy his lifetime work.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would also mean that the chances of evolution on a flat earth are practically zero. meaning everything you see has some how been created, it can no longer be down to pure chance. Maybe they need to hide the creator or creator's. Maybe they are just evil and like to laugh at how they can control all of society through their lies and deceit, good against evil. Maybe it's all these thing and more.
             </p>
             <p>
              My eyes are wide open, I will no longer just accept things that authorities tell me are correct. Question everything and make your own conclusions. They say we are hurtling through an infinite space on a spinning ball, space is allowed to be infinite but the land can't be? some flat earthers believe that the small world we live in is surrounded by an ice wall Antarctica, beyond this ice wall is more land, possibly surrounded by its own ice, could there be infinite land beyond these areas? you believe there could be infinite space, why not land, just a thought.

               The moon gives of a cool white light (female) and the sun gives of warm yellow light (male), a fact which completely contradicts science explanation that the moon reflects the suns light.

               You're being irrational... If you're going to say The earth is flat, THEN YOU NEED TO PROVIDE A SINGLE FUCKING PIECE OF EVIDENCE.  There are countless peices of evidence, that Suggest the earth is round... NO, I'm not talking about "someone said something"  There Is raw data, that suggests the earth is round... Data that ANY ONE CAN OBTAIN... Like Without a fucking computer, or a science gatekeeper. So many things ONLY MAKE SEnSE, BECAUSE OF THE EARTH IS ROUND.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is no data To suggest the earth is flat. Every time nasa lies about something... You're not gaining another peice of evidence to support your retarded fucking theory. You're just providing another piece of evidence that you're being a dimwit.
