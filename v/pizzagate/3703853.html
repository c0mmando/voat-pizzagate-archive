            , can you please edit your post to explain what exactly is being claimed here? Is it the same company in Wuhan as the lab that likely released the coronavirus? The one Zerohedge got banned from Twitter for talking about? We've had so much disinfo pushed on this topic we need to clear about what's being claimed, what new information is coming out, and how it fits with past stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you need to add a link to all the times QAnon has mentioned the "White Rabbit" so people know what that QRV post is about. And it would be great if

            intriguing that the chemical structure of "adrenochrome" is shaped like a rabbit. All the more reason to apply our usual standards, though.

             Re: Remote sensing  - I'm interested in the military sense of the phrase.. not the unproven conspiratorial speculations on wordpress website.  I'm interested because: The president of Raniere's company (you remember NXIVM) Global Technologies Inc is Francis Tsang. He was a Principal Scientist at
             <strong>
              NSTec (Remote Sensing Lab, Las Vegas)
             </strong>
             .  Yeah, it's a military establishment.  I also found links to Epstein from NXIVM.  Tsang.  But that's old news now.

             <p>
              Hyperspectral imaging, like other spectral imaging, collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes.

              is used in a wide array of applications. Although originally developed for mining and geology (the ability of hyperspectral imaging to identify various minerals makes it ideal for the mining and oil industries, where it can be used to look for ore and oil),[9][18] it has now spread into fields as widespread as ecology and surveillance, as well as historical manuscript research, such as the imaging of the Archimedes Palimpsest. This technology is continually becoming more available to the public. Organizations such as NASA and the USGS have catalogues of various minerals and their spectral signatures, and have posted them online to make them readily available for researchers. On a smaller scale, NIR hyperspectral imaging can be used to rapidly monitor the application of pesticides to individual seeds for quality control of the optimum dose and homogeneous coverage.

             The wiki link to 'remote sensing' :
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing">

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object and thus in contrast to on-site observation, especially the Earth. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines (for example, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology); it also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications.
             </p>
             <p>
              In current usage, the term "remote sensing" generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth, including on the surface and in the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It may be split into "active" remote sensing (such as when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft and its reflection by the object is detected by the sensor) and "passive" remote sensing (such as when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor).
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Remote Sensing has a growing relevance in the modern information society. It represents a key technology as part of the aerospace industry and bears increasing economic relevance – new sensors e.g. TerraSAR-X and RapidEye are developed constantly and the demand for skilled labour is increasing steadily. Furthermore, remote sensing exceedingly influences everyday life, ranging from weather forecasts to reports on climate change or natural disasters. As an example, 80% of the German students use the services of Google Earth; in 2006 alone the software was downloaded 100 million times. But studies have shown that only a fraction of them know more about the data they are working with.[29] There exists a huge knowledge gap between the application and the understanding of satellite images. Remote sensing only plays a tangential role in schools, regardless of the political claims to strengthen the support for teaching on the subject.[30] A lot of the computer software explicitly developed for school lessons has not yet been implemented due to its complexity. Thereby, the subject is either not at all integrated into the curriculum or does not pass the step of an interpretation of analogue images. In fact, the subject of remote sensing requires a consolidation of physics and mathematics as well as competences in the fields of media and methods apart from the mere visual interpretation of satellite images.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many teachers have great interest in the subject "remote sensing", being motivated to integrate this topic into teaching, provided that the curriculum is considered. In many cases, this encouragement fails because of confusing information.[31] In order to integrate remote sensing in a sustainable manner organizations like the EGU or Digital Earth[32] encourage the development of learning modules and learning portals. Examples include: FIS – Remote Sensing in School Lessons,[33] Geospektiv,[34] Ychange,[35] or Spatial Discovery,[36] to promote media and method qualifications as well as independent learning.
             </p>
             <p>
              Others mixing remote sensing and GIS capabilities are: GRASS GIS, ILWIS, QGIS, and TerraLook.

             <p>
              April 2008 TerraLook provides access to satellite images for users that lack prior experience with remote sensing or Geographic Information System (GIS) technology.  It does this by combining collections of images on user-defined themes with a set of simple visualization and analysis tools, allowing the user to explore the data and employ it for useful purposes.  The images include recent high-resolution ones plus those from several historical periods going back to the early '70s to support change analysis.  Simplicity is an overarching principle.  TerraLook was designed to overcome the obstacles that limit access to data by user communities that lack sophisticated tools and skills.
             </p>
             <p>
              TerraLook is of use to a wide variety of disciplines including conservation, development planning, education, urban studies, disaster planning and response, and others.  It is of particular use in developing countries that may have less capacity to purchase or work with remote sensing data.
             </p>
             <p>
              TerraLook was previously known as the Protected Area Archive, or PAA. That name reflects its origins, which lie in conservation, and the name was changed to TerraLook to better represent the broad range of user disciplines that it supports. The concept evolved out of discussions that
              <strong>
               Gary Geller had with Protected Area managers in southeast Asia, while he was on leave of absence from his job at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory

            </p>
            <p>
             This does not Connect 3BSWC to Epstein, nor does it mean that 3BSWC is engaged in harvesting Adrenochrome from unwilling victims, nor does it connect Epstein to COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ncbi link merely shows that lab-synthesized Adrenochrome can/could be sourced from the 3BSWC, it does not at all link Adrenochrome to COVID-19. The relevant virology lab regarding COVID-19 is located in Jiangxia, Wuhan, Hubei, China, which is north of Donghu New Technology Development Zone; there is absolutely nothing linking Adrenochrome and COVID-19 except for the city of Wuhan.
            </p>
            <p>
             As an aside, it is very interesting learning about Christine Maxwell's contributions to the IT industry (for better or worse – notably her work on IPv6), but, there's no indication that she was involved with Ghislaine and Epstein's depravity.

              I agree that from what I have written there is no real connection to Epstein here.  I was blown away by the tweet because I could see many many connections that still need to be investigated and properly documented.  Just consider my comment the beginnings of that documentation.  I'll strike out the Epstein bit.

              The truth about "the Vatican's 'LUCIFER' Telescope".
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Spoiler alert:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              It's an acronym and was renamed to LUCI before it was even put into operation.
             </li>
             <li>
              LUCI is not a telescope, it is an instrument which attaches to the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).
             </li>
             <li>
              The LBT is not owned by the Vatican, their telescope (albeit at the same facility) is named Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT).
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             So we can file this one under misinformation at best, deliberate disinformation at worst.

              Thanks for that argosiv.  Always interesting when you show up.  Lucifer is also known as the 'morning star' btw.  There's much more to that Arizona story.. but I've already posted about that long ago.  However, I took a closer look at these agencies that are working together...

The same year, Steward Observatory’s Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) also opened on Mount Graham. A little more than a decade later, the

              <p>
               Fr. George V. Coyne SJ was named director of the Vatican Observatory at the age of 45 — notably he was one of the few appointments made during the brief papacy of John Paul I — after the unexpected death of his predecessor. He served until he was 73, the longest term of any Observatory director.
              </p>
              <p>
               During his tenure as Observatory director, Fr Coyne oversaw the modernization of the Observatory’s role in the world of science, welcoming onto its staff a number of young Jesuit astronomers from around the world including Africa, Asia, and South America. Under his leadership the Vatican Observatory Research Group was established at the University of Arizona and in collaboration with the University he made possible the construction of the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, with the world’s first spin-cast mirror, on Mt. Graham.
              </p>
              <p>
               ..And with the establishment in 1986 of the biennial Vatican Observatory Summer Schools in astronomy and astrophysics, Fr Coyne advanced the education of a generation of young astronomers, especially from developing countries.
              </p>
              <p>
               ..Coyne was appointed Director of the Vatican Observatory by Pope John Paul I in 1978, and in that same year he also became Associate Director of Steward Observatory. During 1979-80 he served as Acting Director and Head of Steward Observatory and the Astronomy Department, and thereafter he continued as an adjunct professor in the University of Arizona Astronomy Department.
              </p>
              <p>
               Coyne was awarded honorary doctorate degrees by Boston College; the Jagellonian University in Krakow, Poland; Loyola University Chicago; Marquette University; St Peter’s College Jersey City; and the University of Padua, Italy. He was a member of the International Astronomical Union, the American Astronomical Society, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the American Physical Society,

               It's not surprising that multiple astronomical organizations are linked together. The resources for observing the night sky without light pollution are very limited and thus shared by many different countries. Also, due to the nature of measuring astronomical phenomena, it often requires collaboration of teams operating telescopes from opposite sides of the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               FWIW: the Jesuits have been involved in optics and astronomy since it's beginnings. They helped found the science, as well as much of the development of the mathematics needed for those fields. Here's
               <a href="http://faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/sjgeom.htm">
                a brief article
               </a>
               about that. My understanding is that the reason they were interested is for the sake of navigation (Jesuit missionaries were always at the forefront of world exploration) and then later for education. Ignatius of Loyola, the order's founder, was a soldier before his conversion, so he was keenly attuned to the logistical problems of bringing the Gospel to all the people of the world.

               As for the rest of your comment there, there's nothing to suggest any nefarious activity behind these observatories. Also, with this "Vatican LUCIFER telescope" claim now debunked, I see no value in beating that dead horse. Religion and modern astronomy have always strongly researched space(modern)/the heavens(historical astronomy).

              <p>
               The human race is fascinated with existence beyond earth, so it makes sense that any number of various organizations are going to put money into such studies. Are bad actors going to get involved? Sure, because big money is so often intertwined with nefarious people – but that doesn't make the sciences evil.
