  'formattedContent' => '<p>The Miami Herald is reporting a brand new accuser has joined the Virginia Roberts lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein -- an accuser who says she reported his crimes to the FBI, but they did nothing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new victim has gone public in the Jeffrey Epstein case, filing a sworn affidavit in federal court in New York Tuesday, saying that she was sexually assaulted and her then-15-year-old sister molested by Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 1996.</p>
<p>Maria Farmer, then 26, claims that she was employed by Epstein, a multimillionaire financier who lived in a vast mansion on New York’s Upper East Side, and that she frequently saw “school-age girls’’ wearing uniforms come into the mansion and go upstairs. She was told that the girls were auditioning for modeling work, according to her affidavit.</p>
<p>Then an art student in New York, Farmer said she reported her assault to New York police and the FBI in 1996. FBI documents released April 1 make a reference to Farmer having been interviewed in 2006 or 2007. However, Farmer, now 49, said the FBI did not take any action against Epstein and Maxwell.</p>
<p>“To my knowledge, I was the first person to report Maxwell and Epstein to the FBI. It took a significant amount of bravery for me to make that call because I knew how incredibly powerful and influential both Epstein and Maxwell were, particularly in the art community,’’ she wrote.</p>
<p>Farmer’s affidavit is one of 15 exhibits attached to a defamation complaint filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, against Alan Dershowitz, one of Epstein’s most vocal and powerful attorneys.</p>
<p>Giuffre claims in the lawsuit, as she has in past court filings, that Dershowitz, 80, knew about and participated in a sex-trafficking operation involving underage girls and run by Epstein and Maxwell, and that she was forced to have sex with Dershowitz and other prominent, wealthy men when she was underage.</p>
<p>Dershowitz has railed against the allegations for years, maintaining that he has never met Giuffre. He also says he has documents and other evidence that prove she is lying.</p>
<p>Farmer’s affidavit and other documents attached to the lawsuit are meant to bolster Giuffre’s case that Dershowitz has maliciously spread false information on behalf of Epstein in order to intimidate and silence her and other victims, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>“No sensible person looks forward to litigation,’’ Giuffre said in a statement. “And I know that standing up for myself and others will cause Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Epstein to redouble their efforts to destroy me and my reputation. But I can no longer sit by and not respond. As my complaint shows, my abusers have sought to conceal their guilt behind a curtain of lies. My complaint calls for the accounting to which I, and their other victims, are entitled.”</p>
<p>Dershowitz said he welcomed the opportunity to finally prove in court that Giuffre is lying.</p>
<p>“Virtually everything in the complaint is false, and I will be able to disprove all of this in a court of law. I have told the truth throughout and I’ll be able to prove it. ... I never met her, I never heard of her,’’ Dershowitz said.</p>
<p>In recent months, Dershowitz has waged a public relations war against Giuffre, her lawyers and the Miami Herald, which published a series of articles about Epstein in November. The series, “Perversion of Justice,” focused on how the former U.S. attorney in Miami, now Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, brokered a non-prosecution deal giving Epstein federal immunity, despite overwhelming evidence that he had sexually assaulted dozens of girls. The series mentioned Dershowitz, who represented Epstein during the negotiations, including Giuffre’s sex abuse allegations against the Harvard lawyer.</p>
<p>Giuffre’s lawsuit does not provide evidence of Giuffre having sex with Dershowitz, or provide dates when the abuse allegedly happened. But it does provide a chapter-and-verse history of Dershowitz’s public statements and attempts to take each statement he’s made and discredit them.</p>
<p>For example, Dershowitz has said that he has never seen any underage girls when he visited Epstein at the financier’s various homes in Palm Beach, New Mexico and New York. But Farmer, who now lives in Kentucky, claims that one of her duties working for Epstein was to staff the front door to his New York estate and to keep track of visitors.</p>
<p>“On a number of occasions I witnessed Dershowitz at the NY mansion going upstairs at the same time there were young girls under the age of 18 who were present upstairs in the house,’’ she said in the affidavit, asserting that Dershowitz was so comfortable he would walk into the mansion and go directly upstairs.</p>
<p>Dershowitz said that would have been impossible because he did not meet Epstein until August 1996 on Martha’s Vineyard.</p>

            <p>
             ZAMPOLLI is an old world BLOODLINE of the Italian AGNELLI/FIAT family.[24] The Agnelli family intermarried with one of the leading ruling families of old Europe that goes back to ancient Etruscans. They are part of the ancient HOUSE OF BOURBON.
            </p>
            <p>
             The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma, Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 37th Degree of Sublime Freemasonry, with that of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, were the Knights Templar, successors of the Ancient Knights of the Temple. Before his execution in 1314, the Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, transmitted his powers to the actual Grand Commander through an uninterrupted series of Chiefs of the Order. Among the secret Chiefs were recorded many Princes of the HOUSE OF BOURBON.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Royal Bourbons originated in 1268, when the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon married a younger son of King Louis IX (discussed further below). The house continued for three centuries as a cadet branch, while more senior Capetians ruled France, until Henry IV became the first Bourbon King of France in 1589. A cadet Bourbon branch is the House of Orleans.[25]
            </p>
            <p>
             Zampolli, HOUSE OF BOURBON &amp; ILLUMINATI– The Old World Elite
            </p>
            <p>
             Roman Catholic Donna Virginia Bourbon del Monte (1899 – 1945) was the wife of Edoardo Agnelli and the mother of Gianni Agnelli, head of Fiat and the richest man in modern Italian history. He was the uncrowned King of Italy.[26] Gianni was a Roman Catholic, and a high ranking member of the Lucifer’s Network, the Black Nobility, Committee of 300, and the Bilderbergers. Zampolli may have learn the business of exploited women from Gianni. He was regularly engaged in orgies with high class prostitutes then take them to Mass. Gianni died in 2001.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, Gianni wasn’t  just interested in whores. He used Fiat to gain a strategic brand in Ronald Reagan’s classified Star War Programs, the Strategic Defense Initiative. Gianni got right in the middle of America’s classified and top secret research and development of Psychotronic and Electromagnetic Weapons and Mind Control. (See Alex Constantine, Psychic Dictatorship in the U.S., Feral House, Port Townsend, WA, pgs. 36-37)
            </p>
            <p>
             He was directly in the middle of the JFK Assassination. He was in the New World Order Satanic inner circle of the Rothschilds, and George Soros that allegedly was behind Hilary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[27]
            </p>
            <p>
             Virginia Agnelli was a close confidant of SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Eugen Dollmann. Dollmann was an extremely important SS, Knight of the Black Sun, diplomat.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1939, Dollmann was appointed as Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler’s personal Ambassador to the Holy See, and Italy. Dollmann helped Virginia Agnelli escape from detention and with her help arranged a meeting between Himmler’s personal secretary SS-Obergruppenfuhrer Karl Wolff and Pope Pius XII to negotiate the Waffen SS evacuation of Rome.[28]
            </p>
            <p>
             Karl Wolff, Dollmann, Vatican and Virginia Agnelli were secret partners in Operation Sunshine. Virginia may have been SS Wolff’s secret lover. In this operation, Dollmann worked closely with James Jesus Angleton, the future CIA head of counterintelligence who saw Allen Dulles (MK ULTRA) as his maestro.  Working together with Himmler, they helped many notorious Nazi and SS war criminals escape to the United States, Latin America, and other countries via the “Nazi Ratlines.”[29]
            </p>
            <p>
             After the fall of Nazi Germany, Dollmann worked for the CIA and Hitler’s favorite “Scarface” SS General Otto Skorzeny– one of Europe’s most dangerous men.

             Zampolli, UN, Freemasons, Nazi &amp; Mafia Ambassadors
            </p>
            <p>
             Paolo Zampolli has a Dominican diplomatic passport and is officially the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of Dominica for Oceans and Seas- an absolute joke. According to the UN’s Blue Book, Zampolli is Dominica’s (lone) Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN.[30] There is great concern that Zampolli is using his stable of MK ULTRA Sex Kittens at the UN to compromise and bribe foreign  heads of state, officials, diplomats and ambassadors.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2015, Prime Minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit and Zampolli tried to name as its ambassador to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization one Mafia Boss Francesco “Corallo, a gaming magnate on Interpol’s most wanted list on suspicion of “organized crime, transnational crime and fraud.”[31]
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2004, Dominica’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Marketing wrote to Ireland, requesting “agrément” for the appointment of a Nazi bank robber, Serge Roger De Thibault De Boesinghe as Dominica’s Ambassador to Ireland. “It turns out that in the 70s, De Boesinghe became a member of an international neo-Nazi organization, the new European order, and was active in the Belgian branch of the movement. De Boesinghe was also a close friend and confidant of Leone Degrelle the former head of the Walloon Division of Hitler’s dreaded Waffen SS, which were front-line troops in the fight against the Soviet Union.”[32]
            </p>
            <p>
             Obersturmbannfuhrer-SS Leon Degrelle along with his close confidant Skorzeny were close to Fuhrer Hitler and SS-1 Himmler. Their secret post-WWII circle and network of SS, Nazi and fascist war criminals, murderers, assassins and mercenaries were the most dangerous and ruthless people on the planet.[33]
            </p>
            <p>
             However the De Thibault De Boesinghe is far more deeper, secret and dangerous than just a circle of secret Neo-Nazis, Nazis and SS. They go back at least to the 13th Century of Flanders- Belgium. They are another ancient powerful old European noble family BLOODLINE linked to the “Occult Masonry” of the Isis Mysteries, New Templars, Grand Lodge of The Phoenix of the “Grand Orient de France”, Grand Elected Scottish Knight of the East and Sovereign Prince Rose-Croix.
            </p>

             Paolo Zampolli is using the island nation of the Dominican Republic as a front in the old Masonic Agnelli Family business of running a secret international network of Luciferians, Mafia, SS, Nazis, Fascists, Mercenaries, Criminals, Prostitution and Pedophile rings for the Knights of Malta, CIA, and a Demonic New World Order.

            <p>
             <strong>
              In 2004, ID Models boss Zampolli was exposed as a former business associate/partner of the infamous convicted Pedophile Island financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In 2004, Zampolli and Epstein unsuccessfully tried to buy Elite Model Management at auction. Now, very few if any tie these two figures together in the inner circle of Donald Drumpf,  Bill and Hilary Clinton.

            <p>
             People like Zampolli aren’t in the business of making poor Central European bloc young ladies legitimate models or superstars. He is an old world criminal Luciferian/Masonic pimp– a white slave trafficker. Zampolli manufacture “Executive Whores” for the elite, wealthy, famous, powerful politicians fascists, bureaucrats, master criminals, and world leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
             He does the old fashion DEVIL’s work around the world as the ILLUMINATI Bloodlines have been involved in for generations- evil, crime, corruption, espionage, assassinations and white mail. Nothing but poisonous fruit fall from Zampolli’s tree.
            </p>
            <p>
             He brought Marina out of Milan, Italy to New York where his front, ID Models, paid her rent. A Slovenian magazine, Suzy, investigated Melinia and Zampolli. Their conclusion was Zampolli was a pimp, and she was a Zampolli executive “WHORE.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Zampolli runs an illegitimate international escort racket with stables of mind controlled East European Sex Slaves. He passed down a “sex kitten”  charter from the Old World Ruling Houses of Europe, Knights Templar, and Freemasonry  to Donald Drumpf, Jeffrey Epstein and the Mossad [Ehud Barak].

             , is that it looks like a site designed to make anyone who cites it look like a loon. Nothing is properly sourced, pictures are photoshopped, it's full of crazy, wild-ass claims and is impossible to take seriously. It's one thing to use it as a jumping off point for research leads to corroborate elsewhere, but actually citing it does not add to our body of work here.

              So your calling Rayford Bullock, an ex Black Panther, a REAL Black Panther, who saw what the CIA did to them by placing mentally unstable people into the heart of the organization to compromise it and dissolve it, got out the movement, educated himself and received law degrees...

             <p>
              But your calling his research and testimony "Loony" Dude this guy has been around the block fifty times before you Momma weaned your silly ass from diapers. NONE of you could hold a candle up to this guys work and you belittle it as of little consequence. Thats fine, this forum has shown me there are more than enough idiots that think they have a clue about the breadth of Pizzagate and the Pedocracy  that are SAILING into their own traps that will render you all more useless than you already are. Go ahead and question this guys work to your own peril, he was right in the middle of all of it, I could give a fuck what half you dimwits here think that's why it took me so long to fucking care about this nonsense comment.

                       Oh, Jew.  You faggots are so low-IQ and emotionally compromised, it's hilarious.  You make mistakes constantly, and wonder how goyim figure out you're a Jew without you telling them.

                        A site OWNER or Moderator making those kinds of comments? This is unbelievable, it's no wonder the MSM have a FIELD DAY when Pizzagate gets full exposure. We've been working on a white supremacists site the entire fucking time.

            May she open the way for others to come forward and have the bravory to talk about their abuse.  Epstein needs to Fry.  Getting Epstein opens the way to Noble classes in UK.  Which could open paths to royalty in Europe (UK, Belgium, Im looking intently at you..)

              Come on Vindicator.. you know what that means..
Forget about the UK Pedos, thats the Royals, PIE and BBC, you know that already.  They've hung themselves with their own arrogance and sense of impunity.   We'll get them.  (If the Brits can get their govt back..) 
What does Maxwell REALLY open the doors to?  ...you know you know this..

              Daddy Maxwell's death?  (did he die??) Related to?  What was he called in British Tabloids?  Who does Epstein work for?
