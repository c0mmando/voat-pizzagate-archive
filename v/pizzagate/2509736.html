<p>Zerohedge just published a recap of yesterday\'s Wall Street Journal article (behind pay wall) exposing Tony Podesta\'s demise. Happy Patriots Day! Not only did his &quot;pedovore&quot; art collection cause the breakup of his marriage, refusal to sell cost him his firm. Great read! Lots about the art collection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-19/calamitous-collapse-former-podesta-group-employees-reveal-truth-behind-firms">https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-19/calamitous-collapse-former-podesta-group-employees-reveal-truth-behind-firms</a></p>
<p>Some highlights...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Podesta\'s purchases of artwork behind his wife\'s back reportedly caused Heather Podesta to file for divorce. Tony kept most of his art collection, while Heather received nearly $5 million in retirement savings, homes in Washington and Manhattan, and $4 million paid quarterly over five years.</p>
<p>The [Podesta Group] unraveling was swift. As clients such as Wells Fargo, Wal Mart and Oracle Corp. bailed on the Podesta Group, they death-spiraled into default - as Tony refused to pledge his giant art collection against firm obligations. </p>
<p>With clients leaving, the Podesta Group had no money. Rent was due the next day. One idea was to use Mr. Podesta’s art collection as collateral for a loan, but he refused.</p>
<p>“At that time, it was inadvisable to provide additional guarantees as an individual for the obligations of the corporation,” the Podesta Group’s spokeswoman said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Podesta Group’s chief financial officer sent Mr. Podesta a 7:23 p.m. email: “If we don’t have collateral pledged prior to 5pm tomorrow, we will be in default.” If the firm went into default, the CFO wrote, “we will not be able to meet our rent, your art payments, ad campaigns, and most importantly payroll.”</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Podesta responded: “need list of next 5 layoffs,” among other questions. The next day, he left for an art show in Turin, Italy. The bank’s deadline passed.
On Friday, the firm’s CFO quit. That night, a senior manager sent an email to Mr. Podesta, still in Italy, saying the bank had frozen the firm’s funds.
“This means that we have no way to pay employees,” the email said. “If we do not alert employees immediately that we have no way to pay them for their work, the firm is committing fraud.” -WSJ</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Podesta Group was a nebulous organization with no board oversight and all financial decisions made by Tony Podesta. Carlson’s source said payments and kickbacks could be hard for investigators to trace, describing it as a “highly secret treasure trove.” One employee’s only official job was to manage Tony Podesta’s art collection, which could be used to conceal financial transactions.</p>
<p>The WSJ must have inadvertently left out another factor which may have contributed to Podesta Group clients heading for the hills; a spotlight on Tony Podesta\'s strange artwork which began swirling around the internet during the emergence of the discredited &quot;pizzagate&quot; theory.</p>
<p>Internet sleuths pointed to a June, 2015 issue of &quot;Washington Life&quot; magazine featuring some of Tony Podesta\'s artwork, along with a 2004 Washington Post article entitled Married, With Art - describing how shocked Podesta guests stumbled across pictures of naked teenagers during a house tour.</p>

            This may sound trivial given the gravity and magnitude of the harms revealed in Pizzagate investigations, but I was struck by the fact that when warned that his employees would not be paid unless he offered up his art as collateral, he went overseas to an art show.  I mention this because this entitled attitude fuels all the evil these people do. Tony Podesta did not care if his employees were paid, did not care that gallivanting around buying more art was akin to Nero fiddling as Rome burned.  His entitlement permits him to harm people with impunity, from denying wages he could have paid had he not been a complete psychopath, to possibly rigging elections, to violating children because he considers it his right to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is a scumbag in every element of his life and his belief that he can do whatever he wants to whomever he wants outlines his complete contempt for anyone who is not a part of that group of frightening elites.  In his mind, our money, our democratic freedom, and most importantly, our children, exist to serve him.

            This piece is a total whitewashing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only did they skip the pizzagate, they included this, to spread the idea that Podestas are famous for pizza parties and pizza isn't a code word:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The following night, Mr. Podesta threw himself a birthday party, serving hundreds of guests pizza from a brick-oven stove in his backyard in Kalorama.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It sounds like Mueller may have made him cop a plea for planting Manafort into the Trump campaign:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Early in 2012, Mr. Manafort and his associate Richard Gates, longtime Republican lobbyists, hired the Podesta Group and another firm to lobby on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a nonprofit...In April 2017, the Podesta Group filed a report with the Justice Department acknowledging its work “could be interpreted as principally benefiting a foreign government.” In his February guilty plea, Mr. Gates admitted he had arranged for the Centre to “represent falsely” that it wasn’t supervised by the Ukrainian government.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The article explains the how his lobbying firm was failing, losing clients here and some mistakes there..  But interestingly the banks seemed to have actually foreclosed October 31 2017.  Perhaps Mueller managed to freeze the firm's assets?  Or the banks are following QAnon?  Remember that QAnon announced he was moving on John Podesta November 2.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On Monday, Oct. 30, U.S. prosecutors announced the indictment of Messrs. Manafort and Gates. The indictment alleged the Podesta Group, identified as “Company B,” had worked with them for Ukraine. Mr. Podesta in a staff meeting said he would step back from the firm.
            </p>
            <p>
             The following day, an official with the firm’s new bank, Chain Bridge Bank, demanded $655,000 in cash or collateral within 24 hours—or it would cut the firm’s credit line.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Then Tony attempted to escape the November 2 crackdown by fleeing to Italy:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The next day, he left for an art show in Turin, Italy. The bank’s deadline passed.
...
On Friday, the firm’s CFO quit. That night, a senior manager sent an email to Mr. Podesta, still in Italy, saying the bank had frozen the firm’s funds.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The next week mover's began emptying his art from the offices and staff was let off, all while Podesta was still in Italy.
           </p>
           <p>
            FYI, Add Haley Barbour to the enemies list.  From earlier in the article:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             That night, Mr. Podesta ducked out to a birthday party for former Republican Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who gave him a hug. “He did good quality work,” Mr. Barbour said.
            </p>

             A surviving sister, auntie Evelyn Carres, i notice there is a lot of weird abuse or sexual weird shit in ancient Greek culture, the family chats they seem to obsess with killing swine pigs, slaughtering at 4 am in morn, the mother adopted another 25 people during the time she came to Washington, Podesta used to have a picture of a pig on a spit as his screen saver, but his staffers made him get rid of it, because he said: “They couldn’t stand looking into the pig’s eyes during meetings.” So many weird coincidences, maybe he's not a pedophile, but some local police or interpol or FBI need to start digging, bottom line is all this, maybe he's innocent or guilty, but the election was probably rigged vs Bernie and podesta is a creepy spirit cooking satanic obsessed motherfucker whether the Neo-Liberal Dumbocrats like it or not.

             I once thought all this was crazy conspiracy crap. I like to check stuff online, confirm myself not just tv and I know a lot of general social media reddit, facebook etc while back i started to lurk here on voat, i was warned not to come here, voat was racist, extreme, sexist etc etc With the election rigged against Bernie on reddit/facebook I figured something was up, the censorship of terrorism across Europe and the Orlando Flordia, finally the Donald block from Huffman..i finally said goodbye to reddit. When I first read these pizzagate subs I was going to laugh at how stupid the conspiracy was, expose the whole thing as a bunch of clownish truther ufo tinfoil headed nonsense...after all didn't Alex Jones even say pizzagate was too crazy. After a few weeks and months lurking around, posting some weird things I found myself on Hollywood, the political elite, India, the tv shows like Smallville...I am willing to admit some of the 'pizzagate' thing can be real, it could be very real and this degeneracy, abuse, filth and crime is everywhere. I first came across this Podesta name on a blog and youtube channel, I though perhaps maybe he just has a nasty quirky taste, like a guy watching horror movies, or those weirdo Japanese or French who have an obsession with say i dunno these young looking girls on their shows and movies, or maybe i thought it could be just passing on weird art, maybe there was some weird culture thing i wasn't getting?....there are plenty of movies or art or music I would say ok that's too much, too weird, stuff that I don't like but I'm not one for burning of books or censorship. The conspiracy went deeper but reading more on the conspiracy...When I read more I kind of had to stop reading, it is very very dark, more weird and dark than usual, the Podesta stuff is fucking dark and weird, more than just 'strange' ....next I was thinking ok, he can't really be a sick person? it can't really be abuse can it? These elites and media people and global politicans they can not be that in-your-face with this weird shit can they? .... the more you read, the symbolism in the film and music industry, the Jeffrey Dahmer style crap, that Abramovic bitch, the 'Spirit Cooking' rituals, the Vegas rumors and now all the scandals with Hollywood!? I don't know maybe pizzagate is real after all and I would like to say a thank you to the people who have tried to expose this weird shit...if it turns out to be nothing, well its just internet chat like you get on a site like twitter or 4chan...but if there is any truth at all to abuse, and trafficking and globalist mafia black mail and a world wide network....and if voat users helped expose this sickness, then countless will have a chance to be saved from this system of abuse and evil and the world can be a better place for it. I don't know if Podesta is guilty of anything, my gut feeling is very much like the Benn Swan vid, someone needs to look into this weird shit because something stinks....probably the Left is in freakout mode because they think him going down is the end of the world, most of hollyweird, open borders tv show people like 'Smallville' the Left is probably too deep in bed with the degenerates just as perverts and degenerates were exposed in the Republican party....but that's not the way things work, its an opportunity to house clean and clean out your own backyard, everyone will be the better for it in the end, also the Republicans moved on from Hastert etc However there is also the possibility BOTH parties are involved, Podesta seemed to be pretty high up as a money mover etc Assistant to the President, Staff Secretary and the sick thing is there may not be one government infected, but the crime, abuse and corruption covers multiple governments, religions and media industries across this world. I still don't know 100 % if pizzgate exists but something exists, I could borrow maybe a phrase David Icke might use, a cancerous cold blooded satanic network of abuse. When it comes sexual abuse, corporate greed,  corruption the religions, political elite and the damned entertainment industry is at the top. The Weiner Huma marraige always smelled of bullshit and i'm not sure where the whole deep state crap fits in? blackmailing the ministers and presidents of the world, a cold blooded 'Pedophocracy' or PedoStocracy  ???

              Of course both parties are involved. Both parties are owned by the same secretive group of people. You've only pealed back the outer layer of the onion. metoo movement is a far left movement and ignores the real victims. metoo victimizes all the whores in hollywood. Real metoo is #120DB. Alex Jones and David Icke are controlled opposition shills.  There are many so called truthers that are controlled opposition shills that are only in it for the money.

              History taught is full of lies and omissions. Enemies and friends are not who they seem. Many people can't understand the criminal extent of those in power, because they are too brainwashed by the press and media. Demoralized and filled with lies. Satan is the master of illusion and has tricked the world into worshiping him.

             I doubt it was a hoarding spiral. My guess is that he went to those art sellers to buy some kind of protection from them. Maybe the artworks represent a contract of some sort. Psychopaths are self protecting. You are looking at him from the point of view of someone with emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
             It makes me happy to see that you are a person with a capacity for emotion. It makes me remember there are still good people in the world.

             Would you please be so kind as to hit reply and say anything. You can tell me to fuck off or ANYTHING. I'm just trying to determine if my posts are actually being posted. So far, only shills have told me my account is working correctly, and I've seen a few wonky things lately. Thanks.

               I mean, - Why write an article about this at all? - It's disinformation that can be pointed to when real information starts to surface. I don't know how any of these sick fucks can stand to see their own sick fucking faces in the mirror each day. This woman may have been in a position where she felt trapped. However, if she remained in the situation, either through lack of will or courage; and was party to their sick deeds, then she deserves whatever is coming to her. She knows the jig is up. Tony and John and everyone in their orbit will soon be toast. - She's getting as far away as she can. - Don't be surprised if she ends up dead.

              It sounds like it was a way for him to funnel funds into something other than cash as a safety net, so of course the witch went along with it, that being said, one has to wonder what kind of person would marry someone with that kind of taste in art to begin with.

              I read an article somewhere that they went to his house on their first date, and he made jokes about collecting sculptures of people without heads....

             <p>
              .....I think he already collected this stuff before they met. IIRC, she was his third wife.

                Agree. But I doubt that someone in his 50ties suddenly starts collecting pedo art. He must have been into this before.

              This makes me so fucking angry.  There is no question what the "art work" is among sensible people. These obstructionists should be hanged  along with the rest of these cretins.
