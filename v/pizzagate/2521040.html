            The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek
           </p>
           <p>
            United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12
           </p>
           <p>
            earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the
           </p>
           <p>
            time," said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.
           </p>
           <p>
            "UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in Haiti that
           </p>
           <p>
            existed already beforehand.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market."
           </p>
           <p>
            The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate
           </p>
           <p>
            wake of the quake.

            However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
           </p>
           <p>
            the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of
           </p>
           <p>
            local authorities and relief coordination "to kidnap children and get them out of the country".
           </p>
           <p>
            Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and
           </p>
           <p>
            trafficking in Haiti was "an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and
           </p>
           <p>
            months".
           </p>
           <p>
            The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring
           </p>
           <p>
            Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable."
           </p>
           <p>
            He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations
           </p>
           <p>
            in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.

            A reminder for those who were following closely or new information for those who weren't a very convenient drill was held in Miami 2 days before the earthquake.  Coincidence?  Pre-knowledge?  HAARP event?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A Haiti disaster relief scenario had been envisaged at the headquarters of US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) in Miami one day prior to the January 12, 2010  earthquake.  The holding of pre-disaster simulations pertained to the impacts of a hurricane in Haiti. They were held on January 11, 2010....Upon completing the tests and disaster scenarios on January 11, TISC was considered to be, in relation to Haiti, in “an advanced stage of readiness”. On January 13, the day following the earthquake, SOUTHCOM took the decision to implement the TISC system, which had been rehearsed in Miami two days earlier: “After the earthquake hit on Tuesday [January 12, 2010], Demay said SOUTHCOM decided to go live with the system. On [the following day] Wednesday [January 13, 2010], DISA opened up its All Partners Access Network, supported by the Transnational Information Sharing Cooperation project, to any organization supporting Haiti relief efforts.

            Great question,

            . I found
            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/30/politics/human-trafficking-tip-report-2016/index.html">
             this 2016 report from CNN that said Haiti was getting worse, not better
            </a>
            . It references this 2016 Obama State Department report on
            <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/index.htm">
             Trafficking in Human Persons
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to the U.S. State Department, the report is "the world's most comprehensive resource of governmental anti-human trafficking efforts." It rates 190 nations -- up from last year's 188 with the addition of Libya and Yemen -- on how effectively governments are tackling the human trafficking industry on a scale from the worst on Tier 3 to best on Tier 1.
            </p>
            <p>
             Myanmar, Sudan and Haiti are currently among the worst offenders for human trafficking, according to a new report published today by the U.S. State Department. The three nations were among 27 to be downgraded in this year's annual Trafficking in Persons -- or TIP -- report).
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Maybe the data is buried in the report? There's a 2017 report as well, although I'm not sure the bureaucrats who create it would be different yet, even though it was published after Trump was elected. Might be interesting to compare. I wonder how much of these reports are disinfo?

             Haiti is on page 195, not very encouraging, little to no money to support investigations, it sounds like most stolen children end up as domestics in the country and in the Dominion Republic next door.  You know, blah blah blah.  Very dry reading.  Haiti is such a poor country.  I do like the work Compassion Intl is doing, history proves, societies that take up Christianity, slavery falls by the wayside.

            I found this from Feb 2017
            <a href="http://www.renegadetribune.com/haiti-trafficking-ring-busted-story-not-reported-crime-syndicate-lying-press/">
             http://www.renegadetribune.com/haiti-trafficking-ring-busted-story-not-reported-crime-syndicate-lying-press/
            </a>
            nd again we see the pattern of delayed media reporting on these major pedo trafficking busts. The Haiti pedo bust story finally appeared in Reuters Bogota last Tuesday. The investigation began in December and remains ongoing to uncover the true breadth of the operation that appears to include non-governmental organization and international elements.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note: Reuters (and AP) are wire sources that MSM utilizes. However as of Thursday and just like the Norway bust, this story is not being reported at all in the usual lying press outlets. And once again “by coincidence” the bust took place just after the Clinton Foundation pulled the plug on its Haiti programs. For undetermined reasons Glenn Beck tweeted out that this raid was going down two hours early.
           </p>
           <p>
            As TNN has warned from the beginning, should this be used solely against Trump enemies, then of course the lying press will counter that this is nothing more than a contrived political hit list. Already CNN is framing the situation as a “Trump-Bannon coup in the making.” Last night none other than vivisection art collector John Podesta spoke out about “sinister, vile fake news.” At discussion sites, such as Reddit concerning this topic, large numbers of tell-tale automated social media bots are in disruption, distraction mode. This TNN post at Reddit has been hit by down votes by who or what.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clearly the Crime Syndicate is prepping for a fight. The risk to Trump’s people is that mutual assured destruction dossiers are in place against them as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is AG Sessions the real deal and will he let the chips fall where they may? If he acts and follows through, will he be strongly backed by Trump? Will the busts just be minor, token and just for show? So far today, Trump appears engrossed in his tit-for-tat distractions: (Trump attacks Nordstrom for refusing to sell Ivanka clothing line). We may see soon enough, but count TNN as from the Show Me State. Still, in yet another you can’t make this up “coincidence”, February 9th is National Pizza Day.

               Yeah, reading too much is what caused me to have to take a 4 day rest.  I still am not back full time. This stuff gets to you, as you well know.  I just posted this in the comments

            Well we know for sure that on just 1 flight,  54 children were scheduled to leave Haiti, from the Bresma orphanage. 1 child died prior to flight.

            Then you have Silsby trying to smuggle out 33 kids all at once. So they were exporting more then a few children each time. I doubt we will ever have accurate numbers, and it wouldn't surprise me if the family members/elders, of those children are missing too.

             Yes, and remember when Ed Rendell tried to take kids out of Haiti as well?  They think this well will never run dry.  Now they are going to ravage and plunder and steak the children of Puerto Rico as well.  Sad beyond words.

             THE CLINTON FOUNDATION: ALL ROADS LEAD TO HAITI:
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clinton Foundation has been in operation since 1997. However, the foundation began truly amassing massive power and wealth during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. This accumulation of wealth occurred not only due to the Uranium One Deal but also with the Haitian Earthquake of 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
             In January, 220,000 Haitian people were killed by a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake. The country was completely devastated.
            </p>
            <p>
             On January 22, a charity telethon was promptly formed called “Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief.” It was the most widely distributed telethon in history, amassing a reported $61 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             The hosts of the telethon were George Clooney, Wyclef Jean and Anderson Cooper.
            </p>
            <p>
             It also featured other A list celebrities including:
            </p>
            <p>
             John Legend, Jon Stewart, Leonardo DiCaprio,
            </p>
            <p>
             Matt Damon, Robert De Niro, Ellen Degeneres and Madonna.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even Oprah Winfrey told all of her fans to give as much money as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Together they raised hoards of money for the Clinton Foundation, Bush Foundation, United Nations and the Red Cross.
            </p>
            <p>
             What was supposed to be a grandiose gesture of goodwill turned into one of the greatest robberies of all time. As many celebrities enjoyed the benefits of coordinating with Clinton Foundation for years to come, even joining their “Celebrity Division” with stars including Kevin Spacey, the Haitian people were suffering and dying.
            </p>
            <p>
             Former President Bill Clinton was appointed co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. The total international funds were calculated at approximately $9.04 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Only .6% of the funds went to Haitian organizations. The former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, claims the Clintons kept 97% of the monies owed to the Haitian people.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clinton Foundation was also responsible for assigning contracts for Haiti reconstruction. It was later found these contracts were only assigned to those such as Warren Buffet and Anthony Clinton who contributed large donations to the foundation. There was no reconstruction of Haiti, instead what they received were a handful of mobile homes outlawed in the United States for having carcinogenic properties, Cholera outbreaks, food and water deprivation, and the complete sell out of their country.
            </p>
            <p>
             Additionally the tens of thousands of orphans impacted by the disaster were not given schools and homes as promised. Instead they became one of the largest targets of child traffickers in the world. In fact, on January 29, 2010 (only 7 days after the celebrity riddled telethon) Clinton friend Laura Silsby was arrested at the Haitian border with 9 other co conspirators for attempting to smuggle 33 children out of the country without documentation. CNN later reported this was not the first time Silsby attempted to traffic children out of Haiti. The Clintons intervened immediately. Bill Clinton brokered a deal to get 8 of the other traffickers released. Silsby received a lessened sentence of 6 months jail time.
            </p>

             Once she returned to the states Laura Silsby changed her name to Laura Gayler and now works for Alert Sense, a company in coordination with the Amber Alert system. In February of the same year, Silsby’s lawyer Jorge Puello and his wife, were arrested on the suspicion of leading an international human trafficking ring involving women and minors. He was sentenced to a light sentence of 3 years in federal prison.

             With the horrid reports of the Clinton Foundation crimes in Haiti, Hollywood, Media, Government Officials and donors stayed completely silent. The only public figure to speak boldly against the Clinton Foundation? President Donald Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             Donald Trump repeatedly commented on how the foundation “ripped off Haiti.”
            </p>
            <p>
             After Trump’s historic 2016 win, during the Al Smith Memorial Dinner, he had perhaps one of the best ‘Mic Drop Moments’ of all time:
            </p>
            <pre><code>“Everyone knows of course Hillary’s belief that ‘It takes a village (to raise a child)’ 
</code></pre>
            <p>
             Which only makes sense after all, in places like Haiti...
            </p>
            <p>
             Where she's taken a number of them.”
            </p>
            <p>
             He was met with unprecedented booing from the crowd of elite Hillary supporters, as Clinton shot him a sinister look for daring to speak of her deep ties to child trafficking.
            </p>

             WATCH:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Is it any wonder President Trump has received such vicious hatred from Hollywood, from establishment politicians, from ‘journalists’ and large donors?
            </p>
            <p>
             The massive abuse, robbery, and sex trafficking of the Haitian people seems to have been an open secret within elite circles for years now. No one spoke out, instead they helped perpetuate these crimes. As Trump said: Everyone knows.
            </p>
            <p>
             The take down of the Clinton Foundation alone is enough to permanently cripple The Swamp. From donations by the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, to corrupt Saudi Princes, it’s tentacles have reached all throughout the globe. After Hillary’s devastating 2016 loss, the Clinton Foundation donations have completely dried up. It is clear to see it’s only survival was through a Clinton presidential win.
            </p>
            <p>
             With President Trump’s Executive Orders freezing assets of Human Rights Abusers and his historic battle defeating human traffickers, the foundation is headed towards it’s last lifeline; and the world will be better for it.

              @obedientworker/understanding-pizzagate   Scroll all the way down past the steemit article, past the Ling sisters, and the JP emails and you will see the Ninja Turtles pic and the comment by dr.nwo and his Whip up a Haitian special, extra cheese.  Yes, it was for real.  What a place for a Haitian Pizza Special with extra cheese.  This is sicko.
