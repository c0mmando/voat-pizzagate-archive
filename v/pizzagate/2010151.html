<p>07-07-17   &quot;Work-Life was really sweet this time last year. I was performing my regular closing duties as things wined down on a Saturday night. The late and great Seth Rich was keeping me company as I soaked the bar down in Pine Sol. I believe the topic of conversation was my amazing choice of music that I regularly played on any given day I worked at Lou\'s City Bar : \'Y2K Hits. Seth had amazing taste in music. I probably took a shot or two of Jameson and was floating as I closed down my register. Eric Ruiz and Brooke were heading to Zeba to meet Jimmy Portillo and Johnny most likely, while Katie Goldhammer and Lori Goldhammer were rolling in 30 minutes after I had given last call lol. Meanwhile Bernard Warren was giving me the \'bruh, what are you doing\' stare as I poured them 1 Yueling and 1 Lagunitas. I went home that night happy and a little more financially stable, and was right back there the following Wednesday pouring Lauren L O\'Leary Sauvignon blanc\'s and walking to my car with my work-dad Joe Capone after one of our neighborhood famous half price draft Wednesday nights. I did that same routine for a really good 4 and a half years with so many incredible people I met along the way, Unfortunately, all good things have to eventually come to an end and with new management and a serious lack of homeliness I\'ve decided to end my run at Lou\'s. It was real about a year ago, and now it\'s no longer fun to be behind that bar. So much love to my Lou\'s crew and family. Eric L Kane D.j. Donatelli Patrick Scott Cullen Lauren Tavar Karen Kassekert Virginia Hopkins Jessica Elaine Francis Keller Alice Sadler Sean Callahan Ron Vest Michael Crockett Larry Holden Elisabeth Warren Jessy Leigh Mason Raquis Da\'Juan Petree &amp; all the other people I can\'t fit in this status ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ you are apart of my story and I have so much love and light for each of you.

<p>Her post did not mention that she was there on the exact same day of his death, but just that about this time last year Seth was giving her company while they were closing. I searched through more of her FB posts and found out she actually WAS there the night of his death and talked to him. She made the post on July 11th the following day after his death. <a href="http://archive.is/vW4l9">http://archive.is/vW4l9</a></p>
<p>07-11-16   &quot;A Couple of weeks ago I was having a conversation with one of my favorite regulars about settling down, having children, and getting comfortable... We discussed growing up in the 90s and how it\'s overwhelming to believe we are legit \'adults\' now... He talked about marrying his girlfriend and what religion they would raise their children... We talked about so many things involving the future. I saw him last night for the very last time shortly before he was murdered on his way home from my job... Life is so unpredictable and so unfair. With everything going on in the world right now, it\'s so important to make people feel good whatever chance you get. Rest In Peace to one of the most genuine guys, I was fortunate to have known. Save a seat at the bar for me Seth.&quot;</p>
<p>I know others have gotten info that they were broken up and that Joel Rich was lying about their almost being engaged, but this post she made was on July 11th and Denise seems to be very genuine. So if Kelsey and Seth had been broken, it would have only been just for a couple weeks, if two weeks prior, Seth is talking about marrying Mulka and settling down. So maybe its true that he was depressed at the bar over his GF like early reports mentioned. </p>
<p>She goes on to mention that she saw him there at the bar shortly before his murder. Later on the 11th she made another Seth Rich post. <a href="http://archive.is/FWtA6">http://archive.is/FWtA6</a> and then a few days later another <a href="http://archive.is/jq8dP">http://archive.is/jq8dP</a>.</p>
<p>Denise seemed to really care about Seth. I wonder if she has any info to help with the case or if she has spoken with police, as she was one of the workers there that night who saw him. As genuine as her care seems for Seth, perhaps she is willing to give info on what she knows. She also listed the names of the employees who worked with her a year ago...so perhaps one of these folks knows something else that hasn\'t been uncovered yet. If ya\'ll can find out any other information, please be sure to share.</p>',

            As for his relationship, I do not believe they were broken up.  I believe they were arguing about him taking a new job on the Clinton Campaign which would have meant moving to Brooklyn.  She didn't want to move with him.

             Yup. Very odd to see people pushing the theory he's alive and lous is a CIA front.

            <p>
             Arguing about his new out of town job is very likely and isn't far fetched at all. Explains the accounts from employees at Lous who said he was depressed. Would explain the long phone calls to mulka afterwards too.

              Have you guys been keeping up with George Webb and Jason Goodman's reportage?  One consensus is that the parents of Seth Rich are not acting like how parents of a dead child would act.  They are all, "yeah we don't really need closure thanks...stop helping....we know he was murdered but like let's get over it already and honor his memory and not ask any more questions about the murderers...kthanx"

              This is not how humans work sorry.  It's how mkultra victims work (

              Anyway, oh.  And the autopsy report.  Lots of things dont add up and there's clearly a campaign of STFU going on about it.  That is not typical--that is a cover up for certain.

              The facts point to all of us not knowing definitively if he is dead.

            What "MURDER?"  Sans a DEATH CERTIFICATE and an AUTOPSY REPORT, there is NO DEATH, let alone a "murder."

           <p>
            NO HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION BEGINS WITHOUT THESE DOCUMENTS.  Ergo, this is a complete waste of time.

            Interesting but still isn't hard proof Seth Rich is dead. When you mix that with the fact Lou's Bar is a CIA cut-out then any claim in this post needs to be taken with a grain of salt.

            That could be taken either way. If they faked his death then they'd have him be seen immediately before his murder wouldn't they?

             I agree. My gut tells me her post is sketchy. First and last names of those who were there? Touching on his "near engagement"?  Religion? This screams manipulation.

             Matt couch and his team went to D.C. and spoke to the Medical Examiner. The director of communications Leshon Beamon emailed them the cause and manner of death listed on the death certificate. So at this time, i'm pretty confident he is dead.

               So you think the Medical Examiner and now the Communications Director are involved in the cover up? You know...the more people involved in a cover up, the higher chance someone's cover is blown. If your putting a hit on someone, you want the least amount of people to know about it. You think they faked his death and got medical examiners, directors, the people at the funeral, etc...all sat in a room to plot out how to fake a death? Cmon. Yes, I'd like to see the death certificate, but lets be real...we know the family is not gonna release it. And because he doesn't release it, doesn't mean we should all assume he is alive. Not knocking what you believe. If you want to follow the path that he is alive...what proof have you found? There is more proof out there that he is actually dead, then there is of him being alive. Just saying.

                Yes, let's be real. It shouldn't be hard to see a physical death certificate. The fact none has been produced is all I need to know.

                Regarding your disbelief at the government lying I'd suggest you read up on the Smith-Mundt "Modernization" Act of 2012 which literally allows the U.S. Government to literally lie to the American people, staging hoax shootings is easily justified legally.

                 It shouldn't be hard? Have you heard of HIPAA? Officials bound by HIPPA laws can't just willingly go and share death certificates with the public, for their peace of mind.

                 Honest question, aside from the death certificate not being produced, what evidence have you seen that shows he is alive?

                  Does HIPAA apply in cases of Fraud or Crime? Since Seth was shot and injuries caused by an unknown assailant, HIPPA may not apply.

                  The biggest piece of evidence for me is the brother laughing through the interview immediately after Seth Rich's death.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then there's the possibility Hillary and Podesta didn't know who the real leaker was but still needed to make an example of someone. So they chose Seth and told him they were going to fake his death.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also there's the British consular official that supposedly Seth Rich met. No one in the British government should be trusted. Full Stop.

                   I agree the brother laughing was odd. But isn't proof of Seth being alive in any way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The other stuff you mentioned sounds like a real stretch. Saying Seth is alive because he met a British consular official is just way out there. Sorry. If you can prove something I'd back you up. But just cuz he met a british official is in no way evidence of his being alive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And for them to say hey Seth let's fake your death. We need you to go into hiding the rest of your life.  We'll also need to coordinate with All the first responders, doctors, the funeral home, etc., and we want to do this all to prove a point to anyone who may want consider leaking in the future. Do you mind going into hiding forever?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Sounds a bit much. Like I said, if your gonna take someone out, you want the least amount of people involved. The more people involved the greater a chance there is at something slipping from someone. Just sounds too unrealistic. Can't imagine Seth loving America as much as he did and then being cool with never showing his face here again just to please Clinton and Podesta.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    It's enough for me. I saw the same thing with the Sandy Hook parents. No sane person is going to laugh at a moment like that.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I know a guy who couldn't stand his brother. He would go on for hours about what a piece of shit his brother was. Then one day his brother died, he fell of a roof. The same guy was inconsolable for months. I couldn't believe it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The brother laughing means Seth Rich is alive. There's no question in my mind.

                     I just personally feel that a statement from the Director of Communications from the Department of Forensic science confirming the homicide and the funeral that was held, has more merit than...His brother laughed, so Seth must certainly be alive. I mean we all know people handle deaths differently.  A brother laughing, while odd, is not proof of anything. I've seen family laugh in the days after a death. For all we know, the cameraman tripped and fell over and he inadvertently laughed. Either way...dead or alive...I hope the truth comes out soon.

                      Fair enough. Just to be sure you're not a shill what is your take on Sandy Hook? Was it real or a Smith-Mundt 2012 mass shooting hoax designed to tilt public opinion towards an assault weapons ban.

                       Sandy hook was staged in my opinion. Robbie Parker was waaay more unusual than Aaron rich. He literally was laughing with a cocky look and says "We ready to start" or something similar. The "We need to talk about Sandy Hook" video and Wolfgang Halbig and his hearings, really woke me to all the oddities that lead me to really believe this was entirely staged. The pushing gun control couldn't have been any more obvious than this 2 minute video.

                       , where the asshole talks about how his young little daughter was upset she didn't get to tell Obama that she had hoped "legislation could be passed to where only military and police officers could own guns". Can't get any more obvious than that. What 8 year old girl understands the concept of passing legislation and I highly doubt she came up with the idea of military and officers owning guns only. Absolutely ridiculous.

                        I'm prepared for the worst. As in I think the 100% Truth is going to be absolutely unfathomable. We're only seeing maybe %50 of the real story. I'm 100% convinced of that.

                   For me, it's the ping at the abandoned hospital and the fact that we don't know where he was between 1:30am and 4:19 am. Oh, and the lack of investigation by police, and the witness who said Seth was walking to the ambulance and didn't know he was shot. It doesn't add up.
