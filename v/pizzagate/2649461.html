            I remember that episode of h3h3. The original footage has been removed but I remember parts of it that remided me of code signals.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of these happened in the 2nd mentioned, but original footage video
           </p>
           <p>
            dont take my take on it too serious, but we have to consider anything to understand crazy people:
There was a scene (I cant remember well) where they animated a moving ship over real footage. It didnt fit to any of the story and felt pretty random like everything else, unless it means shipping something/someone? 
another animation was a rocket flying, written on it: A++  (maybe blood type?)
The open house-stands certainly mean something, maybe thats where the "trading" happens?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also big factor: Ethan and Moe B. used to be pranksters and all of a sudden they change to kids channels without even changing their previous channel name?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think someone approached them(cause they had lots of subscribers), offered them lots of money which they couldnt refuse and these clowns followed their video instructions. The fact that they didnt even put music over the raw talking footage makes me think it was very important that the video was available in due time. The amount of money they received was bigger than their reputation among their previous fans.
