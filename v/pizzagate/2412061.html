            This is true... I will never ever forget getting a random email on my "aol" account about 15 years ago... I was young and traumatized by this email! I'll never forget it. I opened and it said "It's Emily's 5th birthday and guess what she's getting" it took you to a website that I refused to click on... I will never get that email out of my head though... 15 years later... long story short, I called my local police, they didn't care. I called the FBI and forwarded the email and never heard anything. I called AOL and they told me to "block the sender." After calling about 4 people I realized no one cared and no one wanted to deal with it... it was quite shocking to me because I was REALLY UPSET at getting this email. I wanted that little girl saved. I still think about that poor child. THIS is why I am here. THIS is why I will NEVER give up on exposing this.

            This is why I think there's a bit of state backlash against online vigilante paedo-hunter groups.

            I spotted an ad on craigslist that clearly had noted pedophilia and child abuse. I called 911, spoke to 3 people. Spent 30 minutes on the phone and they wouldn't even look at the ad, or take a report. It's discouraging.

               most people just give up, that's what the police wanted you to do, give up.
Please, that's her job right???  I'm sorry she treated you that way.
Now you know better.
I had a similar experience, we would not let it go, the police caved and then listened.....

                I guess your right should've got their names. l was just baffled, shocked. After telling 3 people what needed to be done, I as told no and trying to talk to them got me no where. I wonder if I am able to get that info since 911 is recorded.

               ,
              </p>
              <p>
               I have a friend who reported a pedophile ad from Craigslist. This was from a number of years ago from before Craigslist was forced to clean up their sex ads.
              </p>
              <p>
               He showed it to me, it was super blatant. It was a female pedophile saying she was visiting the city on business and wanted to have sex with a "tadpole" which is a term in the female pedophile community for an underage boy.
              </p>
              <p>
               He actually took the ad to his local police station, and the cop who took the report agreed it looked pretty bad, so he gave him the number of the detective at police headquarters who was in charge of the vice department.
              </p>
              <p>
               The detective took a report on the, but said it was unlikely he would do anything about it. His reasons:
              </p>
              <p>
               1) Budget cuts. He already had lost 1 staff member because of reduced funding, and he said his officer assigned to pedophile cases already had his hands full with local cases, and trying to coordinate a case of someone coming from out of town would cost even more, and reduce the time the officer had for his current case load.
              </p>
              <p>
               2) Unlikely prospects for successful prosecution. He said while he didn't like the fact, it is true that it's very hard to prosecute a female pedophile without the cooperation of parents (like cases where parents report a schoolteacher who commits pedophilia.) He said some people don't even believe female pedophiles exist, and if the case goes before a jury, and they don't have a cooperating witness who's an adult, the woman is very likely to get off. His budget was dependent on getting successful prosecutions, and he couldn't spend money on a case where the prospects for success were low.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyways, even though my friend couldn't get anything to happen, I think his approach of going to the police department and finding out who was responsible for pedophile cases was a good one.

                Great advice. This was a few weeks ago. I think I may try to find it again. I may have screen captured it. It's not in this jurisdiction, but I am going try 
anyway.

            We should have thought of this... didn’t something like this come up? Please don’t tell me that all we got is Craig sawyer, sheriff arraigo and trey goody...
