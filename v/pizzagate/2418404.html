<p>Thanks to Letourneau (and if it wasn\'t her, it would have been somebody else), laws are changing across the country for pedophiles, and it is a nightmare.  For the purpose of this post, the highlight is on Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Letourneau\'s expertise had to have been relied upon 100% by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.  A Brief of Appellees was filed on 11/01/13 holding that PA\'s Sexual Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was unconstitutional as it applies to juveniles.  Prior to 2012, children convicted of sex offenses in PA were not required to register as sex offenders.  With the adoption of SORNA, PA now requires children &quot;as young as 14&quot; adjudicated of certain sexual offenses to register as sex offenders for the rest of their lives (as it should be)!.  Appellees successfully challenged the constitutionality of SORNA as applied to children.  Reading this legal brief is sickening.
 This case was before the Court as a matter of exclusive jurisdiction on appeal from an Order of the Court of Common Pleas in York County, PA, Juvenile Division.  The Trial Court held PA\'s SORNA statute unconstitutional as applied to children, both retroactively and prospectively.  Appellees were adjudicated delinquent for qualifying offenses when they were children and retroactively registered as sex offenders under SORNA.  Letorneau\'s name is all over the brief.  Here is a small portion of her &quot;expert&quot; opinions:</p>
<p>&quot;As is all too common with juvenile sex offenders, lives have been marred by tragedies, traumas, addictions, abuse, and personal victimization.  Fortunately, as is also common with juvenile offenders, they have demonstrated a great capacity and willingness to rehabilitate and make better lives for themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Children who commit sex offenses are also different from their adult counterparts.  The belief that \'sex offenders are a very unique type of criminal\' is false as to juveniles.  Unlike adult offenders, children\'s motivations are rarely sexual in nature.  Rather, children \'tend to offend based on impulsivity and sexual curiosity...\'  With maturation, a better understanding of sexuality, and decreased impulsivity, most of these behaviors stop.&quot; <br />

<p>On 08/15/16, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court came to a &quot;logical&quot; decision - Two or moe convictions must stem from multiple acts to trigger lifetime registration requirement.

<p>Additionally, on 10/31/17 the PA Superior Court ruled that the methodology or &quot;framework&quot; used to designate individuals as Sexually Violent Predators (SVP\'s) under the State\'s SORNA laws is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The same arguments used to convince society to embrace and normalize homosexuality are now being used for pedophilia.  The changes in state laws are focusing on &quot;juvenile&quot; pedophilia...for now.  Bumping up the age from there is probably inevitable, and creating more &quot;juvenile&quot; pedophiles can now be deemed as a fact.</p>',

            Juveniles get away with.murder, literally. What makes you think rape is any different? The system is designed to protect criminals (HRC). The fight is not going to won without bloodshed, too many pedos are in high places protecting each other. We need military intervention because the cops who are supposed to stop it, are part of it.
