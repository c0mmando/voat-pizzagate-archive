<p>..There\'s a growing number of computer apps inviting children to program their own games, or modify them. For the first time however, MIT Media Lab with funding from the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, has launched a software game and free iPad app called ScratchJr which facilitates programming for five year olds.</p>
<p>MIT Media Lab <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and former MIT President Jerome Wiesner, and is housed in the Wiesner Building (designed by I. M. Pei), also known as Building E15. The Lab has been written about in the popular press since 1988, when Stewart Brand published The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at M.I.T., and its work was a regular feature of technology journals in the 1990s. In 2009, it expanded into a second building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>..The Lab\'s primary funding comes from corporate sponsorship. Rather than accepting funding on a per-project or per-group basis, the Lab asks sponsors to fund general themes; sponsors can then connect with Media Lab research. <strong>Specific projects and researchers are also funded more traditionally through government institutions including the NIH, NSF, and DARPA</strong>. Also, consortia with other schools or other departments at MIT are often able to have money that does not enter into the common pool.</p>

            US State Department Special Agent Kurt Smolek was murdered 2 years sgo and his body was dumped in the Potomic river.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although never officially  acknowledged, Agent Smolek had just returned from an overseas investigation - supposedly in Phnom Penh  - conducting an investigation on the matters described in the above post.

            The intimate involvement of so many American "elites" in government, business, academia in these child sexploitation affairs is widespread and profoundly evil.
