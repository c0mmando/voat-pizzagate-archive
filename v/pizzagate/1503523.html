            Because he knew Obama would get a full 8 years since we've never cut a President's term short during war.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did he run for president in 2000? According to you shills it was right in the heat of his activities and prior to disconnecting from Epstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kinda throws a wrench in your shillful submissions.

            The Democrats and the left are funded by Goldman Sachs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump's victory was in response to what the left was doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is backed by Goldman Sachs and ended up putting Goldman Sachs appointees in charge of the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Goldman Sachs created a problem, and then they gave us their solution, which was Trump and then Trump gave Goldman Sachs even more power and control over the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            See how it works? Simple as pie.

            Now first of all I assume you dismiss the claim that Zionist Jews control society. I don't want to get hung up on this too much but I'll at least preface everything I'm saying by showing you what I'm talking about. Take a look at everything they control, keeping in mind that Jews are a tiny minority (2% of the population) and network heavily with each other. The Jewish elite are almost one group.
           </p>
           <p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now here's an article that was written by a Jew named David Brooks who's the top political analyst for the New York Times where he admits that Jews have supplanted the Anglo Saxon elites and now control America. This article was published in the New York Times.

            Keep in mind that there are literally countless documented admissions made by prominent Jews claiming they control Western civilization. If you do your research you'll see that many prominent Jews flat out admit that their people control Western civilization. How about Jewish banker James Warburg,
           </p>
           <p>
            "He gained some notice in a February 17, 1950, appearance before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in which he said, "We shall have world government, whether or not we like it. The question is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest."

            Joe Biden thanks Jews for giving us multiculturalism, feminism, gay rights,civil rights, immigration, and for shaping America's culture with their control of the media.

            You must understand that those who print the money control politics and therefore society, and that those who control media will control culture which shapes and molds how a populous thinks and acts ( or fails to act). A very small group of tribalist Jews (Zionists) control both of these things. They hold global banking and media monopolies. A private group of tribalist Jews invent money out to thin air and loan to governments at an interest . There's nothing Federal about the Federal Reserve. It's a private institution that has been run by Jews for the last 40 years. They control the manufacturing and distribution of wealth which gives them almost unlimited power and resources. Money is power and they print it. I implore you to do your own research into this because I'm barely scraping the surface.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bankers understand the cyclical nature of politics and have given us a false revolution to retain their grip on power. They are the controlled opposition. It's called full spectrum control/dominance. Trump was nothing more than a false revolution to restore faith in the system that the same elites still control.

            Trump's pick to head the Treasury is a Jewish Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager and Hollywood producer ( was also employed by Soros and Hollywood media firms) and produced the movie " The Accountant". His father was also a Goldman Sachs banker and his grandfather was a diamond dealer.

  The fake news shitstorm proves it.
