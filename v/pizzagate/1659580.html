            In June 1998 Lawrence Vander Esch asked a young male employee, John Doe #1, if he would be willing to donate
a sample of semen for a scientific research project.1 Doe #1 was promised fifty
dollars for a successful donation, and he agreed to the procedure.2 Vander Esch
showed Doe #1 his own penis "to make him feel comfortable." Vander Esch then
put a condom on Doe #1, and when the procedure was finished he "milked" the
penis to "get out all the semen," then took the condom off.3 He tied the condom,
and put it on ice, stating it would be sent to a laboratory for testing.4 He later told
Doe #1 his sperm count was not high enough for him to be paid for the sample.5
Similar circumstances occurred on a second occasion with Doe #1, and on two
occasions with John Doe #2, who was also a young male employee at the
restaurant. Vander Esch was never authorized by any scientific body to collect
human semen samples. The victims indicated they would not have consented to
these sex acts if they had known no legitimate research project existed.

             At various times Vander Esch represented he was authorized to collect semen
samples by the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, or the Sioux County Public
Health Nurse. Vander Esch indicated human sperm samples were required for "prostate"
cancer research.
2 One victim was promised $30,000 for something "[he did] every day"; He was shown
a cash register receipt and told Vander Esch could set up direct tuition payments.
3 Vander Esch explained to the victims that he had worked for the Sioux County Public
Health Nurse and was specially trained to apply and remove a "collection device". He
explained that he needed to be present during the procedure to prevent air exposure to
the semen sample during removal of the condom and to "certify" the identity of the
donor.
4 In one instance, Vander Esch and a victim drove to the University of Iowa Hospitals
where Vander Esch went through the motions of carrying a semen sample into the
hospital. The victim stayed in the car and was informed Vander Esch had deposited the
sample for evaluation.
5 It is clear no one was ever paid, and that Vander Esch told all the victims their sperm
counts were too low to qualify for payment. He urged the victims to try again and
advised them they could achieve higher sperm counts if they were willing to let someone
else perform the procedure on them.

            I made a thread about it already, the must stop for candidates is a known thing called the Pizza Ranch Circuit. Check it out.  The FOUNDER of Pizza Ranch was convicted of molesting 15 boys that worked at his Pizza Ranch locations over the course of 19 years. Hes out now a judge vacated his sentence so he got let loose with no record or anything, didn't even register as a pedo.
