            None of these predictions ever come true. It's all wishful thinking. The reality is everyone is afraid to rock the boat. New York firemen knew the Twin Towers were brought down in controlled demolitions but they were afraid to speak up and go after Guiliani and Bush and Cheney. People are cowards when they need to be heroes. The good news is those cowardly First Responder Assholes in NYC are now all dying of cancer from breathing in the toxic fumes at Ground Zero. Serves them right for being such pussies.

            Think they'd really like to leak this full story but will it actually happen?
They have 50 years of investigations which have been stopped any time they actually had the names.

             Friend of mine just interviewed John Dean, it's on facebook. Don't know if we'll ever get to the bottom of that (the break-in), I've read Stone and Russ Baker on it. Too many opinions. Dunno. I'll ask my friend but have lost interest really.
            </p>
            <p>
             Supposedly Dean's wife was a high-priced call-girl and it had to do with that but I haven't heard the new interview. I wouldn't be surprised if it had to do with a pedo trafficking ring, as you say, considering the Franklin scandal. Others say it had to do JFK assassination info. Nixon was paranoid for a reason.

              Nixon was paranoid because he had a great deal to be paranoid about -- he was a criminal, pedophile.
Fiona Barnett/Australia was a victim who relates her experiences with Nixon

              Watergate isn't stuck in time, it's a crime that points to crimes before and afterward which is reason enough to be interested.
All of the White House tapes were made in duplicate by the Secret Service and Congress would have known that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's some of what Rotstein is pointing to ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be once cause for the break in.  In earlier times, LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress.   Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress.

              The authors there again say that they turned information about the hack-able electronic voting machines over to the DNC when they visited there before the Watergate break-in, but Larry O'Brien, Director of DNC was away at the time and they left the info for him.

              Book written by two brothers who happened to be journalists in Florida (Votescam) in the late 1960's when the computer voting machines began to come in there.  The large computer used by MSM came in about 1965 and gave them new powers to announce winners and losers based on 1% or even less of the vote being counted.  Previously, they were only permitted to report votes actually counted.  Coincidentally one of the brothers had run for election at that time in Florida.  And they were already quite familiar with the many ways that any machine that counts votes can be manipulated.

              I doubt very much that there ever was a Nixon "Southern Strategy" but that the computer voting machines were created to keep the right wing in power here.  Both Germany and Ireland have dumped these machines.  Germany called them "Un-Constitutional."

              Nixon, of course, benefited from a number of assassinations and was involved in coup on JFK.

              And even beyond the Bobby Bakker/LBJ days, this idea of blackmailing politicians isn't new and sex would have always been an easy way to do it.  Actually, I think there's an article on the history of that up on Voat right now, isn't there?

               Thanks for this, lots of info. What I meant by losing interest ... there's so much other stuff I'm looking into. Fact is, I will never really lose interest, because, as you say, it points forward and backward. I'd like to read those books. I have FBook friends who were involved w/ the JFK assassination so Watergate always comes up.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dunno if Nixon was a pedo, I did listen to the testimony of the woman in the video. Fetzer himself doesn't believe Nixon was into sex so much as other things, others of Nixon's friends say the same, so I'm on the fence. Not to say they didn't entrap him some way in this regard.
              </p>
              <p>
               I listened to the detective interview, months ago, I need to hear it again, I like him. I am aware of Nixon's involvement in the JFK hit. I think he was with pepsi-cola at the time, he was in Dallas when it happened, Prescott Bush's lapdog, some people don't know that Jack Ruby actually worked for Nixon.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't know if there's something up on Voat right now, can't keep up! I am familiar of course with Ballot Box 13. What a wonderful system we have. Now if I can only find the time to read those books you mention. Sigh. Thanks much for this info/leads.

                Hi bopper --
In the end, any search becomes a circle where you eventually end up getting to every subject and when it comes to corruption it is all related.
You'll find if you look at Nixon there are trails everywhere -- to Huston Plan which mimics Operation Northwoods by Joint Chiefs.
Something you should be familiar with which involved a false flag activity to create an excuse to bomb Cuba
                <a href="https://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylc=X3oDMTFiN25laTRvBF9TAzIwMjM1MzgwNzUEaXRjAzEEc2VjA3NyY2hfcWEEc2xrA3NyY2h3ZWI-?p=Operation+Northwoods&amp;fr=yfp-t&amp;fp=1&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8">
                 https://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylc=X3oDMTFiN25laTRvBF9TAzIwMjM1MzgwNzUEaXRjAzEEc2VjA3NyY2hfcWEEc2xrA3NyY2h3ZWI-?p=Operation+Northwoods&amp;fr=yfp-t&amp;fp=1&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                But the Huston Plan was created to carry out the same kind of false flag activity in case Nixon thought he had to cancel the 1972
election should he think he was going to lose.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's up to you what you believe of what victims say.  I for one certainly believe Fiona Barnett one of the strongest witnesses I'm aware 
of.  Kind of akin to the female witness in Belgium
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uOrEtOUZDA">
                 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uOrEtOUZDA
                </a>
                The Dutroux case in Belgium is another where those involved used media to confuse the public and cause them to doubt witnesses.
               </p>
               <p>
                Nixon was a homosexual,  involved with Bebe Rebozo at the least -- a Mafia fixer
                <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/27/richard-nixon-had-gay-affair_n_1171557.html">

               </p>
               <p>
                As I've just recommended to someone else, you should see Madelaine Brown videos on YouTube 
in particularly her report on the Clint Murchinson meeting the evening before JFK assassination.
But all of her videos fill in details about the kind of people we are dealing with and information about events.

               <p>
                I'll try to find the Voat thread which I saw yesterday which shows how sex has long been used to compromise politicians.
Nice day here so going out right now.  Try to look through the threads.
               </p>
               <p>
                You don't have to read the books -- you'll find summaries on line.  But info I gave you is foundation of it all.
Always look at these things from highest perspective you can get to.
               </p>
               <p>
                Look, right now you're watching Trump put Wall Street reps in charge of agencies regulating Wall Street.
It's that way down the line.
When they could no longer blackmail politicians using adultery, they moved to pedophilia and that was a long time ago.
You also have to look at corruption of military which is being used for drug running, human trafficking/organ trafficking.
               </p>
               <p>
                They operate by corrupting government in every way they can -- putting pedophiles in charge, but always the most 
corrupt officials they can find, ready to do anything for them.  That's how we got the Supreme Court we have -- look at
Clarence Thomas - a pervert on the Supreme Court.  They're all compromised in one way or another -- or with strong
corporate allegiance $$$.

I know a lot of what you mention but your info will help fill the holes. Enjoy your day, it's nice here too! I'm trying to read "Mary's Mosaic" and "Devil's Chessboard" right now, also looking forward to David Lifton's new JFK autopsy discoveries.

                 <p>
                  For decades I read something like 200 library books of non-fiction and tried to keep notes/journals on what I was reading.
Been trying to read Devil's Chessboard as I already knew a good deal about Dulles (and James Jesus Angleton) and CIA.
But my tolerance for reading about corruption right now went over the edge with "Devil's Chessboard."  I've had to take a
break on reading it as the evil just spills out of it.  I'm familiar with "Mary's Mosaic" and have read a lot about it, but not 
actually read the book.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Tell me what you find in Lifton's new book --
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Autopsy records showed that neck wound was a wound of entrance which had NO OUTLET.
It was thought that the bullet may have fallen down into the chest cavity -- but it didn't exit out of the back of the neck or anything 
like that.  Also thought that it might have been a poison dart/frozen which would only have left a small red mark difficult to find.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The back wound was at the level of JFK's right shoulder blade and also had NO OUTLET.
It was thought that that bullet probably fell out of his body.  As I recall it the depth of the entrance wound was probably less than an
inch.  These wounds were repeatedly probed and there was NO OUTLET for either.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The head wound was to the right temple as made clear by Malcolm Killduff and here's a search page on his press conference...
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=malcolm+kilduff+press+conference">
                   https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=malcolm+kilduff+press+conference
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Notice that in NONE of those photos do you see Malcolm Kilduff pointing to his right temple -- that's because they have from day
one very obviously been trying to wash away this evidence.  I'll try to find the one where he explains where the wound is to the
right temple and he actually points to it on his own head.  But like with YouTube when this video has ever been shown on TV the
part where that happens is cut.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This was a press conference where Kilduff reported JFK's death and pointed to the wound in his right temple, almost at the hairline,
which existed out the back right side of JFK's head, creating a huge gaping wound there.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Kilduff was Assistant Press Secretary to JFK.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Shot came from right side/picket fence area of Grassy Knoll -- or fired from a sewer/drain opening near the picket fence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They had already had to abort at least two or three attempts to assassinate JFK (one in Miami where Milteer was recorded making clear
that JFK would be shot by rifle hit and "patsy" would be found ... think Sullivan was name of guy who taped him and passed on to FBI).
Think the other was Chicago and can't remember the third at this point -- but they weren't about to let him get out of Dallas alive.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If the video of Kilduff point to this temple to show where the bullet entered JFK still exists on YouTube I will try to find it for you...
but if you're not seeing a Kilduff video where he is pointing to the wound in the president's temple, then you are seeing a lie.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  OK -- this one is OK
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHQ4EoDZKdg">
                   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHQ4EoDZKdg
                  </a>
                  though I tend to recall that the video goes on after that and in this one it happens
at end of the video.  There were a number of films taken at the press conference from different angles.  This video is rather shaky and unclear.
There is a video in color which is quite clear and records the entire event -- including Kilduff pointing to his temple.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  OK here's another one which not only shows you Kilduff pointing to where the bullet entered JFK's head at the right temple/near hairline,
but it also explains how the video has often been shown in an edited form to lie to the public about where the president was hit.
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O41R8lxWvP8">
                   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O41R8lxWvP8
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So far, that's two that lie and two which tell the truth.

            The high level law enforcement officials who are not RAPING CHILDREN AND HARVESTING THEIR ORGANS need to step up to the fucking plate on this NOW and dump the final batch of Clinton emails.  This is getting ridiculous, their are LITERALLY CHILDREN'S LIVES ON THE LINE. These officials need to take a long hard look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves what side of history they want to be on when all this goes down.  Do the right thing!

            I'll believe it when I start seeing those leaks. And, honestly, I don't know why more non-pedo police and feddies don't do this. They have to be sick that nothing's being done and that Comey is dicking around chasing non-existent Russian spies when children are being raped.

             And you think somebody acting goofy in a video and making up unproven accusations with his unproven sources, showing no material, is credible. You are a liability to the rest of us.

            I have an ex police chief friend who went through some of the FBI training/boot camp but he quit 'cause he "didn't want to be turned into a robot," but I think he just couldn't hack it. Anyway, the point is, he was an OK family man guy.
