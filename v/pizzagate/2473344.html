<h1>Hillary\'s 30,000 Fans Are Her \'\'CULT\'\' Following</h1>
<p>A purported pyramid-scheme operator who was run out of Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor has reinvented himself as the head of an upstate group accused of being a “cult” – and his devotees have pumped thousands into Hillary Rodham Clinton‘s presidential run.</p>
<p>Executives and top associates of the Albany-based NXIVM group – along with their family members – donated $29,900 to Clinton’s presidential campaign, according to federal records.</p>
<p>On March 14 and April 13, records show, more than a dozen contributions poured into Clinton’s coffers from NXIVM, an executive and group-awareness training organization led by Brooklyn-born Keith Raniere, 47.</p>
<p>Most were from first-time political donors, each giving the $2,300 maximum.</p>
<p>The revelation comes on the heels of the arrest of Norman Hsu, who raised $1.5 million in campaign contributions for the Clintons and other Democrats, even though he was technically a fugitive from fraud charges in California.</p>
<p>Hsu jumped bail in early September but was nabbed and is currently locked up in California. ...</p>
<p>Three of the March and April Clinton pledges came from Raniere’s most high-profile followers: Seagram heiresses Clare and Sara Bronfman, and Pamela Cafritz, daughter of D.C. A-listers Buffy and Bill Cafritz.</p>
<p>Cafritz shares a condo with Raniere.</p>
<p>The Bronfman sisters are also deeply involved with NXIVM and, according to a 2003 article in Forbes magazine, have loaned millions to the group and provided use of their jet.</p>
<p>Their father, Edgar Bronfman Sr., once took NXIVM classes but soon severed ties, telling Forbes, “It’s a cult.”</p>
<p>The Clinton campaign downplayed the significance of the NXIVM-related contributions.</p>
<p>“Over 100,000 people from across the country have contributed to Sen. Clinton’s campaign for change, and regardless of who supports her, she will always continue to stand up for what she feels is right,” said campaign spokesman Blake Zeff.</p>
<p>Hillary isn’t the only Clinton NXIVM officials are attracted to.</p>
<p>At least three of them – group President Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters – are members of Bill’s charitable organization, the Clinton Global Initiative. Membership is by invitation only and requires at least a $15,000 donation per person for one year.</p>
<p>NXIVM spokesman Frank Roberts told The Post the organization doesn’t have a presidential candidate it is officially backing.</p>
<p>Last month, the Albany Times Union reported that NXIVM associates gave $31,600 to the state Republican Senate Campaign Committee and provided $34,763 worth of air transportation. ... </p>
<p>A 1992 Arkansas lawsuit filed by Bill Clinton’s then-attorney general, Winston Bryant, charged Raniere, Cafritz and two others with fraud and business deception. Soon after, then-New York AG Robert Abrams sued CBI, branding it “illegal.”</p>
<h1>Raniere didn’t admit wrongdoing, but agreed to pay hefty fines in both states. ...</h1>
<p>At NXIVM – according to court papers, cult watchdogs and relatives of members – Raniere has defrauded devotees, shattered families and drove at least one person to suicide.</p>
<p>After four months attending NXIVM’s expensive, “intensive” studies, Alaska resident Kristin Marie Snyder grew angry, depressed and irrational.</p>
<p>In winter 2003, she disappeared. Her family believes she drowned herself. Her body was not recovered. Snyder was last seen leaving a NXIVM course, and police released a note she left behind.</p>
<p>“I was brainwashed and my emotional center of the brain was killed/turned off,” Snyder scrawled in a spiral notebook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Raniere didn’t admit wrongdoing, but agreed to pay hefty fines in both states.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so it states he paid hefty fines, but remember, this is Slick Willy and The Cannibal Queen we\'re talking about. A deal could have been forged between them that jail time would be averted for sending money their way. Get it? Got it? Good. </p>
<p>Now Fiji: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://frankreport.com/2017/11/28/will-keith-raniere-return-to-perfection-if-not-in-spirit-at-least-in-fiji/">https://frankreport.com/2017/11/28/will-keith-raniere-return-to-perfection-if-not-in-spirit-at-least-in-fiji/</a></p>
<p>So will Keith return to perfection? Or will he have to admit he is one of the most highly flawed human beings on the face of the earth? Will he use Mexico to maneuver secretly to someplace else? How about Tahiti?</p>
<p>Or will he return to his fools followers in Clifton Park?</p>
<p>Wakaya Island might be nice if Clare Bronfman is in the mood to host him. Fiji is a hard place to extradite even a Raniere, yet it is a small island and it will not be hard to know he is there. He can run there but he cannot hide.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to our original question: Where is Clare Bronfman?</p>
<hr />
<p>On <a href="https://www.mailcharts.com/emails/ec074c5e-1b75-f5cc-ec1a-1e8cf66f3c0b">https://www.mailcharts.com/emails/ec074c5e-1b75-f5cc-ec1a-1e8cf66f3c0b</a> , the glad tidings were announced that Clare Bronfman assumed ownership of Wakaya from David Gilmour, the founder of Fiji Water and original developer of the long uninhabited Wakaya Island, as of August 11, 2016.</p>
<p>Extradition in Fiji is almost entirely contingent on the amount of money the resident of Fiji possesses. It is inexpensive to purchase residency in Fiji.  The judiciary in Fiji is rated by several watchdog groups as among the most corrupt in the world, which of course is ‘perfection’ for Keith Raniere.</p>
<p>Now, doesn’t this seem better than shacking up in a condo in Monterrey?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it may be one of the most corrupt places on earth, but not when you have a POTUS who ANTICIPATES the problem and has already worked out a deal. </p>
<p>Can I get an Amen? </p>
<p>In one fell swoop, the cabal is going down! </p>
<p>Please keep checking this post. I\'m going to be adding to it.</p>',

            Don't be surprised to find out the Cafritz connection is more than coincidental. They have their own reporter, Suzy whatz her name.

              All I can tell for sure is that Buffy ran these inauguration balls for quite a while, and while it may seem very civilized to put Democrats, Communists, Libertarians, and Republicans in a party setting to make friendly, everyone knows that deep state will join the Gay party to get elected, or worse. One thing that stands out about most of these parties is that they are invitation only. That means it would be pretty hard to crash, unless you were the one inaugurated perhaps. Perfect place for a secret group to corner a diplomat/other on the fence about some issues, or just plan immediate war. The guest lists are impressive and varied. Lot's of Hollywood, BIG money, and foreigners. Now Al Sabah is trying to fill her pointy shoes with her own balls. In the pictures I could not help to notice how much black clothing they all wore.

               Good points.

               Yes, it would be an excellent point to corner a politician and get lots of one-on-one time. That's gotta be worth the money right there. But n the case of NXIVM, it would be a perfect place to make contact to report any news or receive instructions. The Clintons already knew about Raniere from the pyramid scheme. And we've learned what comes of putting private communiques in writing.

                Worth the money? Check out how the Cafritz's started out as immigrants. Lithuanian jews, small loan from uncle(fortune now), buy this, build that, and all in those now familiar streets of the Capital when it was a podunk town. Cost of event is slightly less when you own the Building(s). Thanks for making me laugh though.

            , you've got a bug in your headline and your text - the '$' is missing - it'd be '$ 30,000 fans', not '30,000 fans'. ;-)

              Well, yes, since it is misleading, and people will be confused - the post is not aboutt 30,000 HRC fans who comprise her 'cult following', but about a handful of people who contributed $ 30,000 altogether, and who are connected to a real cult. Most people will not click the link, but only read your text.
             </p>
             <p>
              Would be really nice if you could just repost, before there will be more comments.
