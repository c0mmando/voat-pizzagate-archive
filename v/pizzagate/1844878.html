            They have gay only adoption agencies that say foster children must only live with a demographic that's medically proven to be 30 times more likely to rape them. 
If you want the sources - CDC says 1.7% of America gay. And get the bravehearts.org.au child abuse fact sheet, 35% of all children raped are little boys raped by homosexuals. Then do your math it isn't that hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            With state media saying the gay has the basic right to rape a child - we have a problem. 
( banned url shortner slash gaysrapekids)
fostercare.lwb.org.au got a 50 grand grant to say the best foster carer in QLD was someone already on 4zzz gay radio promoting their child snatching business who was already charged for fucking his own son in the fist national carer awards. 
This will make you sick. I mentioned it at the end of my Jim Fetzer PhD interview on satanic gay child rape pedo cults suing people for religious vilification in OZ. Also see this:

            (censored in support of pedophila) lots of information about life without barriers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's their promo video saying we proudly discrimination against hetrosexuals because we are homosexual biggots who are proud we are responsible for multiple mass child rapes already, and we know the net effect of our discrimination is more massive child rape statistics increase.

THEY PROUDLY DECLARE THAT NOTHING IS WRONG WITH SAYING THE BEST PARENT IS A PARENT WHO FUCKS THEIR SON.

            The nursing registrar shows he was already charged as a gay dads son fucker before receiving the award. My father was found guilty of the crime of linking to a youtube video I made predicting he was a pedophile before his arrest. See McKee vs Burns in caselaw and lookup the video for yourself.

              you think the politically correct gays can do no wrong even when they are raping children - and must always be respected police will come along and delete this.

             <p>
              These are high profile gay marriage activists being charged with raping kids again and again. you can't divorse the links between gay marriage activists raping kids. This is my research. I broke this story the MSM covered up:

            Adult and child victims of satanic ritual abuse will need years of psychological therapy as well as medical assistance. Don't expect the victims to come out until they are both ready and permitted to do so for legal reasons by their rescuers.

            It is unbelievable that the Belgian MSM and government can cover all this up, sounds just like pizzagate = CNN &amp; Podesta and their cohorts.  How can 20 people supporting the children be killed and no suspicions, it sounds just like the Clinton Body Count. VERY VERY SAD :(

            I found a piece that describes the torture and eyewitnesses to the Belgium sex ring. This is HORRIFIC. I googled after watching the above documentary. How these people escaped with their lives I'll never know. How they function I'll never know.

            Probably they don't release the names so dumb fucks like you don't harass them. Not naming underage victims is actually common practice stupid.

            We also need names of the arrested released, so that we can follow the cases and makes sure that the charges are not dropped. Which reminds me, is anyone following the Comet Ping Pong shooter Welch's case still?

            Many of those kids go into therapy and are kept hidden so they can try and live a "normal" life. Many abused women go through same drill. Some are even allowed to change their names legally without it being public. I knew a woman whose three daughters was being abused by a guy (his wife was their babysitter in her home) and his ring of sick Evil adult fuck friends. They got busted because the one daughter has a rectual tear that got severely infected😠 However, these friends was wealthy and made several attempts to contact these daughters when they was in high school. So the mother and her advocate went to authorities and she + her daughters changed their names and moved. They endured years of therapy and mental health issues b4 leaving.  Many nights she said she thought of putting her and her daughters in their van in the garage and just never waking up. 😢😢

            Sausage. On pizza and the food supply. Either directly, or after having been feed to pigs.

            To complete the ritual circle, and to add to the energy of the magic, the 'bodies' are being fed back out to the consumers. You will see soon.

            I think we may well be witnessing a child traffickers turf war. One child-trafficking network brings down another child trafficking network mafia-style. Child trafficking never stops. Just changes managers. The ultimate beneficiaries probably remain invariable the same.

             I believe this whole thing with the "elites" is all about surpression of knowledge between brotherhoods. These brotherhoods seem to be friends or mortal enemies and we seem to get caught in the cross fire.

            EXACTLY. Where are the kids? We need to see proof from these "busts" that actual kids were saved and not just shuffled back into the system. For every news item we see, we need to start contacting the agencies involved (via social media) and ask for proof.

             I dont know why we werent doing this from before? Are we supposed to take the Fed's words for it ? The same people that are covering for these pedo fucks? Citizen journalism needs a quantum leap if we expect actual change in this shit-show of a world.

            "Where are the released kids?! "
           </p>
           <p>
            Law enforcement would never release the kids names or even show pictures of them for obvious reasons. The kids did nothing wrong obviously and they deserve privacy.

            The only person who would blame a child for being sexually assaulted is James Comey of the FBI who went after Anthony Weiner's 15 year old sexting partner. Evidently James Comey felt that poor girl was as guilty as Weiner for seeing his weiner. The FBI really should hold a remedial ethics class for the two highest executives there. Here's why James Comey needs to step down from the FBI. It's part of the victims letter to him expressing her outrage at being outed as a rape victim:
           </p>
           <p>
            “
            <em>
             In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle?
            </em>
            ”
           </p>
           <p>
            “
            <em>
             I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me…I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views.
            </em>
            ”
           </p>

            Which makes think of a good SNL skit idea: James Comey at the Pearly Gates trying to get past St. Peter. That would be pure comedy.

             While I agree with you on the Comey issues, &amp; believe that much of what we see &amp; hear, especially in MSM, is a lot of CIA/Deep State propaganda, for the PEDO busts that are real I have to wonder;

            These people kill their own. I think if the pedo elite could positively identify who has been rescued they will try to finish them off to prevent more positive identification of their cohorts.

            If they show the children, there certainly will be people out in the streets.  Not good for the elite.  We must start demanding proof.

            Well first their abusers are gone so that stops hopefully the abuse. We'll probably never hear much about the children, you usually don't. Hopefully people that care about them will come into their lives.

              We don't hear half of what is happening to kids because it is the law. They can't reveal things about minors. This is why we are not really hearing about all the really terrible things that kids go thru in the public school system. It is against the law to report it cause they are minors. You would hear of all the rapes in school if they could report them!!!

              So you stating the Dutroux case didn't happen? and the crying kids you see getting rescued in the first 15 min are actors .... 
Do i do agree with you about TV is a lie, i cant agree (and even cant remotely accept) that was fake!

               Yeah they went too far, but a lot of it is propaganda, probably the majority. But if Lester Holt tells me there's an earthquake in California and my in-laws call and say they see the carnage ... Likewise if Dateline does a segment on some particular murder case that I'm very familiar with and I can verify what they're saying is true ... You just have to use your own judgement. But yeah, it's a propaganda machine, you know they censored The Franklin Scandal documentary. If Dan Rather tells me there was a huge explosion at the OKC federal bldg. I can accept that to be true, what we don't have to accept is how it went down.

              TV is the best propaganda tool to control the masses. Newspapers, books, articles etc can be just as effective at hiding the truth or distorting it. Revisionism is still a thing.

            You are exactly right! They need to show real children to wake people up. Statistics don't cut it. Think about what the video of the gassed Sirian children did, the iconic picture of the little boy in the back of the ambulance, or the dead toddler on the beach.
