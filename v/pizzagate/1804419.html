I know that many, including myself, have been trying to determine if Aquino was still alive and doing his satanic bullshit. I am researching another (more interesting)  topic related to A.I and James Casbolt (aka- MIchael Prince) and stumbled across this recent interview. This interview is conducted by Miles Johnston (who has much more interesting work relating to Casbolt IMO) </p>
<p>I am not sure how he got this interview, but he did.</p>
<p>Be careful listening to this IMO. </p>

<p>&quot;Each, an interview with Michael Aquino - He and his host list his many worldly achievements, is highly decorated, in Military and US intelligence. I listened to the 1st hour. His subjects for that hour was about Atlantis, Egypt, Masonry, religion - that he was the priest of the Egypt. God of Set and discussed Christianity where he calls the Christian God as judgmental . He touches on the five dimensions, the secret space program. Then goes into a discussion about the danger of nuclear devastation, and says the game is over if Russia and US do a nuclear exchange and says he\'s keeping his fingers crossed! And that\'s the end of the first hour. &quot;</p>

            While he's criticising everyone and everything else, please remember that the FBI reported that this fucker is 'gender-confused'--in other words, he likes wearing women's clothes--and that he frequents prostitutes and is into BDSM.  So he has a lot of fetishes and hates women. Basically, he's a sick fuck.

            This  a  BIG MISTAKE to read  this  guy's BS-he is a  master at deceit on levels most  of  us  can't  imagine, his information  may  be  true,  but it CANNOT  BE  TRUSTED   unless  it  is  verified  by other  sources-he  is UNDOUBTEDLY GUILTY OF THE  MOST  HORRENDOUS VILE ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN   imaginable-for those  that are empaths stare  into  his  gaze  and  all  your  questions are  answered-he  is as  close  to an ANTICHRIST as  I  have peered  into,
to  give  this MONSTER A  PLATFORM to cast  his  MAJIK is a  big mistake-it lends  credibility to  him  and  his  vile  LIES and CRIMES  against his  VICTIMS-this  includes AQUINO  AND THOSE IN  THE  MILITARY LIKE  HIM-my deepest  question to  myself is  how  could people in  the  military allow  people  like  this to exist  among them???
Also the  last report I read Aquino is  apparently Jewish-go 'figger

            This guy is accused of raping and killing kids in the 80's and the investigation was stopped quickly. He's good at lying and sounding like a nice guy. Don't buy into it

             I believe I left a not of caution about what a liar this man is. To dismiss everything he has to say would be a mistake. You can unconver lies and strategy by understanding what is and WHAT ISNT said on these topics. To understand the enemy strategy (and the disinfo) is very important. If you can handle it. To reject ALL that is said, would be unwise and a missed opportunity. The Art of War and all that jazz....

            WOW.  that is definately him. 2 years ago. HIs YT page is empty though.  I just watched this exact video recently but didnt read the comments.  I find it interesting he is back on the circuit now. He is presenting as a 'retired military officer' on pension (ie-broke and slinging books) but I dont buy it. Especially with this recent subject matter. I know that he is a powerful liar so very carefully approaching this material. Thanks for pointing out that he has been active recently beyond this interview.   I search for him often and have found nothing. Reading between the truth and lies on this is going to be interesting. I think he is playing a part in the new psyops being rolled out currently.  I believe Aquino is directly responsible for the death of Max Spiers as Aquino was part of the subject matters he was researching when he was killed. We must be getting close to something since he is now resurfacing.... and his subject matter ties in directly with the A.I. big picture I am looking into currently. Its possibly a diversion tactic with some nuggets of truth to get us to open ourselves to his message.

            Absolutely excellent research, as usual AA. Glad to see you're still around. Aquino imo is an extremely important link in PG. The information you've posted here is gold. Thanks.

             Well thank you. I am laying low BUT I have shifted my focus to another aspect something larger and involving A.I, Genetic Enhancement and Occult Warfare Projects as I have found a larger connection with ALL of the pieces of the pizza puzzle far exceed the current view (IMO). Likely not much of it will be posted here on VOAT, but who knows,  some things just need to be shared here.  Like this interview which blew my mind as I occssionally do searches on Aquino to figure out if he is still up to his old tricks and in fact he IS....

              No worries and great to hear, fascinating subjects! Did you see synt.us have a new front page with a link to their dischord? Theres an extremely interesting PDF book in the dischord in the 'info' room. 'How to create a mind control slave.' Occult Warfare Projects. I've just started reading it and it's fascinating. It may be of help to you.
