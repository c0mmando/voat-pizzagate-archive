<h1>More than four years later, the spotlight shines back on their plight, and that of thousands of women like them, in the documentary Stolen Daughters: Kidnapped by Boko Haram, premiering on HBO.</h1>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/22/bring-back-our-girls-documentary-stolen-daughters-kidnapped-boko-haram">The wrenching film</a> follows two Chibok girls freed in 2017 and two women who, like thousands of others, were kidnapped but are known as “forgotten girls” because they weren’t captured in a high-profile event.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram">Boko Haram</a> has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced at least 2 million. Mines laid by Boko Haram killed 162 people in two years and wounded 277, according to a report released last month. This week, a Boko Haram faction killed an aid worker. <strong>And 112 Chibok girls are still missing.</strong></p>
<p>The girls released last year are the focus of the documentary, which provides an exclusive look at the safe house where they have lived, their first time being reunited with family and the moment they meet their former classmates, who continued their studies while they were in captivity.</p>
<p><strong>The Forgotten Girls, meanwhile, try to recover their lives in Maiduguri, a city targeted repeatedly by Boko Haram, scraping by on support from aid groups. They must also confront a community worried that the women, as well as men and children kidnapped by the group, have returned radicalized.</strong></p>
<p>“The community in Maiduguri has been really stoic in opening up their doors to refugees and providing shelter,” said producer Sasha Joelle Achilli. “There’s a bit of both: there’s the fear and stigma attached to the people who have been living with Boko Haram and there’s also just great openness and generosity to help the other.”</p>
<p>The stories and scenes from Maiduguri provide a less varnished look at terrors Boko Haram is still carrying out against Nigerians, while the Chibok girls story is more focused on rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s government put [restrictions] on the production.</p>
<p>In an early scene, the head teacher at the safe house gathers the Chibok girls to announce the film crew has arrived. She explains to the girls that the film-makers have been told not to ask about their experience with Boko Haram. “Do not tell them about what happened in the forest,” she warns.</p>
<p>Despite those warnings, a sliver of their experience comes through from anonymized diaries girls shared with the film-makers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The fact that the Chibok girls were kept for three and a half years is an embarrassment to the Nigerian government,”</strong> Edwards explained. <strong>“They don’t want the world thinking too much about that or what might have happened to them …</strong> They want the world to see the Chibok girls are being looked after, want for nothing, they get food and dresses made for them, that they are very safe and secure, and that’s what they want the world to see.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edwards said the girls did say they felt safe there and were grateful for the government’s protection because they are still scared of Boko Haram. “It’s a complex situation but we made sure we were honest with the audience that this is the condition and this is how they’re being told not to talk about it,” Edwards said.</p>
<p>Because the Chibok girls are warned away from disclosing what happened to them at the hands of Boko Haram, it’s the Forgotten Girls who offer a glimpse of what happened in the forest.</p>
<p>A woman called Zahra, whose name was changed for safety reasons, explains what responsibilities Boko Haram gave women in the three months she was there: caring for the sick, helping those who were pregnant and helping to kidnap more women.</p>
<p>It’s the latter activity that appears to have shaken Zahra most, as she describes a violent attack that happened during a kidnapping she was enlisted to help with under the threat of death.</p>
<p>Zahra tells the story of what happened to a 14-year-old kidnap victim in a few sentences, each worse than the one that came before, then concludes: “I will never forget her all of my life.”</p>

<h2>Boko Haram Teaching Child Soldiers to Rape (trigger warning)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Senior Boko Haram militants are now ‘providing specific instructions’ to younger boys for raping women and girls at gunpoint.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well before they set off for the attack, Ahmed’s superiors told the fighters to capture as many women and children as they could, and that they would be allowed to “have fun” when they returned to their base.</p>
<p>“At first I didn’t understand what they meant by ‘you are going to have fun’ and nobody thought to explain,” said Ahmed. “Days before we left for Gwoza, they began to show us what they wanted us to do.”</p>
<p>For the next two days, the young boys, most of whom were about Ahmed’s age [15], watched as their commanders raped women and young girls abducted in earlier raids. The lesson for the boys was clear: They were learning to subdue a struggling victim during sexual assault.</p>
<p>“The girls will scream and cry for help, but [the militants] didn’t care,” Ahmed said. “Sometimes they’ll be slapped and threatened with guns if they didn’t cooperate.”</p>
<p>While in the act, the jihadists provided specific instructions to the young militants.</p>
<p>“They tell us to remember to hold the girl tight on both hands, pinned to the floor,” Ahmed said. “They said we shouldn’t let a woman overpower us.”</p>
<p>The leaders were making a sharp departure from previous rules. Previously, even though dozens of women and girls were held hostage in their camps, young militants were prohibited from emulating their elders.</p>
<p>“From the day we came, they [Boko Haram commanders] kept warning us against having sex,” Ahmed said. “They said women belonged to men and not boys.”</p>
<p>Now, all that changed. A large number of senior fighters had been killed in one assault by the military, forcing the militants to take the boys along as part of the mission to Gwoza. But they knew they had to incite these young teens as well, and they wanted to replenish their supply of female hostages. Some abducted girls had been married off, and some had escaped or been rescued by Nigerian forces, leaving the jihadists with just a handful of female captives to prey upon.</p>
<p>“They wanted us to do a good job and that was why they said we will have fun when we returned,” <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/boko-haram-teaching-child-soldiers-to-rape">Ahmed said</a>. “I could see that so many young boys were excited.”</p>

            Glad this is going to get some more attention. You know, I work with lots of Nigerians in the job that I do, which is in the security sector, and when you work alongside people you do make friendships. I rarely ask them sensitive stuff about their homeland, not wanting to offend, but i think i will ask them if they know anyone at home touched by this evil.

             I will do another post about it, focusing on the rapes by soldiers - it's so sad, the girls and women felt safe after they could flee or were freed, and than many of them were raped by the Nigerian army. :-/
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Nigeria is a major trafficking hub - many teenage girls and women are lured by female traffickers, who promise them jobs in Europe, but once they get there, they have to work as prostitutes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before they leave, the traffickers make them see a priest (kind of voodoo priest), who cuts off some hair or a tiny piece of a fingernail, and tells them he 'owns' them now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later, when they try to flee, they are being told that the priest will put a black magic spell upon them and / or their family members, so they are often too scared to flee (with the help of small NGOs who try to help them, in Italy f.e.).
            </p>
            <p>
             This really, really sucks. :-/ The mafia organizations that traffick these women are all linked to cults, and in order to become a cult member, men often have to rape a woman. Actually, the Nigerian mafia has already taken over some parts of Southern Italy from the Italian mafia.

             https://www.foxnews.com/politics/clintons-state-department-resisted-labeling-boko-haram-as-terror-group
            </a>

           <p>
            The kidnapping of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls by radical Islamic terror group Boko Haram has drawn international condemnation, including that of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the State Department, under Clinton's leadership, repeatedly resisted and blocked efforts to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist group. Those who pushed for the designation as early as 2011 are now saying the department missed a major opportunity to track and target the deadly organization as it grew.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The delayed designation of Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization cost us two years of increased scrutiny of the group's activities and leadership," Rep. Patrick Meehan, R-Pa., said Thursday in a statement to FoxNews.com. "Boko Haram met the statutory requirements for the designation as early as 2011, but the State Department's delay has left us with fewer resources and less intelligence on an Islamic terrorist group with ties to al-Qaeda that is clearly destabilizing the region."
           </p>
           <p>
            The State Department did label Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization in November 2013, under the leadership of Secretary John Kerry.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Boko Haram had been killing people for years at that point, building ties with Al Qaeda sympathizers and orchestrating major terror attacks, including one on a U.N. compound in 2011.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortly after that attack, lawmakers began lobbying the State Department to consider labeling Boko Haram a terrorist organization, to no success.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lawmakers noted that designating Boko Haram would authorize a range of punitive measures -- giving the Justice Department clearance to prosecute those tied to the organization and the Treasury Department the ability to go after members. The letter said those in the intelligence and law enforcement community were "deeply" concerned about the group's "rapid progression from a machete wielding mob to a full blown al Qaeda affiliate."
           </p>
           <p>
            The more these groups are allowed to kidnap murder and rape and instill fear into the people, the weaker the support system which will only facilitate their crimes and plundering of villages. Trafficking of Our Children certainly must have picked up during this time.
