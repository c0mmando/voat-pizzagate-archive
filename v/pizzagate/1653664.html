<p>What\'s interesting with this Indian story is that the babies/children aren\'t for other Indians, it\'s for Europeans and Americans.  The other reason why pizzagate is possible is this line here, in regards to the sheer amount of people involved in trafficking children: &quot;<strong>Those arrested included the owners of the clinics, midwives, doctors, owners of the charities, as well as court clerks who are accused of forging documentation for the babies</strong>.&quot;  When it comes to what we\'re dealing with here, there\'s people at all levels. Any background. Any race. Any age.</p>
<p>The above article about India is worth reading from beginning to end. It truly captures what we\'re dealing with here.</p>
<p>Here\'s reviews of European Adoption Consultants, the adoption agency recently raided and shut down by the DoJ, state, and local police: <a href="http://www.adoptionagencyratings.com/adoption-services/european-adoption-consultants">EAC</a></p>
<p>Read the 1 star reviews. There might be a thread here that is common among the adoption agencies: mentally and physically disabled children.  This makes sense if you consider extremely poor countries and parents who don\'t want to (or can\'t) take care of a child with disabilities, so they give them up for adoption. The reviews also offer an honest glimpse into how these agencies work.</p>
<p>However, this leads to another thread in these articles: the demand for <em>healthy</em> babies/children.  You have hospitals lying to mothers by saying the baby is stillborn, when it isn\'t, then whisking the child away to be sold. In the Mexico article, you have mothers being paid to bring babies to full term and then having them taken away to be sold.  There\'s probably a whole factory-farming system out there where trafficked, healthy women are forced to breed with healthy men to produce high-value babies with little to no disabilities.  The kid in the fatherhood video may very well be mentally disabled, as if the entire thing couldn\'t possibly be more horrifying.</p>
<p>The easier children for pedos to get are the ones WITH disabilities. These kids are probably dumped off somewhere in India, Thailand, Mexico, etc no questions asked.  Nobody is looking or asking for these kids. Why would someone high up like Epstein or Podesta handle a high-risk child, one who may be doggedly searched for by their parents? For them, I imagine it\'s much safer to deal with trafficked children who nobody is looking for or cares about.</p>
<p>In regards to Foster Care centers, a simple google search will show you pages and pages of foster parents being arrested for sexually abusing their adopted children: <a href="http://www.fox4now.com/news/cape-foster-parents-arrested-for-sexual-and-physical-abuse">Foster</a></p>
<p>Los Angeles shuts down a bunch of foster care centers due to sex trafficking: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/countygovernment/la-me-foster-care-last-resort-20160301-story.html">LA</a></p>
<p>What\'s telling in this article is how minors, who find themselves hopeless, actually accept their lot in life and attempt to recruit other minors into the trafficking trade.  Are foster care centers desperate to find adoptive parents, or are they willingly giving these children over to monsters? Pedogate is systemic, and to really get to the root of the devil, is to investigate the system itself.</p>
<p>When it comes to Pizzagate/Pedogate, there\'s so many leads to go down. I think by understanding the economy of sex trafficking and pedophilia, we can understand the smaller details much better when drilling down into details such as the Fatherhood video, or linking different businesses with prominent players.  There\'s a system involved here and I think having a base knowledge of how this system works will help any investigations.</p>',

            That's a tough story, I'm sorry you have to go through that.  I've also personally known two positive adoption stories so it's easy to forget that it can be a good thing and there are a lot of rock star adoptive parents out there.  It does seem, however, that the adoptive parents may know the actual parents may want to re-connect with their child and can be fearful of losing their child to the real parents.  Even if that fear is misplaced.  Is there any official recourse you could take so that you could, at least, get someone to ensure the child is safe and can provide a picture for you?  I'd think a 3rd party would be very useful in a situation where the adoptive parents want to ensure there's no direct link between the actual parents and their child (because of the aforementioned fear of the child wanting to 'leave').
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck, never give up!

            I've been out of the loop for a while. Do we have that massive list of charities and etc. that was posted on /pol/ by a graphics designer who was looking at logos?
           </p>
           <p>
            There were an unbelievable shitload of them that had pedo symbols in their logos. I remember the anon saying it was highly unusual for so many separate companies that do the same thing to have such similar logos.
           </p>
           <p>
            I may have part of the thread archived, but I'd have to search for it.

             It's out there. I just ran across it last night. I can't remember what search term I used but it definitely came up. Huge thread matching charities with symbols.  I didn't read the entire thing but it seemed like a good lead to narrow down the list for further investigation.

            These are the two agencies Melaney Parker was associated with before her suspicious suicide in Marfa, Texas. She had also come back from Peace Corp work in St. Lucia, where she had also been affiliated with Haiti efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would bet my lunch money that she learned something she shouldn't have somewhere along the line and paid the price. The suspicious circumstances of her suicide (like Monica Peterson's) warrant further digging.

           <p>
            Edit: My money on Safe Austin...has a children's shelter, deals with sexual abuse, and Melaney Parker was planning to move to Austin to work for them permanently. Think I may start a new thread when have a moment.

            I was looking into Bethany Christian services. Today their Facebook held a live interview with Vijonet Demaro- a Hatian man and their country director. He was involved in the country's electoral board or something, which was under a lot of criticism, and then he resigned on 15 Jan 17. Not sure if in protest or was forced out or what (he could be a great guy but it's hard to figure out what's going on since most articles are in Haitian Creole.)

            Then I thought to look into BCS, and sure enough, found this post with comments accusing people of BCS taking children, providing terrible experiences, and multiple comments that they are "only in it for the money."

            Really sorry to hear that... fortunately, Netherlands is a good country. The people can be very private and aloof, so I think that is what you are experiencing. All the best.

            Pushing orphans into foster care and adoption is big in the 'religious/cult' movement.
'CAFO' is the motherlode bringing agencies under one umbrella -
