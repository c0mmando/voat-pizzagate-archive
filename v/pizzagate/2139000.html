<p>This is an update on the Gemmel Moore case, and it\'s another tale of political payback. This time, Ed Buck\'s attorney Seymour Amster has called for an investigation of Lindsey Horvath for saying this: </p>

<p>Buck’s attorney, Seymour Amster, appeared before the West Hollywood City Council to say he is demanding an investigation of comments that Horvath made about Buck. Amster apparently was referring to Horvath’s statement at the Aug. 21 City Council meeting that she had contacted the L.A. County District Attorney’s Office and the Sheriff’s Department and asked them to “take the necessary steps to make it possible for anyone with information pertinent to this case to safely come forward. I want all facts surrounding this case to be known.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amster said that Horvath in making her comments did not disclose that Buck opposed her election and had campaigned against her.  He said he wanted a grand jury to look at Horvath’s private emails and telephone records to “determine if she has been involved in instigating, promoting or financing the character attack on Mr. Buck.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I\'ll bet Ed Buck opposed her! Imagine having someone that isn\'t a paid puppet on the job! Why they might actually demand an investigation if Buck landed in trouble for consorting with sex workers and the strange fetish parties he\'s alleged to have thrown. Oh, wait! That IS what happened, isn\'t it? Now Horvath is paying the price. </p>
<p>It seems any councilmember of non-councilmember would have issued the statement she issued. By assailing her, Amster is proving what? That there are councilmembers that don\'t want an open investigation? That the correct stance is to look the other way and take part in a cover up? That Gemmel Moore\'s life and death isn\'t worth investigating? At least not when it\'s juxtapositioned against someone with deep pockets ... someone like Ed Buck. </p>
<p>Noted activist and journalist Jasmyne Crannick is calling Buck and Amstel out. Here are her tweets: </p>

<p>I\'m going to keep on this case. This illustrates the level of corruption that\'s rampant in LA and elsewhere. </p>

            Thanks for the update. Based on Buck's fetish what do you bet this has happened before. If it wasn't for The kid's mom raising a big stink this would have been swept under the rug.  Buck uses mostly street kids that have been tossed aside. Poor black kids that people forget about. Sad.

             It is very sad. And I'm sure this has happened before. Who knows? Bodies can be moved and dumped. Maybe the only reason that didn't happen is because Buck was already so sure (from perhaps past experience) that it would be swept under the rug.

            do you know this Horvath?  Hopefully she is just disgusted with mr Buckmelter, but unfortunately buckmelter probably has a point that Horvath is seizing the opportunity to punish him for opposing her.  You're talking West Hollywood after all -- are there really morals out there anywhere

             Where is she punishing him for calling for an open investigation? Could you call out the part where she's being vindictive because I'm not understanding your point.

              i thought that was his (buckmelter's lawyer's) point?  i'm saying that it's likely that it was more being vindictive than being 100% outraged.   and also, she's not going to say she's condemning him cuz he opposed her

               So you're saying we're vindictive to Pedosta, HRC, Marina Abramovic, JA, and the rest of the assorted characters in this #pizzagate cabal?
              </p>
              <p>
               So what if she made calls? Or wrote emails? Buck did that when he got an Arizona Governor ousted in a recall election. Was that vindictive?
              </p>
              <p>
               Ed Buck was freely showing videos of what he was doing at the Stonewall Democratic Club. I guess everybody was all right with it, but now that someone isn't, the lawyer is going to take aim at her? The one person who doesn't have strings attached to her or her opinions?
              </p>
              <p>
               I understand your point, but do not agree.

                no one here, i don't think, has political motivations for such investigations.   at any rate, ok i guess whatever her motivations are, yes calling for the investigation is a good thing and buckmelter's lawyer's attempts to shout it down are bad.  hopefully the police do as suggested.    Plus yes, the other council persons should be calling for an investigation and their silence says a lot
