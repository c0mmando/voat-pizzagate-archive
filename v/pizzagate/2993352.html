            Sorry, but this is mere speculation. I don't think that Madeleine or Desmond were not raised by their biological mothers.

            </a>
            . Thanks for the post. Do these videos include any actual evidence that either of these kids was born prematurely? Our Rule 2 requires linked evidence for every major claim. We need the support for that directly, or at least the timestamp of the spot in the video that provides it. I will give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can add that. If this is a purely speculative theory, we have a separate subverse for unsourced material this should be posted in:

             No Sir, and I was clear to offer it up for consideration. This is a dialogue,is it not? When someone is presenting a possible scenario, the Socratic method demands that folks to substantiate or refute. That is all I am asking. Information. I do not have access to Desmond is Amazing's birth cert but I bet someone does. Also Truth is not a brain perception. It is a heart perception and when it comes to Truth, the brain is entrained to the heart. There is nothing about the life of Desmond is Amazing that is spiritually empowering for him or anyone who watches him. I cannot watch him for much longer than a couple of minutes because as a Mom, I know what he sees when he is home. I did not claim that they were raised by some other woman, but due to the horrendous nature of how that little feller is being raised, if I worked for CPS, I would be asking for a blood test first thing as proof of parentage. And then move on to his homelife. 
THIS LITTLE GUY IS BEING psychologically ABUSED!! Little boys are not supposed to be stared at by hundreds of grown male adults - it is sick and wrong. Take me down if you need to. The TRUTH will out eventually. God bless you and your forum, God bless and protect President Donald J Trump.

            This is lunacy.  Jews do this because they rape and eat children.  The rest is window dressing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jews torture infants to force their bodies to produce adrenachrome which they then consume.  They addict their slaves to it in order to ensure their compliance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Micheal Jackson dangling a baby out a window by the leg makes a good deal more sense now, doesn't it .
           </p>
           <p>
            The cult and religious faggotry is just pretty window dressing for this practice.

             Read the very objective and well-researched book The Controversy of Zion by Douglas Reed. In this excellent historical record you will see that it is complicated and that many Jews with rare exception do not want the thousands of years of Levitical slavery that has been imposed upon them, but have not the will or courage to separate themselves from it. They are a very superstitious people. If they do not decry the heinous crimes done in their collective name however, they will unfortunately reap what has been sown for them.

              Precisely.  Their lack of will and weakness of spirit can not be my concern.  They permitted themselves to become this, warned over and over for a thousand years.

              They had every opportunity to eradicate this from themselves and chose instead to serve it.  Now it doesn't matter what they decide.  They have made their problem the world's problem for the last time.
