            I think that "Something About Pizza" thing was a hoax. I saw his IMDB page early on, and it wasn't there at first. Someone put the credit up after the incident.

            Been awhile, but wasn't there something up with one of the interviewed by TV eye-witnesses? Something about him keeping his story straight concerning blocking and the amount of shots fired as well as his work history.

            Pizzagate is far from Fake news, no matter how hard some are trying to persuade that it was ''to throw off (insert another investigation here)''.
           </p>
           <p>
            That was the closest anyone has gotten to ripping this wide open. ALL the signs were there. The fight the opposition gave was ferocious.
           </p>
           <p>
            -The MSM out in strenght vehemently denying it
           </p>
           <p>
            -Lawsuits
           </p>
           <p>
            -A false Flag
           </p>
           <p>
            -Media Matters in full force attack
           </p>
           <p>
            -The Pressure on the Flynns to get fired (they lost)
           </p>
           <p>
            -The only computer at CPP's hard drive lost due to it being shot
           </p>
           <p>
            -Alefantis interview
           </p>
           <p>
            Etc......Etc......
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you see the fight they put up? that's how close the citizen investigator came to blowing it wide open.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now since everyone is focused on Seth Rich. (a story on it's own) Pizzagate has been forgotten.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the citizen investigator went back to revisiting? with all the new knowledge? that would be a fight for the ages.

            He most certainly did not have any part in that European production.   Anyone can edit IMDB.

           <p>
            Calling him a part time actor is a giant stretch.   He has a single bit/extra part years ago.    I think he worked at a supermarket.

             Valid points. The part  about the training seems a bit of stretch tho. I mean, yeah, they might be expecting something to go down just because of the death threats but defs big dif between practice and real thing, esp for young dudes in skinny jeans (I know I'm stereotyping, jk, and who knows, perhaps skinny jean, skinny dude types got nerves of steel). It was very odd, odd not conclusive, that the cams were messed with just before the event tho.

               Don't you get tired of telling us you think that, day after day at this site? What is the point? Why would you be at the same site daily to say that there is nothing to see here? Obiously, you are a disinfo shill. That doesn't work anymore. Nobody thinks you are just some concerned poster who feels he needs to make sure nobody believes this is true. 10 years ago, your act might have influneced newcomers. It no longer works. People identify you the moment you type, and your screen name doesn't help. You have failed in life that this is your task. Find a better way to live.

            It was a PsyOps to shut down the Podesta questions and make pizzagate researchers look crazy.  Now they shut down any "non-official narrative" story with ease.  See Seth Rich.

             Welch doesn't seemed to have accepted the plea bargain offered, and is still due to plead not guilty. Just hoping the "official narrative" might just get derailed over this. Somehow
