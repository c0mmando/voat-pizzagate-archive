            UPDATE: I found this guy's MSU bio on the Wayback Machine and archived it:

            Nassar won numerous awards from coaches, trains sports medicine internists, and was appointed by the governor of Michigan to oversee the licensure of athletic trainers in the state.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             OVERVIEW
Dr. Larry Nassar received his medical degree from Michigan State University in 1993.  He completed his family practice residency at St. Lawrence Hospital in 1996 followed by a primary care sports medicine fellowship at Michigan State University in 1997.  Dr. Nassar is the Team Physician for the M.S.U. Women’s Gymnastics and Women’s Crew Teams.  He is an Associate Professor in the Department of Radiology, Division of Sports Medicine and teaches sports medicine and physical exam skills to the first and second year medical students in the College of Osteopathic Medicine at M.S.U.  He developed the curriculum and created the four sports medicine courses currently taught to the medical students at M.S.U. Dr. Nassar is the medical consultant for the Wharton Center for Performing Arts. His medical practice is specific for osteopathic manual medicine and primary care sports medicine care of athletes and is located at the M.S.U. Sports Medicine Clinic.  Dr. Nassar has dedicated his medical practice in the memory of his two greatest mentors: David Hough, M.D. and Allan Jacobs, D.O.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Nassar is a 1985 graduate from the University Of Michigan where he received his athletic training education.  He maintained his certification as an athletic trainer for 20 years and believes this has enhanced his ability to care for the injured athlete.  After 20 years as a certified athletic trainer he was eligible to retire.  He has chosen to do so but continues his support of the athletic training profession.  He has been appointed by the Governor of Michigan to the Michigan Board of Athletic Trainers to oversee the practice of athletic trainers and their licensure in the state of Michigan.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to his work at M.S.U., Dr. Nassar is the USA Gymnastics’ National Team Physician. Since 1996, he has been responsible to coordinate the medical care for USA Gymnastics at every national and international competition.  He has been a part of the USA Gymnastics National Team Medical Staff since 1986. Locally, he has been the team physician for Gedderts’ Twistars Gymnastics Club  since 1996 and Holt High School since 1997.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Nassar received a patent on his ankle brace for gymnasts’ with syndesmotic ankle sprains in 1990 (patent #4,926,846).
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Nassar has accumulated many awards throughout his medical career.  A partial list includes the following awards:
            </p>
            <p>
             “USA Gymnastics Shirley Marshack Memorial Award for the Development of the Talent Opportunity Program”
            </p>
            <p>

            My apologies. No offense was intended! The news organization reporting this was being called out on Twitter for not reporting it. I tried to confirm or debunk, but I couldn't access his Facebook page.

            Given that a major objective of our investigation here is to uncover the Clintons' human trafficking links overseas, and given their known involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood...
See several links here:
            <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/03/29/hillary-clintons-muslim-brotherhood-problem/">
             http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/03/29/hillary-clintons-muslim-brotherhood-problem/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And most of all, given the brazen, above-the-law, large-scale and long-term abuse Nassar repeatedly inflicted on young girls (reminiscent of Anthony I-have-friends-in-high-places Weiner, but much worse), it DID seem relevant to me, especially if the press has deliberately left it out.
           </p>
           <p>
            His curriculum vitae has been removed from the Michigan State University faculty directory. I am hoping someone with better investigative skills than mine can locate archived copies of these pages, especially to determine how he landed the prestigious position in 1996 in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            This man was giving "intra-vaginal" chiropractic/osteopathic "adjustments" for low back pain to girls barely in puberty while hiding behind prestigious awards and the adulation of the community. He sells DVDs, does outreach to autistic kids and is running for a position on the school board! This is an obscene level of brazen behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, it would be interesting to find out if he had connections to any of the 54 USA Gymnastics coaches who were reported for sexually abusing kids to the organization, whom the club apparently failed to investigate or report to police:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In fact, the organization compiled confidential sexual misconduct complaint files about 54 coaches over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006, court records show. It’s unclear which, if any, of the complaints in those files were reported to authorities. It’s also unclear how many files have been added since 2006.&gt;

            Well its the same as the football coaches in the UK isn't it? So you have pedophiles in sports. Note that reporting on this doesn't damage the system. Reporting on politicians and billionaires molesting children and murdering them on the other hand....
