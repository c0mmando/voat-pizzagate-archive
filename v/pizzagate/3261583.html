<p>Attorney: Federal Prosecutors Seeking New Information About Jeffrey Epstein Case
by Alberto Luperon | 11:16 am, June 3rd, 2019
submit to reddit</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly speaking with victims of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and asking them if his alleged crimes crossed state lines.</p>
<p>Spencer Kuvin, an attorney for three women, said that he spoke with an assistant U.S. Attorney. The U.S. Attorney appeared to focus on what Epstein’s victims want the government to do and whether Epstein’s alleged actions constitute federal crimes.</p>
<p>“I think they’re asking it, because as a federal prosecutor you want to know whether this is a potential federal crime or state crime,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast in a new report. “If they determined that it did [cross state lines], they have potential for prosecuting it.”</p>
<p>Epstein’s attorneys declined to comment in that story. He got a remarkably beneficial deal when he pleaded guilty in a Florida court in 2008 to solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution.</p>
<p>It turned out that this was part of a secret sweetheart deal with then-U.S. Attorney (current labor secretary) Alexander Acosta, according to a bombshell Miami Herald report. Victims were kept in the dark about the agreement and alleged co-conspirators were given immunity. Epstein served 13 months, but he was able to do a work release program six days a week, even though sex offenders didn’t qualify for that.</p>
<p>This deal barely reflected the extent of the alleged wrongdoing. At the time, the Herald said they found about 80 women who claimed to have been sexually abused by Epstein from 2001 to 2006. The defendant allegedly committed abuse at his homes in Florida, New York City, New Mexico, and the Caribbean. A judge determined that the agreement violated federal law.</p>
<p>Kuvin would go on to say that if Epstein can’t be charged federally, one client a) wants the entire Epstein file to go public and b) wants Acosta to “step down.”</p>

            Ugh, this has been so dragged out, it is despicable.
           </p>
           <p>
            My issue with Epstein is that everything re: his case is focused exclusively on HIM. Yet there are hundreds of people in his flight logs, high value POI's/household names and political/foreign dignitaries. That's the true pot o' gold at the end of the rainbow.
           </p>
           <p>
            As much as Epstein deserves to be punished, if his trial is always limited to him as the prosecution's target; we'll only be able to see a small sliver of what actually happened on his island.

              Patience is key. But many are growing uneasy. I'm not one of them, I understand that the systematic dismantling of a global shadow cabal isn't something that can happen overnight!

            This can be used to fuck over Mueller.

           <p>
            Remember it was Mueller that was involved in that sweet heart deal. Mueller has a long established history of leinency towards pedo filth. Wouldn’t surprise me if Mueller is a pedophile himself.

            One the keys of appointing Acosta is to demonstrate that the corruption crosses political lines.

            It would look silly if no Trump appointees or Republicans went down.

            Acosta probably thought he was getting immunity.
