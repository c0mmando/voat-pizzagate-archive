<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong>  <em>So we have a number of threads on the arrest of Peter Dalglish, a founder of Street Kids International, for suspected pedophilia.  This post looks at the further connections of that organisation.</em></p>
<p>Peter Dalglish is a former Unicef and WHO official who was found with \'two young boys at his home in Nepal\' and has been jailed over allegations of serious child sex offences. The married father-of-one founded global charity Street Kids International (SKI), which is now part of London-based Save the Children.  
</p>

<p><strong>In 2015, The UK branch of Street Kids International merged with Plan UK</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>The two organisations have announced that SKI UK will cease to exist from 1 April and its work will be merged into Plan UK. </p>
<p>Two of SKI UK’s staff will join Plan UK’s team, including the executive director <strong>Philippa Frankl</strong>, but there will be no redundancies because the third staff member was due leave the charity anyway. </p>
<p>The move came about after SKI UK approached Plan UK with a view to a merger in May last year, and both sets of trustees recently decided there was a good fit between the two organisations.</p>
<p>Tanya Barron, chief executive of Plan UK, said the move would help her charity to reach more of the most marginalised and vulnerable young people.</p>
<p>SKI UK was established in 2008 as a sister organisation to Street Kids International, based in Canada. SKI closed in January and became part of Save the Children Canada. </p>

             Mauritius and black money - Riding roughshod over regulators

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Paradise Papers leak has exposed Mauritius as a haven for tax-dodgers. The leaks obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and trawled by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, publicised 13.4 million records from two offshore firms, Appleby and Estera as well as 19 corporate registries in offshore tax havens - including Mauritius. What they found is that Mauritius is increasingly being used by the super-rich from abroad to avoid tax, or simply to cover up dodgy transactions abroad. Just to take a couple of examples, three British TV stars were found to have diverted £2 million via Mauritian firms to avoid tax claims by the British exchequer. A former Kenyan minister of agriculture, Sally Kosgei, was found to have used Zonrisa Ltd, a Mauritius-based company, to buy a flat in London near the iconic Harrod's department store.
