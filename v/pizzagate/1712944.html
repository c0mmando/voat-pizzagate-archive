            For me it's accelerating ever faster into the end of all life on earth except for insects in the ground no matter who won between 2. A giant orange fascist elderly douche and a mentally and physically ill elderly with about 2-3 million kills to her death count, she told Bill to do almost everything he's done militarily and found it hilarious that a woman was raped by Bill or that Gaddafi the leader of the richest and most egalitarian arab/bedouin muslim country which happened to be the richest country in Africa where everyone had a house built for them if they married but didn't enough money to buy a house and other things and how she laughed like a maniacal witch on TV laughing of Gaddafi's death with her stupid we came we saw he died hahahahaahaahahahahaha.

            Trump is buddy buddy with Epstein, probably DAP'd 13 year olds with Epstein. Maybe not though, "Katie Johnson" said before her ddoss'd and cancelled because of "fear for her life" when the strength of about 250 000 zombie computers with 100mbps of upload fibre or dsl or cable connections. Just a couple weeks before the elections maybe a month, you can easily find what I'm talking about. And like Virginia Roberts, she wasn't asking for any money, joking that the settlement with the scam the Scammer in Chief right now conned really stupid people in an so unethical, it's illegal thing like the stupidity of the Trump University which he settled by giving back 25 million, which is only the amount people paid for his scam, no bonus for being victim of a criminal like usual, just got a reimbursement after a class action suit that lasted years. He still hasn't done what he should have done regarding his enterprises, that's one step on how he could be removed from office very fast, fuck the dude of the largest opposition party, the leader, in my province in Canada for a while was one of the richest man in Canada (Péladeau family guy)and he put his money into the hands of somebody who doesn't take any advice from him etc., giving up control of his businesses (which are many, an ISP/cable company, newspapers, magazines, Cable Internet, cell phone service etc.). Trump hasn't do anything of this yet, the guy won't last I can promise you this, if he makes it even to the midterms I'll be surprised, if we aren't all just dust in a nuclear wind by then.

            She's an actress. The News about celebrities is all manipulated. It's called Very Fake News.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you prove that she is his girlfriend or was..?  Notice of any relationship is lacking until recently.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then they back - dated it all.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was at the "Spirit" Vampire Dinner , and looked totally calm. Most others, barring Nicole Kidman, there looked uncomfortable.

            The only people who can really get this done are the Military / Administration / Intel / Public alliance which is what I believe is happening.

            That's why all the social propagada was to keep people stupid and fighting each other.

            Yes, I think Assange was captured by the good guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assange grew up, or at least was connected to  the Anne Hamilton - Byrne child trafficking cult; so perhaps the Rothschilds bought him when he was a child . That would make the Rothschild connection since that's what they are allegedly "into."

            Common sense! Thank you. You see, I am not convincing anyone of anything, common sense IS waking some of us up to the unlikelihood that wikileaks/assange is what we have wanted to believe it is.

             That is fine. No one is trying to convince you. Merely offering an idea that there is more to this that many think or (want to) believe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would it be better to think this possible and be correct, when it come out, or to ignore it as a possibility and be completely wrong, and thus floored when it comes out?

              The links you post are just too unsubstantiated. If you want to convince us that wikileaks is not to be trusted, then you gotta bring out the big guns.
Not "a sister-in-law of the Rothschilds posted bail for Julian Assange". That's some 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon shit, IMO.

               First off, not my links, merely links that have illustrated these points.
Second, ignoring them entirely, doesn't common sense suggest to you that wikileaks is a 'too good to be true' platform of truth? If not fine. But recognize that for many of us, it does.

                I'm genuinely curious about what you're trying to say. What do you mean by too good to be true? Are you saying wikileaks has been compromised, and they're revealing CIA secrets because the elites want us to know the truth, or are you saying the damning information they're leaking is false?

                 No. I am saying that it is not inconceivable that wikileaks is a tool of the enemy. And that the content of the leaks is measured, planned, and limited to their goals, desires, and agenda. That DOES NOT mean it is false information, however.

                 IMHO we are only ever made privy to that which 'they' wish for us to be aware of.

                  I hear you. I've always thought of Assange as the one that got away, the one that those in control did not account for. But it's true, he could be working with the people writing the larger narrative.

            I have come to that conclusion too, that we are not only fighting against the pedophile monster network, but the CIA who has created, fostered, protected and USED this network for their own goals.  There are good people in the CIA fighting to get this info out, but how many of them there are or if they will survive long enough to be successful, we shall see.

            This is BS... Rothschilds have nothing to do with wikileaks, and Vault 7 just lroves that the CIA
            <em>

              Assange was kidnapped, Was that part of the Rothschild plan too?
             </p>
             <p>
              Somehow I doubt it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump winning was definitley a glitch in the overall Rothschild plan. That;s why they are so pissed and why Merkel looks like she aged 20 years in two months, [unless that's a double and yes, there are rumors she was taken out ; as there are about HRC]
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet , some of course will argue that it was , and that everything in the world is a plan by the Rothschilds, but we'll just have to wait and see.
             </p>

              It's look like they missing the mark in getting their fucking NWO. At least not in U.S.

            So far I've looked at Assange as a hero. He had a huge part in saving us from Hillary. That would have destroyed our country! If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have found out about pedogate. But I don't think Wikileaks realized the whole pedogate thing until people started finding code words. They had so many emails to go thru and were releasing them so fast. I'm not sure they had time to figure out what those code words were.

            But, something that bothers me is that he's been friends with Pamela Anderson for a long time. Now we find out they are dating. She's been going to see him at the embassy and would bring food. She recently was caught on camera showing up with no pants 😮

            Pamela Anderson attended that Marina Abramovic spirit cooking gala.

            Are all the Rothschilds naughty? Are some of them nice and maybe hate what happens and want to expose it? Sister-in-law/second cousin soudns like someone who could be on the fringes, finds out stuff and is horrified, goes to work? Or is that optimistic? I don't get it at all otherwise. I hate the feeling that maybe everythiing is going exactly to the plan of evildoers, it's frightening.

             "maybe everythiing is going exactly to the plan of evildoers" THAT is what I am attempting to elucidate to everyone, though those for whom this concept creates ample cognitive dissonance will react by screaming 'shill' instead of considering this dark, yet very real possibility.

            the CIA HAS access to ALL Windows enabled devices, iPhones, Skype, cars/trucks/planes (OnStar, etc..), medical devices, smart devices and appliances, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            question ? for how long did they have this access ?
question ? why do they need "help" from the people finding pedo related stuff ?
question ? how come all the "evidences" &amp; "leads" are mostly found on social media sites &amp; have
to be picked up by people while they have all this smart surveillance programs on their super computers ?
question ? could it be they are playing a GAME to remain in POWER  by falsely creating trust in "government" ?
question ? if in 1994 police states in internal reports that 50% of the world economy is in hands of criminals in 1994!!!!!! what
does this mean in 2017 ?????
           </p>
           <p>
            why are there so few people here able to see this ? i do not understand.

             Great Question.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it's because the biggest hurdle is going to be the Mass Media mind control .
            </p>
            <p>
             If someone tells you something, it's not as powerful as if you connect the dots yourself. 
They may honestly lack the budget to crack this.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the money goes to the thieves.. They can't get the appropriation from Congress for it!
            </p>
            <p>
             It's like one of those puzzles when you fingers are caught in a straw cylinder, and when you pull, it tightens.
            </p>
            <p>
             So something from outside has to work on the system to break the stalemate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, functionally to get it done?
            </p>
            <p>
             And: The Admin / Officials who want this to come out need the public to pressure it, to pop the festering boil.

              i think that : the corruption is so bad that maybe 90% of the world economy is in hands of criminals. 
they dont need the people for finding "leads" &amp; "investigations" with their all powerfull computers on the worldwide web ( that they control)
they want the people to THINK that their "help" is needed so the people will stay in the illusion that they have a "say" in being governed.
all they want is your compliance &amp; your tax money.
they don't want people worldwide protesting in the streets for the SAME THING.

               No, with this people are going to boycott and petition. 
The networks inside are a mixed bag.
              </p>
              <p>
               The top posts are all perps. Ther perps call the shots.
              </p>
              <p>
               The insiders who are not perps need the outsider's help.

              <p>
               Also, when the Boston Firecracker happened they released a bunch of photos.
              </p>
              <p>
               By those photos the truth was able to come out and be totally explicit and "in your face"
              </p>
              <p>
               Whoever performed the rest of the fake event did not use the imput of the public.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, the public still had the images, which prove it was a firecracker.
              </p>
              <p>
               The evidence which was released and what the independant investigators found out, was ignored during the subsequent unfolding of the fake event.

                i thought this boston bombing was allready found a falseflag operation ,  false flag ops happen a lot , &amp; not only in the usa.
this is why i believe that we can not keep it "local" with this pizzagate , pedophelia &amp; humantrafficking is a worldwide thing ,
the best proof for this are the emails found on the hacked freedom server (tor network) 
by aproaching pizzagate as a "local" thing (usa only) is in my opinion the best way for the people to do to keep everything unchanged.
&amp; we may be all different from eachother ,one common thing we share is that we are all children or we have children.
so in my opinion for real change the people need to protest &amp; demand justice worldwide.

            Hmmm, some very loose and flimsy connections.....those Rothschilds are satanic no doubt, and they may have some peripheral connection to wikileaks (after all, we're all conected in a degree), but find it difficult to believe Assange is a Rothy shill...

             Sure. So disregard them entirely. It takes nothing away from the fact that IF you hold Vault 7 as truth, then the CIA is at the very least COMPLICIT in pizzagate, in addition to myriad other crimes by way of inaction

            This shit post is meant to be a distraction and morale tanker. The entire thread I just scanned felt like a toilet of shit flushing, trying to take our fucking sub down with it. I hope you have enjoyed your 7 hours of fame.

              You are off-gassing a cloudy mass of doubt and trying to infect everyone with your philosophical truism of "trust no one."  Spoken like a true spook. This post was started to plant seeds of doubt about WikiLeaks - nothing more. It is clear as day. Your own lack of power and trust needs to be validated externally, which is a sign of weakness. You will trip over your own sword.

               Believe as you wish. My recommendation is to have no such expectation of a source or body, and you will never be disappointed.
There SHOULD be doubt. About everything.

               I have no sword. I am not fighting. justaryde = my position on ALL of this- it is all just a ride. One finite experience along an infinite continuum. My fun is in looking for clues and patterns within the game. that includes cynicism and speculation in all directions.

            Even if this is true (citation needed), who cares? Lawyer's aren't known for being agenda driven. They're known for being driven towards money and prestige. What's more prestigious than being Assange's attorney?

             I see his point, but it doesn't really matter. 
Hasnt Assange been kidnapped, with no proof of life?
            </p>
            <p>
             And an important leak , said to be the first in a long string of them, just came out last week.
            </p>
            <p>
             What exactly is the relevance about Assange's connections? 
As if anyone could know anyway? He's a Media creation. There's no way to know who he really is.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's the spy business.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bottom line is the leaks and how they can be used to clean up the mess which is a least 50 years of filth , if not more.

Just because I also question the validity of wikileaks? How dare I have suspicion.

            Without government, marauding invaders come to your village, rape and pillage, and there's no army to fight back. Your bigger neighbor comes to your house and steals your property and beats you up when you object, and there are no police to call or courts to take him to. There is no perfect government, but man has decided all over the world that some form of government is better than no government. There is no complete freedom from oppression for mankind, as there will always be those who want to oppress others and those not strong, informed, rich, or organized enough to resist this oppression.
           </p>
           <p>
            The US government was designed to have checks and balances so all the power wouldn't end up in the hands of a small elite. We haven't been vigilant in protecting these checks and balances and let the federal government gain too much power. We need to return power to the states and the individuals so it's harder for a corrupt group of psychopaths to do so much damage when they gain power.  However, eliminating all government wouldn't result in freedom because there would be no entity to protect that freedom. So we'd soon realize we need to form an entity to protect our freedom, creating a new government.

             So you hire a government to act as 'marauding invaders go to other villages, rape and pillage?" Don't be so naive. 
The whole of nature lives in anarchy every day, save for human beings. We are conditioned to fear each other, to be afraid of murder, theft, and violence from one another, so we submit to an authority who uses murder theft and violence. You cannot see it yet, but you will.
            </p>
            <p>
             Government is mind control, nothing more nothing less. they are in the business of Human Livestock Management.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eliminating government would absolutely result in freedom. No one is protecting you but you. Now or then. It just so happens that now, most people buy the illusion they are somehow 'protected'. It is a laughable charade.

            What you must realize is that pizzagate is a ridiculous obviously fictitious conspiracy theory, and since you bought into it you have major problems in discerning fact from fiction.

            Really don't see any reason why Rothschild's would want to expose pizzagate, especially with the international scandals also waking up the public in every nation.  Makes no sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Just as an aside, there is always the possibility that we could be missing pieces of the puzzle which may be found later.
But who forced Podesta to email "pizza" -- or where was the necessity to expose Alefantis elaborate set up?
It would immediately, of course, tie in with MKULTRA -- and possibly the Clintons because we don't really know
what role they play for CIA, but they certainly were cooperating in Ark.  Maybe the connections go back to Yale?
Or even before that?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe Assange, if he is still alive, will explain some of the Rothchild stuff listed above.
           </p>
           <p>
            We could have been pursuing the CIA back when it's Operation Mockingbird was being drafted 2 years before the end of WWII.
But Allen Dulles was working in total secrecy.  Most to of the US government didn't know what he was doing.
It looks like JFK found out about Paperclip somewhere fairly early on -- maybe Werner Von Braun at NASA was a clue.  To top it off
JFK and Werner Von Braun had a serious disagreement.  Seems that Von Braun wanted to use nuclear fuel in space.  And JFK rightly understood the dangers of that and stood against it.  To my surprise I'm not able to find anything to support either this notable disagreement between JFK and von Braun -- and quite to the contrary, I'm finding an article which suggests that von Braun did use nuclear fuel for some of the rocketry.  Nothing I can do about not finding it, except to keep looking.
           </p>
           <p>
            JFK was highly anti-Nuclear and to my knowledge that was what the disagreement was about.
JFK not only understood the dangers of moving nuclear fuel into space, but he understood the threat to us all of nuclear testing and the creation of nuclear bombs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Barely found this which confirms that JFK was after cooperation with Russia on space program and lunar exploration.
Btw, the Russians at that point were 12 years ahead of US in their space program.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much more to be supported and will continue to look, but did find this.  They switch the "disagreement" between JFK and von Braun to Webb, though there may have been two disagreements.  The one with von Braun was rather noisy and often commented upon.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             President John F. Kennedy may have been aware of a parallel space program and decided to make it public policy. On November 12, 1963, ten days before his assassination, he instructed NASA administrator James Webb to develop a program of “joint space and lunar exploration” with the Soviet Union. This proposal, which may startle Americans today, was verified by Sergei Khruschev, the eldest son of the former Russian premier, in 1997.
            </p>
            <p>
             The importance of Kennedy’s step toward reconciliation with the Soviet Union and his control over NASA will become apparent in the upcoming chapter, “Kennedy and the Nazis.”
            </p>
            <p>
             • Who would have wanted to stop joint U.S.-Soviet space missions that might have ended the Cold War in the early 1960s?
            </p>
            <p>
             • And who has been orchestrating the launches of space missions in both the United States and Russia with an eye toward occult astrological alignments?
            </p>
            <p>
             • Does this mean that someone with the power to set space mission launches in both nations truly believes in the power of the position of the stars?
            </p>
            <p>
             • And whom did Johnson mean by the “masters of infinity”?
            </p>
            <p>
             This refers to a speech by LBJ in mid to late 1950's, where he also speaks about the Moon as "the highest hill."

             Exactly correct. There is evidence of a connection [of Assange ] to the Rothschilds. However, there is no way to know what that means at this point of the saga. Rothschild are certainly not behind the latest leak.. Their controlled Media and Brock squads are working overtime to dampen down the impact.

            I don't see him as controllable. He's his own man and a rare breed in the sense that he takes pride in following through with what he says he will do. Agreed that he sees the common man as his boss. Which is why there is such an effort to destroy him. They do not want to wake a sleeping giant, which is the people since we outnumber them 300-1 (govt/citizen).

            I've been telling people to look into the CIA for months. And you are turning that lead into a way of attacking Assange and Wikileaks who are right now the greatest proponents and legitimate hope for fighting the CIA.
           </p>

            For example - you start with "everything is the CIA"

            Main body of post: "Assange is a Rothschild." Which you do not show has anything to do with your statements re: the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are incorrect about the CIA "doing nothing" to expose abuses while "possessing untold years of evidence". Actually that's an understatement. For decades the CIA participated actively in this abuse, documented electroshocking and drugging children. Orchestrating abuse and covering it up. They were not so innocent as simply ignoring or not prosecuting.

             Agree re CIA.
             <br/>
             And, when we look at Part I/Pizzagate we see it is about CIA/MKULTRA and its expansions.
Now, we see that in Part II/Vault 7 we have CIA again in their fantastic scheme to spy on the public in every way possible.
This is a challenge to NSA - it's a challenge for greater control.  What would the Nazi/Gestapo pattern be except for total control?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also agree and don't like attack on Assange.
            </p>
            <p>
             PS:  I'd also like to see more investigation of United Nations.  Like religion/RCC they are worldwide as well and very involved with children and organizations involved with children.

             They are one in the same. Hard to grasp, I know, but do you really think Michael Hastings was more threatening than Assange? Think about that.

              I missed something. 
How do you even know if Assange is alive; Or who has him right now if he is.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, The mainstream Media is playing up the Anderson bull dung.. You don't really believe that do you? I thought you were a skeptic.

             <p>
              Who knows what happened to Hastings. You don't even know if he really died.. What was he supposedly going to reveal?

              I can't imagine who might be interested in coming to this specific corner of the internet and sewing division in support for Wikileaks four days after they caught a massive intelligence agency with its pants down.

               Again, believe as you wish. The connections are not my unique ideas. They are common sense connections.

              <p>
               I am stating 'trust no one'. Not the CIA, not assange/wikileaks, not me. Use your head.
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you really think the CIA/Mi5/6 could not eliminate ANYONE they truly viewed as a threat within 24 hours of the decision being made, and it NOT looking like a hit?
              </p>
              <p>
               He is a tool just like the rest. Wikileaks is a social engineering and manipulation instrument. You may not wish to accept that, but the power of those at the top of the pyramid could quickly and vastly disrupt communications and the flow of information instantly, as well as silence any true threats to their existence or agenda. To believe otherwise is IMHO indicative of naiveté to this subject matter.

                  At least with this latest CIA leak you sniff the air and realize yeah, they're setting up a system whereby the can round people up , as they do in other countries.

                And you come in here 4 days after vault 7 is released with a brand new account to tell us this with absolutely altruistic intentions, I'm sure.
 No attempt to get a large base of wikileaks support to oh, I don't know, mistrust Assange to benefit the CIA.
               </p>
               <p>
                If everything is as controlled as you (wish) it were, there would be no need to tell us it is controlled because our opinions would not matter. This shilling shows that someone, somewhere, is worried about Vault 7.
               </p>
               <p>
                99% of Vault 7 that has yet to be seen. It would benefit a VA based intelligence agency for people here to suddenly not trust Assange when Wikileaks may release evidence of pedogate.

                 This thread is about the CIA being privy to all things pizzagate and doing nothing about it. The cherry on top IMHO is that the source of said CIA capabilities is on the same side. Thus they appear to be setting their own house ablaze. Should you agree or not is of no consequence.

                  I question your attack on wikileaks (because I hate the CIA and they are exposing them)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And suddenly I'm lumped in with

                   trusting
                  </em>
                  the CIA. Way to gaslight. Also adding a string of people like Alex Jones and Trump as insults just proved you're a Brock style Dem shill.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Again: "This thread is about the CIA being privy to all things pizzagate and doing nothing about it." - That's nice for the uneducated and naive and all, but you know full well that the CIA is a fuckton more than "privy" to this and inactive on the subject. The CIA is pizzagate. They are the ones responsible for all of this. They don't ignore it. They are the ones DOING this. Nice way to ignore that again though.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "This thread is about the CIA being privy to all things pizzagate and doing nothing about it." - Actually this thread seems to be 100% about why we should not trust Wikileaks who is exposing the CIA.

                   Our conversation has become about wikileaks, the thread is about the CIA and pizzagate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Question everything, you won't hurt my feelings. But to do so INCLUDES wikileaks/assange, no?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "The CIA is pizzagate." Exactly. We agree. I fail to understand, however, why you think wikileaks is not part of the grand charade as well though. There are no true threats to the system other than us. Not some 'leak platform' we are conditioned to believe is the truth, over a long con, and now that we have been swayed wholesale to 'believe; them, what better tool/platform could there possibly be for tptb to incept/engineer/sway people now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   For someone so distrusting, which you should be, how can you be so trusting of what many of us can plainly see would be the perfect platform to be used by 'them' in wikileaks? How can you/we trust ANY sources? ESPECIALLY one who's figurehead is so easily 'touchable', and who publicly and blatantly associates with 'their' assets and representatives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I lump all of them together yes- if you have heard of them, they are likely controlled or compromised, and the larger their reach/audience, the more important they are for tptb. If that makes you think I am a shill, I am curious to whom you think I an aligned. I think ALL government, ALL media, and ALL electoral politics and parties are controlled, illusory charades. The government is in the business of Global Human Livestock Management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Government literally means 'mind control'. Govern- to control, Mente (from the latin 'mens')- the mind
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I also condem ALL Central Banks and the UCC and Maritime Admiralty Law that connects to and enriches them, off of our lifelong debt servitude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I am for exposing ALL criminality- human/drug/weapon trafficking, money laundering, extortion, bribery, mind control manipulation through the media, poisoning though foods/vaccinations/pollutants, etc, and ALL bloodliners and their minions. And letting the people decide how justice be served, not their courts, their LEO's etc...
                  </p>

                   If you think someone is paying me to say that, you are quite wrong. That said, if you know of anyone paying to state this positions, sign me up! I will post and post and post it.

Can't judge who the enemies agents are? Just likes illuminati entertainers and thinks he can handle it and come out unscathed? Won't use his proof of life key? The can't seem to kill him? He calls 9/11 not worth covering. Yes, that is what he said.  When you use your head, you realize that anybody allowed on TV is in their control. Be open minded and quetsion everything. This thing is layered.

             Nice try. My tenure doesn't change the facts. IF vault 7 is to be believed, then the CIA has known about all of this and much more for a long long time.

             And we aren't even touching the other implications in this thread. Such as:
            </p>
            <p>
             the position that ALL terrorist attacks are either
             <br/>
             -false flags
             <br/>
             -known and allowed
             <br/>
             -hoaxes
             <br/>
             As the CIA had the ability to GLOBALLY monitor anyone with Windows, iPhones, Skype, Onstar, or smart appliances/electronics

            I am going to just put this idea out there, I have nothing to back it up and it's just a thought...but let's say that the Rothschilds do (and I believe they do) engage in this SRA and all of this other evil activity regarding human rights, economic means, and also social construction...they're definitely going to need a good lawyer.  And if they employ this lawyer, you can probably bet that he/she is totally competent in her job.
           </p>
           <p>
            Julian does absolutely require that same kind of legal representation because of his position in the world.  He would need the best of the best, same as the Rothschilds, just for different reasons.

             They own all the judges and most the DOJ. Try getting charges on them in the first place. They own hundreds of central banks for christ sake. They are untouchable, or have been so far.

              Absolutely you're right about that.  But if you had all the power, would you wanna be that obvious about it?  Lol like a lawyer false flag for lack of a better idea to present.  The lawyer is a cover.  Or maybe just in case they get a judge that
              <em>
               isn't
              </em>
              owned by them.  But I'm not saying you're wrong, like I said it was just an idea.

             I am sharing items published from 2012. AND Assange IS 'them'. Sorry to burst bubbles or cause any cognitive dissonance, but true threats to power do not live long, and certainly do not enjoy longterm  influence, platform, or notoriety.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think on that with regards to all of these so-called leakers and truth heroes, including assange, snowden, fat man jones, etc.

            Yeah I can see your point about fighting in two directions is fraught with difficulty.  It just pains me thinking about the kids being MKULTRA´d in some dark basement laying in some specially made kid coffin with some insects dropped in there to freak them out.  I just want to leak everything NOW and let slip the dogs of war.  I think in the end our only hope is likely to revolve around a world wide tidal wave of revolution and frankly a Pogrom on a Biblical scale.  If we let to many of these people live among us they will likely reconstitute themselves in a generation or so...   by the way watch this 15 minute video.  It is made by a Jewish group with the attended audience of Jews to make Jews realize that the shit is about to hit the fan and they need to get all ready to fulfill their function of controlling us Goyim better.   Doubt me?  watch it

            you will need to put in an email address to watch the whole thing.  I have done it a month ago and nothing has occurred to me.  So I suggest you put in an email you use in a back up or just go ahead and put your email in.  It is well worth it to get an idea of what these Jews say when they think they are alone among fellow members of the tribe.

            I agree Wikileaks is a rothschild joint. Also, Assange was also raised in some satanist pedo cult, I forget their name. Wikileaks is definitely a limited hangout. Not sure the purpose, maybe to target certain enemies or create various fake narratives. Maybe it's the jew pedos trying to knock out the Catholic pedo competition i.e., the Catholic Pedostas. It's definitely a disinfo campaign; satanist hollywood jews don't make movies about things that aren't jew ops. Remember the stupid hollywood movie about this a few years ago. There was another one about Snowden, so we know he's an op too, without a doubt.  Not to say there isn't some truth there, but it's for sure an op.

             When I look at programming technique on individuals I can see the similar techniques used on wider population through political drama and pain, inflation vs low wages numbing people,   carrots dangling with the desire of consumerism producing survival instinct.   It's all there on mass scale.    Society has always been these  f'ers  sado play toys.
             <br/>
             If  children don't make us wake up to take action, nothing will.   Maybe this is why they've pushed this extreme  in the same way  the abusers push extremes while grooming children.

            Also, we have no proof that Assange is alive and wikileaks is potentialy corrupted. I am not saying it is, but it is a possibility. If wikileaks is trying to make a case that the Rothschilds are enemies of the CIA, then you can discard wikileaks. The Rothschilds own the Deep State and the Deep state owns our politicians and alphabet agencies. I hope I am not reading correctly and this thread is not attempting to suggest the Rothschilds are fighting for justice. That is some nonsense I would expect from Robert David Steele.

              I think the Wikileaks release of the Clinton emails was to control the release because they were imminent coming from the FBI because of the FOIA requests. And also I think Wikileaks was a diversion from the 11 million pages of CIA documents recently released;

             <p>
              And the Spirit Cooking email that really got the investigation going might have been a diversion from the Rothschild hack that happened on Nov. 1, 2016

              Now why would the 250K CIA documents be just as important if not more than the pizzagate related ones?...its because they show the potential for the human mind and how powerful humans really are...

            The only logical conclusion therefore is that the CIA has a pedo-circle of it's own that is connected to the Podesta, Epstein, Wiener group and the Hollywood group. Follow the money and you'll find the big enchilada smoking gun. I cannot wait for the results of a thorough formal investigation with congressional oversight.

             You will be waiting a LONG time, as there is no 'body' that has the capacity to investigate the global disparate tentacles of the CIA behemoth, nor the bloodliners above them.
The only power to expose lies within our hands. However legal justice will likely NEVR be properly and wholly applied to all of those guilty and otherwise complicit IMHO.

            The Central Banks control the CIA. The Rothschilds own the Central Banks. The Rothschilds and Rockefellers are the top of the pyramid to the best of my knowledge. The CIA has destroyed America and has been a destructive evil mafia since the end of world war 2. The CIA is enemy #1 to the American people. The CIA and Mossad did 9/11 along with other Oligarchs and bankers. The CIA assasinates world leaders and manufactures coups. The CIA creates terrorist and uses them as an excuse to invade countries. The CIA murders reporters and citizens that threaten to shine light on their evil deeds. The CIA loves to use entertainers in their psyops because they know the little people worship the popular people and trust them. The CIA has taken the research on mind control from the Tavistock institute and used it on the American people for decades. They run the news and entertainment industry, and this includes sports. The CIA is even in NFL security. Look it up. They do divide and conquer black vs white psyops in the NFL. The nonsense with the 49ers QB was manufactured IMO. I stopped watching sports and TV because of the Deep state programing. I would personaly slice any CIA op's throat if I could get away with it.

             Excellent --
CIA is a system invaluable to Elites.  And they are moving in on NSA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Part I/Pizzagate-Pedo-gate was based in CIA/MKULTRA - kidnapping of children, sexual abuse, torture, Mind Control.
CIA is following knowledge of RCC gained in Inquisition re torture and sexual abuse, SRA which continues on in Catholic Church.
            </p>
            <p>
             Part II/Still CIA:  challenging NSA on intelligence gathering and  trust there will be more info cementing Pedo-gate and higher up's.
            </p>
            <p>
             Global Warming is the Wild Card and Trump is acting for the side which requires denial.  That means keeping the public from gaining any government confirmation of it.  That's his most important role right now as it would mean the end of capitalism in two minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Elites are hysterical that the public not figure this out.  But Trump might as well build some WALLS around the North and South Poles and Greenland.  We are set for HUGE ocean rises -- as much as 9 feet.

              Israel was not patsy. Mossad was heavily involved and it gave them the desired effect of blaming their enemies for actions that they commited. It gave them the use of the US war machine to take down all their rivals in their own region over a crime that CIA/Mossad caried out.  Israel was no patsy, a major player in the 9/11 crime. Muslims were the intended victim they framed. Worked nicely, people are still confused to this day and think Muslims are enemy #1.

              Presumably not every person who works for the CIA is evil and part of the whole thing. Same goes for all of it - to have the power they have they need minions who will unquestioningly do their bidding, and the minions do it even if they think its wrong because they are scared, think it's what everyone else is doing so must be ok, or just don't care. But that can change, if just one or two have the courage to speak out and say it's wrong, others feel more confident, and morally compelled. I think it's highly likely that there are people who have been working for or with the bad guys who have been wanting to burn down the house for a long time and have more recently had the opportunity or the impetus.

            The idea people can hold this knowledge and not act on remedying it but capitalising on it via black mail of "officials" is at face value repugnant.  My curiosity is in how they justify their inaction in the face of such injustice and some say evil, with the idea in mind the best way for them to control society is via this way.  evil is the root of it plain and simple, it's clear if you walk the logic back and forth on this matter.  One caveat is you would have to be honest and this is why they are blinded, they cannot come to the truth to begin with.

             I kind of view it as either Assange playing the long con with them, (they use him, he uses them but in his mind isn't "controlled" by them), or there are some white hats within the Rothschilds. The latter seems unlikely considering their history. Assange however is a wild card.

            Of course. Archons are slavers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Archon means 'ruler'. 'An' means 'without'.

               But the "Mason" is from a scholar I listen to who read the ancient languages. The word is connected to Gnosticism.
              </p>
              <p>
               A scholar whom I'm listen to the podcasts of, said the "Archon" was used for "Mason," in the old texts.
              </p>
              <p>
               I just looked in an old English dictionary [ 1733 ] and Archon = ring - leader. And it also connects the Gnosticism.. in that dictionary too ; the Archon were angels, demons, powers - like that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Archon is a Greek word. = Rular.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe the Masons were ancient Rulars?

            Unless Assange is to be used to collapse Western Civilisation (which is unclear as he seems to be galvanising it, to the financial detriment of globalists) I remain curious as to Assanges Rothschild connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is he being used to usher in conflict that will result in the 'justifiable' reduction of population?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are there fractures in terms of future direction within the Rothschild family?

             One son of David Rockefeller died after going to meet his family and friends at some villa high in the mountains somewhere, he died at take off the next day and he was an accomplished pilot, I forgot what name he had.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lawrence Rockefeller from what I have gathered online through the last hmm..man 20 years soon I have the internet, anyway, is a bit of a curmudgeon who disagrees with almost everything daddy Mr.
             <s>
              Burns
             </s>
             David Rockefeller says has to be done to humanity and the earth on it. First time I came upon such info I was like yeah right, this guy, a son of greatest "American" devil in the flesh, actually rebels against David yet he wasn't the son that died in a freak accident after visiting the whole clan plus unknown invitees in some mountains pretty high in the sky, I forgot what country this happened. I'll look it up, I remember those facts, just not when and where.

              None of those connections are particularly damning. He's in a building that was once owned by a Rothschild in London? A second cousin paid his bail? Not very compelling evidence.

                But this is like playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon. When you have to rope in obviously good guys like pirate activists, it makes the whole thing seem less credible. It's saying Assange is guilty of something without having any evidence of him personally actually doing anything.

               <p>
                Look at it another way- what's to stop rich assholes from just donating to their enemies, to make their enemy's supporters stop trusting them? How do we know that hasn't happened here? Or a third option, where it's not a monolithic conspiracy but independent actors with different goals?

                 My answer is "I don't know."  I 100%. refrain from calling him guilty  Because I don't know.

                 He was likely brought up in the Anne Hamilton - Byrne cult from childhood. How could he be guilty?  He was likely bought as a child himself.

                But why taint strong evidence with weak evidence?
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 The Economist (a Rothschild magazine) gave Assange its New Media Award in 2008
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Guardian and The New York Times, two of Assange’s media partners, are linked to the Rothschilds
                </p>
                <p>
                 The owner of the mansion where Assange was eventually put under house arrest has links to Rothschilds
                </p>
                <p>
                 US Senator Joe Lieberman is a member of the Council On Foreign Relations
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                These are all really vague. Like "Assange breathes air, Rothschilds breathe air, therefore Assange works for Rothschilds". Partnering with giant news orgs is just basic common sense, for example.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm always on the lookout for a double-cross, so I'm willing to consider compelling evidence. This vague stuff just lessens the impact of the rest of it IMO.

            I have felt for a while that Pizzagate was not meant to get out in the WikiLeaks drop before the election.  But the hive mind of humanity figured out the pizza code words and spawned the Pizzagate story.  The group that is behind Trump wanted to use the potential blackmail of pedophila to force the Soros side of the Illuminati to allow the wealth to come back to America.  I dont think they ever really intended the kid raping and sacrifice and eating to get out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its like two mafia groups battling it out for domination.  And one group seems maybe a little bit saner but likely is still just as devoted to many of the Illuminati´s goals.  Trump seems very devoted to GREATER ISRAEL and war with Iran.  He also is rattling the war drums against China.  So I hope Trump is legit but I do have my fears.

             To me the motivation of these leaks appears to be a chance to shift focus from the NSA/GCHQ to the CIA who have been part of the major political narrative being fomented by the media both mainstream (agenda) and independent (observation) for some time now. This strikes me as a plausible and shrewd strategy to apportion blame to an agency that has widely been observed acting reprehensibly for decades. My intuition tells me that the CIA is being placed in the crosshairs and from its inevitable dismantlement, a new, more covert, more insidious agency will be born. Thus I feel the Vault 7 leaks are a distraction and a decoy.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are also many questions regarding WikiLeaks that need to be addressed but some of the most pertinent are, what was Cass Sunstein's (WH official 09-12) involvement in the early days of WikiLeaks? Why in the past has the legal expertise of Alan Dershowitz (staunch Zionist) been sought by WL? These two questions more broadly refer to a conflict of interests that WL has displayed over the years. And finally, why is Julian Assange so reluctant to discuss and is openly irked by the suggestion that 911 was a false flag? This is surely the litmus test as to whether someone is controlled opposition or not. 911 is now basically a closed book to anyone who's looked into it!

             Finding it difficult to go all the way with the OP, but who knows?
Really think that the story of human trafficking and organ trafficking was getting out there.
             <br/>
             Some groups of people had to be really disturbed by all of that and wanting to get the public in on it.
I think the story of pedophilia, SRA and eating was already out -- it just wasn't out there strongly enough to hit the public consciousness.  Allegedly, this is info released to Assange, not something that they select.  As Assange has said before
when asked why he wasn't reporting on other issues, he responded that WikiLeaks reports on the information that they get.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is an ongoing war for control of our government and intelligence.  But there's no guarantee that either side is the good guys.
What is clear is that the public has no control over our government as that was taken in '63.  Nor do our elections give us any control since 50 years of voting on hack-able computers.  We have absolutely no leverage over elected officials.  UNLESS we stop cooperating with capitalism.  That's our only road out of this.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Wild Card is Global Warming.  And Trump represents the side which doesn't wasn't the public to have confirmation of it.
Why?  Because capitalism would be over in the next 2 minutes.  I think we have to look at all of this cashing in of chips as being spurred on by Global Warming.  All of the "terror" fakery working as attempts at distortion to hide Global Warming.
And the final cards they may actually play in order to keep the public from rising up over Global Warming may be WAR.
War with Russia -- and China if they have to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do NOT however think that pizzagate/pedo-gate is distraction.  It's real.  And I think Podesta's email "password" was the key to opening up this thing.  It's also heavily CIA/Gestapo and heavily against intelligence spying on the public.  Because we see this in the new release which links CIA/MKULTRA and CIA/runaway spying on public.  BOTH are anti-CIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to keep looking at this and discussing it.  We will figure it out.  And hopefully with more help from WikiLeaks.

              OP is a shill.
             </p>
             <p>
              OP exposed themselves by using Trump as an insult. OP should keep Buzzfeed as a dayjob.
             </p>
             <p>
              OP stated:
"If you want to trust wikileaks, the cia,
              <strong>
               trump

              You guys are all falling for a Brock Shill because he used a nice title to get you to mistrust wikileaks. Convenient, four days after Vault 7 with 99% of the content yet to be seen. And with OP's account three (oh, I'm sorry, FOUR hours) hours old. I'm sure those intentions were altruistic though.

               Question everything, you won't hurt my feelings. But to do so INCLUDES wikileaks/assange, no?
              </p>
              <p>
               "The CIA is pizzagate." Exactly. We agree. I fail to understand, however, why you think wikileaks is not part of the grand charade as well though. There are no true threats to the system other than us. Not some 'leak platform' we are conditioned to believe is the truth, over a long con, and now that we have been swayed wholesale to 'believe; them, what better tool/platform could there possibly be for tptb to incept/engineer/sway people now.
              </p>
              <p>
               For someone so distrusting, which you should be, how can you be so trusting of what many of us can plainly see would be the perfect platform to be used by 'them' in wikileaks? How can you/we trust ANY sources? ESPECIALLY one who's figurehead is so easily 'touchable', and who publicly and blatantly associates with 'their' assets and representatives.
              </p>
              <p>
               I lump all of them together yes- if you have heard of them, they are likely controlled or compromised, and the larger their reach/audience, the more important they are for tptb. If that makes you think I am a shill, I am curious to whom you think I an aligned. I think ALL government, ALL media, and ALL electoral politics and parties are controlled, illusory charades. The government is in the business of Global Human Livestock Management.
              </p>
              <p>
               Government literally means 'mind control'. Govern- to control, Mente (from the latin 'mens')- the mind
              </p>
              <p>
               I also condem ALL Central Banks and the UCC and Maritime Admiralty Law that connects to and enriches them, off of our lifelong debt servitude.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am for exposing ALL criminality- human/drug/weapon trafficking, money laundering, extortion, bribery, mind control manipulation through the media, poisoning though foods/vaccinations/pollutants, etc, and ALL bloodliners and their minions. And letting the people decide how justice be served, not their courts, their LEO's etc...

                 Yes, there are a few of them with interviewers or visitors, but none of it has the same feel as the
old ones when he used to pose with visitors, relaxing and chatting and pics taken of group together.
I'm hoping this latest release might tell us whether it is really him or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If they had him, they'd be trying to buy time imo.  To catch others who might be passing on info.
And also not to have his supporters rising up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One of the last ones I saw here seemed especially odd because in both cases he was in a room
with a window where curtain was drawn back somewhat/looked like maybe 3rd floor, but could be 2nd?
The other one was large window with very thin curtain at window, you could see the buildings across
the street.  If he's on third floor, maybe that is OK.  He has to try to get at least some sun and light.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sad that we have to continue to wonder whether he is safe or not.

                :) Me too. I just hate lies that are framed as truth. And the CIA
                <strong>
                 IS
                </strong>
                the enemy. 
The substance of the post had nothing to do with the CIA but everything to do with smearing wikileaks. The this post functions to BENEFIT the CIA.

                 Apparently you neglected to read the OP:
So Vault 7 illustrated to the world that (for the period covered 2013-2016, and likely for far longer) the CIA had access to ALL Windows enabled devices, iPhones, Skype, cars/trucks/planes (OnStar, etc..), medical devices, smart devices and appliances, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thus, THEY are FULLY aware of any and all human trafficking, pedophilia, child sacrifice, etc conducted either online or in microphone/camera range of any of the above devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That said, not only is pizzagate/pedogate already a global scourge, but it now clearly has perhaps the most capable and entrenched private wet-work army and intel service as it's gatekeeper/enabler.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And then, I went on to ALSO question wikileaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Cheers.

                   "If you know anything about the CIA you know they participated in this. Your post is misleading in that it shows part of the truth. Lie by omission and then smear of Wikileaks." I AGREE the CIA participated in this, as I accept Vault 7 as truth. How do you interpret that as a lie? Then in addition, I posted 2012 information illustrating wikilieaks ties to Rothschild, which I also find dating as there are no such things ass coincidence IMHO. As a CT'er I question everything and trust nothing. Thus, a seeming 'white knight' savior of truth resource like wikileaks , by the measure of common sense in addition to this connections is, to me, too good to be true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You are a waste of time, as you refuse to even consider this as a possibility. I am far from a shill, as EVRY possible angle or agenda that would have interest in paying for position representation is one that I am against.  You keep shouting 'shill', but never once say who would benefit from the reality presented my posts, nor have you stated any consideration for what if wikileaks is a compromised platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   One of us (me) is saying question everything, while the other is saying 'if you think wikileaks is compromised YOU are a shill'. Which one sounds more aligned to an agenda or paradigm. Again, I stand for questioning everything, you stand for questioning everything BUT wikileaks. A bit strange for a Conspiracy theorist, no? Perhaps you do not consider yourself a CT'er, I do.

                    I stated the CIA would benefit from your post.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I questioned the timing of the creation of your account 3 hours before your post.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I questioned you posting this thread 4 days after Vault 7 with 99% of its content yet to be seen.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    By encouraging distrust in wikileaks you encourage distrust in whatever the rest of vault7 reveals. Which in turn benefits the CIA/ whomever is exposed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You say question everything, then state that you accept Vault 7 as truth.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I trust wikileaks' 10 year flawless record of publishing verified material. If it was not for their credibility and the credibility of the Podesta Emails they published, pizzagate would not exist.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So, to a discerning reader, you are attacking the foundations of pedo/pizzagate.  "trust no one" - "believe nothing" - what you effectively mean is, don't trust wikileaks emails which are the strongest piece of evidence we have in a fight against the most powerful criminal elite in the world.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Your description of all living people lacking credibility while the dead are/were credible threats via their death creates an outcome without any possibility of "live acquittal."

                       I do not see how the CIA benefits from being charged with complicitness and collusion with pizzagte crimes and myriad millions of others.

                       What does my tenure have to do with the content? I only ever post once with one handle, then move on to the next, as I do not trust Voat, not any other CT forum, within which I only every post anonymously and from behind a proxy. What that has to do with my belief that Vault 7 is real, and that the CIA is then involved in EVERYTHING is nothing.

                       Vault 7 and everything that wikileaks or any other source divulges SHOULD be distrusted and scrutinized. Why would we feel any different about this source as opposed to another. ALL should be treated with speculation and cynicism IMHO, EVEN THOUGH I do at this point accept the portion of Vault 7 released as truth.

                       Yes. I accept it as truth. I question the why and who are revealing it. Additionally, I do not suggest anyone do or think what I do, I am merely suggesting to use common sense and come to ones own conclusions.

                       As is your choice. Nothing wrong with that. I am merely suggesting that we consider the who and the why behind the info, NOT that the info itself is inherently flawed. More the 'Cui bono' element of everything.

                       Perhaps that is one interpretation. To be clear, I AM 100% behind the exposure of pizzagate and pedogate and ALL of its constituent parts. What I am trying to impart is that wikileaks is not to be trusted. Meaning, that the intentions, and perhaps true puppet masters behind it, are not what we are led to believe. The information, however, does appear to stand up to scrutiny over time. Again, I am suggesting we not trust that it is what we all wish to believe it is, on our side. It is a very real possibility to me, that it is just another element of social engineering targeting us. It can only work if we believe/trust it to be what that want us to think it is. And that can only happen by building itself up as legitimate, truthful, and accurate. Is it beyond the realm of possibility that it is a wolf in sheep clothing? A operation? And intel platform? Certainly not.

                      I've been calling out Fake / Staged events for years now. I've studied them closely. I've made long lists and compiled evidence. Our Forum was taken down Dec. 10th soon after I started linking here.

                      We found incidents of wierd Media coverage around Pizza since Dec. 2015.

                     <p>
                      One of our members who lives in St. Louis felt he could discern what he called a Pizza Cult. So we started collecting data. I thought it was more or less a lark. But as the data started to accumulate I realized there was something weird going on.

                      I study the fake events.. And ironically all the people who opposed me and claimed all these staged events [GLADIO] were real as dipicted on the Mainstream, are the very ones now called "Pizzagate" fake and staged.

                      It is a Brock talking point: "it's a LARP!". And people are taken in by this and do believe it. Beliefs are very strong. And people can tenaciously "know" things that are indeed unfounded beliefs only.

                      I distrusted Assange and Snowden and all the rest of the whistle-blower Media darlings because I knew they failed to mention anti - war, and the Elephant in the Living Room , 9/11..

                      I knew they were working for someone and I never followed it. Also the "Guy Fawkes" mask is the Cabal making fun of everyone who wears it. Since it's the mask of a patsy.

If the Soros trained liberals get in mobs and start to kill Trump people and take back control of the goverment. Well, then I could say I was wrong. So what. But I don't think I am.

                      I believe Wiki changed brands when "Assange" was taken from the Embassy. My working assumption is that he was rescued by the good guys.. He himself was likely sold by a breeding and child trafficking cult.

                      Four.. For me, since I've known from my research for a very long time how big are the lies out there, I trust the Wikileaks. Does anyone question people and get called on the rug for believing the fucking bull dung Fake News , which is everywhere! Are they asked to prove the Foundation of the Belief in it? No never. It's taken as axiomatically true.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I know the motive for all the False Flags [GLADIO - take away guns, soften the population for Fascism ] . What is the motive for the Wikileaks dump, if it is not real? I fail to think of one.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      [Maybe to give one faction power over another? Or to get back at enemies.. That's only plausible for the original Wikileaks - Not for the Vault &amp;7

                     <p>
                      One may be blind to the motive and still know if an action or event was done / occurred or not. You look at the evidence - but that is only if you have evidence.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There is no evidence that the Wikileaks dumps are fake. It's just speculation.

                     <p>
                      So in the case where you lack evidence you, at least, need to provide a plausible motive..

                     <p>
                      There is massive evidence that the Mainstream is fake, And we know the motive!

                     <p>
                      Five. Yes, exactly. Can you describe a plausible motive for faking it?

                      I could waste the rest of my life chronicling the "Lies of the NY Times" and still only get one percent done.. Why is no one talking about that? e.g.  How they cover for War? And Lie every day?

                      Six. The constant harping on distrust without discussing the material and, as others have said, when there has not been time to examine it all, in any case, is 100% out of Brock's Blue Book.

                     <p>
                      I'm refraining from calling anyone a "Brockette" but you can be brainwashed and influenced by them without being them. That is their whole point - to propagate a viewpoint. That's why they call it "Propaganda".

                     <p>
                      Brock and his Blue Boys [or whatever gender assignment they prefer] are trying desperately to dampen this.. Trying to make people feel they will be subject to a "GOTCHA" moment.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Tell me : Who's going to say "GOTCHA?"

                     <p>
                      This goes back to "what is the motive?" Some people claim it's to keep everyone's eyes away from something else going on, i.e. the Bankers stealing the wealth - but that itself is an element of Pizzagate / Pedogate!; so the logic there does not hold.

Surely NOT those who would have interest in controlling said sources, the narrative at large, or the general tenor of the consciousness and desire for uprising, which falls perfectly into the problem reaction solution formula of social engineering. No, must be a shill...

                    I dont know where you get the impression that I am bothered by people studying the content- I do so myself...
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    My point is to question the motivation, timing, and orchestrators behind the revelation of the information, the platform itself.

                    Conviction: a strong persuasion or belief
I disagree that people need beliefs. People need knowledge and wisdom, which come from facts,  and personal experience. Beliefs are something else entirely, and do not have to have anything to do with the truth. I do not suggest anything outside of ones own personal experience or one's intuition/common sense/gut feelings be 'trusted'.

                   <p>

                 Yes, agree -- and the OP should be under even more criticism for its attempt to smear Assange.

                 Other than the Founders, the most serious betrayal of the nation (and now eventually the world) was the setting up of the CIA via Allen Dulles ...  and Dulles served Elites all over the world - the very Elites who had put Hitler in power.

                 Butler is the guy who lays the cards on the table re our government/MIC serving Elites.
                 <br/>
                 Read his "War is a Racket!" on line and very quickly read.
Smedley is also the guy who broke up the attempt to assassinate FDR

                 Keep in mind that our Founders didn't do what your teachers told you they did -- rather they created an Elite patriarchy,
endowed them with land grants, gave them immense influence control over our "people's government," the nation's wealth and natural resources.  Our Founders protected the system of Slavery for Elites which guaranteed the Civil War separating the nation North/South which continues to echo even today.  And continued on with genocide vs native Americans, kidnapping them and forcing them into "Church schools" where they were abused in every way possible -- hangings, beatings, murder, sexual abuse.  See:  Where White Men Fear to Tread by Russell Means.

                  Yes using early assange rothschilds connections doesn't verify implication imo. Surely any person in the world that they view as a potential tool of power they will attempt to control. Hence working with him. But really can't see how his current actions fall in line with globalist agenda

                   Agree with what you're saying.
And purpose of what the OP did seemed mainly to raise questions re Assange.
Very much hope someone is feeding him enough on CIA to dent it a good bit - while hoping for total shredding.

             Big things always have inauspicious beginnings. Podesta emails lead to the worldwide Pedogate simply because an IT guy working for Podesta accidentally said "this is a legitimate email" to a phishing attempt. If it werent' for these words by the IT fixit guy we would never be where we are today!
So we can all thank a clueless IT technician for the treasure trove we received.

             I've been thinking about this for a long time too.  The factions have in-fighting but the Rothschild  group likes to sponsor both sides to the middle, funding and arming AlQuaida,  Isis for two examples.  They have a twisted and perverted  propensity for making citizens into ignorant and useful obedient slaves.

             I've wondered about Julian Assange role in this play, but on introspection it appears to be self revealing in line with history repeating itself.

             I don't think pizzagate was meant to gain public protest with any type of longevity, similar  to Belgium's short-lived protest or  the UK's tolerance in spite of msm not even attempting to hide the facts,      These  leaders don't know what to do with this pizzagate  wild card and are trying to manipulate it to their advantage.

             They've always used  men, women and children as pawns and war soldiers and causalities in their game and they've never had any ethics with which to gauge or measure.    Their game rules has always worked to produce  order out of chaos.  They produce the chaos and control it with order, usually mass genocide.
            </p>
            <p>
             What are these diabolical evil  things playing at now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Leaders don't care that they use children as pawns.  At least that much should be clear to the public but the public are still sleeping and can't see it.

              sometimes i wonder if Julian Assange even knew about p-gate when he released the emails... had he figured it out from the emails or was it just a fortuitous accident by hive mind? to me this seems a fundamental question.

               I am sure he knew the pedo elite, but not so sure he made the same connections we did on the Podesta emails. Even the wikileaks account found those suspect emails, "interesting."

                mmmhmmm. i think you are right. he knew about the pedo elite the same way David Icke knows, but maybe didn't know about the particular criminals (podestas, clintons, et al) possibly implicated by the particular emails he released. there was lots of fishy stuff in those emails, so his instincts were right either way. we think.

               Manchurian Assassins were always a fail. They use cultists and psychos for that. 
They can break a mind but it's hard to create one 
The person they use for killing has to be trustworthy.

               Yes,  when we look at how many people are apathetic, desenstized  we can see leaders use the same type of techniques on a wider social scale.   The survival instinct kicks in even though people are involved in something that is harmful.  Ritual programming on small scale  alternates  drama, pain and reward polarities too, as part of disorientation toward personal ethics. 
Moral relativism produces an excuse to remain engaged in sado while upholding it, enabling it, denying it or excusing it.

               Maybe the deepest type of love is to  look within  and identify these  broken components, stand up and make a different choice.

                 we are going to have to get our hands very dirty for this to finally be taken down once and for all.
                </strong>
                It is going to get way worse before it gets better, and right now I think we are in a situation of the "calm before the storm."  I believe one of these days, someone in the right place is going to say the right thing at the right time, or we are going to uncover something more damning than we previously have, and we are going to take the country and the world back by storm.  That's my prediction.

                 It's also possible that the key may simply be a brilliant marketing campaign. Make truth and justice (in the real world) seem hip and intriguing. Just something to get the ball rolling.

             I think your observations are right on. I don't think they meant it to get out either though, because of the desperate scramble to lable it "fake news". I think it is two mafia groups battling, each exposing damaging info on the other.

              This is him speaking with Alex Jones.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was a CIA psychiatrist?  He likely was apart of MKULTRA type programs.  He seems to KNOW Obama is CIA and says Obama´s mother and grandparents were also CIA.    Alex Jones makes statements occasionally about Pedophilia but they never talk about the Rothschilds or Jews or the Masonic control.  They hint Trump was DRAFTED to run by them two years ago.  This might be a move by Israel to control the growing anti Globalist movement.  A way to build a GREATER ISRAEL and leave the monetary control of the world still in the hands of the Globalist.

               Definitely believe the link to Obama and his lineage. I've studied that enough to know there was a definitive link between grandparents and the "little red church" in WA as well as his mom being involved in microcredit before anyone understood what that racket was all about. And BHO himself was always the classic sociopath. People who idolize him always force their own ideals onto him, as if he represents those things, without any evidence he is what they assume he is. Like a blank sheet with no real values that people than can just formulate in their own minds. Psychologically speaking it's fascinating, but real world it has been a shitshow.

            Of course. The CIA, needs to be outed and burnt wholesale independent of pizzagate. The fact that they had untold evidence of such criminality merely highlights the side of truth and justice upon which they have always resided.

            Spying is illegal in every country. Their charter is to break laws. And all nations have such 'intelligence' gathering agencies.

             Because there is no authority on earth that can prosecute sovereigns. So dirt or no dirt on the bloodlines, they are immune to the prosecution of the system that they themselves lord over.

             They are, however, not immune to being exposed to the world and whatever vigilante justice that may bring to their hidden enclaves.

Is that a poor attempt at deflection? Ouch.
 Documentation of depravity does not need to be only personal. Entertainers Governments and Bankers are easy to destroy.
Just go after what the greedy covet. Fame, fortune and defensive security is easier to destroy than build.

               Deflection? Surely not. Merely pointing out the facts. The bloodliners that rule this global human plantation are sovereigns. Thus they fall under no wartime admiralty law jurisdictions. Anywhere. The rest of what you state is clearly agreeable.

                 If you think that these families are subject to the laws of nations, any nation, then you have a different understanding of jurisdiction than the law itself.

                 A sovereign is not subject to maritime admiralty law. They do not fall under the jurisdiction of the UCC, as they do not exist as 'property' nor 'corporations'.

                   When you print the money and own all of the assets that have been used as collateral to use and borrow said money, do you really have a 'lot to lose'?  Perhaps, but it is akin to the masters and the slaves. Unless they ALL arise at once, the masters have little to fear.

                  <p>
                   Why would I be worried? I have nothing to do with 'them'. And additionally, perhaps you missed my handle- JustARyde- it's all just a rude. One finite experience along and infinite continum. Nothing to worry about. Ever.
