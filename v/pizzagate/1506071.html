<p>Forbes warns about fake news while spreading fake news. 
&quot;Fake stories even inspired one crazed gunman to open fire at a Washington, DC pizzeria where he believed Hillary Clinton ran a child sex ring&quot; 
See what they did there? &quot;Hillary Clinton ran a child sex ring&quot; .... I never heard a single person claim hillary herself runs a trafficking ring. But of course they have to lie and make the whole cause sound unbelievably outrageous because they can\'t really argue about the real facts.
The article is waste of time by the way. MSM is a huge joke now they just quote each other while trying to reaffirm that they are legit. This article quotes buzz feed as a source lmao. And then they suggest &quot;real news like &quot; like &quot;The Washington Post, New York Times, New York Magazine, Politico, Vox, Google News&quot; haha Echo chambers.
 The artlice is not about pizzagate but they sneaked in a few jabs at it. Im pretty sure they wrote this whole garbage article just to insert that false crap about pizzagate. 
Stay strong and don\'t give up. When they attack us it motivates us. Crap like this doesnt discourage us. They actually look very desperate at this point.</p>',
