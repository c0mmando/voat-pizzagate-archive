<p>About Ronald Perelman (yes he\'s in Epstein\'s Black Book) <a href="http://archive.is/fJnnu">http://archive.is/fJnnu</a> and this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>...former Marvel Entertainment Group owner Ronald Perelman, which is no surprise given Perelman’s financial dealings. Chairman of Marvel from 1989 to 1996 after his company MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings bought Marvel from New World for $82.5 million, he called it a mini-Disney and took the company public in 1991, selling 40% of the stock, and making $40 million for his company in the process, the rest being invested into the publisher, buying Panini, Heroes World Distribution,  SkyBox International, Fleer and ToyBiz, which brought in Avi Arad and Ike Perlmutter and setting up the Marvel Films division, before Perlman directed the release of half a billion dollars in bonds. The collapse of the comics speculator market that Marvel had fostered, the failure of Heroes World distribution, the effect on Fleer of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, and Panini poor performance led to Marvel firing 275 employees, a full merger with Toy Biz using shares Perelman owned individually, and issuing more shares, to find the setting up of Marvel Studios. And in December 1996 with all these financial pressure, Marvel filed for bankruptcy. Perelman was replaced on the board by new investor Carl Icahn who blocked Perelman’s plans. A decade later, Perelman paid $80 million to settle a lawsuit accusing him of helping divert over half a billion dollars when he controlled the company.</p>

<li>
Later this company was turned into Perelman’s private holding. </li>

<li>
Ronald and his father are listed on the Philanthropy’s Top 50.</li>
<li>

<p>The Island is a playground for the very rich or well known celebrities who descend there for big events like New Year\'s Eve parties on luxery yachts.  Ronald Perelman was a regular.</p>
