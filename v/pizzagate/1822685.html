             1) the official video on vimeo is translated verry well, but i know the TEXT version i shared yesterday apenrently is not very well translated.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             2) You can go to the Linkedin of "Bank of joy" and see if you can find connections. in his older lecture video's i didn't hear any new info related to his past work, beside it being located in Brussel.   and possible he did hint about it in his tweets or facebook page.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             Apparently linking to linkedin is not allowed here..

         <div class="md">
          <p>
           <p>
            I made contact with the interviewer and maker of the video because she left a  (positive) comment on my (English voice over) upload version:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84vbw_flvqA">
             Ultimate Red Pill Ronald Benard- English Voice Over Version
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I contacted the creators because I thought they should be aware of the fact that a music company made a copyright claim as soon as I uploaded the video. ( I should have trimmed the music off at beginning and end) Also, I was not planning to monetize the video because i am not the creator.
           </p>
           <p>
            I presumed the creators had already paid to license the music, and (personally) I felt like the music company should not get paid twice and scoop up funding that should go to the creators.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her reply to me indicated they were very new to online media and just started their YouTube channel at this link:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvbkPculjIPn0ufvroG7sg">
             DVM TV
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I also mentioned that, in my estimation, the video's cumulative views over many channel uploads will probably reach over 1 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            She expressed her preference as to having NO advertising associated with or 'disturbing' the videos.
She said they preferred donations which can be made on their website:
            <a href="https://cooperatiedevrijemedia.nl/real-big-money-revelations-by-an-insider-video/">
             Website for DVM TV donations
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, if the music company is claiming any of the Ronald videos that include the intro and outro music on Youtube, that takes away the control of the creators to decide if adverts are displayed.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the point here is that, I believe this 'viral' trend of the video is a complete surprise to them and they are probably trying to sort it all out.

            What a load of shit. If you have the real goods on supposed child sacrifice and these other things, why would you start talking about Jewish tribes in Babylon and books about Jews? Shouldn't you be busy naming names instead of religions?

             Answer to your first question: because that's the history of this insanity.
Answer to your second question: no, he signed a contract not to name people, organisations and companies, otherwise he will get killed
What's your contract?

              That ain't how it works. They kill you
              <em>
               before
              </em>
              you can name names. There would be no legitimate reason for him to allow the people doing the child sacrifices to continue killing children.

             Sorry but this is not the point, its about he "use" this story for his bank. (so you would expect one reply.)

             Now he have part of his lecture going viral....   the point is you would expect a reply because its part of what he wants to do with his business. So one reason for a reply could be business opportunity. or because he want to solve the issues, the issues he also described in his lectures.

              This is not a witnesses with a block of pixels on top of his head, or some robotic voice-over... he want you to know who he is, and he have a mission
             </strong>
             that's why he shares his past in this video interview and lectures, he want you to know about his past and the solutions they came up with, for example the new banking initiative.

               Im not trying to prove anything so how can i be a liar?. and he doesn't owe anyone anything i agree.

              <p>
               I feel confused about him being a former bankster and starting a new bank and new currency, he also blames one religion, now the world know about him and his bank... im curious what he can/will bring us.

            I personally don't think he believed his interview was to go viral. I think he was simply sharing his story. Hence why he probably is not responding to his sudden fame. He's probably gone through and seen a lot. Not probably, I'm sure he has.

             Does anyone know if he speaks English? I noticed his twitter was not in Eng.  That may be why the lack of response.  The vid was ins. which
             <strong>
              anyone in his position would be nuts not to do!
             </strong>
             .That was raw emotion &amp; truly embraced honesty.  I don't believe it was all just a ploy for the B of Joy.  I hope others, see his courage and follow him to the light.

             cant agree with you on the first part, and he is not just sharing his story, the bank was there before the viral video. the viral video is basically part of the bank....
            </p>
            <p>
             If there was only his confession i could agree with you, but because of the new bank initiative you would expect him to catch up with the thing going viral,

            <p>
             -edit- especially because its part of his lectures.

            I think we need to do an effort to start blasting this video out there on all social media we can and trying pushing it even more mainstream.

             This video is powerful because of his obvious sincerity.  I think it's one of the most powerful tools of persuasion we have been given to date when it comes to red-pilling Average Joe.  I've been reposting again and again with headings along the lines of: "FB/Twitter keeps removing this video - WHY dont they want you to see it?"  (it hasn't actually ever been removed but it's my attempt to click bait others into watching it).
