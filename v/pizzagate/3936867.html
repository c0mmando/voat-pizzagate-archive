<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p>Okay, so in my previous submission, I inferred a margin of disbelief or at least skepticism of the narrative surrounding the &quot;primary suspect&quot; thought to be responsible for the shooting, Roy Den Hollander. I still maintain a strong degree of skepticism but in light of information brought to my attention over the past several hours by various sources, that skepticism has \'evolved\' somewhat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let\'s get a small detail out of the way first. In <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3935176/24833687">a comment</a> in the previous submission, I wondered if the suspect had been found wearing a FedEx uniform. Per the following article, it turns out he was. (Yes, I\'m taking RT reporting with a grain of salt on this, but nonetheless...)</p>
<p>rt.com - <em>(Jul 21, 2020) &quot;DB-Epstein lawyer shooting suspect worked for ‘CIA of Wall Street,’ did ‘men’s-rights activism,’ and had no clear personal motive&quot;</em>: <a href="https://archive.is/4NVJr">https://archive.is/4NVJr</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other than the FedEx uniform he was wearing when discovered and a package in his car addressed to the judge, however, it’s not clear what links him to the scene – or what his motive was, if indeed he was the shooter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article however goes on to reveal a bit of a twist, which I personally had not yet come across having not yet cross referenced the suspect\'s self-published resume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not mentioned in the sensationalistic media coverage of Den Hollander’s past is the lawyer’s stint with Kroll Associates, a shadowy firm with ties to US and Israeli intelligence. Known informally as the “private CIA,” Kroll’s ranks were stacked with former agents of the CIA, FBI, Mossad, and MI6. A member of the Bush family sat on its advisory board before that was dissolved in 1991, and then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton hired the firm during his first presidential campaign that same year. Den Hollander officially worked for Kroll from 1999 to 2000, but given that the company has long worked closely with lawyers, his relationship with it may have begun (or continued) in an unofficial capacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<p>Here is the stint with Kroll Associates as mentioned by him in his online resume: <a href="https://archive.is/fjrea#selection-185.0-189.109">https://archive.is/fjrea#selection-185.0-189.109</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kroll Associates Russia</strong>, Moscow, Russia, 1999-2000</p>
<p>Managed and upgraded Kroll’s delivery of intelligence and security in the former Soviet Union.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which incidentally ties in with his claim (transcribed in previous submission) that his ex wife is a &quot;Russian Mafia Prostitute&quot;, and further claims published by him which state that he actually met her while working for Kroll Associates Russia:</p>
<p>heavy.com - <em>(Jul 20, 2020) &quot;Roy Den Hollander: ‘Anti-Feminist’ Lawyer Suspected of Murdering Judge’s Son&quot;</em>: <a href="https://archive.is/HFPVu">https://archive.is/HFPVu</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An article he posted to his website contains extended angry disparagements against his ex wife. “While managing a private detective agency in Russia, I met and married this 6’ 1”, vatdyed blonde with grey-blue wolf eyes. Brought her to NYC.” He claimed she became a stripper and he found out unsavory aspects of her past and believed she “had married me for a green card” so he kicked her out of their apartment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can confirm, he does in fact say this but it is in his &quot;Cyclopedia&quot; (PDF WARNING), not one of the site articles. It can be found at the bottom of page 12. I understand the expectation that I link to it, but to be perfectly honest, I am severely averse to posting a link to the dreck he spouts (I shall edit it in if requested by a mod).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="md-section-2"></h1>
<p>Getting back to the RT article, which we last left off with some bizarre and tantalizing information/claims about Kroll Associates, whom Hollander claims repeatedly to have worked for in Russia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that Judge Salas was assigned to a lawsuit by Deutsche Bank investors against the firm less than a week before her son and husband were shot, Kroll’s connections with that bank are also noteworthy – and absent from any media speculation on Den Hollander’s motives.</p>
<p>After leaving Kroll Associates in 2008, founder Jules Kroll launched Kroll Bond Rating Agency, a credit rating agency that has become something of a second home for high-ranking Deutsche Bank staff, employing over half a dozen VP-level and above staff. The cozy “revolving door” relationship has seen KBRA vociferously defend Deutsche Bank in the press against allegations of wrongdoing – no matter how well-founded.</p>
<p>The suit in Salas’s court alleged the bank had failed to vet “risky” clients like Jeffrey Epstein, the notorious (and now deceased) pedophile suspected of having his own rather extensive ties to Israeli and US intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not yet been able to verify that DB staff share common ground with Kroll Bond Rating Agency, but things get juicer ahead in the article and that\'s where my focus is for the purpose of this submission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Vanity Fair, Kroll himself was hired by newspaper baron and Israeli spy Robert Maxwell – father of now-imprisoned alleged Epstein madam Ghislaine Maxwell – to uncover “people out to get him, to destroy his empire, to cripple him financially, and to destroy his life and business in any way they could.” Maxwell died under mysterious circumstances – also officially declared suicide, despite considerable evidence to the contrary – before he could compile the “memorandum of suspicions and unexplained events” he planned to send Kroll, the magazine claimed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait... <strong><em>what?!</em></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, you read that right, approximately a decade prior to Hollander working with Kroll Associates, Kroll got involved with Robert Maxwell at a time when he was apparently thinking of blowing the whistle...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="md-section-3"></h1>
<p>Although the following article (linked to via the above RT article) quite conspicuously tries to simultaneously paint Robert Maxwell as this poor victim <em>and</em> crazy/paranoid/without hope, it does speak in detail about the meeting between Jules Kroll and Maxwell.</p>
<p>vanityfair.com - <em>(MARCH, 1992) &quot;THE SINKING OF CAPTAIN BOB&quot;</em>: <a href="https://archive.is/Llcrt#selection-755.0-767.270">https://archive.is/Llcrt#selection-755.0-767.270</a></p>
<p>The article itself <em>is</em> quite extensive and contains more potentially useful information, but keeping to the topic here...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maxwell had been warning his family for some time that unspecified enemies were out to get him. Indeed, two weeks before his death he had met in the penthouse suite of New York\'s Helmsley Palace Hotel with Jules Kroll, the head of Kroll Associates, a worldwide private-investigation firm that specializes in work for corporate C.E.O.\'s, multimillionaires, and politicians. Maxwell had ushered Kroll and two other men out onto the patio so that their conversation could not be overheard or bugged. Kroll had a thick dossier on Maxwell, compiled in the days when he had helped William Jovanovich, the chairman of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, beat off Maxwell\'s hostile takeover bid for that publishing conglomerate.</p>
<p>Now, to break the ice, Kroll reportedly said, &quot;Let me start the conversation this way. I will never be on the other side of you again, whether this meeting results in an assignment or not. From here on in, you never have to worry about me being against you. I am conflicted out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very solemn meeting, and it went on for a couple of hours,&quot; said one of the participants. &quot;The sum and substance was that Maxwell was convinced that there were people out to get him, to destroy his empire, to cripple him financially, and to destroy his life and business in any way they could. He named businessmen and political enemies— his paper was the only national paper that supported the Labour Party—and he asked Kroll to undertake to find out who was behind all this. I remember Maxwell saying, \'It\'s one thing for people to speculate whether I\'m overleveraged or if I can make this payment or that payment. But this is going far beyond that.\' &quot;</p>
<p>The meeting broke up with Maxwell\'s promising that he would send Kroll what he called &quot;a memorandum of suspicions and unexplained events.&quot; &quot;Maxwell was working on this compendium,&quot; said the participant, &quot;when he met his death.&quot; Kroll Associates was never formally hired.</p>

<hr />
<p>I\'m still not sure <em>exactly</em> what this picture paints, but something tells me that this investigation should continue and turn over every stone imaginable. I can understand the FBI now saying Hollander is the &quot;primary suspect&quot;, but I posit that there\'s far more to uncover than just some aging woman-hating edgelord cracking the sads one day and \'going postal\'... (I\'ll see myself out after that horrid pun, mea culpa)</p>',

           Although the following article (linked to via the above RT article) quite conspicuously tries to simultaneously paint Robert Maxwell as this poor victim
           <em>
            and
           </em>
           crazy/paranoid/without hope, it does speak in detail about the meeting between Jules Kroll and Maxwell.

           The article itself
           <em>
            is
           </em>
           quite extensive and contains more potentially useful information, but keeping to the topic here...
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Maxwell had been warning his family for some time that unspecified enemies were out to get him. Indeed, two weeks before his death he had met in the penthouse suite of New York's Helmsley Palace Hotel with Jules Kroll, the head of Kroll Associates, a worldwide private-investigation firm that specializes in work for corporate C.E.O.'s, multimillionaires, and politicians. Maxwell had ushered Kroll and two other men out onto the patio so that their conversation could not be overheard or bugged. Kroll had a thick dossier on Maxwell, compiled in the days when he had helped William Jovanovich, the chairman of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, beat off Maxwell's hostile takeover bid for that publishing conglomerate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, to break the ice, Kroll reportedly said, "Let me start the conversation this way. I will never be on the other side of you again, whether this meeting results in an assignment or not. From here on in, you never have to worry about me being against you. I am conflicted out."
           </p>
           <p>
            "It was a very solemn meeting, and it went on for a couple of hours," said one of the participants. "The sum and substance was that Maxwell was convinced that there were people out to get him, to destroy his empire, to cripple him financially, and to destroy his life and business in any way they could. He named businessmen and political enemies— his paper was the only national paper that supported the Labour Party—and he asked Kroll to undertake to find out who was behind all this. I remember Maxwell saying, 'It's one thing for people to speculate whether I'm overleveraged or if I can make this payment or that payment. But this is going far beyond that.' "
           </p>
           <p>
            The meeting broke up with Maxwell's promising that he would send Kroll what he called "a memorandum of suspicions and unexplained events." "Maxwell was working on this compendium," said the participant, "when he met his death." Kroll Associates was never formally hired.

           what this picture paints, but something tells me that this investigation should continue and turn over every stone imaginable. I can understand the FBI now saying Hollander is the "primary suspect", but I posit that there's far more to uncover than just some aging woman-hating edgelord cracking the sads one day and 'going postal'... (I'll see myself out after that horrid pun, mea culpa)

            Heavy just did a huge disinfo campaign against someone recently. Never to be trusted ever, but surprisingly, in the past, had some truth inserted. RT is, well, RT. It is so important to archive these old articles because of the truths and the lies. Who leaked this "information" to Vanity Fair, the snob site? Leaks everywhere are hard to pinpoint. It's like, "Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  Six ways because they rest on Saturday? 7 days in a week folks. They start on Sunday.

             Other than the FedEx uniform he was wearing when discovered and a package in his car addressed to the judge, however, it’s not clear what links him to the scene – or what his motive was, if indeed he was the shooter.

            What better way to create a believable patsy than to dress up the killer and the patsy in a recognisable uniform and leave a parcel with the victims address on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The guy might have some pretty shady shit in his past.  Maybe that's how they found him. Still seems really fishy too me though.

             Well yeah, the question is raised as to where the fuck he would even get the uniform or the package.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can they establish that he either worked for or knew anyone working at FedEx?
            </p>
            <p>
             Did he rob (and/or harm in the process) a FedEx worker he somehow knew would have a parcel for her?
            </p>
            <p>
             Lotta questions still, even more important to investigate with the Kroll link in play.
