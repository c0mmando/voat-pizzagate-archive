<p>April 26, 2019</p>
<p>West Vancouver billionaire and philanthropist Frank Giustra is suing Twitter, claiming the social media giant published defamatory statements about him.</p>
<p>Giustra, the CEO of Fiore Group and founder of Lionsgate Entertainment, has filed a civil claim in Vancouver Supreme Court this week, saying he has been targeted since 2015 by a group who “vilified” him for political purposes in relation to the 2016 United States election.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The targeted attack on the plaintiff was part of an orchestrated campaign to discredit the plaintiff in part because of his charitable and philanthropic work in support of the Clinton Foundation,” the claim states. “Twitter began publishing a number of defamatory and malicious statements regarding the plaintiff.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Some of the posts noted in the suit are that he is “corrupt,&quot; a “murderous thief,” a “criminal” and that he was involved in Pizzagate, a “discredited and malicious conspiracy theory in which he was labeled a ‘pedophile’.”</strong></p>
<p>Twitter also published threatening posts, the court documents state, including one that specified Giustra should be killed with “2 bullets to the back of his head.”</p>
<p>Giustra notified Twitter multiple times about the false and defamatory statements and asked that the company put a stop to them. Some were removed, the suit acknowledges, but “Twitter has neglected or refused to remove and continues to publish a large number of false, defamatory, abusive and threatening Tweets.”</p>
<p><strong>Other accusations highlighted by the suit: That he is a pedophile who was involved in a child sex trafficking ring, that he is involved in drug trafficking, that he was involved in the disappearance and death of missing and murdered Indigenous women, that he has committed fraud and that he is under investigation.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Tweets were posted maliciously, with an intention to harm the plaintiff, damage his reputation, or provoke concern for the safety of the plaintiff and his family members. Twitter’s failure to remove the Tweets and prevent the ongoing and continued publication of defamatory and threatening statements regarding the plaintiff is outrageous and has resulted in significant emotional distress and anxiety for the plaintiff and his family.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leading up to 2015, Guistra had a valued and unblemished reputation throughout the province and the world, the claim notes, but as a result of the tweets, Giustra’s personal and professional reputation have been damaged, the claim states.</p>
<p>In the suit, Giustra is asking for a mandatory permanent injunction requiring Twitter to delete the Tweets and to prohibit further publications by its users of materials that are defamatory to him, as well as general damages.</p>
<p>The civil claim contains nine pages featuring more than 100 Tweets posted between June 2015 and April 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Please retweet. <strong>Pedos like Clinton Foundation board member, Frank Giustra have not only stolen &amp;amp [sic] raped the children of Haiti; they’ve raped Haiti’s resources.</strong> (...) one of the cited Tweets reads.</p>
<p>“NWO Eugenicist Bill Gates has given over $25m to the Clintons. So has corrupt mining exec Frank Giustra,” another stated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No statement of defense has been filed and the claims have not been heard in court.</p>
<p>Twitter has declined comment on the story.</p>

            Fucking guy never sued me though for claiming I was one of the original people starting LionsGate. Interesting huh?? I work as a dishwasher in a restaurant now and I guess Giustra bought almost every single supporter I ever had. I am no longer in the enetretainment industry, I am not allowed to even audition for film or voice work. ALL the agents, Jordan and Assoc., Lesa Kirk, Glen Talent and EVERYONE in L.A can not and will not EVER suggest me for a film. That's okay. In large part that is why I wrote and directed my own feature film. RENT THAT if you want to help me. I'll bet ya, it is one of the best films you will see this year. No, I am not an egomaniac, it is really that good

            Twitter is doubling down.  I had an account with 1000+ followers suspended.  They had shadow banned me after I posted lots of pizzagate stuff. They deleted numerous tweets to L Lin Wood, lawyer for John Ramsey. None were abusive, threatening or harassing; they simply provided links to credible information that John Ramsey was involved in a child sex trafficking ring, that Jon Benet's autopsy report showed long-term sexual abuse, that her injuries were consistent with what was usually done to little children being raped and filmed, that a former victim of John Ramsey and his best friend had come forward to police with her account of being a victim in a child rape ring, that only when diplomats' children go missing are police authorities told to stand down (which was done the morning of Jon Benet's death).  I'm pretty sure that L Lin Wood would have made Twitter take down all those tweets.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also tweeted about Giustra a lot when pizzagate first broke.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's pretty clear that rich people call the shots at Twitter.

              Google Jon Benet and nothing about the research of Donald Freed (visiting professor at Loyola Marymount University) or Stephen Singular comes up. Yet these men each investigated and researched this case for more than year.
             </p>
             <p>
              A ransom note (which the Ramseys claimed they found) triggers the FBI's jurisdiction. Freed said:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               When its a wealthy corporate executive; and when the note in fact announces that these are foreign terrorists---now every bell in the "national security system" begins to ring---then the interfacing with the CIA, the NSA, the Pentagon; all this unfolds within a matter of minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
               This was a child of a Lockheed Martin executive of a $18 billion a year firm with Pentagon and top secret clearance across the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               For the Director of the FBI in Washington, D.C. to restrain and stand down his own agents in the field; … there can only be one answer. They had to know... BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT that what happened neither affected the security of the United States of America or the security and profits of Lockheed Martin.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Stephen Singular said this:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "I had gone online and looked at pictures of little girls, five and six-year-olds, the same age as JonBenet, who were being used for child pornography purposes. They were being tied up by their hands and ankles ... laid out on tables or hung from ceilings. They were being treated violently, and ropes, scarves, and belts were used to tie them up. These photographic situations looked very similar to the conditions surrounding the death of JonBenet, who was strangled to death with a piece of nylon rope"
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Nancy Krebs came forward but instead of the police taking her claims seriously, she was silenced, stalked and threatened. She was proven to have family links to John Ramsey's best friends. She gave police statements that she had suffered the same kind of abuse that JonBenet had suffered. Nancy had been passed around to be raped by grown men, some of them influential and powerful. JonBenet was found dead just after Christmas.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nancy Krebs had said that was one of the favoured times of the rapists, as bruises would heal before school started. Nancy also said that the head was one of the places where the children would be hit, because the bruises would not be seen under the hair.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nancy said that these grown men would tie a scarf, tie or rope around the victim's neck. The victim would be strangled until they started to choke and moan from lack of air. This, in the perpetrators' minds, would resemble orgasm. It's call sexual asphyxiation. Nancy's life was threatened several times.

            Giustra is the Canadian arm of the Clinton Foundation
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is he getting a pass in the Media?
           </p>
           <p>
            We have done a lot of research on him, how about we put some solid stuff between him, the Clinton's, Soros, and whatever ties we can find
           </p>
           <p>
            He was in on the uranium sale, he's gotten solid mining contracts through Clinton
           </p>

            Flew Bill all over the place

            There's a lot
           </p>
           <p>
            Why isn't his name right in there?
           </p>
           <p>
            His Radcliff Foundation and other 'charities', not to mention the Boards he sits on
           </p>
           <p>
            His entertainment ties brought out a lot
           </p>
           <p>
            Giustra is Canada
           </p>
           <p>
            Carlos Slim...Salinas..Mexico
           </p>
           <p>
            You have Soros....he's all over the place, you know, helping all these people out
           </p>
           <p>
            Giustra name should be right up there with them
           </p>
           <p>
            Puppet Trudeau is starting to fall in the eyes of the Canadian people
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's help topple him

            We need to get Giustra in the news, let's give him something to bitch about

               He's Canadian?   People have short memories..that's the problem.  He doesn't get a pass on this forum though.  And it looks to me like the Clintons et al also get a pass in the MSM, STILL.

             The billionaire linked to the 'Clinton Cash' scandals once said something amazing about doing business with Bill Clinton
            </p>
            <p>
             Billionaire Canadian mining executive Frank Giustra is at the center of a blockbuster series of New York Times reports that raise troubling questions about the finances of the Bill, Hillary, &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the stories detailed how a company Giustra was involved with secured the rights to uranium deposits in Kazakhstan days after a September 2005 meeting between the billionaire, former President Bill Clinton, and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Giustra donated over $30 million to the Clinton Foundation after the Kazakhstan trip.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2006, Giustra appeared in the New Yorker where he was quoted making a comment about his dealings with Clinton that's extremely interesting in light of the various allegations:
            </p>
            <p>
             "All of my chips, almost, are on Bill Clinton," Giustra reportedly said. "He's a brand, a worldwide brand, and he can do things and ask for things that no one else can."

              The International Crisis Group (ICG; also simply known as the Crisis Group) is a transnational non-profit, non-governmental organization founded in 1995 that advertises itself as carrying out field research on violent conflict and says it advances policies to prevent, mitigate or resolve conflict. It advocates policies directly with governments, multilateral organisations and other political actors as well as the media.
             </p>
             <p>
              The organization's actions and funding have been the subject of controversy.
             </p>
             <p>
              A July 2014 special edition of the peer-reviewed journal Third World Quarterly published 10 critiques of the organisation, ranging from its influence on foreign-policy makers, "manufacturing" crises, and the methodologies it deploys in gathering its research.
             </p>
             <p>
              ( look at all the places this group is at)
             </p>
             <p>
              George Soros provided the organization's seed funding and continues to support it.
             </p>

              Crisis Group's "In Pursuit of Peace Award” was established in 2005, and is associated with a gala event in New York City. Recipients include U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush; Hillary Clinton; former Brazilian President Lula da Silva;[21] Nobel Peace Prize laureates Martti Ahtisaari and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and financier and philanthropist George Soros.
             </p>
             <p>
              Recipients for 2018 included Frank Giustra, founder of the Radcliffe Foundation and a prolific entrepreneur and financier, H.R.H. Prince Zeid bin Ra’ad Zeid al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Olympic Refugee &amp; Paralympic Teams.

               Some interesting names indeed.  Olympia Snowe, A Soros &amp; G Soros, Wesley Clark, Larry Summers, Sandy Berger in the past,  and of course F Giustra himself.

                      But Lions Gate quickly learned how Hollywood can chew up a neophyte. Following Lions Gate's announcement, a backlash erupted around Mr. Di Caprio, who was seen to be throwing his weight around in the wake of his huge "Titanic" success. Mr. Di Caprio quickly distanced himself from the role of the killer. His manager insisted he had only been "considering " the offer and no final deal had been struck. Mr. Giustra declines to discuss the affair, saying negotiations are continuing.

                   I stumbled upon some attachments in the Stratfor emails about how Pierre Trudeau changed a ton of foster care/adoption laws in the 70s so that the state could take away children a lot easier. Makes me wonder if Justin Trudeau is a part of all this.

                  <p>
                   Wow.  So Pierre was busy doing what Mondale, Clinton and Newt Gingrich were doing here.  Blast them.

                     Q&amp;A: Philanthropist Frank Giustra Talks Refugee Crisis, Charitable Giving and Advice for Fellow Billionaires
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Ontario native, who has moved from Canadian mining to movies and television, and is particularly focused on the refugee crisis and alleviation of poverty, tells billionaires he meets with to sit down with a piece of paper and try to spend their entire wealth on homes, jets and yachts -- anything, he doesn't care. That's after they set aside enough wealth for their children and grandchildren.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Possibly setting aside their grandchildren as well for FG.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So Giustra urges the wealthy to follow the lead of his Radcliffe Foundation, launched in 1997, and to support international and local causes.  He also has advice to kids and everyday Canadians, particularly to look at private sponsorship model for refugees or help at the community level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Giustra, who has worked with Bill Clinton, George and Amal Clooney and George Soros on international causes, spoke with Samaritanmag about his principles of compassion and giving, how he convinces fellow billionaires to do good and chip in, as well as his experiences in Lesbos helping the refugees, and the focus of his latest film production (screening privately, for now, including tonight, Aug. 1, at talent agency ICM in Los Angeles).

                       He doesn't need much persuasion to get money out of investors or fellow billionaires for they know what the pay off will be.  Lots of money or someone to satisfy their perverted needs. Sick.

                         Yes, blackmail but also the investors are of like mind, imo.  They know what is going on behind closed doors.  At least most of them.  Maybe some don't but there are those that know that the trafficking will pay off big for them.  They are cut out of the same cloth if you know what I mean.  Also one hand washes the other.  Many have their own charities and they invest there as well.  Also they have islands that other investors can visit.  It's all so sickening.  The college payoff scam is such a clever cover up.

                     He may lose, but they will have someone lined up just in case.  They always have someone waiting in the wings.  For sure he is MK.  It was in the plan.  The Manchurian Candidate idea is Chilling. Fidel's son.

                We need someone to remind Giustra he's not a victim

                Slim is tied to the Bushes, Salinas runs everything, Slim a frontman like Soros

               <p>
                Jeb is in charge I think through his long friendship with either son or brother of Salinas

                As President, Clinton did some deals with Mexico SMH

                Giustra is an arm of Clinton's, and make no mistakes, Clinton is an arm of the Bushes, who are deep state

                 Not much left for anyone else in Mexico between Salinas and Slim.  Oh God, people are so clueless not knowing about the Bushes and Clinton.  All the way back to Mena and I believe even before.  Georgie is bad but his dad was horrid, not to mention Prentiss.  I still have my doubts about where George and Barbara are.  If they are really gone, then Wow.  Someone just took them out.

            If he’s not a pedo why the boy lover symbol in blue on the door of his El Pedo (name very similar) all boys charity? He has a number of charities for all boys and one in his home town which was talked about set up like a Sandusky club with big donors. What about Uranium One? What about Haiti and the Clinton Foundation he is a partner in it? This Master Mason lies and deceives with everything he touches so its only obvious he’s going to blackmail and bribe another Freemason judge to sit on the case so he wins.

             The lawsuit is quite interesting. Infamous satanist Michael Aquino sued an internet company that hosted a website where a woman published info about him (citing court documents). He lost the lawsuit.
            </p>
            <p>
             From what I understand that was a milestone ruling at the time, stating that internet companies are not responsible for the content that gets published on their sites. But this new lawsuit is in Canada.

              Huh. I didn't know about the Aquino lawsuit. Hopefully Giustra loses his, too. It's Canada though, so who the hell knows how that will turn out. Funny how these people always try and play the victim.
