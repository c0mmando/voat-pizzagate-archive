<p>ELIZABETH CARLILE = LIZZIE CARLISLE - Loretta\'s maternal grandmother\'s birth name (twice married; later Lizzie Bell then finally Lizzie Harris)</p>
<p>LORETTA LYNCH born 1959, Greensboro NC - was using a fake name to conduct illicit business while Attorney General. MULTIPLE crimes here even before you look at what she was DOING. Just using state apparatus with fake names and illegal accounts is imprisonable, and certainly she should be disbarred.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Parents</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Mother - Lorine Lynch (maiden name Harris) </li>
<li>Father - Rev Lorenzo Lynch (Lorenza but he called himself Lorenzo)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Here\'s proof of Loretta\'s parents name:  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/sV6YO">http://imgur.com/a/sV6YO</a></p>
<p>Here\'s marriage cert for Lorenzo and Lorine Lynch: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/MAEGA">http://imgur.com/a/MAEGA</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>Maternal Grandparents</h1>
<ul>
<li>MGM - Lizzie Harris (first married name = Bell (Beel), maiden name = Carlisle (alt spellings Carliss / Carlile)</li>
<li>MGF - Loveless Harris (alt spellings Lovelace / Loveliss)</li>
</ul>
<p>Much sleuthing by myself and Redditer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/queenicarius">https://www.reddit.com/user/queenicarius</a> have discovered the links.  Confusion lies in Ancestry.com\'s common misinterpretation of name spellings from handwritten certificates and registers. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its BELL and CARLISLE - definitely!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out Loretta\'s maternal grandmother was definitely Lizzie Carlisle as evidenced by her death certificate in 1958 (year before Loretta was born).  Lizzie Carlisle married Walter Bell, who died leaving her with 5 children. She remarried Loveless Harris.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Death Cert - Lizzie Harris: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ox2Vu">http://imgur.com/a/ox2Vu</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now get this - maternal grandparents marriage certificate state her maiden name as LIZZIE CARLISS BEEL (according to ancestry.com) - but this is taken from a hard copy marriage cert which looks to me like LIZZIE CARLILE BELL. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marriage Cert - Lizzie Harris: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/GENDe">http://imgur.com/a/GENDe</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact CARLILE is an alternative spelling of the same root surname, others are CARLYLE, CARLISLE.  Carlisle is the most common spelling of the name.</p>
<p>CARLISS is not common at all - not even in the top 150,000 most common US surnames. Carlile however is in the top 7,000 (source <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/apps/thesweetestsound/popularity-index/popindex.php?name=carlile&amp;Submit=Submit">http://www.pbs.org/pov/apps/thesweetestsound/popularity-index/popindex.php?name=carlile&amp;Submit=Submit)</a>). </p>
<p>On Ancestry.com there are 5,000 records under the surname Carliss for the USA.  There are 140,766 under the surname Carlile. That\'s 28x more</p>
<p>Look at the marriage cert again. It looks like Carlile or even Carlisle to me but to another person it could look like Carliss. But consider the fact Carlile is a more common surname by an order of magnitude - maybe 1 Carliss for every 28 Carlile\'s. So on the balance of probability the name is Carlile.</p>
<p>However all this is irrelevant now we\'ve located the Death Cert of Lizzie Harris which CLEARLY shows the birth name as CARLISLE.</p>
<hr />
<h1>So What?!</h1>
<hr />
<p>The chances of this being a coincidence are astronomical.  Basically, Loretta thought she was being oh-so-clever by doing business under a fake name to hide her connection. Why would anyone do this if its not something that is illegal or would damage her reputation or career in some way.</p>
<p>So the silly bitch uses her maternal grandmother\'s name - LIZZIE CARLISLE. </p>
<p>Even proving her abusing Government email systems with fake accounts, and conducting business without accountability and audit trails, is imprisonable. That\'s before you consider what she was actually up to.</p>
<p>We need to weaponise this and spread the word</p>',

            Ok friends!  If there are no other suggestions, start posting #WhyTheAlias and #GrandmaLynch everywhere.  Go forth and spread the word on Reddit and the chans.  Post these two hashtags on the threads of popular social media figures, Trump supporters, and any other Twitter threads that are relevant with tons of followers.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS:  I realize new people are questioned here, but I want to help!

            I noticed in one of these images that someone had used ((((four)))) parenthesis around a word. I know what 3 parenthesis means but not 4. This is the 3rd time I've seen this in the past few days in separate places so I don't think it was a typo. Does anyone know what it means?

            Hey guys.  I'm brand new.  I saw this over on Pol News Twitter page, and it led me here.  I just wanted to share my hashtag thoughts because I create social media content for an international company.  I'm obviously not all knowing, and I'm aware that this isn't even my place. I also apologize in advance if this is difficult to read, but I am in a car full of people right now and I'm partially distracted lol.
           </p>
           <p>
            My thoughts would be that you have two hashtags trending in this case.  You guys know you need the original, more popular/catchy option to trend, but this hashtag is also meant to create awareness to a casual user.  I personally think you should add a second one that implies that this is suspicious behavior for anyone that sees it.  They should know that these findings need to be followed up with more questions, even if they have no idea why.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in addition to the official one that Voat chooses, I think you should also add something simple around the lines of #WHYTHEALIAS or #WHYTHEALIASLORETTA.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd personally say the first one.  One problem with Twitter is the average user is on their phone and faces the challenge of texting with autocorrect. :)

               Welcome! Your expertise will be greatly appreciated. We are all here to do what we can in the hopes that together we can make a difference and stop the evil people that act out their evil on helpless children and steal their innocence and take their lives as if they had no right to live. I despise these evil elites it is them who have no right to live.

              The first hashtag the user above wrote is hard to read and too long, which makes me suspicious of his agenda. Not only that but he uses the shill template usually popular on 4chan. The template goes something like this
              <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/133504762/#133505239">

              minus the LSD part, i guess they thought the autists will buy the "im very smart".

              Then again, i might be wrong about this guy and he accidentally matches my profile.

            Love the #LynchFakeName - loving it. - How about something like #LorettaLizzieLynch - some alliteration to give it some stick. - #LynchLizzieCarlisle #LizzieOrLynch ?? - Just some thoughts as they came to me. - After watching her snotty responses to the judiciary committee, - can't wait to see this bitch go down with the rest of her rotten crew. - I wonder where Bill Clinton is slithering around lately. Haven't heard much about him or Obama lately. - Wonder who's ear his tongue is flickering around in. - Good work guys.

           <p>
            Thinking she has those alias to accommodate Deep Staters.
I felt like plop...
           </p>
           <p>
            they did use her as a United States Attorney General.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just speculation here.

           <p>
            Loretta married Stephen Hardgrove in 2007.
           </p>
           <p>
            (This could be a separate thread.)

           <p>
            Here are two facts about Ms. Lynch current husband.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is a showtime on-air technician.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most reports say he was present during Loretta's tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton.

            What worse, Twitter's algorithm has marked most content about this as "sensative" meaning you don't see it off the back and need to click "view".
