   Occult primer material. Indespensible for anyone looking into the activities of the ruling class, whether you believe in "woo woo" subjects or not. (Somewhat a response to the Icke vid post)

<p>Many users are correct in thinking Icke\'s material will be too out there for some, but it is, IMO, largely correct in broad outline at least. I hope the pizzagate revelations will open more people up to the kind of world we\'re living in but I understand balking at this kind of material if you\'ve been living in a typical materialist ontological mindset for much of your life. Icke spreads a lot of interesting ideas and his notoriety has done a lot for getting this kind of information out but I don\'t think he\'s the most eloquent or accurate speaker on the subject. For anyone who\'s starting to at least take a look at these kinds of ideas I would recommend this series of talks by Mark Passio:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1V98DsNXi0&amp;t=8s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1V98DsNXi0&amp;t=8s</a> (first part of a three part talk, the other parts should be easy to find in the &quot;related videos&quot;)</p>
<p>It starts out really slow and may be tedious at first for anyone who has a basic background in philosophy but once it gets going it\'s incredibly valuable. He goes through a basic primer on the symbolism of every major Western occult system. In the third part he ends with a rundown of incredibly blatant use of this symbolism in US government and military patches, logos, architecture, etc. (Here\'s that part if you just want to see some of that first: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6E6abDdBII">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6E6abDdBII)</a>)</p>
<p>Once you\'ve gone through the talks (they\'re long, I know, it\'s worth it if you\'re interested though, trust me. You could spend a thousand hours watching random &quot;illuminati&quot; stuff on youtube and reading convoluted ersatz mystical texts trying to learn what Passio lays out in a few hours in these talks.), I would highly recommend you check out this site: <a href="http://montalk.net/">http://montalk.net/</a></p>
<p>IMO, Montalk is the best site on the internet dealing with these topics and providing some kind of overarching theory of what\'s going on (the meat of the big picture is in the &quot;gnosis&quot; section, but just go to the main page, read the main intro, and it will tell you how to start getting into the material on the site. From there you can pick which sections interest you most to start reading there first.)</p>
<p>A lot of people will laugh at this material and dismiss it and that\'s fine. But even if your world view prevents you from taking a lot of these ideas seriously, at least taking the time to learn some of the symbolism laid out in the Passio talks will allow you to parse a new layer of what\'s happening in the world around you. You may not be able to believe in &quot;magic&quot;, &quot;spirits&quot;, aliens, or whatever else, but the ruling class does, or at least they engage in activities designed to interact with these dimensions of life, whether they\'re real or not, and knowing the symbolism involved in these areas can help you see what\'s happening even if only on a completely mundane material level.</p>',
