            Many reasons, for her genetics, or because she has figured out how to somehow survive. Maybe she is useful for the rituals the cabal seem to value so much. I know some of these children are used to help kidnap more children for their abusers....honestly I  have no real reason. Like I said it is just instinct and not wanting to give up hope. Some of these children survive against all hope. Maybe she did!

            Obviously it's because the images match the Podesta brother exactly. The whole thing is also tied to Clement Freud, the fat pedo whose vill a the Podestas were renting at the time of the "disappearance".
When the pedos are elites, it's always covered up.

            What is being left out ... well, actually, a LOT of things are being left out ... but one of the things left out is that the British police are infiltrated by the Freemasons. You can't serve two masters ... cannot. They've bollocksed up other investigations that would have implicated and brought down fellow brethren and they're at it again. An insidious faction did not want that child found! That's the horrific bottom line. Meanwhile, the clock is tick ticking away, and this child is alive and being abused. The whole thing turns my stomach. This mostly reminds me of the Elizabeth Smart case. Remember how the police ignored the only witness, Elizabeth's sister? And how it was only because of the parent's that the sketch was made based on Mary Katherine's recollections ... and then THAT WAS IGNORED!!!! Then the detective found the man, the Smart's reported him, and the police REFUSED TO EVEN CONFRONT HIM!!! They gave some PC excuse about interfering with his right to roam around with identity-cloaked wives when a child was missing! No, it was only after she'd served her purpose that the parents finally got their day and the police finally did their job in questioning this dirt bag pedo, and, oh, guess what? Yeah, it was Elizabeth he was towing around in plain sight! And remember how they tried to pin the blame on the some brother? It was so weird .. very much the same MO at work here.

            Who's ever handling this case should be thrown off of it. Let fresh eyes and somebody not under the influence of Baphomet and spirit cooking take over. So much more to say, but I just want that little girl found. I have a feeling she will be. Maybe it's wishful thinking, but if she is, it'll be a huge sign that this cabal is coming apart. Of course, even when she is found, there'll be a media fight over what she has to say. The same with Elizabeth Smart. She's spoken out against pornography, but there are all the porn-driven addicts slandering her because how the hell dare she rid them of their sick games.

             I had to upvote your comment. The truth is every LE seems to be infiltrated and it is so disheartening to see how obvious they suppress investigations and literally destroy evidence right in our faces! The video of the Dutch financier talking about this luciferian network really made it more real than ever for me. We need to unite so much more as a cause. They are relying on keeping us divided while they operate right out in the open as we fight amongst each other. We need to expose them and educate people. People are literally imprisoned by the brainwashing and gas lighting that simply asking questions labels us as crazies. I believe more than ever that we need to get even more united against this very real and very evil enemy agiainst humanity.

              Thanks. Nicely stated and I couldn't agree more. I get so tired of these abduction cases. It's not bad enough these kids are kidnapped for purposes of molestation, but then we slide off into tangents of her being targeted for all sorts of strange reasons. I want to scream, "The reason is she's a child!" That's all it takes to set these pervs off. I really do hope she's found. Like I said, I do have a feeling that it will happen. A caretaker will become ill ... perhaps suffer from a collapse, and they'll find her.

               I too believe she will be found. There is a reason she is still in the public eye. I do believe there are people working behind the scenes stoking the fire so to speak. Maybe it is just a gut instinct but I think there is more to this story that will come to light. I keep hope for her safe return!

                It's good to know you feel the same way. And she's older now, there's a lot she could say and fill in. I pray someone in a position to help does so. It probably means going rogue, but WTH? There's this girl's life at stake. Who are they to keep her prisoner? They're nobody. Filthy animals that I hope burn in hell for an eternity.

            I'm keen on the notion that the portraits were produced as part of a "parallel investigation" technique in which culprits of similar crimes, in this case international trafficking, are exposed as suspects even though they may not be directly involved in the McCann kidnapping on the theory that they surely know something as part of the criminal brotherhood and/or they are guilty of similar crimes. That would explain why the E-fits were suppressed. The Podestas freaked out at the E-fits and with their connections all the way up to Tony Blair took steps to suppress. There is a combination of controlled opposition and genuine concern swirling around the McManns.

             Kevin Halligen, the PI hired by the Mccanns to " investigate" the case, was a well connected Washington operator and perhaps knew something of Skippy's reputation. With her colorama and suspected IVF Illuminati doner Maddie might well have been a very attractive proposition to someone like the Podestas. Perhaps Skippy got a bit over excited.

            I want to know why the Podestas weren't brought in for questioning by the police after those e-fits were released.  Had it been a normal person, their arse would have been hauled over the coals.

             a million times, the e-fits are based on two different people's descriptions of
             <em>
              one guy
             </em>
             who was decades younger than the Podesta brothers. I know that will never sink into people's thick skulls here but that's how the e-fits have been described in the news all along.

               Where are you getting that from? The three-and-a-half-year-old article that you linked in the OP says, "The E-fits of a ‘new’ suspect for Madeleine McCann’s disappearance were drawn up five years ago – and suppressed. Images of a man seen carrying a child through Praia da Luz at 10pm on the night the then three-year-old vanished were unveiled on BBC1’s Crimewatch two weeks ago."
              </p>
              <p>
               That's "a suspect", "a man", singular,  like I've always seen in the UK news coverage. And that the e-fits "are based on evidence from Irish holidaymaker Martin Smith and his family," and that Smith described the person as a "man he saw carrying a girl around Madeleine’s age at the very time she went missing," like I've always seen. That is a description of an eyewitness account of one person, as I said,  and the name Podesta appears nowhere in the article.

             They at least should be questioned as to their whereabouts on the day Maddie died. Just good coppering. And Skippy deleting his emails from the day before her death does seem very suspicious.

             Podestas also tie to Clement Freud, whose villa was sub leased on the date of Mcann's dissapearance. Villa is located 1km from the incident. There are FBI supressed reports that Pidesta Brothers were renting the villa.

             anyone paid by the mccanns are working for them doing their bidding. the mccanns were definately suspects in their daughters disappearance. maybe throwing the podestas under the bus was the idea of the paedophile ring they belong to maybe they thought it would be funny and a great distraction at the time. the mccanns are just every single shade of wrong.

              Madeleine was a clone, this is why her coloboma changes position in photographs.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a photograph where she has on blue eyeshadow, it is suspected she is not alive in the photograph.

               I think they pimped their daughter out with a view to selling her and things went wrong. It seems that she was being abused by her non-biological father and other members of the Tapas Seven, and perhaps had got to the age where she had started to question what was happening to her. Gerry McCann was heavily in debt at the time, and when asked on the airport bus whether he was looking forward to the holiday grunted "we're not here for fun".
