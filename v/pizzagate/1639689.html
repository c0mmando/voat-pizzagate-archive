There are hundreds if not thousands of people engaging in child sex, child pornography and God knows what else. It has infested DC and it’s a real subculture. </p>
<p>These people all bear obvious similarities. They are mostly all tattooed, inner city-type artists. They’re mostly all either gay or without children themselves, although there are many accounts that are just full of photos of these people’s actual biological children, which is just even more sick. Their accounts revolve around children, photos of their children disguised as “art”, degeneracy, Satanic innuendo and shit, abstract and empty art. They’re all democrats and they worship HRC and Obama. They all seem to eminate the same disgusting, unsettling evil dead-in-the-eyes liberal vibe and LOOK LIKE pedophiles. It’s clear they’re from the same if not immediate but broader social circle.</p>
<p>Pedophilia to these people is a culture and they boast and brag about their activities to each other over Instagram. I have found accounts I am sure are those of child procurers along with “customers” and “traders”. Procurers are mostly all liberal women, and I’m particularly disgusted with the amount of women that seem to be involved in this. Extremely depressing. </p>
<p>There are recurring themes, references and symbols in every single account, usually in the comments from other people, if not blatantly in the photo itself. On studying these accounts I’ve come up with recurring terminology and code that these people are using, all of these terms are coming up in almost every account I find.</p>
<p>*<strong>Pizza</strong> = We already know, but children and pedophilia in general. Boy or girl. 
*<strong>Cheese</strong> = I think this is child porn at this point, not too sure here. 
*<strong>Hotdog</strong> = Boy
*<strong>Hamburger</strong> = Girl
*<strong>Donut</strong> = Child’s anus/orifice 
*<strong>Pickle</strong> = Not sure about this one either, likely child’s penis. 
*<strong>Rose</strong> = Black child
*<strong>Trophy</strong> = Child is a &quot;trophy&quot;, a prized possession 
*<strong>Chicken</strong> = Boy
*<strong>Spiral emoji</strong> = Child love
*<strong>Nephew</strong>= Child
*<strong>Uncle</strong> = Abuser/owner
*<strong>Googley eyes</strong>= All-seeing, secret society, Illuminati, code for knowledge of abuse/what’s going on</p>
<p>I am a rational, analytical person. I’m not jumping the gun on anything here and I’m making sure not to succumb to confirmation bias. What is going on here is undeniable to any thinking person with two eyes and a brain. Look at these accounts for yourselves, spend a few hours trawling through them. With the information we have from PG, it’s completely obvious what’s happening. This rabbit hole is most likely bottomless. The extent of child abuse, pornography and probably murder is overwhelming – I could spend 2 years combing through these accounts and not reach the center. </p>
<p>These are the “key” accounts I’ve found so far. They all interact with one another and are linked via likes and comments on eachother’s photos. All I did was follow the trail of suspicious comments and accounts. These are not random, one off accounts, I can’t stress this enough, they are linked and most likely from the same general area. (Although one particularly revolting account is from Oregon, but is still linked to the DC scene)</p>
<p>I’ve included archived images from these pages, photos that I found particularly “interesting”. However it’s important you go through the whole accounts themselves to understand that I’m not just cherry picking or clutching at straws. 
These accounts are damning in their entirety so please look at them. </p>

<p>^ More linked accounts I currently don’t have the time to archive. </p>
<p><em>EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE PEDOPHILES. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. LOOK THROUGH YOURSELVES. OPEN YOUR EYES. IT TAKES MORE COGNITIVE EFFORT AND MENTAL GYMNASTICS TO CONVINCE YOURSELF THESE PEOPLE ARE INNOCENT - THAT MAYBE THEY ALL JUST COINCIDENTALLY REALLY REALLY ENJOY CHEESE PIZZA, PICKLES, HOTDOGS, PASTA, HAMBURGERS, CHILDREN AND SATANISM AND IT’S ALL JUST A BIG MEANINGLESS INSIDE JOKE AMONG AN ENTIRE SUBCULTURE OF PEOPLE; THAN IT DOES TO SEE THEY ARE BLATANTLY ABUSING CHILDREN.</em></p>
<p>Of course these accounts are the tip of the iceberg. They are a select few I’ve chosen. I need help. I need you guys to dig through these accounts and keep compiling data. We need that to happen in this thread. I can’t do this alone, and I know I’m not. </p>
<p>Please only contribute images and accounts that are on the whole convincingly damnable and might lead somewhere/to a smoking gun. No cherry picked irrelevant photos. We need credibility and consistency. The accounts need to clearly demonstrate what we are speculating and what should be incredibly obvious at this point. </p>
<p>God speed</p>',

           Of course these accounts are the tip of the iceberg. They are a select few I’ve chosen. I need help. I need you guys to dig through these accounts and keep compiling data. We need that to happen in this thread. I can’t do this alone, and I know I’m not.
          </p>
          <p>
           Please only contribute images and accounts that are on the whole convincingly damnable and might lead somewhere/to a smoking gun. No cherry picked irrelevant photos. We need credibility and consistency. The accounts need to clearly demonstrate what we are speculating and what should be incredibly obvious at this point.

            I hate to be the guy but this doesn't prove or even show anything out of order, I mean if you're going to go on record and say "EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE PEDOPHILES" you need evidence. imho this isn't even sketchy. At all.
OP you need more than tiny coincidences such as a group of children in pizza shirts, because yanno they're at a pizza restaurant, not in the back of a van or in a basement.
This is the sort of thing that people will use to discredit our investigations by saying we've accused several good citizens of being pedos.
Please investigate into other areas such as how the establishments raided are linked to pizzagate.

            You can add this girl to the list. Found her from following the friends on one of those accounts. I think people like this are victims of the trafficking and now she turns into one of their finders.

            Okay now let me be very clear pizzagate is something I believe has touched the surface very well. However after following the posters of some of these comments and taking a look at some of these things there could be a very slight chance these people are joking. The only person who has really alarmed me so far is that jaon fellow. When he says thngs like I get alot for the white ones and mother wasnt even watching the stroller it is all speculative circumstancial evidence just saying. Not saying the implications are not true just saying I dont want this detracting from more damning evidence surrounding pizzagate like the podesta emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its just very surface level type stuff and unless alefantis or podesta are followers or friends with this guy on instagram im not 100% sold on a link. In light of all the heavier evidence we have gotten this is fluff and not really anything I believe could be taken seriously if reported. The dont look for me im already gone could have been a joke as well but nobody commented on that one.
           </p>
           <p>
            So far the jason account is the only one that seems worth investigating and keeping tabs on so far.

            I haven't spent much of my research looking through the instagram finds, but I have made it a point to take a look when new findings come up. I Just question the Manhattan Knights finding as well as this. I do see some weird behavior, but nothing so far that can't be explained by some stupid sub culture hipster druggie shit. Am I looking in the wrong direction? I'm going through OPs list here and I'm still not seeing anything compelling (other than the fact that he's only been a user on here for 2 days)

             Since when does this stuff smack as normal?  Why do we make excuses for weird, effed up crap when it's staring us in the face.  Eyes wide shut all over again.  Maybe we should start believing what people show us/say instead of writing it off.

              I'm in complete agreement with you. Make no mistake, I'm not writing this off quite yet (if ever) - I have been sifting through this for the better part of today as well as some other leads. This should not be ignored. Perhaps my original comment came off a bit more cynical than I intended. I suppose my mode of thinking at the time was when I was comparing the findings of the jimmy comet instagram with these recent findings, one is very obviously more sinister than the other on the surface. But it could also be that I have not looked into this new lead enough yet to see it as being just as sinister.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will never write off this investigation, ever. We're on the same side. I just try and insert a healthy dose of skepticism here and there only because I didn't see the same caliber of evidence with this recent IG lead that we've been seeing on an almost daily basis. Appreciate your comment though, it was enough to snap me back into really looking into this with more fervor. I can't give up researching something after a few hours just because evidence isn't immediately recognizable or visible.

            Your post is great, exept for making it political. Stop making it political. There are crusty old grey haired conservative Republicans that are pedo freaks too, that are also involved and can be considered part of the elite too.

             But it IS political! However you're right, it encompasses both parties. We have bought into the lie of the two parties when in fact they are two sides to the same, corrupt coin! They are all involved at the highest levels because this shit is used for them to control and blackmail each other.

            This list of accounts you've yet to archive mostly belong to people who work in advertising in NYC. I was in this industry for a number of years. I know who a few of them are, and most of them are following people I've worked with extremely closely in the past. I don't think most of these people are pedos. Just weird, narcissistic, obnoxiously liberal NYC ad-types.

            I went through quite a few related to that guy from flaming lips and made a short list of usernames. Most were just drug users, specifically LSD, with nothing child related, didn't put those on the list, didn't find any more that seemed pedo, but some were satanic,  and there does seem to be a connection there to child abuse. Lists could be helpful to law enforcement investigation

            Damn your awesome! Excellent work. I was feeling very down after watching a video from another post. In it is a child being tortured who is clearly terrified above our level of imagination. I was losing hope your post reminded me that we have to keep going until every last one is taken down no matter how long it takes. Your post gives some new insigt and alot will come from researching this. Im on it.

             Hey VieBleu, thanks for clarifying the situation. I'm more of a lurker here but I was following this subverse regularly almost from the beginning. There were always many shills here as we all know, but you were always one of those users who seemed reasonable and trustworthy to me, with good points and opinions. So it was very confusing to see you trolling and shilling suddenly LOL My first thought was that your account had been hacked! So it's good to see you're back and everything is fine. God bless you

                thanks for that, no worries at all.  Yes, I am not vulgar either.

                I think the OP wrote very well in presenting this BTW.   It is only reasonable, given the climate to chase down this stuff.  Innocent until proven guilty, but suspicious and shady does not require a jury and a trial.  This stuff is shady and at best totally tasteless.  At worst, I have no doubt there is some evidence in it. Sorting out what is what is a dicey task and I'm glad it is being taken on.

                  Had a houseguest with their kids.  However, I've spoken to all parties and now I'm not convinced they were the guilty party.  Looking further.

                  There were a lot of weird events yesterday here, including voat being offline, points getting messed with (not mine, but others have said so) and my moden was knocked out for hours as well.  Anyone familiar with my commenting knows that was not my style, with a music video lol.    anyway, I have taken on mods in past to keep violence/racism etc to minimum n not sure if someone here didn't mess w my account.   Stuff happens i guess.

                   Disapproving significant other?  It's so odd that it coincided with the updates.  That's worrisome.

                    hey -nah, I think it was a houseguest's kids, however when I spoke to them they seemed pretty innocent.  Honestly not sure, but I was trolled.  Not very well, it didn't sound like me at all.  I did complain about a particular mod a bit yesterday, and also my moden inexplicably went out for hours.  Voat was down and some people lost points yesterday too which seems odd.  ya never know around here.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But what updates?  do you mean voat being down?

                     Yeah. Puttitout explained the points thing and the downtime in the sticky.  I lost like 5-10% of mine but whatever.

                     Voats small.  It could be mods exploiting a system weakness but that's pretty impressive.  Chances are it's in your personal life.  Which is more worrisome.

                     Were the troll posts pg related?  That would let you deduce a lot, i think.

                      I'm inclined to agree with you re personal life.  Leave a bored 14 and 16 year old in a room with a computer signed on to a weird website, and you get light vulgarities and a random depeche mode music video! lol doesn't sound like what the salty seasoned vets at voat would do at all really.  it was just a few comments on this thread about how the OP was dumb etc   the kids prob thought people here would think the video was devil worshipping or something.  I'm not used to having kids around. When I say they "don't approve" I mean in the general ::rolling eyes:: way most people think about that weird pizzagate thing from last year.   Then they act super innocent when grild ; ) so to speak, and say they heard it was actually real and turn it into a discussion about staying safe.  kids are smart.

                       They were probably horrified that you were on here.  This is pretty much a 4chan tier troll den.  The shocking truth is that a whole bunch of here and pol is 30-60 yr old smart people who like offensive humor and got banned from reddit at some point.

                          this is so funny - "But guys, come check out my performance art piece next week at the YMCA. I will be challenging the establishment and tearing down your notion of privacy and freedom when i wear a bottomless greenman suit and projectile shit the illuminati all-seeing-eye on the gymnasium wall"

                          And this follow up was priceless - if you could projectile splatter shit even a basic shape against a wall that would be pretty amazing.
