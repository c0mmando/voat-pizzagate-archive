<p>The suit filed against Trump and Epstein accuses them of luring Jane Doe and other young women to four parties at Epstein\'s so-called Wexner Mansion in New York City. Epstein allegedly lured Jane Doe with promises of a <em>modeling career</em> (remember this for later) and cash. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/trump-associate-charged-running-prostitution-ring-article-1.187634">Turkish prosecutors charged</a> former Soviet official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevfik_Arif">Tevfik Arif</a> and five others with charges related to organizing a criminal gang, prostitution and human trafficking after police raided Arif\'s yacht and rounded up nine Russian and Ukranian models who had been paid for by wealthy businessmen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater">Felix Sater</a> is a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-walks-out-over-questions-about-his-mafia-connections-during-bbc-panorama-interview-8695855.html">violent ex-convict</a> and Russian businessman who was also <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/donald-trump-picked-felix-sater-convicted-stock-fraud-felon-as-senior-business-advisor-ap-and-court-records-say-1.11192418">convicted of fraud</a> in 1998. He avoided charges by becoming a criminal informant and was credited with providing “information crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia">La Costa Nostra</a></em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arif founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayrock_Group">Bayrock Group</a>, an international real estate development and investment company, in 2003 and requested that Sater join him. Sater did, and was a senior advisor to Trump and The Trump Organization when construction of the Trump SoHo began in 2006.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bayrock allegedly attempted to conceal the degree of Sater\'s involvement. It also <a href="http://archive.is/wWysZ#selection-395.6-395.352">allegedly engaged in financial institution fraud, tax fraud, partnership fraud, insurance fraud, litigation fraud, bankruptcy fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, <em>human trafficking, child prostitution, and statutory rape</em></a>. Rachel Crooks, one of Trump\'s sexual harassment accusers mentioned above, was a secretary for Bayrock at the time, which was operating <em>inside Trump tower</em>, one floor below The Trump Organization. She also mentioned that she <em>“knew her company did business with Mr. Trump”</em>.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>ROY COHN: TRUMP\'S MENTOR AND THE ORIGINAL JEFFREY EPSTEIN</strong></p>
<p>Roy Cohn was <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2015/07/donald-ivana-trump-divorce-prenup-marie-brenner">Trump\'s lawyer &amp; mentor</a>. <a href="http://imgur.com/82tQF4J">Here they are</a> pictured together with Cohn on the left and Trump on the right. Cohn supposedly admitted to retired NYPD Jim Rothstein that he was part of a “rather elaborate sexual blackmail operation <a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/2014/08/24/the-ghost-of-roy-cohn/">that compromised politicians with child prostitutes</a>” (just like Epstein) that operated out of a Manhattan hotel that was later <a href="https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2016/11/"><em>owned by Trump</em></a>.</p>
<p>During the investigation into the murder of three 14-15 year old boys by the New York State Select Committee on Crime, information was received that Cohn (who also represented Senator Joe McCarthy at the notorious McCarthy Hearings) helped in covering up the murder and the disposal of the bodies. When Cohn was questioned about the murder of the boys, he stated that he was aware of what had happened, but would comment no further. Supposedly Cohn would compromise people and, if “situations” arose, <a href="http://www.behindthepinecurtain.com/wordpress/organized-pedophilia-and-the-criminal-exploitation-of-children/">Cohn would “take care” of them</a>. According to the owner of the apartment where the murders occurred, the boys were murdered by three men, one of whom was CIA. The bodies were then transported to Connecticut by car and buried on a farm.</p>
<p>Cohn’s frequent phone pals included Nancy Reagan and the former C.I.A. director William Casey, who “called Roy almost daily during [Reagan’s] 1st election.” Reagan was <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20Government/boys_town_abuse-large.gif">involved in the Franklin Scandal</a>. Cohn also <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/eavesdropping-on-roy-cohn-and-donald-trump">brought down Geraldine Ferraro’s campaign</a> by enlisting the help of his friend and owner of the <em>New York Post</em>, Rupert Murdoch (who was also <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/kate-gerry-mccann-suing-sunday-times-over-madeleine-clue-defamation-1466318">sued by Madeleine McCann\'s parents</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BONUS: WATERGATE AND THE DNC</strong></p>
<p>Jim Rothstein (the NYPD detective referenced above) interrogated Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis in 1977. </p>
<p>From Nick M. Nero\'s book <em><a href="https://books.google.nl/books?id=LfpKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=rothstein+watergate+frank+sturgis+pedophile+book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wWx5GGO8Hy&amp;sig=Yq52vzGsAZi1IZXVdJJaAqAI-g8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJkLrRlPvUAhUBb1AKHVAuDwg4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=rothstein%20watergate%20frank%20sturgis%20pedophile%20book&amp;f=false">JFK: Assassination Rehearsal</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the interrogation of Sturgis at Marita Lorenz\'s apartment in 1977, “Sturgis said the break-in was to get the \'book\' that had the names of clients who used the prostitution and pedophilia ring operating out of the <strong>Democratic National Headquarters</strong>. This information was to be used to compromise both Republican and Democratic clients who used the ring.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ODD TIMING OF PODESTA EMAILS WIKILEAKS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>Trump\'s infamous “grab \'em by the pussy” interview with Billy Bush was “discovered” by David Fahrenthold of the <em>Washington Post</em> and published around 4 p.m. ET on October 7th, 2016. <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/">2,500 of Podesta\'s hacked emails were released via Wikileaks at 4:32 p.m ET the same day</a>.</p>',

           During the investigation into the murder of three 14-15 year old boys by the New York State Select Committee on Crime, information was received that Cohn (who also represented Senator Joe McCarthy at the notorious McCarthy Hearings) helped in covering up the murder and the disposal of the bodies. When Cohn was questioned about the murder of the boys, he stated that he was aware of what had happened, but would comment no further. Supposedly Cohn would compromise people and, if “situations” arose,
           <a href="http://www.behindthepinecurtain.com/wordpress/organized-pedophilia-and-the-criminal-exploitation-of-children/">
            Cohn would “take care” of them
           </a>
           . According to the owner of the apartment where the murders occurred, the boys were murdered by three men, one of whom was CIA. The bodies were then transported to Connecticut by car and buried on a farm.

           Cohn’s frequent phone pals included Nancy Reagan and the former C.I.A. director William Casey, who “called Roy almost daily during [Reagan’s] 1st election.” Reagan was

             Agreed, I still don't understand why people are so damn insistent that he's some kind of savior. I think it's the bystander effect; people keep waiting for someone ELSE to do something, never realizing it's US who has to make the moves. No one is going to pave the way for us.

            Wasn't aware of this/pretty much says it all.  Can't find specific reference on quick search/but whenever the story of embassy stormed/is JA dead, tortured etc/took the focus off this very astute timing.  Hindsight, sure trump was picked.  Promised to killary but she got too sloppy and too many health issues/Kaine too much of an idiot to take over if need arises/Pence much better to do stand up puppet.

           <p>
            Bottom line she sucked as a candidate and tried to climb higher on the ladder than was allowed.  Even tho it's unlikely she will ever see prison it is comforting to imagine how over the top devastated she was/is...that she never got the prize she had killed for all her political career.  That at lease is something :)

             The “grab ‘em by the pussy” comment could’ve derailed Trump’s campaign. Wikileaks did, in fact, push us towards the Clintons and Podesta, and could’ve been what caused Clinton to lose. Trump is a man with a lot of money and power. Why do people just assume he wasn’t responsible?
