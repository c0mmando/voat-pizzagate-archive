<p><strong>A pedophile man who pretends to be a woman....sorry....a biological transgender male \'who identifies as a woman\' got a lenient sentence by Judge James Williamson of Kirkcaldy Sheriff CourtKirkcaldy Sheriff Court in Scotland after he had attacked a 10-year-old girl in a supermarkt toilet.</strong></p>
<p>Although this wasn\'t his first offence - a month before the sexual assault, he had previously tried to take a photograph of a 12-year-old girl when she used the toilet - the judge gave him only a tagging order and community service order. This is an example of the elite being lenient when it comes to crimes committed by pedophiles. </p>
<p>It is also an example of how pedophile predators profit from the increasing acceptance of transgenders in society , and a bathroom policy that allows males to use women\'s bathrooms if they pretend to be female.</p>

<p><strong>THE ASSAULT &amp; A HERO GIRL FIGHTING OFF THE ATTACKER</strong></p>
<p>The attacker, whose name is given as “Katie Dolatowski”, waited for the young victim to come out of a toilet cubicle at a Morrisons supermarket in Kirkcaldy, Fife, then grabbed her by the face and forced her back inside.</p>
<p>Dolatowski told the girl to remove her trousers and warned that a man outside would kill her mother, according to reports, <strong>but she fought back, striking the paedophile in the face, belly, and crotch and tearing away to her father and siblings outside.</strong></p>
<p>Dolatowski had already attempted to photograph a 12-year-old as she urinated at another supermarket a month prior in nearby Dunfermline</p>
<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<p><strong>A LENIENT JUDGE &amp; A HORRIFIED MOTHER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Judge James Williamson decided not to send the sex offender to prison, instead handing down a tagging order and community service order which he claimed was “stringent”.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Stringent? He should have been sent to jail.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The girl’s mother was horrified, saying she felt “very, very let down” and that she did not have “any confidence whatsoever that [Dolatowski] will not go out and do something equally as bad or worse.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sadly, this is very likely what will happen. Thank you, Judge Williamson.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“He was stalking the toilets. He went there specifically to attack a child,”</strong> the mother said, declining to use Dolatowski’s preferred pronouns.</p>
<p>“We were so, so lucky that nothing worse happened. <strong>It was only her reaction that stopped that. It could have been a five-year-old child that wouldn’t have been able to fight back.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dolatowski, 18, was said to have spent time in the care system growing up and suffer from mental health issues, but the mother was unimpressed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A lot of people have been in care but they do not go out and assault children,” she said.</p>
<p>“I don’t care that he has issues or what his background is, he is a paedophile and he has been let out,” she added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case prompted the Women and Girls in Scotland group to call for safeguards against biological males in female-only spaces, as elite opinions moves steadily towards allowing people to pick and choose their gender with little or no medical oversight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This horrific sexual assault of a child is a reminder that sexual predators will take advantage of any access they can get and we should be doing all we can to minimise the risks of such assaults,” a spokeswoman observed.</p>
<p>“Over 90 percent of sexual crimes are committed by males. <strong>It is extremely concerning that in this climate many female-only spaces can be accessed by males if they simply state they are transgender,”</strong> she added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Judge Williamson acknowledges that Dolatowski poses a “moderate risk” of reoffending.</strong></p>
<p><em>Moderate? A man who has preyed upon two girls within a month?!</em></p>

             Well, last week or so a British woman got arrested because she referred to a transgender 'woman' as 'he', and published his previous male name on Twitter. I learned that this is called 'deadnaming', and that you can get fined for it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone in the comments section of this post wrote that this means that pedophiles can 'identify' as a woman, and have their names changed, in order to conceal their previous criminal activity.

                Most kids with gender dysphoria grow out it.  We should be treating the gender dysphoria not adding to the delusion. Suicide rates post transition remain just as high as rates pre transition, which goes to show that their mental issues don't go away when they transition.

                 Yes. I think the suicide rate drops only by 3-4% after transition. Even doctors who treat kids who want to transition caution that 90% will grow out of it once they've become adults. Which means that giving children hormones, and let them have surgery is a human rights violation, a crime.

            This is all part of the wider plan to destroy the family and pervert the minds of children.  We're all supposed to buy into this crazy 'men can be women' because people like George Soros's Open Society and Pritzker are driving the agenda:

             The Gender Industrial Complex, as we may call it, has many components. Lucrative sponsorship comes from pharmaceutical companies and medical providers. Charities originally established to fight for homosexual rights (like Human Rights Campaign in the United States and Stonewall in Britain) wield large budgets. Last but not least, three American billionaires have bankrolled the transgender movement on a global scale: Jennifer Pritzker, whose activities were detailed in another blogpost, Jon Stryker, and George Soros.
            </p>
            <p>
             How much has OSF spent to promote the transgender movement? In 2011–13, it spent $3.19 million, which made it the top funder, followed by Stryker’s Arcus Foundation and Pritzker’s Tawani Foundation (Funders for LBTQ Issues 2015). OSF’s current database includes grants worth $3.07 million for 2016–17

            The definitive studies done on transgender women were undertaken by Blanchard and Bailey. The studies found that transwomen fell into two sub-groups: those who transitioned early were usually gay; those who transitioned later were autogynephilic. These are the men who get turned on by the idea of themselves as women. In other words, they are fetishists. They usually start with wearing women's clothing in private, and as they get older it takes more for them to get their rocks off, so they feel the need to do it in public.
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301205/">
             This study
            </a>
            identified the frequency of personality disorders with gender dysphoria (feeling you're in the wrong body). The results show:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The frequency of personality disorders was 81.4%. The most frequent personality disorder was narcissistic personality disorder (57.1%) and the least was borderline personality disorder.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Narcissists have no empathy. They are concerned only with themselves, their needs and wants. Everyone else serves as a mirror, not as a human with whom to interact, but someone who will reflect their ideal of themselves as wonderful people.  They are master manipulators and emotional vampires. They are a cross between cold-blooded reptilian in their ability to gauge who can and cannot be used for their purposes. Once they identify a victim, they are like a leech, sucking the lifeblood out of their victim and then discarding them when they've destroyed them.  This is the way of the narcissist.

            People are having their social media accounts taken down if they dare to say 'Men cannot be women'. It happened to Meghan Murphy, who is now taking  Jack Dorsey's Twitter to court. I hope she wins.

             I had no idea that Pritzker and Soros were into this (not surprised though, of course).

             Some days ago, a transgender male compared the spokesperson of a woman's group that advocates for 'safe spaces' for women (=bathrooms only for biological girls and women) to the Ku Klux Klan, and refused to appear on the same BBC show with her.
            </p>
            <p>
             So now women who are peaceful are compared to the violent activities of the Ku Klux Klan. The sad irony is, though, that the women who advocate for safe spaces in Britain get badly harassed by transgender activists, both on Social Media and in real life.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is madness. And TIL that the girl scouts axed some leaders who opposed their 'shower policy' - i.e. that boys who 'identify as girls' are allowed to use the same shower rooms.
            </p>

             This has to stop.

              All u have to do to stop it is to get out of statutue jurisdction and sue the pants off of these pedoempire agents for human rights violation under universal jurisdictiin ie ..international common law..
To get the US to be on ur side reduce debt by even a dollar..instructing them to collect on any charges u apply on common law violaters..
If u dont do it know..it will get worse..they will lobby for UN to legalsise this pedo culture..
             </p>
             <p>
              The ball has always been in our court..we just have been allowing the pedoempire and their debt system to hit self goals..
Get out of the debt game ..via the US treasury..
..and then use the US to collect on charges payable to the US under universal jurisdictiin.
The corrupt judges wint stand a chance ..
Its called judgement day..
Ive been talking about the solution..for a while..but no one can even send an email to confirm this at the US treasury..
Guys emails are free..

              Further to my previous comment, I want to point out the connection between these two men and the current pushing of these politicians into the spotlight:

               Can someone sue the Adrain harret under universal jurisdiction..all it costs is dollar to the US treasury..
..until then u will be under statutue debt law..
Wiki : universal jurisdiction
We fund the debt system ..that is controlled by the pedoempire...is it any suprise this is happening..
              </p>
              <p>
               We fund it ...take ur monies out of the banking system and reduce debt at the US treasury ..u wont be charged under any stupid ststutues passed by the pedoempire..
Being lazy about undrrstanding thr debt system that we feed into causing more statutues and draconiannlaws to be passsed to service the debt and create a low wage prison population..
Is not an option..now..
Especially when it costs even less than a dollar or any currency that the US treasury will accept..
..uncan then charge these pedoempire agents under common law...known as universal jurisdictiin

               Yes, 'transphobic' is the new 'islamophobic'. /s

              <p>
               And the LGTBQ movement is responsible for the transgender madness. Although I heard that some lesbians are unnerved because male-to-female transgenders now crash lesbian parties, claiming they are women. And some female-to-male transgenders to there too. That's why some lesbian groups seem to ditch the 'LGTBQ' label now.

            Had another case like this recently in Scotland. Paedophile 18 year old convicted of abusing a four year old lassie got let off with any sentence because he was training to be a dentist and he didn't want it affecting his career.

             The trouble is that these trans women, who want access to women's refuges, women's sport, women's universities, DO NOT want to lose their penis.  A good case in point is Bruce Jenner--lots of hormones, facelife and fake boobs but wants his penis.   These are the autogynephiles.

               A good case in point is Bruce Jenner--lots of hormones, facelife and fake boobs but wants his penis.

              Interesting. I thought he had surgery. Maybe because of the boobs.

              Yesterday, someone linked an article on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/news">
               v/news
              </a>
              where a transgender 'woman' said there are female penises too.
             </p>
             <p>
              As in: When a bloke 'identifying' as a woman has a penis, it's not a male penis anymore, it's a female penis.

               Yes, they call it their 'lady penis' and they are very angry with lesbians, because the lesbians don't want the lady penis.
