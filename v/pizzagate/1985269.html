            Valid question and valid post - I think M_F has fallen off his perch again - or perhaps ClownStrike has reincentivized him.
           </p>
           <p>
            That ClownStrike has a falcon as emblem and its main piece of software is called something falcony(?) may have more to do with M_F's name than Star Wars - who knows - he sure acts suspiciously!  Perhaps he just suffers a tick box mentality.

            The suspicion of infiltration on the board would seem to be reasonable - there is a whole handbook on how to [mis]lead minds.  And even has its own sticky at the moment!

            That's the paradox. People clamor "We want a victim to come forward." So you tell them "Okay, watch the videos of these children admitting to being part of Satanic Ritual Abuse." You can show them the Hampstead kids, the girl "Vicky," or the British girl who talks about being prostituted by her "Nan" and forced to participate in beastiality and pedophilia rituals, and the reaction is always the same:
           </p>
           <p>
            "GTFO WITH YOUR CHRISTIAN BULLSHIT! SATANIC PANIC! WITH HUNT! SATANISTS DINDU NUFFIN, DEY GOOD BOYS! CHRISTIANS ARE BAD! SATANIC PANIC!"
           </p>
           <p>
            People want proof. They want victims. You show them people who have been victims of this in the past, and they give it the "fake news" treatment and act like every word coming from the person's mouth is a lie. "Satanic Panic" is a fucking joke that was MADE UP BY SATANISTS. Why can't people understand this? Oh yeah, it's because they're fucking stupid.

             OUCH, you hurt me DarkMath and I was a fan of yours. I'm not saying I am a savior or anything but man you all need too chill out and get a heart for these victims who are being tortured/trafficked/ and killed daily. The Podestas will meet their fate one day. Hopefully sooner than later but until then I pray for the innocent lives lost and or found that were put through their hell. I am in no way the enemy. I am just done wasting my time on these MF bastards who belong in hell.

              You lost me. All I suggested is to call the police if you know about a kidnapping. That's not cold or callous. I consider it the opposite actually.

              We're good at finding possible human trafficking rat lines. We move at a snails pace because there's tons of noise and disinfo out there it's almost impossible to do anything quickly.

            Educating our selves and sharing information is still a valid pursuit. The more of us on here sharing our thoughts and theories and actual articles and data to substantiate our suspicions is important because we can identify people and tactics to help prevent abuse, and we can understand and recognize victims who may need support and that they may not feel so alienated or maligned.
           </p>
           <p>
            If nothing else, pointing out that (for example) Judges are corrupt and letting pedos off the hook, or Trump is right to crack down on MS13, we can identify and help manifest change that undermines the pedo/globalist/criminal systems.

            Hey findingaway, in order to meet rule 2 you need to include one link.  Not trying to be a dick.  I think this post raises a good question and don't want it to be deleted because of the lack of a link.  Just trying to help you out.

             Thanks. I don't have a link but i do have a conscience. Pizzagate is a dead end street with no witnesses and the more we try the more foolish we look. Been following this a long time since Reddit and we are really no further now than when we got kicked off of Reddit. We have found and dug up so much dirt on these weasels but we are still at ground zero. Something has to give. If we can't get these cucks lets at least save some innocent lives in the process. I have said my peace. Thank you. And I am not saying there has been no progress. There has been progress. But look at how much time has passed.

              Try this link.  It is of the abuse victim Becki Percy.

              needs to seem safer to victims.  When AbortionBurger tried to speak to someone who claimed to be raped by James Alefantis shills chased him off.  Later they doxed AbortionBurger as revenge. Someone even impersonated Becki Percy with a imposter account and was saying "lulz, I made it up."

              There do appear to be some victims speaking on Steemit. TheHoneyBee lately interviewed a woman whose abusive husband she said ran an elite cp ring.

              How much time has passed.  Hardly any time compared to how long this has been going on, decades turned into centuries.  We here have our hearts open for all victims and survivors, of course.  But we must keep our eyes on the prize and keep on the right track. I am a Reddit survivor as well and am not giving up.  You have the right to feel your feelings, so maybe it is time for you to do what will make you feel that you are  helping the victims.  You can start a group of your own or get involved in your area where you live.  There are groups in all large cities.  But be careful and do your research before you join.

               I feel differently. You ask how much time has passed with NO arrests and I ask How many more victims have been subjected to their ways. I am not trying to insult anyone or say Pizzagate has been a waste of time. We know and heard victims already but there are more and more victims every day. How do we stop this if what we have tried to do to stop this has not worked? Posting on voat or other websites has not ended this situation. I respect you and know how much time you have invested in this just like everyone else. We all have invested many hours in this investigation. We all have learned the inner workings of the establishment. I like you have said have just probably reached a point where I feel I should be trying to help the victims vs the perpetrators. I at least feel good when a victim is found safe. I am still waiting for that day when the perps are all brought to justice but until then I will keep digging up dirt on the scum and help the victims a long the way. No bad feelings. I look forward to reading your posts believe it or not.

              We move fast, gov moves slow.  They have different battles to face.  Good god I wish people would remember that.  Just keep the fire going underneath and make sure they know we give a shit about this.  If we can actually do anything, then we do it.  Otherwise, just letting them know that we are pissed as hell will keep them moving and motivated.
