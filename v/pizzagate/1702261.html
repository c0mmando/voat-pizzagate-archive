This kid at the age of 17 did not get the ideas of abusing children having toddlers getting raped by dogs by himself. This was done to him there\'s a lot of talk that the elite are sending their children to these particular schools in order for them to get indoctrinated from early on. And that there is abuse happening at these places. Eton college was involved in several sex scandals. Eton has already produced 19 Prime Ministers from the notoriously posh academy.

From reading everything it looks like in the old days they abused each other but since then it seems to have escalated since Andrew Boeckman admitted to producing Child porn with toddlers getting raped by dogs
The question remains where do they get the young children from who they torture and rape?</p>
<p>Another former student at Eton:
Mr Montagu was himself a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of his father when he was young, which he wrote about in his book, A Humour Of Love.</p>
<p>He said that that people with ‘entitled backgrounds’ were given ‘more opportunities’ to be abusive towards children.

<p>Tony little headmaster at Eton is concerned that the schools might have to close because of the financial burden Incurred from lawsuits

<p>It turns out previous headmaster was a pedophile

<p>So these are all pedophiles in the making and most of the students end up in higher ranking positions in governments</p>',

            Had enough of this shit today. Fucking children with dogs ffs.
What also pissed me off was realizing that at least 3 - 4 girls I've known over the years were abused as children. And it has lasting implications and effects on them even in their late 20s.

            Some anecdotal stuff on this: My friends ex wife was regularly beaten by her father, a famous &amp; wealthy basketball player. Once a friend of his visited &amp; witnessed a beating, but instead of stopping him or chastising him, he advised him to beat her only in places on her body that would be hidden by clothing - not her face. She grew up to be a photographer, often using half naked children as subjects (she is at Pace McGill now I think). Both she &amp; her father were Yalies. The thing was, it was like oh well you know this is what we do, it was considered normal in these wealthy families. Nothing to be ashamed of, but you don't want any pesky teachers or neighbors ringing the alarm.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other was when I did a small job for a wealthy business man in Westchester County, NY. I was scanning his Christmas cards so he could have them in digital format. I came across one that had a photograph printed on the back, where a little girl (maybe 4 yrs old) was standing face to face with an old man, possibly her grandfather. She was kissing the fly of his pants. This was s family photo! on a Christmas card! that was sent to the guy I was working for, and I assume many of his other friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was extremely disturbed by these 2 things, but It took me years to connect the dots. I couldn't see the bigger picture for what it was, &amp; I couldn't get at the guy I was working for (longer story). I believe it's normal in elite families over generations to indoctrinate children to pedophilia. This is the only reason I hesitate to condemn them all to the death penalty.

            Not sure if mentioned already, here's a link to a video that talks, in part, about the grooming of pedos in the military
            <a href="https://youtu.be/U1Qt6a-vaNM?t=2h48m6s">
             https://youtu.be/U1Qt6a-vaNM?t=2h48m6s
            </a>
            I linked to the point where it starts and lasts about 10 minutes. The entire video is super long (3.5 hours) and covers everything from JFK's assassination by the CIA and current so called terrorism, all manipulations and false flags by the world elite.

            I seriously see a need for mothers to be pd to stay home and homeschool their kids. Until then  start having serious talks with your children about pizzagate and the Evil freaks. Really stress that it's OK to tell you if they see or hear something. Explain to them about the new Vault 7 info and the CIA spying with electronics. Knowledge is power!

            Totally correct.  While they may be younger, elites - and everday satanists, typically begin the real  indoctrination, sexual and otherwise, at about the age of 3 or 4. It can involve others and/or their parents, and can have ritualistic elements. Goes on ALL the time - not just in elite families.  This stuff is everywhere.   These families hang with other familes who all think and do the same things. It seems normal to many/most of these kids. The adults in their lives and their peers tell them it's just how the world works.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the kids are drawn in to the satanic aspects and sacrifice, they are told it's not a big deal, it happens every day in everyone's life and, besides, "everyone has to die sometime."   Everything is normalized but not really.  It IS their normal.  You are never really allowed to know that there are other ways of living - like a cult, they're never allowed out of the fold. And they honestly believe that, despite anything anyone might try to tell them to contrary or appear to be living their lives, those people are either lying, delusional or people sent to check up on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not just teachers. It's the MDs and RN's at the hospitals they go to. It's their dentist, the 24-gas station guy, the grocery clerk, shop keepers, handy men, manicurists, uber drivers. There are plenty of people in the everyday world all around us who, for example, are into consensual "swinging" and/or BDSM, etc.  They are our neighbors, our kids' parents - it could be anyone and we'd never know it. They keep communication and practices strictly within their own communities. In this case, the group "just happens to" rape kids and/or tortures them, kill them and eat them.
           </p>

            I used to think the world was a good place with just a few psychopathics satanists. The more I've traveled down the rabbit hole, I've come to believe that  - especially in some places, in some parts globally -  the world is Satanic with just a few good people.

             I agree it is analogous to swinging in some ways.  The swingers I've met are shockingly normal everyday folks in most respects.  They have their own language and networks, and what seems unlikely or absurd to outsiders is perfectly normal to them.  For example, one man I knew who was into it talked about visiting another couple when he was in a certain place for business, and staying over with them or even taking care of their house and pets when they were away.  It sounded like they were just friends of his.  Then he said, "Of course I've had sex with [the wife]..."

            this is Cathy O'Brien's book where she describes (among others) how she was abused as a child sex slave by Pierre Trudeau. I bet Justin had the same fate with a "papa" like that.

            - says that children part of MONARCH program need constant structured abuse to maintain their diassociative states. The intense abuse where core personality fractures occur happen at places like their own compromised gov/medical facilities and then they say that structured/ritual abuse must be continued at home with a program. If that is true, it would make sense that schools would need to be compromised in order to continue the abuse regime and to hide it from people outside of the group.

            The Satanist have been very hard at work for their master Lucifer, while, since this story broke last year the Christian church has been pretty much silent on this whole matter.....I know there are individual Christians aware, such as myself but, it is the church leaders, especially those with big names and followings who remain silent.

            I think the children of most elites are molested as children. There is a famous saying that is like "I will sell my first born child to the devil". I think that when this agreement is made the child is sold into pedastry, or molested.

            The people in my family who abused me went to a small boys boarding school that cost about $40,000/year in today's dollars. From what I was told, it was a place to send boys who were troubled and wealthy. They went into the school as "problem children" and came out as role models in the family, also as sexual predators.

            I heard an interesting story from author and consultant to the oil industry F William Engdahl ("The Lost Hegemony", "100 Years of War", etc) in the q&amp;a section of a talk on GMOs.  I think the question was about the morals and psychological makeup of the elite families that would allow them to do what they do to humanity [me: Subverting it from it's natural growth, creating wars and boom bust cycles that destroy civilizations].
           </p>
           <p>
            He went to Princeton and knew several people oligarch families.  He said that at birth they are taken from the mother and by a nurse and had zero human contact for the first three years of their lives.  This way they were very likely to be sociopathic and be able to make decisions without regard for human suffering.
           </p>
           <p>
            This would explain why the above story would completely make sense.

             It is a fact that the Royals have very little contact with their children when young. Diana seem to break that with her boys.

             They do this on purpose to create sociopaths? It's just the most despicable thing I have ever heard of. Sociopaths are the worst kinds of people, the realisation that our world is run by them is absolutely horrifying, because they will have no idea what they are doing or risking, there is nothing about these kinds of people that anyone can trust, they won't even avoid risks to their own safety, so certain are they of their own infallibility. Our species will not survive much longer with psychological mutants like these running the show.

              Studies show that psychopaths gravitate towards leadership.  CEOs, heads of governments, business leaders I would say are nearly all on the narcissistic, sociopath, psychopath spectrum.  Nice people don't get to the top because our egos are not big enough, we care about the consequences of our decisions, we are not power hungry, we are not prepared to walk over bodies to get to the top and we are great team members who actually give a shit about people.

              Don't write everyone off with the same brush though... I am a compassionate guy but have some psychopathic tendencies (tbh I find they are present in many people especially in upper levels of business). I care about family, close friends, employees and do whatever it takes to make them happy and comfortable, competition on the other hand I ruthlessly destroy in every way possible.
Thing is not everyone is cut out for management and similar. To do it you have to have some lack of feeling because sometimes you have to make a decision that is bad either way. You have to choose the 'least bad' decision. Kinda like Bush Vs Hillary, you're fucked either way.

              But yes, then there are true sociopaths/psychopaths who are the definitive psycho movie murderer.

              Yes it has to be the reason they do it.  They need people to destroy us with no compulsion what so ever.  Its their culture.  They cant be saved they have to be destroyed utterly.   I dont think humanity can risk turning their backs on any of them.

              Sociopaths hover around 4% of the population.  So 1 in every 25 people you know has the potential to be one.  This is really crazy when you consider that Eating disorders are considered an "Epidemic" and they exist in only 3.5% of the population.  4% of people on this planet do not care whether other people live or die.  And take extreme pleasure in other people's misfortune.  There is a really good book about this called the Sociopath Next Door.  SICK  :(

              The real problem for them is that the world they create for themselves by destroying and killing everyone else they will not be able to enjoy.  They'll never be happy, or know what they are missing.

             and need I mention "Cremation of Care" ritual at Bohemian Grove. I believe that is to dissipate ANY inkling of Care/Concern that may arise in these freaks. They must kill of any kind of compassion that could arise and consume and individual that is involved in this madness. They cannot afford to have the assets being concerned for the useless eaters they believe us to be. Cremation of Care is likely very much like a maintenance wipe. They are raising armies of pedo psychopaths without conscience. There are no accidents here....

                 One of the differences between a psychopath and a sociopath is that the psychopath will ENJOY the hurt he causes. The sociopath will not care that someone is hurt by his actions.  I don't doubt that many of the most brutal child abusers are psychopaths.

                  The research says otherwise - no link between Psychopath and pedophilia. 
Frankly, abusing kids is way too weak for a Psychopath.

            "This kid at the age of 17 did not get the ideas of abusing children having toddlers getting raped by dogs by himself. This was done to him there's a lot of talk that the elite are sending their children to these particular schools in order for them to get indoctrinated from early on. And that there is abuse happening at these places."
           </p>
           <p>
            The programming usually begins at HOME, by the FAMILY, long before the child enters any school.

            "The earlier, the better."  17 is relatively LATE.

             Could this be the real reason behind coloboma (eye anomaly think Madeleine McCann)?
            </p>

             Hi someone just posted this, in a comment
             <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/sp/springmeier.html">

             I couldn't believe my eyes when I read the instructions on how to TRAIN a child in the womb The FRIGGING womb!!! And then I had this thought is that why they have this anomaly? Trauma is one of the causes for it Causes Coloboma can occur due to: Eye surgery Inherited conditions Trauma to the eye Most cases of coloboma have no known cause and are not related to other abnormalities. A small percentage of people with coloboma have other inherited developmental problems.

            It just occurred to me that David Cameron had two children that died. One was a baby, only 10 days old, and the other was disabled. Obviously this is an awful thing to say, but in light of what we know now about Satanic rituals, child abuse and child sacrifice, one can't help but wonder... You know? :-/

            I mean, he was always a wet blanket mummy's boy and we basically know he fucked a dead pig for some Etonian type initiation rite or whatever. Who's to say there weren't other darker steps he was bullied into - or not - on his ladder to PM?

             I have always wondered about Rosemary Kennedy - was she abused and then silenced by her father with a lobotomy so she could never speak of the abuse? She was beautiful and active socially at 20 and by 23 was lobotomized on her father's decision.

              Just looked it up.  It was Rose Marie but pronounced Rosemary.  This struck me funny."Up too late for breakfast. Had it on deck. Played Ping-Pong with Ralph's sister, also with another man. Had lunch at 1:15. Walked with Peggy. also went to horse races with her, and bet and won a dollar and a half. Went to the English Movie at five. Had dinner at 8:45. Went to the lounge with Miss Cahill and Eunice and retired early."[7]  Ping Pong with a man?  At the age of 15 she was at the 4th grade level.  Why would you let your daughter do that?  She should be supervised. I wonder if she was allowed to be abused by her father to gain favors.  He was a nasty man.  Rose the Mother, never visited Jack in the hospital when he was in there in horrible pain for Addison's disease.  Neither one of the parents should ever have had children.

            We might consider whether Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton were considered "Elite" for their family's involvement with organized crime.
They are treated somewhat differently -- no torture which might show.  And other preferable treatment.

              Bill and Bush, Sr. very close re Mena drug trafficking.
If CIA did gain control over them, it might explain a good deal.  Multiple personalities?
I keep thinking about the United Nations and how so many of these organizations dealing with children are connected to the UN and given a kind of validity because of those connections.

             I don't know about Castro being Trudeau's father, but many people, including Cuban author Servando Gonzalez ("Psychological Warfare and the New World Order") thinks Fidel is a CIA asset.  Castro has an IMDB page (he was an extra in a couple movies in the 40s).  His life story is completely unbelievable, how a group of 30 or so guys can overtake a base in Venezuela to get access to the weapons they used in Cuba.  Are we really supposed to believe that the CIA tried 120 times to kill him and failed?  No intelligence agency can be that incompetent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Servando Gonzalez has also said in several interviews that in the 50s he and his friends would wear berets and read Marx.  They would listen to Castro's speeches and then sit around drinking coffee in Havana and wonder what the hell Fidel was talking about; he didn't understand Communism in the slightest.

              Obama seems to like him a lot, kind of a go to guy for connected people and former POTUS who need to go on vacation after screwing the country. Richard Branson owns an island next to Jeffery Epstein. He also was involved in supporting Madeleine McCann's parents:

              </a>
              "ANYTHING concerning Richard Branson is of interest to those of us who have been following the Madeleine McCann case for 9 years, for a number of reasons:
1. His very early support of the McCanns
2. His hosting of the marking of the 1,000th day after Madeleine's disappearance at his Rooftop Restaurant in Kensington (27 Jan 2010)
3. His links to Missing Persons organisations, with whom Kate McCann is also interested 
4. His links to high-flying people who have been involved in the Madeleine McCann case - most obviously people like the Blairs, Gordon Brown and David Cameron - and now Theresa May"

              "The western Algarve has been "a teeming hive of paedophile activity." (C. Freud owned his Villa there 25 years).
One investigator said he knew of 38 child sex abusers living in the area.
Between 2005 and 2009, the children of seven holidaying families were reportedly subjected to sex attacks."

            This is so horrible. It seems as if a bunch of Manchuria candidates are being created. The Justin Trudeau comment has truth. Research his father. Also recognize the common thread in all cases are Jesuit

             I read that he was programmed in Montreal in a hospital run by the Jesuits.  Also that JP was his handler.  His father from what I remember had a friend that was a pedophile.  By the way would you please PM me? Thanks.

            I can't believe any of these people grew up to have wives and children.  Yet that appears to be the norm.  Are they preparing them for a wife even more abusive than their school partners?  What gives?  Not every man in Britain is gay.
