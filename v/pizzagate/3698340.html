<p>In late 2019 it was BBC who made interview about fake news including the newest known interview with James Alefantis ( Pizzagate fame ), and now we will see new documentary which will be also streamed on HBO but this time with much bigger scope, including brother of Seth Rich, Aaron Rich, and obviously our &quot;favorite&quot; Pizza man named James Alefantis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On March 16, “After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News,” will premiere at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. It will later be available on HBO streaming platforms on March 19. Directed by Andrew Rossi (“Page One,” “Ivory Tower”) and executive produced by Stelter, the documentary dissects Pizzagate and other notable conspiracy theories of the last decade.</p>
<p>Rather than just focusing on interviews with reporters, producers turned the camera on the victims of well-known hoaxes. Interviewees include Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis and Aaron Rich, whose brother Seth Rich’s 2016 murder spawned right-wing conspiracy theories that Seth was in contact with WikiLeaks.</p>

            So much for their fake news premiere. Or are they breaking the fourth wall with a secret nod to the fake  C-word?
