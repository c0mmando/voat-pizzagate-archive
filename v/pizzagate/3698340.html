<p>In late 2019 it was BBC who made interview about fake news including the newest known interview with James Alefantis ( Pizzagate fame ), and now we will see new documentary which will be also streamed on HBO but this time with much bigger scope, including brother of Seth Rich, Aaron Rich, and obviously our &quot;favorite&quot; Pizza man named James Alefantis.</p>
