<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data brokers have a dossier on pretty much everyone in the world including children</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>They sell to anyone including pedophiles</strong></p>

<p>The Clinton\'s are heavily involved with <strong>Acxiom,</strong> founded in Little Rock, and <strong>InfoUSA</strong> of Omaha.  </p>
<h2>What is a data broker?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Information Brokers <strong>collect information about individuals</strong> from public records and private sources....The data are aggregated to create <strong>individual profiles,</strong> often made up of thousands of individual pieces of information....to sell to individuals and organizations....Data brokers also <strong>often sell the profiles to government agencies,</strong> such as the FBI, thus allowing law enforcement agencies to circumvent laws that protect privacy.[4]....Data brokers operate behind a veil of secrecy.</p>

<p>Dossiers include medical and pharmacy records, <strong>including for children,</strong> typically from <strong>Intercontinental Marketing Services</strong> established in 1954.  The creepy, grasping behavior of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMS_Health">this company</a> (which changed its name to <strong>&quot;IMS Health&quot;):</strong></p>

<p>School data is included in <strong>children\'s dossiers,</strong> such as from computer software like described here:</p>

<h2>Dangerous -- data brokers sell to anyone</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Emory Law Journal:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The threat posed</strong> [to children regarding information leading to abduction and sexual abuse] <strong>by data brokers</strong> and electronic surveillance is equally <strong>worrisome....</strong>The researchers expounded, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[C]hildren’s merchandise market is in the hundreds of billion dollars in the US alone, it is not surprising that data brokers are already seeking to <strong>compile dossiers on children.</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Selling Teenagers</strong></p>
<p>Your teen’s information is for sale.  <strong>Acxiom has records on just over 13,780,714 teenagers</strong> in the United States.  The average teen has been tracked by Acxiom for up to for five years </p>
<p>Exact Data of Chicago sells anything about anyone including disclosing <strong>where your teen lives</strong> and the social networks they use. It gets its consumer information exclusively from <strong>Acxiom</strong> corporation.  If you don’t know who Acxiom is you should, it is the <strong>world’s largest data broker.</strong></p>
<p>Data brokers sell information to <strong>criminals</strong> all the time....Identity thieves buy info from brokers also, <strong>so do pedophiles</strong> and other predators.</p>

<h2>About Acxiom</h2>
<p>All data brokers have a folksy fairytale origin.  Either they were the first to print phonebooks in that area back in the day, or to \'ingeniously\' compile area auto sales information, etc.  In Acxiom\'s case, it was &quot;humble <strong>direct mail marketing&quot;</strong> for young leaders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Charles D.] Ward founded Demographics Inc. [former name of Acxiom] with his brother Stephen Ward in <strong>1969</strong>(1)  to meet the needs of the Young Leadership Council for the Democratic Party, of which he was a member, which wanted to create political mailing lists that were competitive with <strong>a data processing system set up by Winthrop Rockefeller</strong>(2) and the Arkansas Republican Party.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/0ZKM9">http://archive.is/0ZKM9</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I speculate all of these big data corporations were planned covert intelligence operations, off the books of the government.</strong>  </p>
<p>(1) Note the founding year 1969 contains three sixes, two inverted; this is possibly a Satanic no-Intelligence Community &quot;wink.&quot;</p>
<p>(2) <a href="http://archive.is/ZODIE">Winthrop Rockefeller</a> was the older brother of David Rockefeller, who in <a href="http://archive.is/eICWI">1954 co-founded <strong>The Bilderberg Group</strong></a> (the same year that IMS Health was started.)  </p>
<p><strong>There\'s no doubt that personal information has long been aggregated to provide macro and individual data for Bilderberg think tank social engineering including for potential victims and customers of child pornography and trafficking.</strong>  As well as other things.  All such databases of the populace have surely been sent to the CIA/Bilderberg.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current Acxiom locations listed on their site include across the U.S. as well as:  Paris, London, Australia, Germany, Poland, China, Singapore, and Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acxiom.com/about-us/locations/">https://www.acxiom.com/about-us/locations/</a> archive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619032322/https://www.acxiom.com/about-us/locations/">here</a></p>
<p>In my opinion the website is purposely confusing and overblown:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acxiom.com">https://www.acxiom.com</a> archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619033418/https://www.acxiom.com">here</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Never Heard of Acxiom?....a little-known Little Rock company--the world\'s largest processor of consumer data....&quot;</strong></p>
<p>...take a walk through Acxiom\'s five-acre data center in Conway, Ark...has enough storage space to house all the information in the Library of Congress 50 times over, and maintains a database on 96% of U.S. households that gives marketers a so-called <strong>real-time, 360-degree view of their customers.</strong></p>
<p>How? Acxiom provides a <strong>13</strong>-digit code for every person, &quot;so we can identify you wherever you go,&quot; </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/LqrYa">http://archive.is/LqrYa</a></li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Thirteen is a prized occult number.</strong>  Also, the Fortune magazine article states \'Acxiom solved 9/11\' and implied \'they were not previously acquainted with the government\'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like most of these major companies, Acxiom lays out a clean image for the public and touts their care for their employees who they have created so many jobs for, as well as their philanthropic and humble natures. Although people are waking up to the realization that &quot;innocent marketing&quot; may in fact be a heretofore unnoticed <strong>dark underside of our society.</strong>  This is quite a story (below); scroll down to the last two comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trans Union and <strong>Acxiom</strong> are <strong>corrupt</strong> organizations which have used extortion, theft, wire fraud, securities fraud, computer hacking and perjury to achieve their profit goals and revenue streams by stealing billions of credit records from individual credit bureaus....This is the largest data theft and wire fraud in history. </p>
<p>The case settled on October 31, 2007 for $11,000,000.00.... [Cliff] Mortensen received $6,000,000.00 and his lawyers received $5,000,000.00....The day Cliff Mortensen settled for $6,000,000.00 net, he was bankrupt by three million dollars</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Clinton\'s and Acxiom</h2>
<p>Longstanding ties and donations, including the <strong>Clinton Foundation:</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I first met Hillary in August of 1974,&quot; says Jerry Jones, Acxiom\'s chief ethics and legal officer, exec VP and assistant secretary....working with Ms. Clinton at Rose Law Firm in Little Rock....Mr. Clinton was the keynote speaker at Acxiom\'s annual client event.... </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of Bill Clinton\'s <strong>&quot;dubious ties to the direct marketing industry [direct mail marketing/data brokers]&quot;</strong> are noted in this <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pQACBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12&amp;lpg=PT12&amp;dq=the+clintons+and+acxiom&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nrBHJENc94&amp;sig=FG7jFC6bDm79aMUlgeMYKTKndSw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT0oWenMjUAhUIeT4KHceuCb8Q6AEINDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20clintons%20and%20acxiom&amp;f=false">book</a>  Screen capture of <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4245/35376260216_9cf278311e_o.png">excerpt</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the <strong>Clinton administration</strong> has acted as a virtual <strong>lobbyist for the direct marketing industry</strong> in <strong>blocking Europe\'s attempts to protect its citizens\' personal information</strong> from the data vultures in the United States.  Taxpayers\' money has been used by a traveling band of Commerce Department officials to strong-arm politicians and bureaucrats [in Europe]....</p>

<h3>What kind of &quot;commerce&quot; was this really about, to involve Bill Clinton when he was supposed to be running our country? Was it related to human sex trafficking, a multi-billion dollar industry??</h3>

           All data brokers have a folksy fairytale origin.  Either they were the first to print phonebooks in that area back in the day, or to 'ingeniously' compile area auto sales information, etc.  In Acxiom's case, it was "humble
           <strong>
            direct mail marketing"
           </strong>
           for young leaders:

          <blockquote>
           <p>

             1969

            COMMON CORE Psychological profile tests starting in kindergarten.
           </p>
           <p>
            The tests do not include academic achievement rather they are psychological profile tests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Results are not available to the parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Results are sold in large databases.

             Speaking of schools, school-issued iPads starting in 2nd grade (at least in my part of the U.S.) and in high school assignments must all be submitted electronically. There's no getting away anymore.

            Add the recent pushing of puberty suppressing drugs with irreversible effects!  Sick. Not to mention brain-fried parents wanting to encourage PC tranny toddlers /s

           <p>
            It's like Globalist Pedos are designing a world utopia for Pedos and Satanists.  Delay puberty long enough and the child-like body still excites the pedo freaks while they continue promoting the lowering of (or abolishing) the age of consent.

              I just saw a video discussing it the other night, how, due to the culture of PC obsessing over gender, some parents want their kids to be gay or transgender...because of their politics and because it's cool for them...(like having an exotic pet imo). I had not realized the prevalence of puberty blockers, but apparently they are used at ages 9-11?  I couldn't find the video unfortunately so I'm going off of memory.  The key info had to do with the fact that many seemingly transgender young people eventually 'grow' into their biological sex...and the downside of the hormones is that the changes can not be reversed, there's no going back (micro penis), and there are health risks involved, physical (blood clots, infertility, bone loss) and mental (depression).  Risk of suicide can increase even more than if no treatment happened.  One of the scariest things about the subject (besides the pedo angle), is how the culture has turned into a circus side show, kids are becoming the products of their parents 'searching' for gender, or their teacher's 'searching' for gender...etc...how is it that there is a sudden Explosion in numbers of transgender kids?  Either there is something in the food we eat screwing with hormones or the country is under some serious psyops with medical experimentation happening on kids.

              I looked up an article:

             </p>

              "The use of puberty blockers to treat transgender children is what’s considered an “off label” use of the medication — something that hasn’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And doctors say their biggest concern is about how long children stay on the medication, because there isn’t enough research into the effects of stalling puberty at the age when children normally go through it.  ..their use in treating transgender children is a relatively new practice, first prescribed in the United States by the Gender Management Service at Boston Children’s Hospital in 2007, and recommended in the Endocrine Society’s guidelines for the treatment of transgender people in 2009."
             </p>
             <p>
              "What makes treatment tricky is that there is no test that can tell whether a child experiencing distress about their gender will grow up to be transgender. The handful of studies that do exist suggest that gender dysphoria persists in a minority of children, but they involved very few children and were done mostly abroad."
              <em>
               and what can make a kid stress over gender more than having gender obsessed parents?
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              '...doctors caution that estrogen and testosterone, the hormones that are blocked by these medications, also play a role in a child’s neurological development and bone growth.
“We do know that there is some decrease in bone density during treatment with pubertal suppression,” Finlayson said, adding that initial studies have shown that starting estrogen and testosterone can help regain the bone density. What Finlayson said there isn’t enough research on is whether someone who was on puberty blockers will regain all their bone strength, or if they might be at risk for osteoporosis in the future.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another area where doctors say there isn’t enough research is the impact that suppressing puberty has on brain development.
             </p>
             <p>
              “The bottom line is we don’t really know how sex hormones impact any adolescent’s brain development,” Dr. Lisa Simons, a pediatrician at Lurie Children’s, told FRONTLINE. “We know that there’s a lot of brain development between childhood and adulthood, but it’s not clear what’s behind that.” What’s lacking, she said, are specific studies that look at the neurocognitive effects of puberty blockers."

            Hell of a post op. I think Johnny Gosch witnesses say he was being photographed in the neighborhood a month prior to his kidnapping. An insider says photographs like that went into a shopping catalogue. When someone would order a kid out of the catalogue, the finders would go seek and nab the kid. Gone forever.

              I'm sorry that happened. You can't blame yourself, unless you killed the abductors on the spot, or fled with the boy anonymously, you and your family and friends might have been targeted and killed had you gotten in their way. That is why this situation is even more horrible. Try to forgive yourself.

             Incredible Post. Compiling all of that research and submitting it in an understandable but mind blowing way is amazing work. Many Upvoat s for you.

             Yes. That was part of Obamacare. There is a provision in it that requires patients to surrender their DNA or genome for health care so an individual marker is stored for each person by the government. This has failed so far although HRC was supposed to push it over the line in single payer healthcare. The failure of Obamacare was no accident everyone it was meant to fail and become government mandated and 23&amp;Me compliant.

             In coming years it may be conceivable to design a pathogen that targets a specific person’s genome. This agent may spread through populations showing minimal or no symptoms, yet it would be fatal to the intended target (4)."
