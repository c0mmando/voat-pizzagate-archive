<p>The comments below seek to expose forces that collide to create a situation that we must look at as calmly as possible, and in a new light, in the age of pizzagate.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood</p>
<p>Planned parenthood is an organization that was borne of eugenics and was originally supported by the Bush family. As creepy and questionable as the origin story of PP is, they are the biggest provider of healthcare related to reproductive health. I come from a country where there was a lawsuit years ago because abortion clinic charged women money for their procedure. This mindset is also present in every other industrialized country except the U.S. In the U.S. there is almost no public support for abortion and PP can\'t subsidize women for the multiple expenses associated with getting a legal procedure. There has been controversy lately because PP donates fetal tissue to research. The understanding between PP and labs is not profitable (if you have access to documentation about Big Pharma, as I have seen, it\'s quite amazing how very well-funded labs obtain valuable tissue easily from an organization that could really use the funds). These are all considerations that seem to fit into the greater scheme of pizzagate.</p>
<p>But PP doesn\'t seem to serve the system as much as...</p>
<p>Alternative Birthing Facilities</p>
<p>In every big city there are tons of &quot;pseudo abortion clinics&quot; that actually seek to convince women to not have an abortion. These clinics don\'t perform abortions but they might give the impression they do. Their goal is to neg a patient until they can no longer get an abortion legally. <strong>The first page of your phone book will have all of their names under Abortion Clinic</strong> This fraud usually results in a situation where adoption becomes the only choice for women who can\'t raise a child. These organizations are not hospitals or real clinics so they are not under any oversight. They are usually associated with small religious groups. They can pretend to do whatever they want! If they route women through a birthing clinic they also control, they can spirit away babies without any paper trail. Additionally people who want to obtain a baby (re: Magestic Ape\'s monologue about Sasha having her baby comes to mind) then they can route the birth mother through such a birthing center. We have already found people in our ecosystem who control ALL of the aspects of \'baby ownership\' (adoption, legal representation, etc.) so we know they can do this.</p>
<p>I come from fraudulent origins, having been taken away from my single mother by the Church and given to &quot;better people&quot; so I have pondered the problem of baby shuffling for social engineering for  a while. I have no reason to think it doesn\'t still go. Whether for moralistic reasons, or to feed a system that requires disposable babies.</p>
<p>If you could take time to look around your town and do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the list of Abortion Clinics and try to find the ones that don\'t provide abortions but route people towards adoption.</li>
<li>Identify the group that runs/funds these facilities.</li>
<li>Find matching birthing centers and adoption agencies.</li>
<li>Map the influencers from the funding group across these businesses.</li>
<li>Try to find controversies in local media (going back a few decades)</li>
<li>Ask if your local BBB has files on these facilities</li>
<li>Hope that the BBB isn\'t in on it :(</li>
</ul>

            I mentioned my story for the same reason. Some people just see it as a silo of fetuses and it's really obvious to me that those poeple have either led a singularly charmed life and/or have never been inside a Planned Parenthood. I used their pre-natal services when pregnant with my eldest; my midwife was awesome.
           </p>
           <p>
            It always bummed me out to go in for a pre-natal visit and have to face the gauntlet of religiously-motivated abortion protesters... as if God didn't abort a whole planet down a toilet, or have civilizations that used bitter gall as a priest-approved abortifacient. 
Bah, the beast of ignorance!
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry for tangent. But I agree with your original argument. And as a side note, by having paid protesters ranting against abortion, it creates cover for the harvest of newborns to flourish.

            well I wouldn't start a post with it myself, my concern for pizzagate is intentional systemic abuse of power &amp; resources and how that is manifest through pedophilia/sex abuse/blackmail.

            You might find this story interesting, it doesn't really say where all the babies ended up, most probably went back to the parents, but this guy nursed over 8,000 babies as a Coney Island Island side show. I'm not saying its related to pizzagate.

            Planned Parenthood saved my life. Went in for an abortion (was on birth control that failed, so it was a double whammy), found out it was Trophoblastic disease (no embryo, only placenta-like tissue that can go cancerous)... Without the PP, I would have endured a wait three weeks for a Dr appt, and anything pregnancy related is pretty f'n urgent. If trophoblastic tissue gets migrates from uterus to liver or brains, no amount of chemo will help. After the procedure, the doctor asked if I would consider donating the tissue; there a couple forms of trophoblastic disease, and by having a pathologist go over it, they could tell me which one it was. I consented. I'm still okay with that donation. The more we can understand something, the better, and with how ignorant America is by large, regarding reproduction and it's various topics, the better the reason to support scientific inquiry.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, there's something that I don't get about the whole harvesting abortion for parts or rituals. The embryo is tiny in the first trimester. Second trimester abortions are iffy, and the vast major practitioners aren't gung-ho for them due to increased bloodflow to the area and risk of hemorrhage. And even then, the fetus is pretty small. Third trimester abortions are rare, despite all the publicity about them. If a woman has endured 6+ months of pregnancy, odds are she wanted that baby (or was guilted into carrying to term because people feel the need to make people do what they want)...
           </p>
           <p>
            So to me, it makes more sense to guilt women into giving birth and then surrendering the infants to those who want to "help," rather than part out placenta and embryos for ritual use. The system they have in place requires it; if women at large are allowed to plan their pregnancies, then they deprive the military complex a bunch of boots on the ground and sound cannon fodder. They want women producing babies and staying in poverty because it makes them easier to control when you can leverage their children against them (hello CPS)

            I have been questioning planned parenthood for a while now and why their organization was pushed so hard by Clinton admin. There has to be a purpose that they serve to the elites or they wouldn't care if they were funded or not....also, a Catholic Church down the road from where I work but up a sign about 2 weeks ago about offering comfort and support for unplanned pregnancies. Very, very strange because they have never been a voice in the community for anything and are the only Catholic Church we have actually. Nice work

            These fake centers using religious ideology to persuade women into adoption instead of an abortion,  is emotional blackmail.  It has always seemed hypocritical to me how the same people who are adamantly against abortions are for the death penalty, pro-war, against children's healthcare and education, so their religious sanctimony flies out the fucking window. So the answer here is that maybe the babies aren't expected to grow up, and money is involved. (btw I am glad you grew up Evaeverywhere).

So you propose forcing those who can't pay for their children to carry to term, where you will promptly ignore the babies and children who starve, suffer neglect, and possibly turn to crime in order to support an untenable existence? When access to safe abortion would have prevented the suffering before it even started? I suppose next you're going to say that women who can't afford to raise a child should never have sex or get raped? Perhaps you're better off campaigning for all the men in the world to voluntarily swear to celibacy unless they fully intend to raise a child with the woman they want to have sex with.

              Killing people is either moral or immoral, so when the state decides its okay to kill people, than abortion should also be legal, Innocence is not really relevant. How many innocent people are or have ever been on death row? more than one? How many innocent people die in wars? countless. A convicted murderer can stay in prison. I am saying that the argument is hypocritical, not right or wrong. There are a lot of antiwar/antideath penalty people who are okay with abortion, its the same hypocrisy in reverse.

            There was something similar to this posted on Voat a few months ago... it was a "Christian" website that was looking for pregnant runaway teens, offering to "just call and we'll pick you up" and it had the EXACT same hand-in-heart logo that politics and prose had.

            I agree with the thesis of this post, and especially like the local TO-DO checklist.
Also, home births with doulas are a way some get around having to notify authorities of births.
I will note that the BBB has a bad reputation for protecting only small businesses who pay their protection money.

            Great work. This makes me feel ill. I did wonder how they source these children because surely not all parents can be consenting/part of it.
