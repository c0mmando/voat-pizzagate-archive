<p>This is a website specifically about glass bottle marks (!!?), and here is what it says about this logo:
&quot;Triangles (one triangle inside a larger triangle) …………………..seen on the base of small cobalt blue ointment jars, in several sizes. These jars contained Vicks VapoRub salve.  I believe the two triangles was an actual registered trademark. This particular mark was probably used on jars from a specific span of time; not sure on exact years they were made, but the examples I’ve seen appear to  date from the 1910s, 1920s or 1930s.  Later jars may have one triangle with the words “Vicks / VapoRub” encircling it, or a “V V V” logo along with the words, and there are probably many other slight variations in existence. This is a very common jar, frequently found in 20th century bottle dumps, and loved by collectors of cobalt blue glass for it’s brilliant color. Many of these containers were produced by Maryland Glass Company, of Baltimore, but most of them are not marked with the glassmakers’ identification.   Vicks VapoRub jars have been made of plastic since (I think) the early to mid-1970s.&quot;</p>
