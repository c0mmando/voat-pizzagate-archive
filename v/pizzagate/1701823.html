            I am not surprised. 
Not trying to self-promote, but I posted about a month ago about a picture of a naked girl that was posted on Facebook by one of James Alefantis' friends. Another voat user, Kwijibo, reported it to Facebook but it was not removed because "it didn't violate Facebook's community standards"

            We have to do a better job at red pilling their parents.  I believe these kids though, when they get a little older will be getting red pilled themselves.  That is if we still have the internet. Hillary is still fighting for control.  She still controls the DNC.  You can see on the internet what they did with the Roll Call vote that Perez won.  He is her man.  That is how Bernie lost at the DNC in Philly.  The fudged the Roll Call vote and threw the Robert's Rules out the window.  What a country.

            I resisted after getting an invitation from somebody I didn't even know, likely a contact of someone I knew at college, even one of my girlfriends (I kept friends with my ex when in college, broke up cos we were too much the same, anyway), I remember seeing my then current gf that I did not want to join this facebook thing, I didn't like myspace and this kind of crap.

            Long term girlfriend in 2009 forced me to join in, it had a program scan my IM programs, MSN Messenger, YIM, AIM and yeah, I'm glad I barely participate in anything, I just use a third party program to use it as an IM system for now with otr encryption with those who wanted to learn how to from me (3 out of 50 or so contacts), but at least I don't have to logon to the site to chat and have it be like MSN was to me, my answering machine because I turn off my cell phone when I'm in front of my desktop.

            They seem pretty committed to free speech to me.  For instance, they chose the topic of censorship as the first issue of a magazine they're starting

            While not related directly to free speech, their bill of rights outlines a social contract protecting privacy

            I was on Facebook from 2009 until November of 2016. I have seen their one-sided policy enforcement from the blunt end more times than I care to count. I once posted a picture of a sand sculpture of a girl in a bikini laying on her stomach and it was censored. SAND!!! In a bikini!
           </p>
           <p>
            I have likewise seen plenty of people with pictures of full nudity...even of very young girls or boys...and reported them only to be told that it doesn't violate their policy. Well, I've had enough!

            Close your facebook accounts.  Everyone, imagine how that would affect them.  This must stop and we must create attention by leaving facebook.  I don't have one, so I cannot participate.  I hate facebook.

             I use Pidgin to have my contacts there as if it was Skype, because some are too stupid to know that their old MSN Messenger account works on Skype. At least with Pidgin and Facebook you can encrypt your shit and all that gets recorded in facebook on the site itself is "encrypted traffic" in your chat logs. Some friends of mine also use Linphone with me, but you gotta be a man of your time and use Linux, its not for windows, I think anyway. Mint now makes it so that using windows is inexcusable. I prefer my message board/forum communities and then here and reddit before they banned this topic and I was kinda of getting sick of it because of mods in some subs encouraging scam artists and not banning them, in a sub about YOU being the gatekeeper and deciding what medication you need, not the kind that demands blood testing of course, but yeah, complaints against mods who protected scam artists just a bit before that and I was sad to leave for good (almost). But I'm mods on a couple of forums so of course the joys of the internet are often feeling like work if there's too much stupidity going around, thankfully Trumptards aren't seen very much, he's as guilty as Clinton when it comes to Epstein, loads of girls who worked at Maro Lago also were among the hundred of teenage girls who were given millions of dollars by Epstein not to prosecute or make a class-action suit....anyway Epstein might be the key that drags away Trump too and maybe we can have a fresh reload in north america....i'm just north, the rest of "America", that's watching in horror even more than other countries due to being like a fucking scandinavian country glued to your country, although I love America, the good things about it, hell a series of my ancestors lived in New England to escape the brits for 3 generations when Upper and Lower Canada were trying to do like you guys and revolt and get rid of the monarchy. It's too bad english canadians are not taught about that in high school history like we do here in QC, NB, NF, NS etc.

              They just love to scrub those history books.  It gives them clean backgrounds and erases all of their mistakes.  Not only will they erase the past, they will arrange the future by printing lies in the textbooks of our children. Oh, have you noticed, there are no real textbooks anymore.  Many of my friends have mentioned they never see them at the homes of their grand children.   Hmmm.

               I can attest that there is still this despite the provincial "Liberal" Party slashing education for health and transportation. And when the PQ comes in they put back in schools and slash transportation and construction big time, the CAQ will never be in power, right wing seperatists..strange ones, they forgot the PQ is a mix of left and right wingers going for the same goal. Anyway, I can say that my female cousin's and youngest uncles and aunts are pretty normal, they love to read books, skateboard, play video games and they have textbooks. It's like the experiment is heavily implemented on the US and the UK right now. We got rid of a Zio-Fascist who with helmet hair and high saluting left hand (strange how they both go together) 9 years of a fake "Conservative" party, the Conservative Party here was called the Progressive-Conservative party, well it is in provinces still, except mine cause we had no right wing parties for 40 years until one of the remnants of the PCP's who after a huge scandal which left us with a female prime minister who was horrendous for 6 months, Liberals and NDP slashes 'em so hard due to that scandal, even prairies provinces voted Liberal massively (federally I have to say). They were reduced to 3 seats, their chief left to join the Liberal Party of my province and turn it into a "Conservative" party. Then the 2 extreme right wing parties (Reform Party, Canadian Alliance....just the name of that second one was giving one goosebumps) who were fringe merged with the 3 MP's left in the late 90's of the PCP and formed the "Conservative Party", which should have been the NeoConservative party but yeah, they took out Progressive from the name, I guess that's enough heh. But yeah thankfully here health, education and other things are provinces rights in fact, responsabilities, Canada is a confederation, not a federation, so the federal gov is not as strong as it wishes it would be, it does split the money and does control some stuff, like bridges, and in Montreal we got like 6 bridges that are all pretty old, one so old and decrepit, they are building another next to it and its gonna take 14 years when they said it would take 10-12 years. Champlain bridge...if you visit Canada, remember Montreal is an island, take another bridge than the Champlain, it's always in construction because they keep it just enough in shape so that it stands while the other is being built next to it. It's being done by a pro of an architect, some dude who made a tunnel from Denmark to Sweden, so I'm sure it's not his fault there is...retard in the process, likely the federal government, Ottawa are ineffective goofs, thank fuck for how provinces are so very free here.

              I am so busy reading articles and news and now on voat, I never ever had the time to even think about those type of sites.  As I suggested, quite facebook, tweet (if you have an account) then tweet out statements about pedophilia, trafficking, organs, without the word pizzagate.  Use your brain and come up with strategic wording.  Cut the cord, that is the best thing we ever did and are saving over $100 a mo.  Thanks for taking that step.

               I'm thankful the 50 or so people (a normal number of people you gotta have here, you can only have like 2-3 real real friends in real life so everyone else other than family is acquaintances and that's it, at least for 95% of the population. Thankfully they are not emo pussies who use it as their intimate journal, those things...you can have them on livejournal with a fucking screen-name and that's it, if you feel you gotta share it. The web around 2006-7 started to suck when all those newfrogs who weren't closet nerds like me or actual nerds invaded the internet. I miss IRC and there being 150 000k people on Undernet and every town had a channel and you could make friends this way if you wanted, back then we were encouraged strongly not to give personal details online. I read stories of women who are so fucking naive on online dating sites who wire the guy money because they're "in love" and they get bankrupt because of these scammers...at least way back we could laugh at the nigerian prince bullshit and even troll them for nude pics if they were women.

               I have been emailing recently.  I do like that.  John Podesta taught me not to trust gmail so I found a more secure one and started keeping in touch with loved ones via email.

              They exist. The trouble is getting enough people to switch over to make them worth using. Facebook has a huge head start.

               Yes, Tent is a good base to make one, but I'm not good enough for that. I think forums who might seem to have only one topic often have a vibrant Off-Topic forum so that's most of my internet socializing since...well, since usenet text groups started dying in 2003-2004. I know there's still some, especially with the kind of group google created, but it's mostly mega tecchy stuff that even I, someone with 2/3 of a BSc in Networking (didn't finish the last year, found a job in the field that thought I was competent enough, luckily enough, it was through a friend, people are right, there's no jobs if you don't have contacts.

               It needs to be catchy.....open source brainstorming of ideas would be good.  Then let the programmers implement the framework for a site.   Think back to where Yahoo was with social networking before it was bought and CIA designed facebook was rolled out.  Now, there are enough outside of that contrived facebook/mainstream media paradigm that a new site could flourish.  I can think of all kinds of ways to improve on what facebook offers its users.....a more friendly interface, added features, less advertising, and a social network system for self regulation of the entire site.  Have the news user generated with a scoring system from local on up as to what is national news.. that sort of thing.  Lots of ideas.....first step is the brainstorming to develop an overall concept and specifics.  Then put programmers to work on building it.

                You sound like you could be the one to do a post about the brainstorming, and I think it would create a lot of attention, and original ideas as well. I am not tech savvy enough to even do a link.  I just heard on my local news that facebook is now announcing that it is letting people flag items they think should be "fake news" and they will be sent to a team of people that will check them out and verify.  Another CTR and Snopes rolled into one.  One other interesting item I was surprised at is that they reported on the Vault 7 release and that the CIA has control of your car!  Amazing.
