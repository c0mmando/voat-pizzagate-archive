            I am from Juarez. Lived there during the bad times, municipal police were replaced by military police due to all the compromised officers for 2 years. I'll tell you something though, MP are way more corrupt than the Municipal Police. Every branch of law enforcement is biased by selective cartels in certain areas, be it Municipal, State, Federal, Judicial, Military, and Ministry Police. Our entire country is dependent on the black market industrt the cartel produces, it is one of the main factors of our economy. Mexico needs a drastic reform, it needs to depend on its capitalism.
The point I'm trying to get across here is, although you might find some law enforcement with integrity, you cannot trust any of the branches of Mexican law enforcement I just mentioned.

             do you know much about the border gangs in Brownsville? My ex's step brother was in one but I do not know the name. He's now in FBI witness protection &amp; I'm horrified that he got away with this.

              Yes, I think you are talking about the Border Brothers or Carnales, Barrio Azteca. They work for la Linea. There are also rival gangs (Mejicles, Artistas Asesinos) working for rival cartels, but the dominant gang on TX borders is Barrio Azteca. It's not just drugs, its all the black market merchandise they distribute. The feminicides in Juarez? Snuff Movies, Pay2Play torture, satanic ritual orgies by the Juarez Elite, human and organ trafficking across borders. That's the demand that fueled those horrors. Executed by these local street gangs. Adolfo Costanzo in the Brownsville/Matamoros border is another instance of horrors fueled by black market demand, managed to turn a street gang into a satanic cult.
Growing up I experienced my fair share of traumatic events in Juarez. One instance, a next door neighbor of mine, just a little older than I, was befriended by these 2 shady characters I had previously warned him about, they eminated this really cold and dark vibe. A few weeks go by and I get the word that the 2 shady guys had performed a live dissection on my 17 year old neighbor, no anaesthesia, his chest ripped wide open, left his hollow body a few blocks away from a bar his mother owns downtown. The news sent chills throughout my entire body, I felt numb and horrified, I had just seen him the other day. That picture i painted in my head as I was being told the details definetly scarred me. These terrifying crimes are commited by members of local gangs, commanded by a superior catering to the demand of black market goods. More than likely wotshipping Santa Muerte and participating in rituals.

               Oh my goodness. Well he is now I believe somewhere up near San Antonio? I don't know. I was completely horrified when I found out about this from my children. My ex actually lets them hang out with this person on their vacation trips to see his dad. He's supposedly in witness protection but in my mind that equals an informant. I will never ever forgive my ex for how he has put our children at risk this way. I hope his rotten retard of a step brother croaks very soon before harm comes the way of the rest of his family. He's an unreasonable risk.

             No offence with this question here but why don’t the people, especially the fighting age men, stand up and take back their country instead of fleeing to the US? It will never get better until someone has the balls to stand up and do something about it. Mexico is a country with an abundance of natural resources, there is no reason for the people to be living in fear and poverty other than the cartels. The cops and military and fighting age men in the country need to band together and fight the cartels out of existence. First, they need strong morals to want to do it and stop taking bribes from drug cartels to look the other way.

              These people don't threaten the men, they threaten their families. People are much easier to control when you threaten those they care about.

              The cartel turns people bit by bit. It takes decades.
             </p>
             <p>
              If they tried to force a huge number of policemen and working fighting age men to work for them in one go, they would never have gained the power that they did.

              They all need to come together. Armed Militias are literally coming into cities and towns and committing mass murder on anyone who stands in their way. They will kill whole families and commit public decapitations. They will kill a whole families or shoot a whole city block up and commit mass murder if they feel like it. They are kidnapping anyone they want at will and especially love kidnapping children. With the Mexican Military stepping in we can see that Mexico is literally in a war right now with the cartel vs the population.

               Those armed militias you speak of are los Zetas, the most gruesome and sadistic orgamized group of criminals, composed of active and ex military. The violence in México is directly fueled by narcopolitics and black market demand the US. I'm almost certain the CIA enables that industry. Mexico isn't going to improve until the US resolves it's (((issue))) within it's government.

            Hi gamepwn. Can you provide something specific regarding child trafficking and the Acupulco police? While this news is promising, it's a bit too generic to meet Rule 1 as is. PIck one or two from
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=acupulco+child+trafficking&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab">
             these
            </a>
            articles showing child sex trafficking is rampant in Acupulco and add them, and I will remove the flair. Thanks!

               Any time we see any stories dealing with Central American nations, Mexico in particular, we need to remember that NXIVM had massive political connections there. There will be fall out. It will not be mentioned in any MSM articles, as they now refuse to say child sexual abuse, and call it sexual abuse is all.
              </p>
              <p>
               MSM won't connect the dots for us, between groups like NXIVM, Clinton Foundation members/donors, etc. We are the ones that must try to make first through third degree of separation connections between the stories mentioned and the trail back to pizzagate. Also people neglect even speaking about the panama papers any more. How many of Jeffery Epstein's island buddies were in the panama papers?

                Yes, to have children of three Mexican ex-presidents in an organization like this is most astonishing. And one of them runs the Mexican branch now that Raniere went to prison (and maybe even runs branches in other countries as well).

            This has happened in other places.  They have to retrain an entirely new police force and the military takes over for the time being.  Mexico is in Limbo.   Salinas.

Lets just hope AMLO does some good during his term. I've met the man before, very genuine person with sincere concerns about Mexico. Don't really agree with his politics, to socialist for my taste, but its better than shit we had before.

              Yeah, I agree with your assessment.  But many times those running will say many things to appease voters, when in power they soften their stance.  Let's hope this is the case.  I have a connection to Mexico and he says that Obrador was the man that the people of Mexico had really wanted when Nieto was elected.  They would not let him run, so maybe this IS a good thing.

               For sure, Obrador has ran for president the plenty of times in the past, under different political parties. He has been the underdog in the elections, and he technically won the election in 2012. But just as we have seen here in the US in the past, elections have been a charade, and who ever the pick is, has ushered in by the PRI. That wasn't the case this year. AMLO created his own political party, and gained so much momentum, the movement was huge, that he couldn't be cheated out of his presidency this time. He is extremely liberal, and has a socialist way of politics. He's like a Mexican Bernie Sanders.

            Acapulco used to be one of the hottest places to go in Mexico until it all went to shit.  The US should just legalize marijuana, cocaine and heroin and take the power away from the cartels.  Fuck meth though.  Kill anyone that makes that shit.

             All drugs are bad. If they were legal they wouldn't have the same allure and less people would care to try it. I say legalize all drugs. Make all opiates and adderall OTC, its sales would go to practically nonexistent.

              Yes all drugs are bad. Not arguing with you there. But crystal methamphetamine is definitely the worst.
If we were to do a controlled experiment, where we had 2 towns, both towns contain it's fair share of drug consumers (THC, Opiates, Cocaine). And the only varying factor is that own town has Meth users and one doesn't. You would see how badly affected the community with the meth is compared to the one without. It has multiple routes of administration, has the highest risk to spread disease and infections, and causes profound psychosis (which poses danger to anybody around this psychotic individual). 
Drugs should be controlled, not entirely legalized for recreation, some should be permanently banned like Meth for instance. 
The demand of marijuana from Mexico has diminished due to the better quality of product in California and Colorado. But when it comes to Cocaine which is the main component of narco revenue, there is no way the US would receive that prodcut if it wasn't for Mexico, even if it was somehow recreationally legal. And opiates should have stricter rules in the US. I'm all for banning that poison. One thing about Mexico, is that you will never get a prescription of opiate pain killers from your doctor. You might find morphine in hospitals but thats about it, no oxy or vicodin in farmacies. If you break a bone the best your gonna get is a combo of ketorolac and tramadol. Benzodiazepines are abundant though.

               I'm not really in favor of drugs, I just think that the prison industry ruins more lives than drugs. Interesting info you have about opiates. Bans always create black market violence and other trafficking ops which is why I'm also in favor of legalization. But you can't un ban everything.

             The Cartel that runs the territory in Juarez, "La Linea", enforces this rule. Anyone caught manufacturing, distributing or consuming Methamphetamine is an automatic death sentence. Rival cartels like the "Chapos" from Sinaloa push their merch through our territory, and that includes Crystal Meth. The Juarez Cartel are Drug Runners, don't get me wrong, but at least they have enough ethics not to want our community exposed to that shit of a substance.

                Oh, yes, please read.  I thought I had sent you a different link also.  The one about the head of Interpol missing  He is Chinese and they think they took him in for questioning in China.  Now his wife has reported him missing since Sept. 25th and she has been threatened.  All this stuff about China going on and I wonder if it is connected.  The pope just made some deal with the Chinese and the Church there.

              I thought we protected the poppy fields in Afghanistan. That's what the military guys over there said anyway.  Google poppy fields Afghanistan and every other picture is a US soldier guarding a field.

               They are "guarding" them so that "Poppy Bush" (George Bush/friends/CIA) could go straight to the source and control the opium trade. Bush has made a fortune trafficking in drugs. I lot of the huge old money families made their huge treasure chests selling dope. I don't remember the whole cast of characters that got wealthy beyond imagination dumping opium into China back in the day.

                True.  The Kennedy clan got rich off moonshine during prohibition.  It's amazing when you realize these elites at the top levels of government are combination actors and thugs in sheeps clothing.  The government is organized crime "legitimized".

             I’m confused about this.   Why would they bother ?  All of Mexico is corrupt.

              They have a new President.   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.  He seems to be in some agreement with Trump.  We shall see.  Maybe he is behind this.  Hopefully so.
