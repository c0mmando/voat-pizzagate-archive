<p><strong>Matthews is a self-made millionaire who owns the exclusive hotel \'Eden Rock\' on the Caribbean island St. Barths.</strong> </p>
<p>He has been charged for two rapes at the end of the 1990s - one in Paris in 1998, one on St. Barths in 1999, when his niece was 15 and 16 yrs. old, respectively. </p>
<h1></h1>
<p><strong>The <a href="http://archive.is/szyIR">Daily Mail</a> reports today:</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>His alleged victim, now aged 34, lives in the UK but is understood to have come forward to police in the French capital last year. <strong>Her mother is said to be \'helping her with the case\'.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her mother \'helping her\' probably means she is willing to testify.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chief of the local Police Territoriale in the port town of Gustavia said that he found out about the alleged sexual assaults in the newspaper last week.</p>
<p>\'I tell you, we are very surprised,\' he said. \'This is someone we know on the island who has contact with the President. I can\'t tell you any more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I found interesting is that <strong>David Matthews is represented by a law firm that has also represented the Royal Family:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthews is being represented by Farrer &amp; Co, the London law firm which has represented members of the Royal Family for 300 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the hotel is closed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eden Rock is currently shuttered and undergoing extensive reconstruction after it was badly damaged during Hurricane Irma last September. Plans are for the hotel to reopen in winter 2018.</p>
<p>Staff and nearby shop owners told DailyMail.com that they had not seen Matthews for several weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lifelong resident interviewed by the Daily Mail said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'There is no law for these people on the island – they can do whatever they want here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p><strong>People in DM\'s comment section defend Matthews, stating that it\'s odd his niece filed the complaint after 20 years.</strong></p>
<h1></h1>
<p><em>Some additional information:</em> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Statute of limitations for rape cases in France is 20 years after the victim has turned 18. The alleged victim in this case would have turned 18 in 2003. This means the case can be dealt with up until 2023.</p>
<p>If found guilty, he faces up to 15 years in prison for the crime of \'rape of a minor by a person of authority\'.</p>
<p>The local police are not part of the investigation which is being led by the Juvenile Protection Brigade (BPM) in Paris. </p>

            I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but all of us are going to have to crash course on Caribbean geography.  Many of the thousands of private islands are owned by the cabal.  No law.  Money rules.  No questions.  Puddle jumpers and go-fasts get you to anyplace down there without questions.  There are going to be a lot more "orgy islands" popping up soon, I think.

             That's true.  Great comment.  I think many nefarious groups will be exposed for crimes on, under, and in yachts off those islands.  We citizen investigators knowing the geography will lead to more connections.  I don't know it at all.  Was there decades ago on a yacht trip and two things haunted me ever since.  Before then I didn't believe in bad vibes, but St. Barths' was so bad I decided I'd never go back.  No one/nothing was unpleasant, it was in the atmosphere.  Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan even stopped us on a rural road to politely ask for directions, but we were lost too.  Anyway, the atmosphere on Nevis was worse, it felt "evil."

               Weird coincidence -- I've been going down a rabbit hole of a Caribbean NGO called Love City Community Network, whose co-founder Jason Monigold was just arrested for child rape.  In looking into his associates who presumably are innocent,
               <a href="http://archive.is/5M09L">
                co-founder Rob Tutton
               </a>
               developed technology in the Navy to monitor, intercept, escort, etc. vessels off coastlines,
               <a href="http://archive.is/LXB9L">
                here
               </a>
               and
               <a href="http://archive.is/jWeEF">
                here.
               </a>
               Don't know whose side he's on, and child traffickers can't repel the U.S. military, but with the Caribbean being a lawless area it kind of raised a red flag for me.

              You asked about Rotherham in the other thread.  Matthews is from Rotherham and Savile operated in that area.  So there is a tie between Savile and Matthews.

              </a>
              I would recommend reading all the way up to #3 but if you scroll down to #3 you will see that Savile's area was Yorkshire and Rotherham is IN Yorkshire. This proves that Savile is tied to Rotherham and there is so much info here on Rotherham and his involvement too. So yes, I cannot imagine that Matthews and Savile did not meet up. IMPOSSIBLE. " Reportedly, Sir Jimmy Savile, whose main base was Yorkshire, worked for the intelligence services." " There has been massive child abuse in the town of Rotherham, in South Yorkshire."
