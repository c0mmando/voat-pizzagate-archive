<p>Recently, Gonzaga University has been brought under fire when <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/these-priests-abused-in-native-villages-for-years-they-retired-on-gonzagas-campus/">Reveal News investigated Gonzaga University</a> and discovered more than 20 priests accused of sexual abuse were living at the Cardinal Bea House on campus. </p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A trove of internal Jesuit correspondence shows a longstanding pattern of Jesuit officials in the Oregon Province—an administrative area that included Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho and Alaska—privately acknowledging issues of inappropriate sexual behavior, but not releasing that information to the public, which avoided scandal and protected the perpetrators from prosecution.</p>
<p>When abuse was discovered, the priests would be reassigned, sometimes to another Native community.</p>
<p>Once the abusive priests reached retirement age, the Jesuits moved them to Cardinal Bea House on Gonzaga’s campus or another Jesuit residence, to comfortably spend the rest of their lives in relative peace and safety. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Father John Whitney, former Oregon Province and who was responsible for Father James Poole - one of the most abusive priests there - moving into Cardinal Bea House, admitted in a deposition in 2005 that <strong>he did not notify Gonzaga administrators or Spokane police about Poole\'s history</strong>. Poole regularly attended basketball games and other events while living on campus, and even met with a female student alone - despite the fact that he previously abused more than 20 girls, one as young as 6 years old. </p>

            <p>
             Revelation 22:16 KJV
I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.

              The Bible refers to both Jesus and lucifer as 'the Morning Star'.   Isaiah 14:12:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               “How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn!
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Rendered by the King James Version as “O Lucifer, son of the morning!”
             </p>
             <p>
              The Babylonians worshipped their dead king Nimrod as 'the Morning Star' (sun worship). Nimrod aka Baal aka Saturn. The Babylonians thought Saturn was the sun.
             </p>
             <p>
              'Order of the Eastern Star - Freemasonry'. Freemasons worship lucifer. You only have to see how many Freemasons lodges are called 'Morning Star' to know that Morning Star=lucifer.

              in the ESOTERICshade sticky, I asked multiple times how to prove I'm not an alt and didn't get a response. I posted a screenshot of my one username out of desperation. I haven't posted shit in months, and the only reason I posted this is because it directly related to a previous submission I made. Am I forever going to be trolled until I am off voat completely, even though I'm not an ESOTERICshade alt? How is this kind of behavior acceptable for mods?

               I am happy to review what you said there. We are trying to sort out who is doing the gaslighting and who has been gaslit, twisted. You'll have to link me directly, though. There are over 1,000 comments in that thread now. Individual tidbits are difficult to find.

               The only reason this sub even has mods, TM, is to prevent the kind of consensus cracking and research suppression orchestrated by ES and his brigade. Our tools are either banning accounts or communicating about them. We have banned no one.

               Short of that possibility, I would recommend linking to and copypasting the comment you made where you apologized for whatever roll you played in helping ES or the Jem death psyop in response to Eric. The readers will have to decide for themselves.

                 Totally agree. But trolling users, calling them names, making threats like I'm going to fuck you up (as can be seen all on this thread, although not directed at me, but at another "ES alt") goes beyond simply communicating about users.

                   Here you are gaslighting. You do not link any such "proof". You link to a comment on a post about Q that was stickied to
                   <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                    v/pizzagate
                   </a>
                   . The post had 31 downvotes total, so I was obviously not alone in my feelings, which were simply that Q BS shouldn't be stickied in this sub. In fact, the top commenters, none of which are ES alts as far as I know (unless you know otherwise, which is possible), all seem to have the same opinion. Actually, now that I'm looking, even if you ignore the ES comments (and his rarepeeks comment), you have to really do some scrolling to get to any comment that doesn't disagree with the video or having it stickied. You're telling me that that has nothing to do with the number of downvotes? People vote with who they agree with. In this case, I see people largely agreeing that the video shouldn't have been stickied. I did not, and still do not, see that as blatant proof of vote brigading. Now, I do see ES and his alt rarepeeks both commenting on that post, so that would probably account for a whopping 2 of each vote (up or down, depending on the comment), but that's hardly proof of a brigade (please don't take me as that excusing it or saying it's okay, I'm just saying it doesn't account for all of the votes you were mentioning as proof in your comment). I'm sorry that that is such a sore point for you, but that certainly does not make me an alt.

                   Yes, he was all over the post. But so were a bunch of other users who also did not agree with the video. Are you saying you think all of those users are incapable of thinking for themselves and were duped into not liking the video because ES said so? I'm not sure I buy what you're selling.

                   ES is not the only user I've stuck up for. I have a tendency to say something when I see people being treated unfairly, which is probably why I feel such a connection to pizzagate. At the time, I was not aware of his manipulative tactics. Had I been aware I was going to get dragged into this shit, trust me, I wouldn't have stood up for him. But I would still have been open with you and whoever else if I didn't agree with something, just like I was in my comment on the Q video.

                   How about the idea that the mods, specifically Eric in this case,
                   <em>
                    are
                   </em>
                   being mean? So mods can run around saying whatever the hell they like and users can't say shit, or else risk being called an alt and accused of pushing the same narrative of someone else? Just because ES said something doesn't make it untrue. That's a logical fallacy. If ES said 2+2=4, and then you heard someone else say that, would they be an ES alt? Where do you draw the line? This is the only time I've pinged you for assistance with another mod (with the exception of once, back with millenialfalcon), and it was literally out of desperation, simply because I don't want to be trolled off of the board for something I am not.

                   I have hardly participated in "undermining the board". I spoke up when I didn't agree with things. I did not participate in vote brigading, and I have completely disassociated myself from ES (check if you like) since his alts were brought to light. Personally, I don't see there being any non-shady reasons to have alts, which is why I don't have any.

                   I've made it clear where I stand. I've always been straightforward and honest. You may not agree with me, you may not like me, but I am not an alt, and I don't deserve to be pushed off of the board or trolled when I post things. I would appreciate it if

               because there are more people there and the info will get more exposure since there are usually around 1500 people there compared to only 100 here. I agree and think it's time to abandon the

                 Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Why don't you give goats more credit ? Links would be requested, then verified or attacked. Besides I thought Voat has an upvoat / downvoat system so users could show who is legit. It's becoming clear that certain members only use the voating system to brigate positively or negatively as you can clearly see how my comments are being downvoated just because mods and their buddies don't like being questioned or decide someone isn't wanted 'round these parts.

                   I had to read that three times and I think I get what you're saying. So mods can gang up on members but everybody else is on their own even if other free agents don't agree with how other free agents are being treated. It's scary that you and the mods find that acceptable considering you pretty much admitted that bullying is allowed as long as you're one of the ones at the top of the pyramid. Seems like being a mod gives one a license to be abusive.

                   I already replied to Vindicator about certain mods behaving childishly by accusing members of being an alt. It's gotten beyond ridiculous. I'm surprised I'm not being called the alt of Amalek, EsotericShade, and anyone else that comes to mind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The mods who aren't accusing members of being alts are complacent to even allow this behavior from mods. But its always overlooked and the brigading commences.

                      There are no mods trying to ruin members contributing good content. There are several keeping a close eye on specific users who have

                      Unfortunately, "contributing good content" is one of the methods the shill network used to gain the credibility required to crack consensus and silence a segment of our userbase. It is not a sufficient yardstick by which to measure friends and foes on this board.

                       OK, I can agree with that but I think that it's time that PG evidence went mainstream and wasn't confined to a vault. Say for example that a video is released of Alefantis murdering a child, but it's only posted on
                       <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
                        v/Pizzagate
                       </a>
                       . Sure it will be archived here, but unless someone is looking for it they won't see it until God knows when, but at least the 100 or so people that frequent this sub will know about it. On the other hand, if the video is posted to
                       <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/QRV">
                        v/QRV
                       </a>
                       , more people see it and it gets verified as true or false more quickly because more people (1200+) are there that may have those particular skills.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       There really is no need for a PG archive being on one sub. As soon as someone plugs in certain terms in any search engine results will show regardless no matter if it's here or YouTube or Hooktube or Steemit or anywhere else. Why have it confined to just one place ? The internet is vast and we should all be for spreading PG info far and wide by posting it where it will gain the most traction in the shortest amount of time. It's sad that
                       <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
                        v/Pizzagate
                       </a>
                       isn't that place anymore.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This will be my last comment here. I can see that anything I post will just be downvoat brigaded. Any pertinent and important PG info I feel needs eyes on it immediately will be posted in
                       <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/QRV">
                        v/QRV
                       </a>
                       because I trust free agents and respect their abilities to assess if info is legit and aren't too concerned as to who is bringing the info forward because the presenter isn't as important as the material. It's a shame that
                       <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
                        v/Pizzagate

             For 20 years, the Center for Community Engagement (CCE) at Gonzaga University has paired well-trained and passionate college students together with school youth from the Spokane community. Started in 1995 with the creation of Campus Kids at Stevens and Logan Elementary, CCE's youth programs and initiatives have expanded by leaps and bounds. Today, we run 6 distinct youth programs and initiatives in 12 Spokane Public Schools, with approximately 400 Gonzaga students serving over 700 youth each year.
