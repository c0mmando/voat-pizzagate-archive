            Six emails from Dr. Federici. ‘My name is Dr. Ronald Steven Federici, Neuropsychiatrist in Washington DC area and specialist in the neuropsychiatric evaluation and treatment of post-institutionalized children. They tell me I am regarded as one of the world’s experts in the most complicated cases for children who have been institutionalized, and I lecture all over the world with many of my medical team from my international charity entitled Care for Children International Inc. I am also Director of a large group medical-psychiatric practice and Professor of Child Development.’ …….’We are actively working with one of our very close colleagues….who would be the ideal US Ambassador to Romania and would be dedicated to working with the EU in implementing the proper changes while also working with our medical team to serve as principal consultants.’
           </p>
           <p>
            (p. 86) The BBC had a programme on children. It did not take long before I realized it was a documentary about Federici’s treatment of de-institutionalized children. ‘Taming the Problem Child’ was its telling title. I watched with growing amazement. De-institutionalized appeared synonym for adopted. Apparently many children adopted from Eastern Europe showed a sort of autistic behaviour that was thought to be the result of having been raised in orphanages. Federici’s treatment meant that for at least a month, but if needed longer, the child must stay within its adoptive parents reach, for 24 hours a day. The child had to fully obey, if not the adopters needed to force it down to the floor until the child would give up its resistance. The child would not be allowed to play or meet friends. Federici claimed through process most children would have an 80% rate of improvement. His critics believed this process could be damaging…..’

            This guy gets USAID money. He works with American universities to experiment on kids, right alongside an IVF treatment facility for low income women, who regularly get their children taken after they're born, without notice.

            There are things in this world that I don't think you have the balls to fully comprehend.  You've already proven how ignorant you truly are.  How sad that you'd rather protect your fragile sensibilities.  This shit is so much bigger than you can imagine.
           </p>
           <p>
            So how about you shut the fuck up, stop wasting everyone's time and we will all get back to work.  Facing shit that pansies like you would rather deny.  Meanwhile, people suffer because shits like you cannot handle the fucking truth.

            I've given you evidence the pizza related code exists. You saying NO NO NO isn't a valid argument against my evidence, its you throwing a temper tantrum.

           <p>
            I'm working on an article about ARK (a charity) that uses abuse and isolation (trauma based mind control) as a form of behavior modification for "orphans" in eastern Europe that exhibit autistic like symptoms after years of being locked up and experimented on in Romanian orphanages.
           </p>
           <p>
            All open source, verified evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            They actually have what amounts to a baby farm in a couple hospitals, and nurses actively kidnap children of poor single mothers in Romania.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's happening kitten. The mire you try to deny it the worse it makes it for the people trying to fight against it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets assume for a second you're right, and pizzagate is bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wouldn't you rather have folks like me exposing human trafficking rings because of it, or would you criticize my efforts because they were linked to this movement?

            That's precious for you to cite the term 'echo chamber' in the same sentence with 'fact checking sites and MSM'. NYT proclaimed it 'debunked' and reported that there was never was an investigation.  It's easy to call Pizzagate a "fictitious conspiracy theory" when you never define it beyond the idea that Hillary was physically selling kids out of an everyday American neighborhood's Pizza Restaurant basement.
'being labeled as fictitious'...'will be labeled'...'possibly ridiculed'...'obviously fictitious' = ''is fictitious'  sounds like your post is a an echo chamber.

            For example, the email mentioning a "handerkerchief with a MAP THAT SEEMS PIZZA RELATED".
           </p>
           <p>
            You made no mention of that grammatical clusterfuck of a comment, you just pointed to speculation by someone that its a code for gay sex or some shit.

            THE CODE IN THE EMAIL IS THE EVIDENCE, NOT THE SPECULATION AFTERWARD!

           <p>
            The fact of the matter is a pizza related code used by pedophiles has been established.

            We have mountains of evidence linking podesta and his "people" to human trafficking, some even to ritual abuse of children.

             Everything about pizzagate is built on lies, speculation and confirmation bias, if I started to list all the things wrong with pizzagate there wouldn't be enough space here to list them all. Few examples are:
            </p>
            <p>
             -Lying about the code words made up on 4chan by replacing words in Podesta's e-mails like walnut with person of color, pasta with little boy, map with semen etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2016/12/07/pizzagate/daaa6b3b2a4ae2f0d1d1a18456d77ed4436b8ca0/images/4chan-terms.png">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             by claiming that they are known pedophile code words or that they were discovered by law authorities.
            </p>
            <p>

              http://i.imgur.com/eazSIsO.jpg
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             -Assuming that Podesta was using a handkerchief code mostly used by gay men during the late 1970's, taking that assumption as fact and then lying about the color white being a code for underage sex and photoshoping it to make it look so.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lsJgN8X.jpg">

              http://i.imgur.com/BUl1Hza.jpg
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Then adding in Kim Noble's painting(which was lied comet ping pong)
            </p>
            <p>
             And based on that making up a deranged scenario in which Podesta left a semen stained handkerchief kept as a memento after raping a baby on the kitchen counter, and the people working there knowing what's up offering to mail it back to him.
            </p>
            <p>
             -Lying about Alefantis calling a baby hotard.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yZ1UIqM.jpg">
              http://i.imgur.com/yZ1UIqM.jpg
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             -Lying about a picture with a dude wearing a shirt about L'enfant cafe bar that was named after Pierre Charles L’Enfant.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ly9xEhb.jpg">

            <p>
             etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or just plain absurd things like looking at a picture of a baby chewing on money and interpreting it in a deranged way by claiming that baby is being sold into prostitution. Every pizzagate argument is based on flawed reasoning, and easily disproved.

               Just in the interest of fair play here, the burden of proof is always on the person making the claim. That's pretty much law 101. If not, I could say "you can't prove Batman or Bigfoot or flying spaghetti monster etc. isn't real". Or "you can't prove

               NO ONE HAS PROVED THAT IT IS. THEY JUST LIED. YOU'RE USING REVERSE LOGIC. How ridiculous can you people be? Pizzagaters lied by claiming that there's known pedophile codewords found in Podesta's e-mails. That's a lie. The 4chan code is bogus. You are truly insane and are failing drastically at thinking logically. I almost pity you.

             You really shouldn't be that dumb as to believe that's a real and fear contest. Yet you are. I am offering you a 100 000 reward for proving pizzagate is true. Do it and claim your money.
