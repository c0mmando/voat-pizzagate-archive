             If they were paid off apparently they are not done milking the cow bc the gofundme page has been updated in last few days.  With all this press should get the funds rolling in again.  Ever notice how some families make a 'killing' on these things...pun intended.

            Good video.  Could very well be reverse psychology.  There may be no heroes here and we are on our own. So, now can we all get back to work?

             We can't have "heroes". Look at MLK, JFK, Aaron Swartz, Rich, countless others we didn't get to know has all been picked off. We
             <em>
              all
             </em>
             have to be heroes or we leave ourselves vulnerable to be shur down with one bullet.

             I have to push back a little on the claim that Voat is a limited hangout if your evidence is this post, and others like it. I thought about this overnight... Seth Rich is the reason we have the Podesta emails, and the reason there is pizzagate. But even more compelling, this story is a profound moment in American history, and it's happening right now. I think it's unrealistic to think that as it's happening (as opposed to say, a month from now), we would stay silent about it here. The other aspect to this is the pizzagate investigation - it isn't as if we're hot on the leads of anything even remotely related to pizzagate these days. This sub has been littered with bullshit for months. If we were researching like we did during the Pegasus time period, for example, then i would argue that Seth shouldn't occupy more than half our current posts. But that is far from the case.

              I'm working on forum software that will be devoid of malicious mods, snarky satanic advertisements and no noise. I expect to finish the basic thing to be done in a month or some. I know, a lot of time relatively, but it can't / won't go faster unless I'd start up a crowd funding project in order to work on it and maintain it full-time. I have a mortgage to pay for and more and I don't really want to go the financial support route to avoid any sort of wrong explanation for my endeavor.
             </p>
             <p>
              But yes, software wise the forum will be designed specifically for constructing "truth" using a technique of factual data mapping and association using "organics" (people like you and me) to build truth together. It'll also serve as a database for researchers / journalists / LEO to peruse for factuals and motifs in an organized fashion.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sick of totally complicit VOAT moderators as much as the next  citizen investigator.

             It's actually the only way to explain their behaviour in that interview. But then I have to believe that there are still 'good guys' working in intel and in DC, and that's REALLY hard for me to believe at this point...

              I know what you mean. Here in the Netherlands, things are pretty much down the drain. It's sick when one is terrorized by one's own secret service (AIVD) for hunting for truth on the takedown of MH17, which ties in to the globalist sectarian criminal syndicate as much. I can open books on this and between now and sometime soon I am going to file a death-threat (by one of this organization's members) report with our LEOs so things at least get documented from MY side during the systemic surveillance on me that's been going since '98. When you are told explicitly "You [targeted at me at my desk] DO realize a cat has 9 lives, right?" (yes I am a cat person) that is nothing short of a death threat that tells "comply, we still have use for you" (I can turn time in a lot of money as a software engineer).

              I shall not be controlled. Je maintendrai. (sub-title under the 'weapon' of the Dutch Lion (kingdom emblem). (P.S. yes, killswitches do exist. Fuck them, I'm still alive. It's due to my very adequate dealing with the situation (ambulance in minutes) that they had to abort.
             </p>

              They in fact had to use this exotic method of neutralization because over time I changed my life gradually to yield a near 100% signal-to-noise ration when it comes to my life. If I am killed, people here will absolutely know it's murder for the aforementioned reason (MH17, other research), rather than some vague accident like getting randomly beat up and killed under guise of robbery what so ever. I have no standing enemies  in my local physical environment. Only those that through surveillance know "more", while trying to protect NWO and pedophilic high-ranking politicians here would be my enemy. So if something happens to me, people will know it's the 5th column seated in our government/corporate everywhere. That's why I am still alive so far, with one failed covert attempt at using a biologically based kill switch.

               I'm so sorry to hear this is happening to you. Believe it or not, i have also been targeted for my activism, in my case it was for research and a blog I had about chemtrails. This was a while ago, and now people are allowed to talk about it, officials are even admitting to the program's existence lately.
              </p>
              <p>
               I won't give details as i don't want to be targeted again. The way i saved myself was i took their 'advice' and quit talking about it online for many years, erasing my blog.
              </p>
              <p>
               To put it simply, i was given 3 'warnings', with visits to my home, 2 of them with very large military helicopters. The other visit was actually even more terrifying, and i still have PTSD from it.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's shocking to see how uncommon it is for our governments to come after regular citizens who are simply wanting to talk about the truth!
