            Think about Chicago,  10 million people,  disappearing people would be very easy,  and you have a complicit media to go along with it,

            It is. I realize people give tons of flak for the G. Webb series but he is filming in Chicago right now. Has documented evidence from whistleblowers that heroin trafficking, organ harvesting, &amp; child sex trafficking are linked and occurring in Chicago and at Homan Square.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just in case people do not know Rahm Emanuel was Barack Obamas chief of staff until 2011 when he returned to Chicago. Emanuel was Bill Clinton's chief of staff before. He is a long time political operative. He has a "personal relationship" with Obama before he ever ran for office. You can research that but bathhouse is a good search term.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rahm' S brother Ari Emanuel authored Obamacare which has failed. One brother is also a big Hollywood talent operative linked to known pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the McDonald shooting Rahm held the tape back then gave the family a large sum of money the day of his reelection. Once re-elected he finally released some info.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been over 4000 murders in Chicago since Barack Obama took office. This is the hometown of Obama, Valerie Jarret, HRC, Emanuel &amp; others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama said nothing. Except blamed officers who are literally in a war zone. More killing in the inner cities between gangs &amp; drug dealers than died in combat overseas. Think about that!
           </p>
           <p>
            And now it is breaking their was organ harvesting, sex trafficking. What is the real motive for not stopping the violence?
           </p>
           <p>
            Could it be the bodies of those who died in gun battles are worth more dead than alive. Or that capturing suspects and taking them to black sites &amp; having them disappear became profitable for organ harvesting?
