<p>PETER STRZOK THE ONE IN THE NEWS
Is in his 40\'s, works for the FBI, and was the only person to interview HRC with no recording.</p>
<p>THE FAMILY TREE</p>
<p>PETER STRZOK, SR.
Peter\'s (the one in the news) father who was in the Army Corps of Engineers.  He was a career expert in sanctions nuclear activity in Iran.</p>
<p>MELISSA HODGMAN
Wife of Peter Strzok (uses her maiden name) was promoted to the role as a director in the SEC at the same time the FBI was drafting the exoneration letter for HRC\'s emails.</p>
<p>JAMES STRZOK
Brother of Peter Strzok, Sr.  He is a Jesuit priest working in Kenya and also has a solid military career with deep knowledge in energy and resources.</p>
<p>MARK STRZOK
Peter Sr.\'s younger brother who works for Mammomet, a world leader in big cranes with a specialty in moving nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>DEVIN STRZOK
Mark Strzok\'s son who is a Coast Guard graduate and lives in DC.</p>
<p>MARIANNA STRZOK nee CARTWRIGHT
Mark Strzok\'s wife and Devin\'s mother.</p>
<p>GENERAL JAMES CARTWRIGHT
whose daughter is Marianna Strzok and the grandfather of Devon Strzok.  General Cartwright was pardoned by Barak Obama on his last day of office. Once known as &quot;Obama\'s favorite general,&quot; he pleaded guilty to the felony charge of lying to the FBI during its investigation into the leaking of classified information about covert operations against Iran to two journalists.</p>

<p>Go back to March 12, 2015.  Devin Strzok, Katherine Ustler, and Eugene D. Mok are scheduled for a &quot;West Wing Tour&quot; that was requested on March 6, 2015.  Their &quot;tour&quot; started at 9:45 pm and ended at 11:59 pm. </p>
<p>Not much info on Katherine Ustler other than her being a Lieutenant in the Coast Guard.  I am uncertain if she is/was married to Devin Strzok.</p>
<p>Eugene Mok\'s history is kind of vague but he was once a 2nd year law student and was part of the US Navy for 6 years.  He &quot;left active duty to pursue a legal career dealing with national security&quot;; worked in the intelligence community; interned with the Chief of Naval Operations Special Counsel; and interned with the DOJ National Security Division.</p>

<p>Peter Strzok was THE person who requested the server containing HRC\'s email backups and the last person to see it on 10/15/16.</p>
<p>A tweet from 12/24/17 from Truth in Government reads:</p>
<p>&quot;Remember the Datto server node with Hillary\'s emails?  A panicked FBI grabbed the Datto cloud on 10/06/15 after a Grassley letter to Datto 10/05. After it was checked in as evidence it was never mentioned again.&quot;</p>
