            Matt Lauer is a known high ranking devil worshipper for decades now...
This guy is the biggest creep, this comes as no surprise. I would be wondering if it will ever come out about the underage girls he raped and the child sacrifices he took part in.

            Ok, I'm sorry, but I can't fathom this. She didn't scream, she didn't fight, she didn't kick him in the gonads???
           </p>
           <p>
            When he said "unbutton your blouse" she could have said, "hell, no!" He could not have bent her over a chair unless she submitted to that. I have no doubt Lauer is a disgusting pig and guilty as sin, but the detail in this story is just beyond my ability to believe. If he man-handled her, I can understand that, but this sounds like she just did what he said to do without protesting. Doesn't that imply consent?

            I'm most excited for the news in 5 yeas, when all these people being outed will be in People and whatever else celeb rag being shown as homeless bums sitting outside starbucks begging for change.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope they are all prepared for their drastic lifestyle change.

            Enough with these "Resigning" and "Firing" pseudo-consequences! This is criminal behaviour right here and if this dude really did this, he should be in jail.

            These storys have something in common. They are all highly theatrical and the defendant either admits to it right away or is not qouted or questioned at all. What is the chance these are Humiliation Rituals where they throw some of their members under the buss to protect the main opperations? The button under the desk locking the door was slightly stupid. The generic details of here complying and waking up after being sexed unconsious are hard to picture. Same as Louis CK just randomly jumping on a table in front of 10 women and jerking off, then admitting to it right away as if he had no concern about the consequences. And then there is the fact that every couple of days the MSM exposes one  of the cabals assets instead of an info blackout and coverup. Not buying this shit at all.

             Yep, that's what I thought too. Some scenario like: well, we need to give the appearance of sacrifice, so we'll just destroy a handful in the media and pay them a stipend to move overseas and maybe some plastic surgery like the witness protection programs were suspected of doing. I think these people just got the early retirement program and "took one for the team".

             Yep, these have definitely all been pretty strange in one way or another. The fact that they’re not covering these up in the MSM is really odd in my opinion.

             It’s definitely happening with a quick pace too. I’m sure there will be another that goes down fast in a few days.

            She shouldn't blame herself. It's the deer in the headlight syndrome. She's at work, a place she feel safe and this happens. Usually people don't respond as if they're in a street fight because it's not a street. It's its own domain replete with hierarchy. Then there's the fact that these predators have already done the homework of seeing who is more compliant in terms of putting up an aggressive fight. They do these little things to test them before gauging how far they can go.

             Even if she wasn't a virgin the force of the rape would cause bleeding and extreme pain. Even without a knock out drug put under her nose or forced into her mouth, she could easily have fainted from the physical trauma to her body.  As such it would take a few days for her to think clearly and to weigh her alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even with medical records it then may be too late to go to the police. Or she will have to explain why she didn't go earlier. Plus her entire life's sexual history must be revealed. It will be brought up in every single court hearing. Did she wear pants that were too tight that day? Those of the types of questions she will consistently be asked.
            </p>
            <p>
             Therefore the vast majority of victims choose to try and bury the info and to somehow attempt to forget about it. That's how the vast majority of victims have been raised.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kind of the assistant to take the women to a doctor. I'm sure NBC didn't want an ambulance on the property. Maybe she wasn't in a financial position to quit her job. Try explaining the reasons to future bosses of why you left such a seemingly plum job.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those who say they'd leave after what they're witnessing don't understand being in a stuck position. While never sexually assaulted at work environments, I've had worse issues every single time of having my car, property, and life repeatedly threatened. Why? I work very hard and harassers do not want to work at all. Not ONE supervisor, especially NOT if they were female, ever did anything but blame me for complaining. I've had far worse harassment at every single apartment complex in which I've rented. Call the police? Useless and then the harassment will escalate to violence against your property.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes I know countless, countless women in all of the above situations and far, far, far, worse. If you have few alternatives and are not wealthy, and don't know or can't afford a lawyer, then you are trapped. That is reality.

              Especially re getting a lawyer... in Hollywood, every lawyer would decline to take the case and conspire to tell the woman she is nuts. Word would get back to her work REAL fast... then retaliation.

             Or in pain. Speaking crudely as a female if you don't want sex and someone forces themselves it tenses very tightly. I imagine she was probably in a state of shock too. Frozen in fear.

             SAG-AFTRA is the union that covers broadcasters as well as actors. They just announced in a mass email, "See something, say something." In reality the EEOC Dept that would handle sexual abuse cases has always been overwhelmed and there's long been a huge back log. Even after completing the paperwork, providing witnesses willing to take off work to testify, corroborating evidence, the MOST the union will ever do is suggest counseling and a small fine. What a joke.

             So both women lose their careers as NBC, ABC, &amp; CBS has had far, far worse complaints about employees and has done absolutely nothing. They also have the legal clout to destroy the lives of anyone who dares to speak up at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you really trust the NYPD considering who you're accusing and their ability to sue you if you make the smallest mistake? I sure wouldn't.
            </p>

             For example, a very famous TV co-host had a habit of aggressively molesting all child, teen, and young adult male celebs guesting on his talk show. Saying "no" only made him act more dominant. It took forever and years and years and years of complaints before this ancient creep was encouraged to retire. That's really only because it was way too evident he was sinking the television show's ratings. Not worth his over inflated huge salary. The network knew they needed an energetic, ethnic co-host/hero image to appeal to national TV's changing demographics. The old pervert wouldn't have gone along with the change.

              The official way for Hollywood to take of these things... is much like the mob. They didn't let victims speak out, killing them is not beyond their will. There is a specific example in Hollywood doing these things... and more... I can't write about it right now, but hopefully soon.

             Some traumas are so unbearable and unthinkable that the mind responds this way as a defense. Imagine abuse survivors with suppressed/repressed memories. Those flight or flight responses are certainly plausible. The part that I don’t understand is how she continued working there for a year without reporting...? Maybe she was advised by a lawyer or law enforcement in hopes of gathering evidence or support? I’m trying to wrap my head around that...

              I stayed friends with someone who forced themselves upon me as we were dating at the time and I was so young. It was only as I got older I began to understand the severity of what had happened as it affecting intimate partners after him. I was then quick to cut contact.

              Some people really do freeze up and go into denial.  Unfortunately I suffer from this type of emotional reaction.  The idea of something being so horrible causes me fight or flight.  Flight usually takes the form of holing up for awhile and denying something due to a perceived inability to deal with it  (lack of coherent plans or fear that it will adversely affect my life in more ways.)
              <br/>
              This is a result of being sexually molested as a child.  When one considers the stats of people who've been sexually molested it's not surprising that their reaction and coping skills are terrible.

               I recently spoke in depth about this with a victim of childhood molestation. She would freeze when men would begin to assault her so she was repeatedly raped by sickos who took advantage of this response.

               yup, the trauma reaction is usually referred to now as "fight, flight or freeze," instead of just "fight or flight", which I think is much more accurate.  thanks for sharing your story
