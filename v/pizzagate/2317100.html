            Why do people follow and listen to these Rappers?  They are just as caught up in this garbage of Pedowood Sins and MK Controlled as their Movie Idol Sis and Bros.  I never heard of Stevie and am glad I don't listen to K-Rap Music.  That's what we call it.

             I really don't know. I watched the show out of morbid curiosity and I've literally never heard of any of them (in the uk) there are some really shady characters on it. Everyone's on drugs or an alcoholic. Perfect breeding ground for them

              Another vehicle to rope in our children.  This crazy Rap Trap.  Atlanta is a Huge Pedo Sex Trafficking Hub and this jerk is able to put out his poison so that kids can follow him like the Pied Piper.  Probably backed by Area Pedos.

             Thats it. I saw it at the time but didn't put two and two together. Absolutely sick. That Mimi the mother is an absolute waste of space. She tries to act as if she is a shining beacon of morality but she ends up being a walking joke. Sex tapes, threesomes with joseline and stevie after she said she hated her, and now she is a lesbian.
