            Might be cool to put so cheap IR cameras in the tunnels and watch for activity. Pretty dangerous though considering what's been happening when folks get too curious, but if there's any ex-military of techno nerds up to it just park one near pegasus for a while. Time to go all "Marlon-Perkins of Mutual of Omaha" LOL, I'm showing my age kids will have to google it...
edit - what about tracking alefantis &amp; friends via their cell phones? Are there any hackers who can track the GPS in their phones? Seems safer than cameras but would be fun to catch these guys red handed.

            Before diving into the address list one by one, I have to point out that just because alefantis hasn't been proven to own the properties does NOT mean he has nothing to do with them. 
A safe house is not safe if everyone knows you are there, likewise a drug house, illegal brothel, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the context of criminality and conspiracy, you would fully expect him to have little or no provable link to the properties. Here we have something in between. Some connection, some suspicion....
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that there is some documented connection suggests to me that these may not necessarily be the sites of greatest interest. Then again they may have been used criminally then abandoned to avoid attracting suspicion.
           </p>

            It would be interesting to analyze the likelihood of proximity to tunnels in D.C. since there are so many.
Are 1/20 properties in D.C. Near a tunnel? 1/10? 1/100?  If 1/100, it might be odd for one person to always have addresses near them. But what about other factors? Tunnels often run under parks or other open spaces, for example. Liking to live near a park is normal, so a person who likes to walk dogs or do yoga in parks might gravitate to areas with parks (and tunnels under them).
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm gong to see what I can find on the addresses...

            Your post is beautiful and historically interesting, but most of the references for the addresses you share ain't worth much. Radaris, for example, is not a viable source of information. You are not using the proper ressource to find the actual owner of the properties you put out. Use the following public web site (like I did a while back to verify the claims of Yoichi Shimatsu) and you'll see there is no correspondence between what the private web sites tell (might be a collection of all the adresses Alefantis ever lived at, liked someone suggested was the case for him in a Radaris review) and the official names of the proprietors.

              First off, Remember The D.C tax site is run by the fucking governement.... Ya know, the same government we're researching for corruption of the highest order... and ya know, In the city that has the most corrupt people per capita.

               side note:WHAT THE FUCK VOAT SPELL CHECK! You tell me I spelled per capita wrong, and because I can't spell, I believe you... But then your only suggestion is DECAPITATOR! Then I have to fucking google percapita so my comment isn't dismissed because of my inability to spell... Only to find out I DID spell it correctly. Then I have to spend  ANOTHER 30 seconds bitching about the fucking spell check. Get your shit together voat spellcheck. Some how I still think I'm the one who spelled it wrong, because of the stupid squiggly under it.

             <p>
              That being said, I use the D.C tax site hundreds of times a day, and often times the names listed are of extreme relevance. Other times The names are fake either fake, Or they are names that can't be found anywhere on internet, other than the site that provided the names in the first place. Also, The amount of dead people that are still listed as owners, is VERY telling.
