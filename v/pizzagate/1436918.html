            You must go into view Original PDF to see this which is why it might have been overlooked by many people.

            When Hillary Clinton first started as Secretary of State she asked Colin Powell question relating to blackberry use.  Some of his writings include
"...could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the state department servers. I even used to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the department on their personal email accounts."
Also 
"however there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the President's BB rules this morning, it sounds like it won't be as useful as it used to be. Be very careful. I got around it by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data."
           </p>

            Everyone really must read this because he goes into detail about avoiding them from following him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would you not want what you do it be part of the record if you were doing things on the up and up?  It certainly seems like it fits the part of what FBIAnon says about state department officials to meet with foreign officials.
