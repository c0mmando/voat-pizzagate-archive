<p>The death of a pioneer in black arts lobbying has Washington operatives pointing fingers and lawyering up.</p>
<p>On Thursday, July 9, 2015, Evan Morris, a super lobbyist with the biotech firm Genentech ...shot himself in the head.  
</p>
<p>Washington, at least publicly, has respected the family’s privacy: Despite the fact that Morris, who was just 38, was one of the top lobbyists in the city ― he was the head of all government affairs at Genentech ― his death, until Monday, had not been mentioned beyond the blurb in the K Street newsletter and a one-line obituary on the website of the Jefferson Funeral Chapel that reads: “Resided in Alexandria, VA.” His life has largely been scraped from the internet and social media. </p>
<p>Genentech, for its part, continued to dig after Morris died. Prior to his death, the drug company had been probing what it identified as spending irregularities coming out of the Washington office Morris ran, according to people briefed by the firm on the investigation. Morris learned of the probe the week he died; that probe continued after his death, focusing on consulting firms that Morris directed money toward, the sources said. The company had noticed an unusually high amount of spending on Washington consultants, the sources said, and had questions about whether Morris was taking illicit payments in exchange for doling out contracts, or whether he himself was in control of some of the accounts where money was going. </p>

             There is proof that art is being used for money laundering.  Many pieces are being sold for insane prices.  Here is one I just heard that happened over the weekend.  P Diddy has been rumored to have been the one that abused Usher and Usher now allegedly abusing Bieber.    They are all involved.

            Obama Expected to Lift Restrictions on Embryonic Stem Cell Research

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             President-elect Barack Obama is expected to lift restrictions on federal money for such research. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also has expressed interest in going ahead with legislation in the first 100 days of the new Congress if it still is necessary to set up a regulatory framework.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              John Podesta
             </strong>
             , head of Obama's transition team, strongly hinted that the president-elect would deal with stem cell research soon after taking office Jan. 20. "As you know, he has said something specific about stem cell research, so I think you can expect that what he said in the campaign will be fulfilled once in office," Podesta said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Samuel Pfaff, a professor at the
             <strong>
              Salk Institute
             </strong>
             for Biologic Studies, said he also supports greater embryonic stem cell research to understand what makes them so special that scientists can endow other cells with similar properties.

            <p>
             The Bertarelli Foundation provides global leadership in promoting marine conservation and science. The trustees believe that if mankind is to use the ocean as a source of food and recreation, then it is also mankind’s responsibility to ensure that the future of the ocean is safeguarded.
            </p>
            <p>
             The United Nations Preparatory Committee process, which follows from the Agreement on Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, provides an opportunity to protect huge swathes of the ocean in a part of the world which is currently regarded as essentially lawless.  Many experts believe that if international targets for ocean protection are to be met, the creation of international MPAs is an essential step which will help preserve biodiversity on the high seas for many generations.

             Ted Waitt is the founder and chairman of the Waitt Foundation.  At 22, he co-founded Gateway 2000, Inc., where he helped pioneer the direct marketing of personal computers.  Labeled a maverick by national business publications, he became a Fortune 500 CEO and member of the Forbes 400 by the time he was 30.  Since his retirement from Gateway, Inc. in 2004, he has gone on to form multiple enterprises:  Avalon Capital Group, Inc., The Waitt Foundation, The Waitt Institute for Violence Prevention, and The Waitt Institute.

             Mr. Waitt believes that the depletion of ocean resources is one of the biggest challenges of our generation.

            <p>
             The Waitt Institute is committed to helping small coastal communities develop and implement comprehensive, science-based, community-driven solutions for sustainable ocean management.  The Institute is currently engaged with the governments of Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Curaçao, Montserrat, and Tonga.  Among numerous other ocean conservation endeavors, Mr. Waitt is a founding board member of Oceans 5, a highly successful collaboration of ocean funders working together to protect the oceans.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               **"Lobbyist Anthony “Tony” Podesta filed his final papers with the Department of Justice earlier this month chronicling the last work performed by the once-powerful lobbying firm that bore his name but which is now defunct following its entanglement in special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging Russia investigation.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The Podesta Group’s 28-page closing foreign-agent registration filing - made three months late due to a "computer error,” a spokesman said – marks the firm’s termination of work for foreign clients including Iraq, Moldova, Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia, and suggests an end to Podesta’s 31-year run at the intersection of politics and influence in Washington."**
