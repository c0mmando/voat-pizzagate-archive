            What no  baby for the oven? I am shocked.  I  bought a retro used Skipper sister for my friends grand daughter last Christmas.  She loved it.  I never buy the new stuff.   There are places like Etsy that have redone dolls that are beautiful redone hair and nice clothes, not cheezy slutty Barnie clothes.  I have redone a few myself.  Kids love them.

            I think these YouTube "cartoons" are not simply about pizzagate indoctrination-- which would be bad enough-- I think they are far darker, and represent many, many threats to our future survival as humans in human form. "Elsagate" may be the latest incarnation of a previous program developed and run by the CIA with a similar name-- ELISA, which was an offshoot of their MKULTRA program.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Robert Duncan's book "The Matrix Deciphered":
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ELISA was an artificial intelligence computer program that the Stanford Research Institute demonstrated back in the 70's. It acted like a psychologist and asked stupid questions and responded to answers, parsing, and understanding sentences. This field is called natural language processing... Fast forward 35 years and instead of parsing natural language phrases from keystrokes, ELISA recognizes phonetic brainwaves and parses them into words and sentences for artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing. Now the tortures and menticizations can scale to entire populations through this automation...
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Neuro-linguistic programming (different but related to natural language processing) was developed by the US Army and can be used to actually kill people. As explained by MKULTRA survivor Elisa E. in book 2 of "Our Life Beyond MKULTRA," the ELISA program (which unfortunately shares her name) is "psychic driving software, an automated computer form of a real human being speaking... (It's) a continuously repeated audio message on a looped tape to alter behavior. Invented through torture by CIA 'spychiatrist' Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron as part of MKULTRA."
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, she writes, "...the psychic driving for (total mind control) programming is no longer necessary in person. Remote processing suffices, once a person's brainwave frequencies can be sufficiently tracked by AI. There will always be high-level slaves designed by multi-agency organizations, but now the average citizen is also a potential victim."
           </p>
           <p>
            And what better victims than young children whose minds are much more easily manipulated and formed like clay? After all, the malevolent forces prefer their victims to be as young as possible. These YouTube cartoons may be not only attempting to normalize pedophilia in the minds of young victims (and their apathetic parents), but also enslave the future generation for absolute control and further accelerate the human race's transition to transhumanism. And all done remotely thanks to the Internet, YouTube, and the
            <s>
             willingness
            </s>
            gratefulness of parents who allow this tech to babysit their children.

            WTF is up with the comment section? None of it makes sense like they are talking in code or something. Just putting random letters and emoji together. And then at the end of one comment thread in response to what appears to be nonsense, someone writes "County Indiana lawyer information offered by the way﻿" what the actual fuck is going on here??

             I'm following through on some of those accounts.  I believe that many are fronts for pedophiles and child traffickers.  Look at the logo on this video for example:

            People are walking around in a trance.  I believe some are in a kind of  coma or are just plain stupid.  Yes, this would be a perfect red pill moment if you ca get them  to sit still long enough.

             What is the big deal with Skipper?  Is this a version of Skippy?  What significance dos that have.  I just find really strange.  I think Skippy for Skipper might be some kind of code or have a special meaning. Is it some kind of sexual term?

            This particular video is not related to those elsa/spiderman and other videos with sick themes, sez and adult actors, but all of you should look into it too. This is just too close to pizzagate.

             Get the fuck out of here. The fact YOU are discrediting elsagate confirms its true. If every parent would youtube "elsa" and look what it INSTANTLY feeds you, youtube would be fucked.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe this is Elites way to test us "How Much Fuck We Give", and they are laughing their asses of right now. Beware youtube kids videos to become more out of there aggressive in next weeks. Ten seconds of that gore shit WILL impact your kids brains. Its so sickening and spreading so fast.

            I was just youtubeing "elsa" and looked for new videos with most views.. sayd "hm" with sceptic twist when saw first video being about pizza.. the first minute will blow your minds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Im afraid for my small children. I can delete youtube from my devices, but its impossible to cover them all the time. Youtube elsa, and look those videos with spiderman in it, and continue clicking.. its a fucking nightmare and makes me really fucking angry. 
The most fucked up part is that other parents seems to turn the other cheeck highly because they just dont give a fuck, and cant believe youtube has shit like this stuffed down our kids throats. Sit those fuckers in front of youtube and spend a minute of that assholes time. The face will be worth it. Easy redpill.
