            You saw the Godfather.  It was all there, including the blackmailing of the Senator(?) after he had killed a prostitute in the hotel room.  The horse's head in the bed - just to make sure the message was received and acted upon.  It started little - solving people's problems and scaled up from there.  And went bad.  How governments began.

            figures the Podesta's have that Greek mother.  Queen Elizabeth married the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh">
             King of Greece
            </a>
            just five years before her father mysteriously died  So Queen Elizabeth marries into The Greek Royal Family in 1948 and they take over the world in 1953,
           </p>
           <p>
            this just gets weirder, Queen Victoria's second son was elected King of Greece in 1862, but the election result was rejected, and instead another British royal, the youngest brother of The Princess of Wales, was installed as King.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_royal_family">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_royal_family
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Elizabeth has been kicking and screaming to create a global Greek culture ever since she married into the Greek Royal Family . Hence their pushing so hard for Greek style homosexuality, pederasty etc.

            Starting in 1994, Russian and Chinese military units began to purchase U.S. made super-computers for nuclear weapons research....In 1995, Tony Podesta, a powerful D.C. based lobbyist and brother of John Podesta - the White House advisor, had a consortium of top U.S. computer CEOs attend secret meetings inside the White House. The meetings were on computer hardware and software exports to China and Russia. The meetings occurred just before Clinton changed super-computer policy. Within weeks, the Russian and Chinese were buying computer power that now surpasses the U.S. Defense Dept.

            In 1995, the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP) - according to documents from the Commerce Dept. - was represented by Tony Podesta, brother of White House official John Podesta. The CSPP is a group of computer companies, that in 1995 included Apple, AT&amp;T, Compaq, Cray, Data General, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Silicon Graphics, Stratus Computer, Sun Microsystems, Tandem and Unisys. Officials working for Apple, and Silicon Graphics are documented by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to be very large Clinton donors.

            Judicial Watch 7/3/00 "……Today The Washington Post ran a "fluff piece" on John Podesta's tenure in the Clinton-Gore White House. The profile, written by John Babington, ranks Mr. Podesta as perhaps the finest chief of staff during the Clinton-Gore tenure -- however, this depends on how you define "finest."…….First, for instance, according to Ms. Nolanda Hill (long-time confidante of former Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown), Mr. Podesta, along with Mr. Leon Panetta (former White House Chief of Staff) instructed Brown to obstruct and violate court orders to produce documents issued by Judge Royce C. Lamberth in the lawsuit which uncovered John Huang and sparked the Chinagate scandal…………Second, documents produced during the burgeoning e-mail scandal show that Mr. Podesta was advised of the "e-mail problem" over two years ago, but consistent with his behavior in Judicial Watch's Chinagate case, he likely obstructed justice yet again and kept the e-mail hidden from investigators………Third, according to testimony in Judicial Watch's $90-million class action Filegate lawsuit, and other sources, Mr. Podesta ran and participated in the scandal operations in the Clinton-Gore White House -- namely the use of taxpayer monies to coverup Clinton-Gore scandals……..Judicial Watch is pursuing justice for Mr. Podesta in a number of its lawsuits, and indeed, the story of his tenure will be different by the time the public interest law firm is finished. ….."

            "From Judicial Watch, Panetta and, Clinton's fourth White House Chief of Staff, John Podesta were involved in the planning and implementation of the illegal taxpayer financed foreign trade missions used for DNC fundraising. There is also strong evidence that in the spring of 1995, Panetta and then-Deputy White House Chief of Staff, John Podesta were involved in the obstruction of justice in regard to an investigation into then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's 'allegedly' illegal taxpayer financed trade missions. The Panetta/Podesta team's involvement with Brown in this matter would put them in close contact with Brown's lawyer, Reid Weingarten. Curiously, Mr. Weingarten is/was also the lawyer for the illegal fundraisers Charlie Trie and Pauline Kanchanalak - and other Clinton embarrassments."

            I bet he was bullied big time in elementary and highschool.  Not that that has anything to do with pizzagate but he is one weird looking guy and the lisp and fangs.  Maybe being bullied contributed to his hunger for power as an adult

            THIS gets 65 upvoats but threads written by a black panther with YEARS of research into these cults and some half rate idea, poorly sourced, gets 65 upvoats to 18.

              Yep... cointelpro infiltration. I've had a very serious thread up for more than an hour and zero upvoats, when the subject matter of the thread is dead on truth. Strange days at voat, I even had a contributor call me a pedo because I disagreed that his thread had nothing to directly relate to pizzagate and it stayed on the main page, with a ton of upvoats, crazy, it's like the serious research community that it might have been descended into a day school class of observers.

            Well, I have thought about that once or twice.  I have noticed that we don't really talk that much about Tony, I wonder if that's for a reason or just because we are actively focusing on John in a decent amount of threads.

            Great digging for the proof. Of course Tony is the big man. John is the little stuttering pawn. Psych 101 could have told anyone that.

            that's funny because i spent all the day to do research on tony because when i woke up i thought exactly the same thing...that maybe we should look at him more...and i found that about the collection of videos TP

            Basically John is tonys appendage. 
I can see that. Tony is obviously a sadistic pedophile. Just look at those teddy bears in that photo of his artsy fartsy bedroom.like a sore thumb. He probably seduces and rapes young children in that room.

            WHAT about BRIAN PODESTA?     John and Tonys BROTHER?
This is a really great investigation which seems to be a BIG part of the picture:
Thanks to Echo Truths, for all her hard investigative work:

             i'm doing research on the family of the podesta and in a article tony had alleged that his mother had adopted 25 children but that seems very bizrre because of that:

             !!!
so or she never adopted anyone or they are all disappeared

                One of my favorite versions of this is that it's going on for a veeeeeery long time. Something along the lines of splintering into multiple personalities on purpose that can be called up. So... it's suggested that with this form of MPD, one of their alters can be sleeping while the surface personality does its work. Then, when the surface persona becomes tired... they trigger and switch. Something like that.

Don Podesta (Brian's father) and his wife Jane Sims Podesta work for the WaPO, which is where John just announced he will start working. HoneyBee originally reported. Echo is part of the team they are putting together. Here is Honeybees vid.

                From the digging I've done they play it pretty close to the chest. It is quite difficult to find connection outside of immediate family (father, mother, sibling) maybe if you pay to look you'd find different info, but what is public is quite closed source so to speak. It wasn't easy to find a direct connection from Brian to John. Anything is possible, but the probability of it I can't say.

             meaningless platitudes, we know how high it goes - the Rothschilds, and Israel
            </p>
            <p>
             CIA are PMCs for Rothschilds, which means human and drug trafficking, toppling govts to install Rothschild controlled central banks, money laundering. Rothschilds get high off their own supply.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jews love human trafficking, they have controlled the global slave trade since its inception. Israel is the human trafficking and organ harvesting capital of the world.
             <a href="http://davidduke.com/jewish-involvement-transatlantic-stave-trade-canard/">
              Jews had full control of the african slave trade to the united states
             </a>
             , as well as the european slave trade to the arab states which continues today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even before the international slave trade routes were set up, jews would kidnap european children,

              kosher slaughter them by draining their blood into a pan
             </a>
             , and use that blood in matzoh for passover. These are the same people we dealt with in the 1200s, they never stopped.

             <p>
              99% of the god damn world is totally oblivious and idiots like you with your 'JEW' rhetoric prevent the dismantling of the empire, regardless of whom is behind it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stop being an ass and falling into the trap. Blaming all Jews is a NON STARTER because it immediately turns people away who might otherwise open their minds and become aware.

               This comment makes no sense. Blaming Jews 'turns people away'? Hang on, it's called telling the truth. If it turns people away, so be it. Certainly, Pizzagate turns people away, so do you advocate not talking about it? If so, why are you even here?

                He should call them reptiles like David Icke does. Just make up a name. Its weird that saying Jew is a taboo anyway. "That's an Italian!"  Cool! "There goes a Jew!" HOW DARE YOU! Huh?

                The problem is Jewish supremacism. Judaism is a supremacist ideology with the Jewish worldview based entirely on the distinction between Jews (good) and gentiles (bad). A Jew remains a supremacist regardless or not of whether s/he supports Zionism. Non-Zionist Jews still seek to advance the collective interests of Jews against nonJews, wherever they are, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Estonia, Sweden, everywhere. This would not change even if Zionism vanished from the earth tomorrow.

                         It's like you're going down a prescribed playbook item by item. Okay, so armchair psychologist didn't work, neither did yelling conspiracy, so now you have to accuse the other guy of being a shill, and tell him he doesn't meet your arbitrary standard of internet points.

                            Easy lads!! We're all on same team!! Both make very good points. It is important for people to realize the depth of the issue but it's also important to take care with perception of message.

                            Although majority of "illuminati" might happen to be Jewish, not all Jews are shadow elitists!!! Bunching them together like that is an easy target for people that don't want to research things themselves.

                              I actually defended this guy on Twitter from Jew slander immediately after roasting him for going after PewDiePie lol. There are so many human negatives littered within all corners of the arguments that getting the narrative to move forward is often more about navigating past these road blocks. Or so it seems

                             They think I don't have supporters on this sub. We need to root these shills out and expose them for what they are. This will be the next move by the Cabal. They are a step or two away from saying Trump hates the Jews and it's this hatred driving Pizzagate.  Clear as a cloudless day.

            She also enjoys the same "art" that Tony does. Tony described the first time he had her over the house "and for some reason I had pictures of headless women", and when they spoke again later she made some cute joke about her not being headless or something. They went on to jointly collect all the horrifying art they proudly displayed in their home. Unless she was plotting her rise to power from an early stage, and suffered Tony's presence and taste in art, she enjoys the same shit he does.

             Unless? Of course she was plotting. Otherwise she would go for a kind handsome middle class guy, not creepy rich and perverted if not 100% pedophile ( &amp; likely bi or gay) Tony. If Tony isn't a pedo he is trying hard to look like one!

            I think they work in tandem with John wielding the influence and Tony selling it. But yeah Tony's always been the dominant one. Just look at the Camp Nose photos.

            I always wondered about Tony's ties. In ANY photograph of ANY occasion they invariably stand out as ostentatiously cheap, tacky, tasteless and out of place. And this is the guy that dominates the DC modern art market?
