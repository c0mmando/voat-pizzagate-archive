            To start, I am definitely not saying you're on a wrong line of thought. The idea of people being taken from parks for trafficking does have basis (many cases proving/hinting it has happened). Plus the map does give a good idea of what parks people go missing in.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just wanted to point out that the Missing 411 Cluster Map that you've linked covers cases with a very specific MO, including absolutely no scent trails, no suspects, very strange and unusual cases, and many of those marks have been found dead. The markers on that map range from children to the elderly, missing or found dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            Definitely dive deeper, I just wanted to put it out there that this map has a very specific purpose and each mark is a specific, individual case. Paulides, former detective, has put a lot of work into his research. He has also looked into Urban disappearances with very strange circumstances. You should check out his series of books, they're fantastic.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing to note about his cases is that each national park has a federally trained agent, yet they claim they do not keep lists of missing persons in their parks. Which makes no sense. Especially when these parks keep lists of movies made there, art pieces made there, famous people who have visited, etc. Why would you not keep track of something as important as people missing in a park? Some theorize bad publicity which would result in lack of tourism. Others believe the lists are kept secret because &lt;insert theory here&gt;.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your average National Park ranger doesn't have much knowledge on this. With the structure of the park system, normal rangers are shuffled all the time. It's the senior officials of the parks that would have access to this information. And they have denied Paulides FOIA requests numerous times, he even had a special agent contact him about one in specific, telling him he would NEVER get that case file.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Fun side note. I am listening to his interview on Coast to Coast AM right now and it slipped my mind that "Devil" appears in the name of a lot of locations where people go missing. Usually teens and adults, but some children. Considering the satanic aspect of Pizzagate, couldn't resist adding this tidbit on.

             Wild, driving up to Maine and listening to coast to coast also.

             I've been asking people up here what the hell isnin these woods. The state is huge as fuck and only around a million people. Most of that is off i95.  There's some strange shit going on up here that's all I'll say. The bush family vacationing in kennebunk should say it all.  Also Maine was a landing port for nazi spy subs.... I also hear Maine is a hub for trafficking on the east coast.

              Now that would make sense. Especially with Maine and the shipping ports. Human trafficking has always seemed to focus around shipping ports, which is why I have suggested numerous times in the past we just surprise-sweep all warehouses on the coastlines and borders. Though that's pretty extreme, it just really bothers me knowing that somewhere there are warehouses with innocent people held prisoner for awful means.
             </p>
             <p>
              Florida would be another place of interest, especially if there was some deal with an off shore island nation or something. Slip out under cover of darkness, drop the people off on the island for further transport, return having had less chance of US Coast Guard catching you in either direction. Meanwhile your contacts are in a country with less restrictions handling the rest of the transaction.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry didn't mean to ramble, but so many theories when it comes to human trafficking. Clearly getting people into Mexico to ship out is a huge possibility as well. It's annoying how we know human trafficking is a thing, but how rarely it seems any busts happen.

               I heard of something in Eastern Europe called "Arizona" market.  It's a trafficking hotspot that sends people straight to Arizona through Mexico. Open borders isn't about jobs it's about cheap labor and human trafficking.

                Now that's creepy. Aside from the cases listed by Missing 411 in the Arizona area (and spreading into New Mexico, Nevada and I believe Utah), there are numerous others in the state and state parks that go unsolved and the people, many children, under suspicious circumstances that befit abduction - thus were ruled out of M411 listing.
               </p>
               <p>
                Has anyone gone through NamUs decade by decade to cross reference disappearances with locations of suspected individuals at that time? Also keeping in mind active child nappers, murderers, etc. in the area to try and help rule that out as well.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also consider referencing gang activity, like MS-13, in the same time frame and area of missing person's too. They've been dabbling in human trafficking themselves. It's scary. If they can get them in, they can get them out.
               </p>
               <p>
                Considering the corruption of the Mexican government on numerous levels and it's appreciation of money, I can't say I'd be surprised if they had fingers in the pot as well. Or at least were willing to look the other way.
