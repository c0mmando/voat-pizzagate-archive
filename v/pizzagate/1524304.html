<p>The following post gained some notoriety not too long ago. The original post was some Hollywood Gossip &quot;blind item&quot; concerning some unnamed and abused Hollywood star. The comments section contained the following bit of errata, allegedly written by Robert Downy Jr:</p>
<p><a href="http://crazydaysandnights.net/2012/11/todays-blind-items-12.html">http://crazydaysandnights.net/2012/11/todays-blind-items-12.html</a>  <a href="https://archive.fo/SEFJM">https://archive.fo/SEFJM</a></p>
<p>The OP for this comment is about former child actress Hayden Panettiere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay folks, here goes. Excuse the spelling as I\'m on an iPhone w/o spellcheck. First, sorry for unleashing all of this. Second, I am NOT judging this young lady – just saying that help is there for all of us if we accept it and want to help ourselves.</p>
<p>And third, if this BLIND ITEM hits and spreads through the web far, wide, and rapidly, I may have to remove this comment. It can cause problems I cannot explain right now. (Don\'t want trouble for &quot;Enty&quot;, so don\'t be shocked if the whole item and/or my comment gets erased to avoid trouble).</p>
<p>So here goes: Yes, this IS Hayden.
100% totally. I know this for a FACT. The wording of this item is NOT 100% correct – which may be intentional to deny it legally, but it is close. But there\'s far more to this than is being mentioned, revealed, or even hinted at. For all you GoogleSleuths out there just look up the past news stories about her Dad getting arrested on &quot;domestic&quot; issues – then her mom dropping it. It\'s not just about a fight, smack, or basic domestic issues. It\'s about sexual perversions, videotapes, witnesses, and the loss of MONEY and FAME.</p>
<p>I am a FORMER personal &quot;friend&quot; of a woman named Diana Jenkins. Doubt you know her, but she\'s the Rosetta Stone of every scandal and perversion from Hwood all over the globe. She\'s an Uber-wealthy divorcee whose hubby ran UK’s Barclay\'s bank – and she ran the Arab investors for the bank! She\'s been running a high class call girl/party-girl ring for Arabs, Wall Street, DC, Royals, and Hollywood elites. She\'s also a MAJOR philanthropist, arts supporter, political donor, and social hostess to EVERYONE. Her best Hwood pals include Sean Penn, Clive Davis, Ari Emanuel, George Clooney, Cindy Crawford, and her “little pet” named Hayden. Diana is the connector of wealthy Arabs and Asians and Athletes with Hwood actresses/models. She also is a sick and twisted bitch. When Hayden and her own Mommy went on the outs, Diana Jenkins took that place in her life, by Hayden\'s choice.</p>
<p>Leslie P. is not just a poor victim in this trainwreck. Trust me. She\'s at LEAST 50% responsible (if not more) for encouraging, enabling, and at times even participating in her hubby\'s twisted fucking life. Leslie\'s kinks cross the line into depravity, illegality, and inhuman sickness. As in: Ryan ONeal, John Phillips, Tish Cyrus, and Dan Schnieder territory. (Far worse than Pimpa Joe Simpson!)</p>
<p>She\'s not just had chances to stop it or walk away with the kids, but she elected to not protect her kids – and give in to the hedonistic sickness in her bedroom (all for her own greed). You think Dina Lohan is bad?</p>
<p>Leslie\'s guilt is compounded by trying to save her daughter\'s &quot;IMAGE&quot; (so as not affect her earning potential); and hoovering her own mountain of drugs, booze, fame, and fucking (of everything with legs)…Leslie IS as bad as her hubby – maybe worse because she KNEW it was wrong but didn\'t stop it and at times fueling it.</p>
<p>It\'s easy to argue that Hayden is forever a victim which drives her own insane life choices – and I\'m not a psychologist – but she has taken it further into becoming a willing perpetuator of it (and saying she loves it). Not just the physical and mental violence she enjoys, but her insatiable appetite for the most bizarre shit she can indulge in to &quot;top&quot; herself. She was offered help by some who genuinely cared for her and worried for her. She mocked them and tore off on her own streak. Now? She craves it and considers nothing taboo. NOTHING! Just ask Mario Lopez (right Enty?).</p>
<p>There is NEVER any excuse for inflicting sick acts upon a child (of any age). This stuff all began in Hayden\'s teen years. And her Mom was as much a part of it as her Dad. Leslie\'s idea of a fun time was a coke-fueled orgy with 2 young studs…and her daughter and daughter\'s pals watching or joining in. Leslie preyed on Hayden\'s boyfriends, and Hayden preyed on 40yo-60yo producers, directors, agents, and studio bosses – male and female – (even offering one of them an in-home party he\'d never forget). All this before she aged 19.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dear old dad with his own substance abuse issues made sure to tape EVERYTHING in the house. Including Hayden\'s girlfriends, sleepovers, and &quot;quality time&quot; in the family jacuzzi pool. When some of her gf\'s complained, their parents forbade them from ever going to that house again (and threatened charges). THEN, in return, Hayden would SNUB them out of her circle. So if you wanted to go to the clubs, shopping swag, and live the high life? You didn\'t rat out about Hayden\'s SICK family life. Because – after all – EVERYONE wants to be famous right? EVERYONE wants to be a celebrity…or a BFF hanger on, right?</p>
<p>Sorry to unload all of this stuff at once. I\'m sorry. I\'m just sick and tired of all of this, and parents who are so fucked up that they breed fucked up kids.</p>
<p>My family was not Ozzie and Harriet – and it damn near killed me and destroyed everyone I loved – and my pathetic career- as a result. But when I realized it was time to take charge and stop the cycle, stop blaming my Dad, and be my own person? My life turned around (with the help of my amazing wife and some REAL friends who loved me). I just wish others could do the same for themselves.</p>
<p>(PS – I have no issue with ANYTHING people voluntarily do in their private life as long as it is consenting – (kids and animals cannot consent!), and NOT hurting another mentally or physically. I\'m no saint, especially in my youth but am close these days-lol. And all I\'ll say about another old topic? I am NOT a cross-dresser! My wife happens to collect vintage clothing and it\'s tough to surprise her when you share a home and office. But I admit I DO look good in pumps and a dress,:-)</p>
<p>For all of you TRUE diehard Hollywood underworld detectives? Find all you can about the notorious lady named Sanela Diana Jenkins – the ex-British socialite from the Balkans. Read British media stories about her divorce, and IGNORE the PR fluff about her rags to riches story. THEN look at her pics with all her pals, and who she\'s with. CONNECT ALL THE DOTS to all the blinds you know. Also look into a photo book called ROOM 23 filled with Hwood stars that Diana “produced”. Look closely at the list of stars who took part in that project. She is the HUB on the blind gossip wheel, and the Rosetta Stone of socialite dirt. Good luck!</p>

            I am a FORMER personal "friend" of a woman named Diana Jenkins. Doubt you know her, but she's the Rosetta Stone of every scandal and perversion from Hwood all over the globe. She's an Uber-wealthy divorcee whose hubby ran UK’s Barclay's bank – and she ran the Arab investors for the bank! She's been running a high class call girl/party-girl ring for Arabs, Wall Street, DC, Royals, and Hollywood elites. She's also a MAJOR philanthropist, arts supporter, political donor, and social hostess to EVERYONE. Her best Hwood pals include Sean Penn, Clive Davis, Ari Emanuel, George Clooney, Cindy Crawford, and her “little pet” named Hayden. Diana is the connector of wealthy Arabs and Asians and Athletes with Hwood actresses/models. She also is a sick and twisted bitch. When Hayden and her own Mommy went on the outs, Diana Jenkins took that place in her life, by Hayden's choice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Leslie P. is not just a poor victim in this trainwreck. Trust me. She's at LEAST 50% responsible (if not more) for encouraging, enabling, and at times even participating in her hubby's twisted fucking life. Leslie's kinks cross the line into depravity, illegality, and inhuman sickness. As in: Ryan ONeal, John Phillips, Tish Cyrus, and Dan Schnieder territory. (Far worse than Pimpa Joe Simpson!)
           </p>
           <p>
            She's not just had chances to stop it or walk away with the kids, but she elected to not protect her kids – and give in to the hedonistic sickness in her bedroom (all for her own greed). You think Dina Lohan is bad?
           </p>
           <p>
            Leslie's guilt is compounded by trying to save her daughter's "IMAGE" (so as not affect her earning potential); and hoovering her own mountain of drugs, booze, fame, and fucking (of everything with legs)…Leslie IS as bad as her hubby – maybe worse because she KNEW it was wrong but didn't stop it and at times fueling it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's easy to argue that Hayden is forever a victim which drives her own insane life choices – and I'm not a psychologist – but she has taken it further into becoming a willing perpetuator of it (and saying she loves it). Not just the physical and mental violence she enjoys, but her insatiable appetite for the most bizarre shit she can indulge in to "top" herself. She was offered help by some who genuinely cared for her and worried for her. She mocked them and tore off on her own streak. Now? She craves it and considers nothing taboo. NOTHING! Just ask Mario Lopez (right Enty?).
           </p>
           <p>
            There is NEVER any excuse for inflicting sick acts upon a child (of any age). This stuff all began in Hayden's teen years. And her Mom was as much a part of it as her Dad. Leslie's idea of a fun time was a coke-fueled orgy with 2 young studs…and her daughter and daughter's pals watching or joining in. Leslie preyed on Hayden's boyfriends, and Hayden preyed on 40yo-60yo producers, directors, agents, and studio bosses – male and female – (even offering one of them an in-home party he'd never forget). All this before she aged 19.

            (PS – I have no issue with ANYTHING people voluntarily do in their private life as long as it is consenting – (kids and animals cannot consent!), and NOT hurting another mentally or physically. I'm no saint, especially in my youth but am close these days-lol. And all I'll say about another old topic? I am NOT a cross-dresser! My wife happens to collect vintage clothing and it's tough to surprise her when you share a home and office. But I admit I DO look good in pumps and a dress,:-)

            For all of you TRUE diehard Hollywood underworld detectives? Find all you can about the notorious lady named Sanela Diana Jenkins – the ex-British socialite from the Balkans. Read British media stories about her divorce, and IGNORE the PR fluff about her rags to riches story. THEN look at her pics with all her pals, and who she's with. CONNECT ALL THE DOTS to all the blinds you know. Also look into a photo book called ROOM 23 filled with Hwood stars that Diana “produced”. Look closely at the list of stars who took part in that project. She is the HUB on the blind gossip wheel, and the Rosetta Stone of socialite dirt. Good luck!

            Diane's good friend George Clooney (he appeared in her Hooker Catalogue, oh sorry, I mean "Art Book") had a troublesome spot of bother with paparazzi taking photos of a topless 13 year old girl staying with him in his lake Como villa.

            Poor George. That had to suck for him.  George below, in happier times, with Hillary. The fact that George's wife is Julian Assange's lawyer must have made for some fun dinner table conversation.

             Catherine Zeta Jones said on the Tonight Show, at the height of her career, that she and her family had shown up at Clooney's Italian villa and he turned them away.  He said "Someone is here".They had been invited. She was grinning, but still mad. Leno was speechless. After that, they came after her with the crazy rumours. I believe George WAS being groomed for governor or President. Because the Arab bride. Her uncle is big arms dealer. But we all knew that, right?

               Zaid Takieddin. I had to dig it up on a hunch. No American MSM mentions it. I started with "I wonder who paid for the Venetian part of the wedding?" Because that. Was. Expensive.

                Agreed, and holy fuckballs. We really need to have a separate thread on all this. Clooney is known in many circles for ALLEGEDLY liking underage girls (10,12, 13 yrs etc). His 'lothario' image and sham marriage have been carefully cultivated to distract from this. ALLEGEDLY, his villa in Lake Como is to protect him from prying american journo eyes and lets him indulge in his 'passion projects'.
Trying to find a link pining him to Epstein.

             She spoke no English, and had no money and no family but saved enough to enrol at London’s City University. In her time there she launched an investment fund, through which she met her husband. They married in 1999, the same year their son, Innis, was born. Daughter Eneya was born three years later.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the couple separated Mr Jenkins promised he would be generous when it came to the settlement. Last year he told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Will she take half my money? Of course. And quite rightly so. Without her, I would not have anything like the success I have had.’

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Roger Jenkins, the Hollywood-connected Barclays executive who last year helped preserved the bank’s independence by securing a vital investment from the Persian Gulf, is planning to establish a firm to advise sovereign wealth funds.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Jenkins, who is said to be one of London’s highest-paid bankers, is negotiating departure terms after 25 years with Barclays, a person with direct knowledge of the talks said Monday. The person declined to be identified because no agreement had been reached.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Jenkins first voiced interest in founding a firm a year ago, but senior executives persuaded him to stay to help Barclays through the worst of the credit crisis, this person said.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to The Sunday Times Rich List, Mr. Jenkins earned £40 million, or $65 million, last year and has personal wealth of £120 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Jenkins, who is chairman of the investment banking business in the Middle East but is based in London, is said to be eager to move to Los Angeles to spend more time with his family.
            </p>
            <p>
             In October, he was vital to Barclays’ £5.8 billion, or $8.6 billion, deal with Qatar and Abu Dhabi, which helped the bank avoid having to accept a government bailout, which would have meant surrendering some control to the British government. This year, he worked on the sale of iShares, the business that was eventually acquired by BlackRock as part of its purchase of Barclays Global Investors.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Jenkins could not be reached for comment Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
             His wife, Sanela Diana Jenkins, introduced him in 2006 to Sheik Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar and director of its sovereign wealth fund. Mrs. Jenkins is a socialite who considers Mick Jagger and Paris Hilton friends. The couple co-hosted an event with George Clooney in December that helped raise £10 million for refugees from
Darfur, Reuters reported.

             How did she meet her "$40 million" husband "at the gym" if she could "only afford to eat Toblerones"? LOL. Im presuming the gym wasn't a Planet Fitness (or whatever is London's equivalent.) Her biography is such made up bullshit, its breathtaking.
She was a prostitute and street hustler. The end.

            Sean Penn, (Jenkins partner in Haiti) known for beating his wife Madonna, herself known to be something of a Whore of Babylon type, went to the trouble of producing a Hollywood documentary debunking of child ritual sexual abuse:

             I've been wondering about Sean Penn and why he was really in Haiti. Now that I see he did that documentary, I guess I know. He was friends with Dennis Hopper, even named his son after him. Dennis Hopper had a lot of underage and abuse allegations against him.

              I may need to do a follow up post. There's a lot going on here actually but I've been lazy over the holidays. For instance, the general on her Haiti board was somehow coincidentally in Haiti when the earthquake happened, and there's an account from Penn how their org was in there and just doing shit without anyone really knowing or supervising anything, including moving a lot of people around and out of the country (for "shots and medical treatment"). It's pretty shady but I'll post a follow up. Then there's the profile of Jenkins and how she is actually a split personality; there's Diana and there's Salena, and she has this really weird interview where she talks about them both like two different people. Then there's the fact that no one can figure out how she got to London as a penniless Bosnian refugee but a few years later is introducing Barcalys bank to the Prime Minister of Qatar. She's been asked but she won't say. I haven't found a lot of recent activity, but there's a story here....

              Yep, she's the power-broker behind the "face" of Democratic Hollywood. Dennis Hopper produced her website and book I mentioned in the post. She knows everyone in Hollywood, which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of one's character.

            Diana Jenkins got a huge divorce settlement from Roger Jenkins. He claims that she negotiated the bailout from Qatar and was very happy to give her 150 million pounds. How does a refugee from Bosnia negotiate one of the most profitable deals with Qatar for Barclay's resulting in Roger Jenkins being the highest paid banker in London? Hint: Bosnian kids.

              How did she in 2006 introduce her husband to the Qatar royal family. That introduction, btw, resulting in Barclays bank not being bailed out by taxpayers in 2008 banking crisis. SHE LEVERAGED THAT DEAL! That was historic and made Roger very wealthy. He says so that she gets the credit. What in her background put her in contact with that kind of social network and why.

               Her refugee scenario needs to be looked into. Maybe she started off recruiting other refugees to be trafficked and was smart enough to maneuver her way up the organistion. She's a very interesting person indeed.

            My speculative take: she made her fortune in the UK trafficking girls and children from Bosnia. She expanded her enterprise massively after marrying her client / husband, now continues those operations while pimping out the Hollywood kids to the big players (see Hayden P.) especially Arabs and she is the conduit for trafficking for the Clinton Foundation.

             During her marriage, her husband became the highest paid banker in London due in part to a deal she negotiated with Qatar. I would further speculate that these deal involved Eastern European human trafficking, as it continues to do today through the Clinton Foundation. If you want to find a link between the foundation and the trafficking supply chain, she is it.

              Yes, instead of just giving them some cash back to settle up the terms, the deal was to include many, many new victims in addition to monies to be paid back.
