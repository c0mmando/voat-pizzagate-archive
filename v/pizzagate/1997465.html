             We know who Lika is, and she is connected to some of the groups involved including the Social Justice League of Racine, Leadership Racine (trains people to follow the path of corruption led by the local elite), RAMAC, and Founders Rotary.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Rotary Club is a major circle of criminal corruption in Racine with a deep history as the founder of Rotary International was from Racine. She has been an advocate of programs that are known to be part of the agenda tied to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. She was also part of a group called JT Irregulars, which has mafia connections. They were outed as being part of the circle of corruption and many of them work for some of the companies involved and with local unions.
            </p>
            <p>
             She and many others went quiet when they were exposed as part of the unveiling of different circles. It has been a long process. The list of those involved is in the thousands in Racine at various levels. She is one of many, but has very relevant connections to the circles involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
