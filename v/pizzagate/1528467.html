<p>Here is a list of documented ways in which criminals dispose of bodies from Wikipedia.

<li>Illegal use of conventional methods, commonly burial in a place unlikely to draw attention, or water disposal (e.g. Cleveland Torso Murderer)</li>
<li>Dissolution was used by Jeffrey Dahmer, smashing or dissolving the skeleton</li>
<li>Cannibalism (e.g. Jeffrey Dahmer)</li>
<li>Grinding into small pieces for disposal in nature, disposal via a sewer system, or use as fertilizer</li>
<li>Boiling (used by Futoshi Matsunaga and Dennis Nilsen)</li>
<li>Encasing in concrete (e.g. murder of Junko Furuta)</li>
<li>Hiding in trash or landfill (e.g. murder of David Stack, disappearance of Natalee Holloway)</li>
<li>Feeding to animals (e.g. pigs or flesh-eating insects; used by Ted Bundy)</li>
<li>Abandonment in an area where the body can degrade significantly before being discovered, if ever, such as a remote area (e.g. West Mesa * murders), cave, abandoned well, abandoned mine, or a neglected or hazardous third-party property (known as a dump job); sometimes dropped in an easily discovered but out-of-the-way location to obscure the identity of the murderer (e.g. Fountain Avenue, Brooklyn)</li>
<li>Dropping into a destructive or impassible natural hazard, such as volcano, quicksand, or crevasse</li>
<li>Destruction by industrial process, such as machinery, chemical bath, molten metal, or a junked car</li>
<li>Injection into the legitimate body disposal system (e.g. morgue, funeral home, cemetery, crematorium, funeral pyre, cadaver donation) or killings at a health care facility (e.g. Ann Arbor Hospital Murders and Dr. X killings)</li>
<li>Burning, often in a building (e.g. possibly the Clinton Avenue Five)</li>
<li>Disguising as animal flesh (e.g. abattoir, food waste, food; as Katherine Knight did)</li>
<li>Attachment to a vehicle travelling to a distant place</li>
<li>Creating false evidence of the circumstances of death and letting investigators dispose of the body, possibly obscuring identity</li>
<li>Indefinite storage (e.g. in a freezer or refrigerator, as in the murder of Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.)</li>
