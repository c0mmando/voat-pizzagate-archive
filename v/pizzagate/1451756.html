            In NYC epstein/trump had a teenage modeling company that they ran as a team 1980-1999, in 1999 they renamed it T-Model ( funny t for teenager, not trump ), this is how trump met his current wife
Many police complaints over the years that trump/epstein were fucking the little girls trying to be models, its said they were auditioning 12 year old girls to work in Trump Mob Casino whore houses start them young, so they're docile fucks by the time they're legal, usually when illegal they're sent to macau or israel, later post 18+ they can come back work in usa until their washed up around 24,

            Yep, and also prior to 2007 Trump &amp; Epstein were best friends around 2007 Trump had to '86' Epstein from key-margo-largo-pedo resort that trump owned in florida, where trump let 14 year old girls give his friends hand-jobs called 'massage', epstein wanted a fuck and the girl told her mother who called the cops, they had to ban epstein,
           </p>
           <p>
            I always thought this move was a political move to distance trump - epstein when the SPITZER investigation was going on trump needed plausible deniability that him epstein were no long fuck buddys

            Could just be a coincidence, but it seems to be a coincidence that happens all too often--Look at any politician in any office who had a very public sex scandal 'fall from grace' or a sudden death, and chances are they were probably investigating or attempting to stop sex trafficking in some way.
