<p>Most of us know the story of Reddit\'s pizzagate forum. How it was taken down and rose from the ashes here on voat. Since then, Reddit\'s main forum for this cause has been:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pedogate">https://www.reddit.com/r/pedogate</a></p>
<p>Although I don\'t deal much with Voat outside of our forum here, Voat\'s pizzagate forum has been the main hub. Homebase. #1. For this cause. Although it paled in comparison, the next best forum was Reddit\'s pedogate forum.</p>
<p>AND NOW IT\'S GONE.</p>
<p>It is supposedly due to a user posting CP, but I\'m not sure I buy that. People are citing a certain post, which I myself followed, as being the cause.of this. The post was by a supposed virtuous &quot;i\'m so sorry&quot; pedo CP-watcher who claimed he was disgusted by his own urges and was morally against CP aka child porn aka child sexually exploitative material (which is what i truly believe it should be called but is also laboriously thirteen syllables long.)</p>
<p>I think the timing with the &quot;Cuties&quot; movie controversy is to blame. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/cuties-film-cancel-netflix/">https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/cuties-film-cancel-netflix/</a></p>
<p>Does anyone know more about this? I am surprised it has not been discussed here yet.  
</p>
<p>For the record, I watched &quot;Cuties,&quot; and it is horrible. In writing, in words, I would understand the director\'s perspective: that it\'s important to shine a light on society\'s abhorrent sexualization of children. But in the end, no matter what, the movie is packed full of footage-- non-stop repulsive close-ups-- that is clearly fodder for the monsters out there who want to abuse children, and they clearly did something horrible by having these girls act in this movie.  The point could have been made without exploiting these girls and creating footage to fuel the sick fires of child sexual abusers aka the SCUM of the earth.</p>',

            And you could have gotten the talking points and summary of the movie without watching it - like most of us didn’t.  There were plenty of blurry still images and descriptions of what was in it to have me cancel Netflix immediately and not watch the film.  Oddly though, you felt the need to watch it..?

            Personally I'm not fooled. Cuties isn't some altruistic attempt to shed light on the elite pedo situation. Its an attempt at pedo normalization that that they are trying to soften any way they can think of because the public outrage was way worse then they expected.

            There was a massive thread yesterday on the frontage that was shitting all over Netflix for creating Cutie's. Reddit won't let you dox people so of course they're going to ban a doxing subreddit. You guys are retarded, seriously.

            Reddit is well known for censoring stuff exactly like this. Netflix has lost billions of dollars because of Cuties. You should stop being part of the problem, dump Netflix, stop funding abuse.

                I haven't seen the film, but the trailer had portions of a scene with an adult woman telling a little girl to "just wash it off, the water will cleanse your sin", from the context of the film I'm assuming that this is some reference to oral sex. I have also heard there is a scene with children watching and mimicking porn. The film is rated NC-17, I'm sure that if the film had not included porn, sex, and rape of pre-teen girls it would have easily been rated R instead. I've also heard that there is an overseas version which isn't even legal to show in the USA because it contains child porn. Muslim's are evil, instead of being angry at a movie that shows a middle age Muslim forcing a little girl to blow him, they're upset that people don't like rapist shits. After all, their hero is Muhammad who liked to fuck nine year olds, and to them the idea of heaven is fucking 72 little underage virgin girls over and over.

            Just yesterday I heard a "conservative" "Christian" defending Netflix and attacking other Christians for boycotting it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was a little surprised, but part of me was thinking "Deep down I always suspected you were a piece of shit."

            It's not directly related to your post, but it's just that people who protect pedophiles are eveywhere, and each is doing what he can big or small. Some have the power to shut down whole Reddit groups, and others only have the power to make a small group of Christians in their circle question themselves for opposing those who promote pedophilia, but they are all working toward the same goal.

             Just accept that you have to be ready to kill that faggot bownthat you know they are geneeal danger to white children everywhere for enabling weimar trannyniggerjews to rape kids and make pedos not get exterminated in the streets cuz muh tabula rasa muh enlightenment muh if you kill child molsestors and kiddie porn fans you lose. fat chance put a ball peen hammer right to the top of his head and leave a nice golfball sized hole for his pedo loving spirit to leak out into hell with. christ will have nothing to do with those who defile his children and certainly not with those who do so and speak as if they know him.  Many false christians among us, i do not judge them but by them commandments of God and only in the futherance of his word to I ask all to help these people meet God so he may judge them.

            No surprise there. There is a clear, obvious connection between rich, powerful jews and pedophilia. Reddit is owned, controlled and (mainly) moderated by jews. It's not really shocking that these jews would censor on their own platform in attempt to do damage control.

             My mind would be more at ease if this were true but at the end of the day recording sexually explicit scenes with children was not necessary for the film to convey the controversy. The Netflix poster alone was enough for that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not only that but if that's the intent then it abjectly failed because I haven't spoken with anyone new to these terrible problems. I don't see anyone talking about child exploitation but I will admit that Reddit shutting it down (((oy vey!))) shortly after the release of this film (I can't even say the name because it makes me feel gross) is likely beyond coincidence.

            The fact that you know this means you still, to this day, frequented reddit and therefore anything you say is null and void. This isn't "HUGE" in the slightest, and how it was still up after all this time is beyond me.

             Pizzagate stuff is all over Twitter and YouTube. Everyone knows the elites are pedo cannibal satanists, and no one is doing anything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just like Obama's birth certificate. Remember that? It was delivered in crayon and Adobe layers and the whole world knows it's fake as fuck, but nothing happens.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's the world we live in.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gang member arrested for the 9th time, released without bail, shoots someone later that day. Literally knew he was a criminal. Literally released him. Literally murdered again. Literally no one cares. Literally no one doing anything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like, "Archive all the evidence!" Yeah, because we need a petabyte of evidence rather than a terabyte of evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone knows everything already, and no one is doing anything ever. That's the world we live in now.

            Fuck... This really fucking sucks. But I can't say I'm that surprised since they took down the pizzagate sub before reddit separated into voat to continue the research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are there any threads discussing what happened with the subreddit shut down more in depth?
