           </blockquote>
           <p>
            and does satisfy Rule 2?

            Whistleblower Kay Griggs mentions Dahmer, saying his crimes were connected to his military background.  Also recently on 4Chan an anon posted a scan of a page from Dahmer's biography.  While a high school student and on a school excursion to Washington DC, Dahmer slipped away to make a phone call.  As a result of this call the whole group was given an exclusive inside tour of the Whitehouse and met the Vice President.  Who did he know?

            John Wayne Gacy  was involved with politics.
Gacy was also a Democratic Party activist who had his picture taken with Rosalynn Carter after being given Secret Service clearance. At the time of the picture, Gacy had several victims hidden in his home. Source
