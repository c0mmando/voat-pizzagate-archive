<p>Here is just a short snippet:</p>
<p>Hagmann: The push for pizzagate being &quot;fake news&quot; is so hard. It astounds me. first of all this has been misrepresented in the media. this has been to some extent misrepresented in the independent media. I know Alex Jones got a lot of flack for issuing an apology. I\'m not going to comment on that, I can\'t speak for him... Having said all of that, where are we at with the actual investigation itself?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Angela: &quot;Pedogate is the worldwide child trafficking network. It\'s the entertainment for the elite of society; it\'s run by the very top, this is how they can get away with it. this is how they can traffic 30+ children over a border with no problem.</p>
<p>&quot;But Pizzagate, and this is the important point to make, Pizzagate is the Washington, DC faction of a global pedophile network. so the media is purposefully misrepresenting it as though it\'s all just one pizza shop. Granted that pizza sop has been implicated as a possible suspect, but it never originated with Alex Jones. It originated with John Podesta\'s Wikileaks because it is a term pedophiles use to be able to talk about child porn out in the open. [Mentions 2010 Urban Dictionary entry: &quot;cheese pizza&quot; = child porn] &quot;....that\'s where the word pizza actually comes from, it\'s not because of just some pizza shop.  
</p>
<p>She then details how our investigation went from the strange language in the emails, to DC\'s child sex ring history, including The Finders (more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIbXbzK-XIA">here</a>), and connections to the CIA. &quot;It wasn\'t just rape, they were actually using them in satanic rituals, sometimes torturing them and sometimes killing them. This is what we\'ve been seeing with pizzagate and with pedogate. the people that tend to enjoy this activity don\'t stop at rape a lot of times... That investigation was shut down by the CIA. It really makes you wonder, is it just continuing? Did it really ever get shut down, or did it just get buried?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The reason the media just wants you to think it stops at pizza shop, is because it\'s very easy to prove it true once you know what the real implications are.&quot; [Mentions Barney Frank threatening to out half of Congress as pedophiles, and the Franklin Scandal] </p>
<p>&quot;The more you look into it, the more you will see that i sit true, and the more you want justice for these children&quot;</p>
