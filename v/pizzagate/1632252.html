             <strong>
              PLEASE READ ME!
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding "Tin Foil Hat Brigade": whenever something uncomfortable gets mentioned, it isn't long before someone chimes in with a dig at tin foil hats and conspiracy theories. So, in honor of those enterprising souls that know/have seen things that others cannot wrap their minds around, I'm covering some little known scandals... one of which was revealed in 1995, well before HRC ever ran for office.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Michael Trimm's new site, someone asked if anyone read "The Franklin Cover-Up: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder In Nebraska" .. and so I looked it up and started reading it. After all, I'm a child of the 80's and remember the Satanism hysteria that was
             <em>
              everywhere
             </em>
             and ultimately discounted as the wild imaginings of kids... Kids that recalled in detail ritual abuse, torture, perversion, money, drugs, and the names of the elite.
            </p>
            <p>
             Long story short: Iran-Contra funding via coke sales, money laundered by a bank ran by a pedo who recruited kids from Boys Town (among other places) to be prostitutes and drug couriers.
            </p>
            <p>
             And before you roll your eyes, please consider that A) human experimentation has happened in the US; and B) Bill Clinton issued an apology in 1995 (
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRTOB">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRTOB
             </a>
             ... ) to the victims of those experiments. He references one type of experimentation, but that is a far cry from all the manipulations used on an unknowing/unwilling people, including CHILDREN. Oh, and C) America's Most Wanted covered it, but dropped the topic after the FBI failed to co-operate (aka stonewalled them), being the first time that agency declined helping investigate a story from that program.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, tied to this is Cathy O'Brian (
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugx64">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugx64
             </a>
             ... ) who alleges she was part of the CIA program, MK-Ultra, and was used as a messenger and prostitute after being tortured and abused from an early age. In her book, "Trance Formation America," published in 1995-- way before HRC ran for president, O'Brian states that Hillary saw her particular genital mutilation and began raping the teenager.

             If our government was kidnapping children and doing atrocious things to them in order to fulfill an agenda, then our country has bigger problems than this election. Just sayin'.
