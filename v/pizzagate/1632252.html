             <strong>
              PLEASE READ ME!
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding "Tin Foil Hat Brigade": whenever something uncomfortable gets mentioned, it isn't long before someone chimes in with a dig at tin foil hats and conspiracy theories. So, in honor of those enterprising souls that know/have seen things that others cannot wrap their minds around, I'm covering some little known scandals... one of which was revealed in 1995, well before HRC ever ran for office.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Michael Trimm's new site, someone asked if anyone read "The Franklin Cover-Up: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder In Nebraska" .. and so I looked it up and started reading it. After all, I'm a child of the 80's and remember the Satanism hysteria that was
             <em>
              everywhere
             </em>
             and ultimately discounted as the wild imaginings of kids... Kids that recalled in detail ritual abuse, torture, perversion, money, drugs, and the names of the elite.
            </p>
            <p>
             Long story short: Iran-Contra funding via coke sales, money laundered by a bank ran by a pedo who recruited kids from Boys Town (among other places) to be prostitutes and drug couriers.
            </p>
            <p>
             And before you roll your eyes, please consider that A) human experimentation has happened in the US; and B) Bill Clinton issued an apology in 1995 (
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRTOB">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRTOB
             </a>
             ... ) to the victims of those experiments. He references one type of experimentation, but that is a far cry from all the manipulations used on an unknowing/unwilling people, including CHILDREN. Oh, and C) America's Most Wanted covered it, but dropped the topic after the FBI failed to co-operate (aka stonewalled them), being the first time that agency declined helping investigate a story from that program.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, tied to this is Cathy O'Brian (
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugx64">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugx64
             </a>
             ... ) who alleges she was part of the CIA program, MK-Ultra, and was used as a messenger and prostitute after being tortured and abused from an early age. In her book, "Trance Formation America," published in 1995-- way before HRC ran for president, O'Brian states that Hillary saw her particular genital mutilation and began raping the teenager.
            </p>

             If our government was kidnapping children and doing atrocious things to them in order to fulfill an agenda, then our country has bigger problems than this election. Just sayin'.
