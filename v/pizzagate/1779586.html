            I see the symbols everywhere now.  I saw an advertisement for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's new tour called "Soul2Soul," and it has a version of intertwining triangles as well.

            Interesting find.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought I would quickly point out that Neil Gaiman's father David (who died in 2009) ran the outreach department for Scientology UK way back in the 1960s when they first achieved notoriety. As far as I remember, Neil has been openly critical of the organisation and his father's involvement.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been suggested that his father was involved in "End of the '60s" PSYOPs like the unsolved mystery of the Rolling Stones founder drowning in his swimming pool, and the Altamont stabbing by the Hells Angels in 1969. Weirdly, the cult's UK HQ in Sussex was just a couple of miles down the road from where band members lived. This thread is worth checking out:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember also the Scottish Rite has been linked to Scientology. The Jagger family are quite close associates of the Guinness dynasty who were implicated in Pizzagate (Rachel Chandler married Tom Guinness a few years back).

            The same names and organisations keep popping up, time and time again.

            To flesh the shot (and perhaps the story) out a bit--That scene, Shadow finds a weird device on the ground.  It opens up, and before it locks itself on his face, we see two little viewports open up--it's kind of a magical VR helmet. I'm not exactly sure it's supposed to be a triangle swirl, necessarily--in the shot, we're seeing him travel through the virtual space, which seems to be a narrow corridor with alternating light and dark areas, forming itself as he falls in, making the distinctive triangle pattern. That said, in the book there's a page where Shadow knocks on Wednesday's hotel room door and he sees an underage girl in his bed. So possibly--but it could just be a stylistic choice. We'll have to see if they keep that hotel scene in the show.

            Would have to see a reference to what the person is looking at. It's similar but not sure I want to jump into seeing every triangle as pedo symbols. Not ready to dump my Dark Side if the Moon LP.
