            You can look up federal inmates online. So I did.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was a federal crime, he goes into the federal system. Federal System is Nationwide. John Gotti's brother from NY served at the same prison.

             I read your post about the clinton email found at silsbys church

           <p>
            This is a little bit backwards.  It was a document from Silsby's group, the New Life Children's Refuge that a State Department employee downloaded from Eastside Baptist Church in Twin Falls.  The document was attached to an email that was part of a chain forwarded to Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            I actually just learned there were two Idaho Baptist Churches involved and Silsby attended the other one, Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho, not Eastside one.  So it was downloaded from the other church.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just put a new giant thread about Silsby today.  Look under NEW, it's because it's been downvoated.

            Remember, he is a shill. He is only interested in defending elite pedophiles, defending human trafficking by elites, and defending leftist elites in general.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore you can safely assume that anything he says either has evil motivation (there is no such thing as a shill who is a good person) or is outright lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's to PG breaking so he can be outed to the masses as one of their defenders, right at the timing in which their anger will be "white hot".
