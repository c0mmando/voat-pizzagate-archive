<blockquote>
<p>After a lifetime of being an outsider, Marilyn Manson, born Brian Warner, is coming to terms with his past. In a frank and soul-searching interview, he talks to Carole Cadwalladr about the loss of his mother, growing up angry – and why he’s ready for fatherhood</p>

<h2>I have indeed, cherry-picked this particular section of the interview, for the purpose of emphasizing Brian\'s early life - I fully encourage others to read the rest as it provides an insight into the darkness which seems to plague him.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out Manson’s lyrics about killing, about killing strangers, are true in a literal way that even he hadn’t quite realised. His father did kill strangers. And Manson, and his mother, lived with the aftermath.</p>
<p>“I think that he was very, very good at what he did. In the same way as the character that Martin Sheen plays in Apocalypse Now. I think my father was selected to do a job. He entered the air force at 17 and you just don’t know what your life is going to be at that age. He never talked to me about it. He still hasn’t really spoken of it. I think it was after my mother’s passing that he felt it was a time where it was necessary to tell me: ‘This is who I really am.’ And I think he was selected for being good at what he did – and that was killing people.”</p>
<p>When you realise that he spent the first 18 years of his life in a household dominated by the after-effects of violence, Marilyn Manson and his music, his obsessions, his sense of alienation, his fascination with killing, his insistence on living outside the strictures of mainstream American society, suddenly makes much more sense. And if it’s a light-bulb moment for me understanding who he is and where’s he come from, it also seems to have been for him.</p>
<p>His father had told him not to write. And he went to journalism college anyway. “The first article I ever did,” he recalls, “was about Marilyn Manson, which I wrote as myself as Brian Warner, and that was in part why I had to have a pseudonym, a stage name. I was put in a situation where I was suddenly stuck with… where I had created a Frankenstein’s monster. There was Marilyn Manson, but there was no music yet. I created a fake world maybe because I didn’t like the one I was living in. But that’s what made me make music. I had to fill in the gaps I’d created.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me, that this particular interview does tie in to his cryptic interview from September 2017; I would say that the latter was part of a bigger decision by Brian, to make peace with his past an \'exorcise some demons\', so to speak...</p>
<p>I have also listened to several songs on Heaven Upside Down and the lyrics seem to firmly bolster my theory that Brian was dropping hints in the 2017 interview, hence his seemingly-suspicious injuries of late.</p>

            He's still pretty vague. I think there was some kind of SRA in his family growing up. If his father never told him about the killing growing up while he was young how would he know about all that at that age. And killing who and for what. If the military was involved then even more so that SRA was done on this nutjob.

             That would be an incorrect assumption, there was no SRA in his family or his life. I read his autobiography and he details his early life quite well.

              He was molested by a neighbor when he was young several times.
             </em>
             That same neighbor poisoned his dog, which is why he wears his contact lenses in memory of his husky his abuser killed. .
            </p>
            <p>
             Also had a hard time in Christian school growing up, paranoid about the end times and hellfire and brimstone, like most children are around those sorts of things.
            </p>
            <p>
             he also walked in on his grandfather mid climax when he was dressed in drag and saw all his old smut mags and sex toys.
            </p>
            <p>
             I remember reading about something him walking through the woods with a friends and seeing Satanic altar places or something like that, but was never participating or so he said. Befriended Anton Lavey and was made an honorary Rev of Church of Satan, but never really detailed any Satanic rituals in his auto-bio. Did some freaky shit with groupies backstage though

               what you on about, I'm just making the point that just because he doesn't talk about SRA in his autobiography (again, why would he) doesn't  mean it didn't happen.  aka do your own research.  ppl are cunts on here sometimes

               Church of Satan is actually just a business that gives rituals and community to atheists, that is the garden variety satanist, not saying those things go on, but...

             The article, at some point, reveals that "the killing" was his father's involvement in the Vietnam War.

             I'm not even suspecting violence within the family home, at this time, but, it goes without saying that the effects of war on Brian's dad, would have been reflected in their home life on some level.

             Call him a nutjob all you like, I suppose. Though, if you suspect he was ritually abused, isn't it a bit harsh to call him that, while disregarding your own suspicions?

            I am getting really depleted.  I took a break yesterday and had a lot of fun and thought it would give me a fresh start this morning.  I have no intention to stop researching or speaking out, just that this stuff is really pulling at me lately.  I get tired of jumping back and forth to one subverse to another and a lot of people don't come here, which is frustrating.   What is posted here is so very important.  Had to vent.  Yes, it could quite be possible that MM was sending messages.  Messages that could gt him killed.

             Don't feel guilty about taking a break. Do what you have to to stay strong. This stuff gets us all down. I have been lurking at voat #pizzagate EVERYDAY since January and I know I speak for.a lot of people when I say how much we appreciate what you all are doing. Don't forget to take care of yourselves too.

              Thank you.  It is hard to take a break from here.  Especially when I know that so many are working hard right along with me.   But once in a while I do.  I really should do it more often.  There is no way I could ever stop doing this until the Story breaks.   We have not uncovered what we have just because of my work, it is all of us as a team.  But you are so right that we should all take a break once in a while.

              I am getting really depleted. I took a break yesterday and had a lot of fun and thought it would give me a fresh start this morning. I have not intention to stop researching or speaking out, just that this stuff is really pulling at me lately. I get tired of jumping back and forth to one subverse to another and a lot of people don't come here, which is frustrating. What is posted here is so very important. Had to vent.

              we are becoming aware of such heart breaking things they are doing now and in the past that it is breaking our hearts and our minds.  I never would have thought I would be strong enough to take all this in.  Never.

                 I for one, was desensitized to that kinda crap a long time ago... maybe not for the best of reasons at the time, but, it helps nowadays - being able to look at the worst aspects of humanity without being utterly shocked that any one human(or more) can reach such levels of depravity - it helps me to push forward and somehow cram 50+ tabs worth of info into my head for processing, when next I sleep.

                  I know what you mean I see it happening to me too.  But being able to read, over and over of these horrible acts, scares me that I will become TOO use to it.  But after reading your post on pineal glands  I now realize that I am putting myself into a certain mode.  One that makes me process this in order to get through what I have to.

                   If you feel apathy taking hold, have a break and spend some time around the things that make life tolerable for you - they'll remind you of why you look at the darkness, why you put yourself in that position to learn about what goes bump in the night, so to speak.

                    Thank you for giving credit where credit is due.  That is you all over.  I am going out to water my Flowers and clean the Bird Bath for the Birdies.  Time to smell the Roses.  Then back to Business.  Thanks for reminding me.

                     Haha, well, I certainly don't want the words of others, attributed to me... get enough of that with that one silly bugger who accidentally helped remind me of who I am and what I'm capable of, but, has now convinced themselves that I have multiple accounts here... bit of a laugh on it's own, but, would rather keep that kinda thing to a minimum xD

                      There are a lot of similar traits I see developing here.  It ties in to my open theory - our sub isn't getting larger.  It's been stuck at roughly the same number of participating members for quite some time now.  There is definitely some commonality I've seen between the little bit of personal info posted here by other Goats on
