            I saw this too and couldn't help but to think that is a great tactic satan himself probably would use. Blame the one telling the truth. So basically everyone guilty of something should be the victim because satan exposed his/her sin and is playing our accuser. Feel sorry for me.

            Francis must be the worst Pope I can remember. Many have predicted he'd be the last Pope. With their current problems, the predictions just might line up. Besides, God's not with the church, he's in your heart...

            Two Catholic beliefs that are insane.
(1) Masturbation is a venal sin. Pedaphelia is a mistake.
(2) Abortion and birth control are both wrong. Notice how many old white lawmakers in DC have been all up in arms about these two issues like they are important?
           </p>
           <p>
            Supreme Court made up of mostly Catholics. Vatican control of US...Not representative.Think I know how they do this....it's the money. Hopefully that will soon be drained.

            If Pope Francis says Vigano reminds him of Satan, I'll have to take his word for it, since he seems to be so intimately familiar with the way Satan looks. Maybe it's how he wears red a lot of the time? Pope Francis should get a selfie with Satan next time they're eating dead babies together.

               Vigano's claim that the previous pope had put McCarrick under sanctions is belied by the fact, that no restrictions seemed to be placed on McCarrick and that Vigano was part of the coverup because he publicly praised McCarrick.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                At a gala dinner in the luxury Pierre Hotel in Manhattan in 2012, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Pope Benedict’s top diplomat in the United States, bestowed an award for missionary service on Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and praised him as “very much loved from us all.”
               </p>
               <p>
                But if Archbishop Viganò is to be believed, he was keeping a troubling secret — a claim that is at the heart of a new scandal that has thrown the church into upheaval and led some conservatives to call for Pope Francis to resign.
               </p>
               <p>
                The archbishop now says he was aware at the time of the gala that Cardinal McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, was under orders from Pope Benedict XVI to stop appearing in public on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church because he had sexually abused adult seminary students.
               </p>
               <p>
                Archbishop Viganò did not explain why he agreed to publicly laud a cardinal under sanctions. But LifeSiteNews — a website run by conservative Catholics — quoted the archbishop on Friday as saying that he could not back out of the event.
               </p>
               <p>
                Even beyond the gala dinner, however, a review of Cardinal McCarrick’s activities during the years he was supposedly restricted under Benedict showed that he visited seminaries and ordained new priests, officiated at Masses and traveled the world representing the church.

               Try searching "vigano child sex".  Many articles calling it "child sex abuse".  Spin it however you want.

               What is it pedophiles like to say?  "Sex before 8, or it's too late?"  C'mon, you know the saying....just sayin'.

                see the article I just posted on Vigano and see why people are skeptical.

               <p>
                Many people feel Vigano and his allies are cynically using the child sex scandal as a way of fighting long standing battles. So far he has not provided evidence for his claims.

                  That's the point.  They are cynically using the pedophile scandal. (Did you hear about the Pope's actual news today?) Vigano and his allies are claiming the previous pope was told, but blaming this pope.  The only pope who has actually started taking steps against the sex scandals.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Notice how this claim from a fucking Breitbart article (Steve Bannon is alleged to be part of this war on the Pope, btw) is the thing that gets posted here.....did the Pope actually say what was claimed?....drowns out the big step the Pope actually did take.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I will say this again.  Vigano provided no evidence Pope Francis knew what he claims Pope Francis knew.  In fact, the evidence he puts forward is that John Paul and Benedict knew and Vigano knew, but he kept quiet year after year after year.

            Vigano is getting support.
           </p>
           <p>
            VATICAN CITY, September 7, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) — A Vatican letter to a New York priest confirms the Holy See knew of sexual abuse allegations against ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in 2000, Catholic News Service reported Friday.
The letter obtained by CNS was sent in 2006 from Archbishop Leonardo Sandri, then Vatican substitute for general affairs, to Father James Boniface Ramsay, a whistleblower on McCarrick.

             Yes!  Thousands are signing letters.  Women and Men and protests being organized even as we speak.  We all have to keep posting about this here and also spread the word to others.  We must not not allow  them put this on the back burner again.

            Pedo Pope doesn't realize we all know he is Pedo Pope?
