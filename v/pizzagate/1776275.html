The Russian narrative has always been inextricably attached to pizzagate.
This is relevent to pizzagate for this reason.  Even John podesta in his two formal interviews in 2017 links the two. ( see my old post below  with link to the interview here, where the title is &quot;podesta talks email hacks, fake news, and russia&quot;)</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1637939">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1637939</a></p>
<p>So it looks to me like The warhawks and pedophiles at the pentagon (more on operation flicker here:
 <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1449388">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1449388</a> ) have forced trumps hand in Syria, but I think he takes the upper hand.</p>
<p>Many have speculated about this new syrian confrontation :
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1773581">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1773581</a></p>
<p>My simple conclusion is, If trump didn\'t act forcefully in some way, the consequences could have been detrimental to him.  The american people, believing the press, would have lambasted trump for inaction, or worse claiming that he is complicit in letting Putin run rampant with Assad in Syria, amidst &quot;chemical atrocities.&quot;</p>
<p>So Trump suprises everyone today with the Tomahawk missle attack on a dual Russian - Syrian Air Field.  
</p>
<p>This tactic solved a variety of Trump issues.<br />
1.) Putin immediately condemns the attack, which shifts speculation about Russian-American collusion on any level aside for a moment.
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/04/07/putin-us-act-aggression-damages-relations-moscow/100160608/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/04/07/putin-us-act-aggression-damages-relations-moscow/100160608/</a>
that headline above is exactly what the trump team needs right now, everything considered.</p>
<p>As well as appeasing the neocons and pedos at the pentagon who baited him into action regardless.  His move looks bold, yet was intelligent in that they only struck military targets.  Which cant even be said for obamas endless drone campaigns which frequently bombed civilian targets, in multiple countries with no congressional oversight.</p>
<p>Likewise the very silent HRC spoke out today, at a very odd time, amidst bombings abroad, to talk about the Russians hacking her emails and she tries to tie the idea of theft of emails to watergate.  the article is not-coincidentally in the NYT:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/nyregion/hillary-clinton-russia-hacking-election-trump.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/nyregion/hillary-clinton-russia-hacking-election-trump.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>Her timing backs up my theory that trump gained a few points in casting aside this bullshit Russian collusion fiction thats been blasted by liberal media the whole year.  Enough so for her to come out of hiding and feel the need to embolden the false ideology that Russia had something to do with the DNC Hacks. .  the whole Russian argument is getting stale.</p>',

            They have Mc Cain on again stating that the Russia is now complicit in the gad attacks. He said the pictures of the babies being gases made him cry. Now we are going to arm all the rebels again (Isis) then continue on to take back Syria against Russia. Then arm the rebels again in the Ukraine with "leathal"  weapons to attack Russia again

                Nope. The only things that bother me are psychopaths in my government raping children, stealing organs, using crack to kill black people, and using mango-flavored opiates to kill poor white people.

                  That's exactly what I thought before I saw Clinton Cash and 150+ George Webb videos going over the evidence of child trafficking, organ harvesting, and importing mango-flavored heroin to sell to poor white people all across this formerly great nation.

            I agree that the MSM and democrats should not be able to say he is soft on Russia now.  Who knows what they will do.  To me, the way he strongly emphasized that innocent children, and babies, suffered and died, sent a signal to the elite pedophiles that he won't tolerate their sick behavior.  In other words,  "Don't mess with children, you sick people!"

            Assad seems to have thought he had an opportunity to terrify domestic dissidents by showing them that he could get away with dropping chemical weapons without international repercussions.  In trying to pull that, he frittered away a great deal of political capital.

               The guy who is a staple of popular culture for 40 years with the hit tv show? Obviously the real logical directionality is dying networks recognizing an entertaining figure and understandably desiring to capitalize on it.

                All I have to say is General Michael Flynn should be back as head of NSC. Bannon involved again. Kushner wstching from the sidelines. Steven Miller take over for Rience Prebus.
               </p>
               <p>
                This was the winning team during the election. This is who the American people voted in to office. Now Senator McCain , Lindsay Graham, &amp; Rubio are all over cable news cheering themselves.
               </p>
               <p>
                Gen. McMaster who took Flynn's position is giving a televised interview is some sort of hero.
               </p>
               <p>
                Russia who had plans with US to take down Isis in Raqqa. Putin is the guy who actually gave a speech in Devemeber on Child trafficking and Satanic worship taking over societies and the urgent need to stop it.
               </p>
               <p>
                In Syria everyone is upset about the gassed children but no one realizes the "white helmets" who allegedly rescue the children of Syria by day... steal them by night and sell them traffickers and organ harvesters who sneak bodies into Turkey where black market organs are sold.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is happening in Haiti, in the US in places like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Canada.
               </p>
               <p>
                No one is filming the truth about the white helmets who are in the videos with the gases children washing them down. It is a set up. The sarin gas was moved to Syria from Lybia by HRC &amp; CIA to establish Rat lines to take over Syria and execute s coup. The white helmets and rebels  (isis) are funded by the west &amp; directed by the west. John McCain secretly met with them last week.
               </p>
               <p>
                They use gas attacks to establish Rat lines that start child trafficking &amp; organ harvesting to lay pipeline for oil.
               </p>
               <p>
                Ex-CIA Morell has been outed as the guy implicated in the past involved in the gas attacks. He is being named again as well as HRC, Trump fell for it
               </p>
               <p>
                These peopl are beyond evil
