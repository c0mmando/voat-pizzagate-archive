<blockquote>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<p><em>Should we say “raped” automatically if a grown man has sex with a teenager? Does it matter at all if the 15-year-old, now much older, describes their encounter as one of the best nights of her life? What is our word for a “yes” given on a plane that’s almost vertically unequal? Does contemporary morality dictate that we trust a young woman when she says she consented freely, or believe that she couldn’t have, no matter what she says?</em> ...</p>
<p><em>The story widely recirculated after Bowie’s death was that he’d had sex with a 13-year-old, specifically the famous “child groupie” Lori Maddox (who was, by her account, 15 at the time of the encounter, <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/i-lost-my-virginity-to-david-bowie">and told Thrillist her story</a> last fall). As the piece recirculated, people emailed us, saying that it was our</em> <strong><em>political obligation</em></strong>  <em>to write that David Bowie had been a rapist, even a pedophile, too.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Just a point of interest, David Bowie had quite a few songs with space/celestial-themed titles: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iYYRH4apXDo"><em>Space Oddity</em></a>; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dLYafk0Lui0"><em>Ziggy Stardust</em></a>; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tRcPA7Fzebw"><em>Starman</em></a>; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLJ8y7DDcrI_piG-vQIQLOTe4q3zyxgzob&amp;v=v--IqqusnNQ"><em>Life on Mars</em></a>; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LaqMwE5NKaM">Moonage Daydream</a>; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kszLwBaC4Sw">Blackstar</a>; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gH7dMBcg-gE">The Stars are Out Tonight</a> I don\'t know if this is meaningful to our cause HERE, but, to me, this <em>micro-theme</em> seems noteworthy.</p>
<hr />
<p>I liked some of Bowie\'s songs a lot, but I now realize (all these years later), I was just hearing the music, and never <strong>listening</strong> to the <strong>LYRICS</strong>.  Following, are some links to some of his MANY <em>products</em>, and to the lyrics, with some excerpts. </p>
<p>Four months ago, I wouldn\'t have thought about David Bowie, or the lyrics to his songs, in any depth. To me, he was just a pop-culture icon (with a bit of a questionable reputation), a huge presence on radio, and his hits were covered by bar bands galore. Even if I had payed attention to the lyrics years ago, I wouldn\'t have gathered any potential of reference to <strong>real harm</strong> towards humanity. And, even if I did, I\'d have dismissed it as <em>poetic creativity</em>, outside of my capacity of (and interest in) understanding. If I had known the word &quot;esoteric&quot; back then, I\'d have used that word to describe this art, without knowing the negative connotations that word brings, today.</p>
<p>Make of these, what you will: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Stars are never sleeping, Dead ones and the living... They watch us from behind their shades, Brigitte, Jack and Kate and Brad, From behind their tinted window stretch, Gleaming like blackened sunshine. ... Their jealousy\'s spilling down.</em> <strong>The stars must stick together.</strong></p>
<p><em>We will never be rid of these stars, ... And they know just what we do, That we toss and turn at night. They\'re waiting to make their moves, ... Here they are upon the stairs, Sexless and unaroused. They are the stars, they\'re dying for you, But I hope they live forever.</em> ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They pulled in just behind the bridge. He lays her down, he frowns, &quot;Gee my life\'s a funny thing, am I still too young?&quot;. He kissed her then and there. She took his ring, took his babies. It took him minutes, took her nowhere. Heaven knows, she\'d have taken anything</em> ...</p>
<p><em>All the way from</em> <strong><em>Washington</em></strong>, <em>Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor. We live for just these twenty years. Do we have to die for the fifty more?&quot;...</em></p>
<p><em>And,</em> <em><strong>ain\'t there a child I can hold without judging?</strong> Ain\'t there a pen that will write before they die? Ain\'t you proud that you\'ve still got faces? Ain\'t there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Pressure pushing down on me, Pressing down on you, no man ask for, Under pressure that burns a building down, Splits a family in two, Puts people on streets</em>. ...</p>
<p><em>It\'s the terror of knowing, What this world is about. Watching some good friends Screaming, &quot;Let me out!&quot; ... Turned away from it all like a blind man, Sat on a fence but it don\'t work. Keep coming up with love but it\'s so slashed and torn. Why, why, why?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Fame, makes a man take things over. Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow. Fame, puts you there where things are hollow... Fame, it\'s not your brain, it\'s just the flame, That burns your change to keep you insane...</em></p>
<p><em>Fame, what you like is in the limo... Fame, &quot;Nein! It\'s mine!&quot; is just his line, To bind your time, it drives you to crime... What\'s your name? [whispered:] Feeling so gay, feeling gay? Brings so much pain?</em></p>

            Some have wondered whether the whole degenerate music scene from the 60s (or actually 50s) onwards was a creation of multiple governments working together to rot away the moral foundations of society, and that many of these musicians were actually under mind control from the get-go. This is starting to look like the likeliest explanation in light of the current knowledge.*****BINGO. This is it.  This is what they have been doing for decades and still are doing.  We are finally waking up. EDIT: Time to wake the kids and grand kids up too.

             "I'm a Blackstar, not a gangstar, not a filmstar"
Not sure what Backstar means in this context other than perhaps that he himself has the eye anomaly(extra black in the eye?) but he seems to be telling us that he is not a part of the gang(of kidnappers) or in any of the films(CP or snuff). Think about it, he was in several films, so how could he claim to not be a filmstar?
