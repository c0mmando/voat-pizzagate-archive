&quot;Kenneth Freeling, a former Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf partner who became of counsel at Covington &amp; Burling in Washington, D.C., died Thursday in New York. He was 59.&quot;
I remembered Covington &amp; Burling (Eric Holder/Loretta Lynch) and am listing some voat references in this thread: Covington &amp; Burling works with and shares offices with (since 2009) Institution Quraysh for Law &amp; Policy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_Quraysh_for_Law_%26_Policy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_Quraysh_for_Law_%26_Policy</a>
&quot;In 1988, Covington opened a London office, followed by a Brussels office in 1990. In 1999, Covington merged with a 60-lawyer New York firm called Howard, Smith &amp; Levin and also opened its first West Coast office in San Francisco.[7] In 2008, Covington entered into a strategic alliance with Institution Quraysh for Law &amp; Policy (iQ), a Qatar-based transnational law firm and think-tank, for the joint provision of legal and consulting services in the Middle East. As of mid-2009, both firms share the same London office premises. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covington_%26_Burling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covington_%26_Burling</a></p>

&quot;According to this Politico article (<a href="https://archive.is/W1b6r">https://archive.is/W1b6r))</a>)), the grand finale of the Africa trip was a lavish CGI meeting in Marrakech, which was funded to the tune of at least $1 million from the Moroccan state-owned phosphate exporter OCP (formerly called the Office Chérifien des Phosphates).One of OCP\'s stated goals is to export more phosphate to other African countries for crop production. (They would use shipping containers for that.)
&quot;The company was connected with the Clinton Foundation by longtime Clinton supporter Stuart Eizenstat, a senior counsel at the powerhouse law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP, which represents OCP in Washington....
&quot;During Clinton’s State Department years, OCP... paid a Covington team led by Eizenstat $760,000 to lobby Congress and federal agencies – including the State Department – according to Senate lobbying filings....&quot;

            This is great stuff! I think there will be suicides coming from the law firm Hogan and Hartsman, now Hogan Lovell, as well.  This is the firm in DC that a lot of the big names had worked.  Loretta Lynch, Cheryl Mills, Goldstar father from DNC debacle, Khyzir Kan, and the list goes on and on.  They have been wrapped up with the govt. for years and years.
