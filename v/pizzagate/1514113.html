            Personal encounter with Acorn pimp. That particular summer I really needed a part-time job. I answered a help wanted ad to work with a team standing outside Walmart to register citizens to vote. Showed up the 1st day of work and met my coworkers but the Acorn rep was a no show.  Also he hadn't bothered to contact Walmart to get approval for us to stand outside and register prospective voters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Furious I called Acorn HQ in FL and was completely blown off. Then I got a follow-up call from the man who hired me. He made a lame excuse about getting in a car accident as an excuse of why he didn't show at the agreed upon time. All of my basic questions about the damage to his vehicle were blown off.
           </p>
           <p>
            He did offer to meet for coffee and discuss the job when I told him he should have called Walmart and gotten approval. I asked if he intended to reimburse by time and $$ for the wasted morning as well as more for a 2nd meeting when I wouldn't be earning money. I then called FL again and asked why they would hire a blatant fraud and liar. We could have landed in jail for standing outside Walmart talking to people without the company's express permission.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I got a call back from a woman who said not only was the man a fraud and liar but he was definitely a pimp which is why SHE had quit working for ACORN when she found out the job wasn't just registering citizens to vote. The invitation for coffee was really supposed to be a solicitation for me to do another job entirely.
           </p>
           <p>
            Long post I know but there's your proof ACORN is a "bait and switch" rip-off FRAUD.

             That's what the ACORN in Ca was accused of doing. Supposedly there was a pimp who Breitbart had proof/videos of BUT everything was debunked. Kind of makes sense why everyone is so anti Breitbart news since he was known for outting our government. Of course they're going to point their fingers and accuse him of false info. It's all so ironic especially that he died at such a young age, most 43 year olds don't die from heart complications.

              I didn't have regular computer access at the time and so I was totally unfamiliar with Breitbart. Believe me to this day I wish I could expose ACORN for what happened to me. When you're broke as I was at that particular time (different from present day) it's terribly unfair to spend any $ on transportation as well as your time and energy getting to a promised job only to be totally scammed. I was never reimbursed by ACORN in FL. I was only given totally phony excuses. In NV they don't have to legally reimburse who for PROMISED work even if you are given a time and location to show up IF you don't actually perform any job duties.
             </p>
             <p>
              I never felt those in ACORN to whom I talked took my complaint seriously either and believe me I can be very persistent. The response, "Well maybe this job isn't for you," was extremely insulting. Then the follow up call calling out the supervisor for being a pimp with a hidden agenda made a lot of sense to me. However she couldn't explain why ACORN still employed the man except to say he was cheap to employ as an independent contractor.
