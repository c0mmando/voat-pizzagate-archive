<p>In light of the tweets that have been deleted in the last few days I think that is evidence of some type of cover up.  Let\'s find at least some of them. </p>
<p>We all know that, even if we are careful with our own data, others with access to it can let it be seen or leaked. Intentionally or inadvertently. </p>
<p>So chances are that some of these deleted tweets have been archived by someone. Our objective is to dig in those crevices where things can be forgotten. </p>
<p>Using simple key word searches, we are going to dig thru the archives.  Tweets are our primary objective, but don\'t neglect those other goodies like tumbler, FB and instagram, to name a few. </p>
<p>We are looking primarily for posts or comments in the timelines that others have established (May, June, July, 2016) but don\'t limit yourself to this.  
</p>
<p><strong>Here\'s what you do</strong></p>
<p>Step 1. Use any archive service such as archive.is or web.archive.org, tweetsave, or any you are familiar with. Choose a person to search for. </p>
<p>Step 2.  Type in the twitter (instagram, etc.) handle of the person in the archive machine and see what pops out. (I did <a href="https://voat.co/user/dwstweets">@dwstweets</a> in archive.is. I\'ll show you my results in a minute.)</p>
<p>Step 3.  Review your results. Is there something relevant you have found? Tweets, news articles that are older and may not have been seen, shared posts, pinterests pins?</p>
<p>Step 4.  Copy the web address from the browser and paste it into any note taking app. (Notes or word, etc.)</p>
<p>Step 5.  Make notes for really important ones next to the link. (I.e. Palmieri tweet 7/11/16) so people can grab the hot tips if they don\'t have time to read through all your research. </p>
<p>Step 6.  Copy and paste your notes into the comments section below. State briefly up front who you searched and what database (i.e. Archive.is).  This is to allow others to go a different direction that hasn\'t been covered. </p>
<p>Step 7.  Optional. You can also just search a twitter handle on google too. You must remember to archive anything you find on google before you post your results to voat. </p>
<p><strong>Images:</strong> sometimes a screen shot is all you get. Load them into imgoat.com or other image host. Make a backup in archive.is or other archive service of the URL web address for the image. Post the archive link to your notes. </p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>put in two different twitter handles and search. </p>
<p>Use the dash - (minus sign)to exclude search terms. For example, using -2017 along with the twitter handle will knock off some of the recent stuff. It\'s not perfect but it helps. </p>
<p>What follows is a couple of hours work. I searched mostly for <a href="https://voat.co/user/dwstweets">@dwstweets</a> in archive.is. I also searched &quot;Debbie wasserman tweet&quot; and got some different results. </p>
<p>You got to be willing to look thru the results patiently and go beyond the surface. You might miss something good on page 4 because you stopped on page 3 of results. </p>

           In light of the tweets that have been deleted in the last few days I think that is evidence of some type of cover up.  Let's find at least some of them.
          </p>
          <p>
           We all know that, even if we are careful with our own data, others with access to it can let it be seen or leaked. Intentionally or inadvertently.

           We are looking primarily for posts or comments in the timelines that others have established (May, June, July, 2016) but don't limit yourself to this.

          </p>
          <p>
           Step 3.  Review your results. Is there something relevant you have found? Tweets, news articles that are older and may not have been seen, shared posts, pinterests pins?

            Tips:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           put in two different twitter handles and search.
          </p>
          <p>
           Use the dash - (minus sign)to exclude search terms. For example, using -2017 along with the twitter handle will knock off some of the recent stuff. It's not perfect but it helps.
          </p>
          <p>
           What follows is a couple of hours work. I searched mostly for
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/dwstweets">
            @dwstweets
           </a>
           in archive.is. I also searched "Debbie wasserman tweet" and got some different results.
          </p>
          <p>
           You got to be willing to look thru the results patiently and go beyond the surface. You might miss something good on page 4 because you stopped on page 3 of results.

            The mother deleted it herself.  She is scared to death.  She is afraid he is stalking her child.  Many people are slamming her, but I can understand how frightened she must be.  This guy is dangerous and I believe he has power behind him or he would not be so in your face nervy.  Did you see all the pictures of children in his "family".  Where are they from?  They only wife he had discovered she was either bi or a lesbian.  I think he could possibly be selling these children for sex or worse (both are awful).  We will get back to him again.  Check him out some more if you like.

             Great job everyone!!
            </strong>
            If you want to archive the archives and not post the new result, that might counter the scrubbing and preserve some really important finds. Screenshots that can be uploaded later to image sites are also good backups. Pdfs should be downloaded locally when possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone is connected to the 4/8 chans that might can get more eyes on our results and get important stuff up to the good guys in D.C.   Please share.
           </p>

            Bad idea. They own the copyright to their tweets and can use the Digital Millienium Copyright Act to issue a takedown request to the archive site and force them to remove it. That's how all the Alefantis and friends' Instagram and Facebook stuff was sealed up. Only do it if you've downloaded a copy of the material locally that only you control and can re-upload it.

             Philippe Reines, very close Hillary confidante. He should be on the list.
            </p>
            <p>
             Philippe I. Reines (born November 25, 1969) is an American political consultant. He joined the Department of State as a Senior Advisor to Hillary Clinton when she became United States Secretary of State in January 2009,[1] and in 2010 was promoted to the position of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications.[2][3]
            </p>
            <p>
             Reines is currently a Managing Director at Beacon Global Strategies LLC, which he founded with partners Jeremy Bash and Andrew J. Shapiro in 2013.[4][5]

               Awesome. We gotta get Robby mook Jennifer Palmieri and the rest of the other motley crew. How about the police? Should we run their names through this too while we are looking? Anyone recall names?  How about the respondering officers on record? Think they inside joked about it?

            Some people will have retweeted their tweets.  Is there any way to find these?  And they will have replied to tweets they received - will these still exist?  Can they be tracked down?

             It works like Voat, as in if someone deletes a tweet it's deleted in all conversations.

              When you check her twitter account right now you only see tweets from april 2017 until now. So what is true..I think you did a great catch finding her other tweets which are not visible at this moment on her account. Can you archive the tweets you found?

                No, I do not have any of those emails.  Unfortunately.  The leak of all those accounts through NGP VAN was a set up. I believe Amy Dacey could have been the person behind this whole scheme.  The person fired by the Sanders Campaign was recommended to the campaign by the DNC.  When all the accounts were  able to be viewed it was never explained that ALL accounts could be viewed, even the Bernie Donors. Little did they know that those polling places would also be exposed.  That was the whole point of the leak so that the Clinton Campaign could see Bernie's Donors.  Many Bernie Donors complained afterwards that they received Clinton request for dollars after the leak of accounts.  They then had it in their plans to blame the Bernie people which due to DNC rules shut down their donations for a few days.  They had to go to court to get the shut down removed. Remember that the Clintons are always good at pointing their fingers while they are doing the same.

                  From Wikipedia: Its current president and CEO, Stuart Trevelyan, was a veteran of the 1992 Clinton-Gore War Room, providing research, analysis, and whip counts to the Clinton Administration as a member of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs.[6  They keep the same people because they have the dirty goods on them. Yeah Utretski was placed into the Bernie Campaign.

                        You mean about the pedo guy?  Did you clink on the title of the post?  It takes you to Pizzawhatever.  Then there is a link and you can see a picture of a guy with a child that is naked (It's Ok it is his backside you see).  This guy is a real sicko.  I searched and found info. We have his Instagram.  He takes women's children and then grooms them.  There is also a little video of a little girl sleeping that he took.

                  Could be.  I remember that he was with NGP VAN.  The guy at the head of the outfit was with Hillary from her first campaign.  Remember once they are tainted, they never leave, unless they want you to.  I think Amy Dacey became so enraged at Seth at first was her plan to expose the Bernie Donors had also exposed the bogus polling places.  Double Rage.

                It seems that yes, since Seth worked for Dacey, she reported to Palmierie (report from 4chan) and Palmierie reported to Podesta.  That prompted the line in the email about making an example of a certain whistle blower.  Then they made the plans.  I believe also (and this is just a wild stab in the dark) that Dacey might have had something to do with Sean Lucas as well.  This Matt Couch says he thinks it is odd that no one at Lou's City Bar has come forward to say anything about seeing Seth Rich there.  There have not been any interviews either of patrons.  I am wondering if the bar was stocked with fake patrons, just in case they were interviewed?  I find it very odd that on a Sat. night with the place crowded that there has been nothing heard from anyone of the patrons (aside from the employees).
