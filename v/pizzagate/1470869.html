            Hey well that's progress! Nice job. Before you know it, he'll be convinced of another large detail. Slowly but surely, he just might come to the realization that there is way more than enough info here to warrant major concern.

            These are really good suggestions to get the word out. I love the initiative that you've shown personally. I was reading through this post thinking, "wow, we could learn a thing or two from op".

            Keep up the good work, and final thing I'd like to say about Colbert selling us down the river is, hey, fuck it! Even bad publicity is good publicity.

             Well, on the bright side, what happens is that we have a movement of energy that acts as an catalyst to the process of people waking up. It also polarises news by uncovering that the establishment is not only a criminal racket, but on top of everything, a criminal racket rooted in the darkest of dark places.

             Corbett's description of #pizzagate says more about him than anything else. Wonder about Siebel, going to check.  As things develop, more and more "alt-pundits" are loosing their camouflage.  Most of them turned out to be controlled opposition, or plainly stupid. Or both.

             What most call reality are perceptions managed by a host of stakeholders whose only commonality is their disinterest in the value of you as a person.

            I have yet to see one MSM mention of the Pedosta's taste in art. It was one of the things, along with the creepy Instagram pictures and comments, that got me to start thinking of the code language in the emails more  contextually.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let them put some of that fucking artwork on the air and see how people would react.

             Also the insanely graphic images and text captions on the walls of comet ping pong. Oh you know, totally appropriate stuff for a family pizza joint, like, "shut up and fuck"!

            I will send info to some of the lesser named MSM/social media outlets. I want trail of facts, no speculation on pics and  unless you have proof of what they mean. In which case I want links and pics of that. This isn't about a pizza shop it's more than that, and only using that as your source that this is real will get disregarded and laughed at. I want the money trail, connection between people, articles of wrong doing (esp from MSM, as to discredit their argument.) This is a world wide epidemic that needs to be disclosed. I want it all to come down and am will to be the messenger.

            Colbert lost the public's trust. This means that at this stage, anything he says will be considered wrong by most Americans.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not a new trope, it is an old one. I would argue that the best way to get this out, is via sports. Mention Sandsuky.  Talk about how if that can get covered up there, what else is going on?
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedo coaches are a huge problem, the newest bit is with British soccer teams.
           </p>
           <p>
            Start in the sports communities. They tend to be right leaning, so they would not be so fast to dismiss this because CNN says it is fake.

            Did you see this sh*t yet? What lawyer in their right mind would let some reporter come interview their client in jail before being convicted for anything? Especially Cecilia f'ing Kang.

              People give the government too much credit for being clever at what they do and not enough credit for being behind an effort to undermine the power structure of our country to seize control of it. Distracted and overconfident minds. Do they not see us take out entire countries on a whim? They only believe that it can't happen here because they believe they're fighting for us.

            I think it might factor well in with what you're calling for here. We need to get more organized and more active, not just "slacktivism," actual physical activity.

             I think it is important we truly understand the psychology of what we need to do. Read the resource in that link...it pretty much outlines exactly how we should tackle this. We need to organize now...not just a lost fitted civilian investigation but a real organization bent on taking down pedo rings and corruption. This can go larger than we are now.

           <p>
            This past Thanksgiving I experimented with different strategies while I told my various family members about pizzagate. Since then, I"ve been refining the most effective tactic into something I'm calling the
            <strong>
             Morpheus Method
            </strong>
            because it follows the method Morpheus employed when he first describes the Matrix to Neo (here's the scene if you want to watch it:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/gDadfh0ZdBM">
             https://youtu.be/gDadfh0ZdBM)
            </a>
            ). Here's how I described the Morpheus Method to another Voat member yesterday.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             When Neo walks in, Morpheus doesn't just start shouting at him, "This world is a computer simulation and you're trapped inside. Also, you're The One prophesied to lead a human army against a machine army and destroy this whole mind-prison. If you don't believe me or disagree then you're human garbage."
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead, Morpheus first offers Neo a chair. Then he empathizes with him "Right now you're feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole." Then he starts with high level concepts "The matrix is everywhere, it is all around us." He describes how the Matrix is part of Neo's life when he references taxes, TV, etc. Eventually, Morpheus leads Neo to a point in the conversation where he must offer evidence of his claims and warns him before he does that there is no turning back.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            IMO, this is an effective way to discuss pizzagate with people.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              High-level concepts first, "pedo/cp rings filled with famous and powerful people exist (hollywood, elijah wood, corey feldman, jimmy saville, etc)."
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Then get into some evidence, "The Podesta emails have lots of weird emails that could be referencing pedo/cp."
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Then keep drilling down further into the rabbit hole with more credible evidence:
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The FBI keeps a log of pedo/cp symbols that were discovered in this pizza place's logo.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Alefantis' IG account (specifically the #ChickenLover picture).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Clinton Foundation operative (Laura Silsby) in Haiti getting charged by their gov't for child smuggling.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Monica Peterson murdered for investigating it.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Personally, I don't even touch the satanism/occult stuff. I've said since day one (check my comment history) that those aspects are a waste of time and effort for two reasons. First, satanism and the occult are not illegal (neither is cannibalism, really). Second, leading our distribution efforts with occult/satanism is the fastest way to delegitimize this research effort. Plus, it makes it very easy for people to dismiss this as another ridiculous theory. Since all researchers have at this point is circumstantial evidence, the Morpheus Method leads with the most convincing stuff first.

            Its going to be rough. I feel your pain. At Thanksgiving, I told myself that I wasn't going to bring this up because it was going to overwhelm whoever I talked about it to, but in conversation, I couldn't avoid it and spilled the beans. My perfectly sane and rational parents were obviously shocked by it all. I'm a very successful person career wise and from an educational standpoint. Ive never brought up anything like this to them. My mom was most receptive and started questioning things about it. My dad stayed silent most of the time taking it all in. It's usually opposite! After about 45 minutes of ranting and pleading my case, I had to stop. My mom said it was just too much to take in. I purposely stuck to the Podesta emails. I mentioned the Virginia missing children. Who can argue the fact that parents would never report a child missing and not submit a picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't focus on the Comet Ping Pong too much. I of course mentioned all of those building were using known pedophile symbols. I think thats a key point to the argument. I also menitoned the theory that if this is really going on, how it can be done using adoption agencies and other organizations that help children.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Average citizens" (as you say), aren't really going to catch on to this right now. For that reason, we need to spread the word to as many thousands as we can. If 9 out of 10 people dismiss it completely, you have to just keep trucking along and reach out to more people. I personally am not willing to fully annouce this stuff on facebook. It sucks, but I just wont. I am however going through  Twitter HARD and on Gab.ai just as hard. These QR codes are going to be my contribution to the movement! I'm going to distribute at least 10,000 myself. That's my goal.

            I hate to be partisan, but the left has spent years creating a base that is very accepting of anything that it's told. The election showed just how the country is divided almost equally into those who follow blindly and those who demand a voice and action. I do think events like pizzagate are pushing more and more people into doubting the establishment and media. Except people are too easily controlled by fear and terror. We're only one false flag away from marshal law and containment camps, I think.

             We are not, that would be to overt. The best method is not full authoritarianism but give enough freedom no one complains. Classical authoritarianism ended with the USSR and majority of its power was destroyed during WWII. In terms of partisan there is no left or right here they both are at fault. The party system is to binary and incorrect to plan political beliefs into a 1 and 0 sum observation.

            This is completely unrelated to political sides! Thorough research proves this was a major issue with the Bushes. Republicans might be even more guilty in this than democrats. I think in all honesty they are essentially all the same when it comes to this illegal stuff. They are regular people like you and I. They are just as susceptible to being blackmailed by others, to be greedy, to be dishonest, to be murderers, to be pedophiles/rapist. They are not immune to human flaws. I can't say it enough. They are regular freaking people! They are all caught up in the corruption and its never going to stop until we bring attention to it. This has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats!!!! Your BF needs to freaking understand that!

            I havent seen the clip yet but read an article. Did he actually start the segment by discussing the news and saying about his own show "News Flash: this isn't news!" (telling the viewers literally to not take his word) Then went on to tell the viewers lies about pizzagate?

            Thanks for the input. I still lean towards the no text option as well, however, text will absolutely have it's merits in other circumstances. I regularly talk to my wife about all of this, and feel like I have to introduce her to only small pieces. I NEVER want to risk bringing her down the full blown corruption rabbit hole where I have to spend an hour explaining a thousand pieces. I agree with how you said people will dismiss it if they think it's a conspiracy theory. The word conspiracy is soooo damaging to the facts. There's a conspiracy word that to this day, I won't say to anyone else, because also it's truly a thing, it will always label you as a nut. It makes my blood boil that everyone is so oblivious, but we have to face reality. People don't want to learn that their government is involved in this stuff. They just don't want to know! It's that sickening to alot of people....

            Find out for yourself. That way it doesn't feel like you're pushing something on someone. Just a thought. I'm going to print out 100 (or til my ink runs out, it's getting low)and see what happens

            I like your points , we need proactive people to lead . Not rely on trying to watch You Tube vids that grip us . We need to share the burden. You tubers are risking alot by what they do. And need encouragement and need to feel they are not the only ones putting there ass on the line. If people want to be useful but are worried about there reputation ,then do things annonymously , print oput flyers, and just leave them randomly around .
 Use your wits and feel part of a moral campaign that you can tell your kids ,when it comes out in years to come , you did your bit , when the world was against you ,you were one of the few that stood up ,Spartacus lol.  As long as you do things that are not a danger or could be construed in that way .

            It took me a few years after the event to get into 9/11. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't the press ignore "truthers" and various websites for at least three months or more?  It seems to me like the pizzagate issue was attacked heavy hammer style almost immediately.  It's like that wanted NO traction.  That amount of energy and co-ordination alone is waking people up.

            The more the MSM attacks the more in convinced. Keep records video and audio of all these detractors.  The next step is saying oops we jumped the gun, they cover the story and misdirected or neuter the outcome.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sort of like Alex Jones now saying we need to step back and look at the big picture that this is going abuse on everywhere.  Yea we know this asshat.  Now that we have pictures, video, names and so on it's time to do something.  Neutralizing through acknowledging then misdirecting.... that's the next step.

             It's pointless. Look at the top results for #Pizzagate and they're predominantly MSM or otherwise highly critical. Anything supporting our movement is being pushed down by their algorithms. Fuck Facebook, none of my friends or contacts are paying attention anyway.

              Don't give up. That's what they want us to do. They have the media, but we will have numbers if we just keep spreading. Sorry that those people don't care, but if you keep trying, you will find people who care. I've found many people who care just by talking about it. .

            Don't rely on social media alone people. Use QR Codes! After printing them, I am just cutting them up and placing them everywhere, sometimes just dropping them onto the floor. I think a more effective way to get someone to scan them is to placed them on the products sitting on shelves. If anything, employees will wonder why they are finding them everywhere and scan them. Hopefully customers scan them as well of course. I did this yesterday with about 120 QR codes. It's so simple. Sure you can get adhesive paper and stick them onto things, but this is something you can do RIGHT NOW. You have a printer.... you have scissors.... DO IT.

           <p>
            Let's get 10,000 of these QR codes out there!!!!

             I think we should print them with a click-bait type caption. Something along the lines of "The biggest  scandal of our lifetime is unfolding right now and your government does not want you to know about it"

              Somebody mentioned bank notes as well. Another one I just thought of is to change Wi-Fi and/or device names to something relevant, so people would see it when scanning for public networks - great for pubs because it could get the conversation going, even if they're debunking it at least it's hard to avoid.

               Yes. I've written the voat.co/v/pizzagate web address every single cash bill that I use, but I just don't use much cash. Also, you legally aren't supposed to write on money, so I think it's still a little harder to get the masses to participate in doing it. I just hand the side of the note face down where the writing is just in case someone says something. Honestly though, I've seen writing on money my entire life and have never had anyone refuse to accept it. Maybe a bank would as a deposit, but who cares about that, we don't want our message going straight to a bank where it gets stored somewhere for weeks or months. We want it seen NOW! Stick to QR codes. you can print thousands of them compared to using bank notes.

                Stick to small notes, larger ones are more likely to be checked for forgery. As to the notes going back to the bank, again they're unlikely to check the small notes - they'll just have a bundle and put it in a machine to count, so they probably wouldn't visually check them. An option is to hand them to small shops which have a small till float, so the chances are that the note would be given out as change during the same day. Public transport is also a good option, especially if they don't accept cards.

                 100% agree on the small notes. I used them when buying drinks the other day specifically thinking that they would be handed back out as change. That's the strategy that will work.

              Good point. I went really simple and just did it! I didn't put much thought into it, but my thinking was that out of pure curiosity, someone WILL scan these. I know that if I saw it in a store, I'd be wondering "is this a coupon code" or something like that. The mystery of it might grab as much attention as a clickbait phrase. What are your thoughts on that? Do you think it should be changed or would people still scan it?

               I think people will still scan it! Why not do both? We'll reach people looking for coupons AND people curious about what the scandal is. Also, I know nothing about qr codes. It's something I've always seen around but never bothered to learn how to do. How do I scan one?

                Yea both would be great. More importantly is just taking action. Do something. Since you seem interested, make sure to do this today. Don't put it off. Every single day new info is coming out. We may get hit hard one day with something that we can't bounce back from. Everyone needs to learn about pizzagate as soon as possible.
               </p>
               <p>
                To view a QR code, just download a QR code scanning app on your phone. After that, just launch the app and hold the QR code up to the camera as if you were going to take a picture. It instantly brings up the link to go to Voat. You then click on the link.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you want to create your own QR code, go online and search for "QR generator" (you can also download apps for it). The QR generator lets you create a QR code for literally anything. It's pretty amazing.

                 Thanks! I'm going to do that! I started a conversation on yik yak and have already taught new people about it and it's still morning! If we all just do a little, it ends up being A LOT. I'll do the QR codes if you download yik yak and just make a lil post every day or so to get people curious? it will only take about 60 s a day. Yik yak feeds are only affected by locals as far as i know, so shills can't easily intervene there. Let's double our efforts!

                  Awesome! It's getting my adrenaline going knowing someone else is going to do it. I printed 378 QR codes this morning and cut them out. When I leave work today, I have to run some errands anyway, so I'm going to put just little stacks of 5 or so EVERYWHERE in the store. I did it yesterday too, but only about 120 of them. I keep a stack in my palm and  just slide them out like if you were sliding out a stick of gum that way you're not reaching into your pocket inside a store.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I really think at the very least, the employees would scan the code. If I worked there and noticed them EVERYWHERE, i would be curious. Those are people that I would not have ever been able to reach via social media or whatever, so that to me is a huge win.

                   I actually tried posting some info sheets around my campus before thanksgiving break, but I feel like they all got taken down by janitors and stuff before many people saw them considering it was just bad timing and I feel like it was just too much to catch a passerby. Honestly, I really shouldn't even be on the internet right now w/ my finals coming up.. but after that I'm going ham on this.

                    Yea I know what you mean. This is pretty life consuming right now. That's a sign though that you're a rational human being. You know something is serious when you see it. I feel like we all need to reassure each other that this IS the most important thing going on in our lives right now.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The way that I see it, is that if this loses traction, there's no way that it will gain traction. We have been brainwashed our whole lives to assume that if a story goes away, it's not a true story. Everything thinks "Well if it was true, something would have been done". I can't even emphasize it enough. This is so important to keep talking about. I know that even if your entire family is murdered, time heals the wounds. The longer we drag this on, more and more people are going to get emotionally exhausted of researching it. We all feel it already. I've been so emotionally tied to this for over a month. It's draining. I'm not going to give up anytime soon though!!! Others might not be as tough! You NEED to find the time to stay on top of this even in between your finals. Instead of hanging around youtube, netflix, or whatever, spend the time here.

            Agree. Focus needs to be on the fact that pedophilia /trafficking is not a left/right issue. Also describing this issue as a 'Worldwide Citizens Investigation' has worked well when I introduce the issue to friends to make them aware. Also we should never use the term 'conspiracy theory' (stating the obvious there but needs to pointed out nonetheless), its an investigation and what is being uncovered needs official investigation by authorities.

            I used your "what are you doing ridiculing people who are trying to save kids from abuse" comment. I like all this. If they're shills it makes them look dumb, if they're real people it makes them consider what they're actually talking out against.

            I agree, but we can do this at the grass roots by infesting all social media and other online forums that reach the masses with targeted messages. Here is the idea: Use the comments section, under videos, postings, articles, etc. People read the comments, and it is a way to bypass the overt censorship they have started to employ of videos or postings. We can post these kinds of comments in any forum where we are trying to reach the masses (popular people who have a following and who generate a lot of comments). A great comment to plant would be something like:
           </p>
           <p>
            "#PIZZAGATE is NOT fake news. The media are lying to you to protect themselves and those in power while children are being abused. This is not a political issue. Check out

            Yet NONE of these people making fun of the investigation will air any of the damning emails or Instagram photos.  And we all know why that is.  THAT is the stuff we have to get out there, the obvious stuff they won't show.

             I'm not actually sure how we push awareness to these dastardly deeds and push for prosecution of these animals, if we can't put the images on TV? Besides, if someone with some clout picked up the story and ran with it, you'd have to think he was a dead man walking, right? This complicates things for us.

            Too much outrage can backfire and make us look like Alex Jones. Outrage is of course a reasonable response but it's not nearly as persuasive as mockery. Comments like "LOL you don't even know what pizzagate is. Why don't you actually do some independent research before you open your mouth and display your ignorance?" will be effective against most normies, I think.

            We need to counter ridicule. The MSM tactic is to make the average person too afraid of looking/feeling stupid to talk (or even think) about pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have a big enough movement going where we can play at this game, too. We need to make people feel too afraid to speak out
            <strong>
             <em>
              against
             </em>
            </strong>
            our position.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anybody who calls pizzagate "fake news" should be immediately targeted for mockery by multiple people. Take a ridiculing tone and call them
            <strong>
             <em>
              ignorant
             </em>
            </strong>
            and accuse them of
            <strong>
             <em>
              not doing any research
             </em>
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The average person will believe absolutely anything to fit in, and the MSM is relying on this. Beat them at their own game.

            This entire (let's call it ) investigation needs more organisation, from unified representation to the masses (like what do we show and how), to controlling our own trolls, who can be sometimes worse than shills.

            HC committed treason. She will be prosecuted, and will most likely go to prison (if she doesn't kill herself first.)
Go back and listen to the Erik Prince interview about the FBI getting Anthony Wieners laptop--listen to this with all the information we know now.

            The FBI and the NYPD already have everything on the Clintons. They can't go forward until Trump is in power. This entire thing is so much bigger than just "pizzagate". What good is taking down a pizza parlor, and a couple of pedos if the Clinton Foundation still exists to exploit mroe children?

            I feel you. I got a bit angry after watching that clip too. But they are doing us a favor in the end. It's not just PizzaGate anymore. Now it's "FakeNewsGate" - they are creating a whole new scandal on top of things. More lies and the truth will eventually come out.

             I'm just worried people will see that, google it and see the same fucking dishonest shit posts by nyt and wapo and call it a day. We need to influence where people are going to find out more when they hear about it. I agree that it still helps, I'm sure many fall through the cracks and find the actual evidence, but I'm just worried.

              And that will happen. I posted the meme on my FB timeline that the same media that said Hillary would win said Pizzagate was 98% a hoax. I got one comment, from someone who said "that's nuts, cause it's 100% a hoax" - I get angry that people are so flippant about it, I don't even want to debate. Because that's going to probably ruin whatever relationship I have with that person. People are just going to put their head in the sand.
             </p>
             <p>
              The media is giving people their one-line comebacks. Just like the SJWs had their "but he's a racist, misogynist, xenophobic asshole!" They don't have to think for themselves when they're been taught the exact words to say to people that talk about PizzaGate.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Oh you're bringing up PizzaGate? Fake news!" Instant response. Zero critical thinking. Impossible to discuss. Frustrating.
             </p>
             <p>
              But fortunately, I was one of those people and I came around. Took me a few years.

               Yes.  When people say 'that is 100% a hoax" -- you say, 'please prove that to me, because I'm not convinced'.

                Did just that. This was their response, "Because it is a pizza place. They sell pizza. There is no evidence at all that anything other than selling pizza is happening there. And the only people who are pushing the story are outlets that are known for spreading incorrect information and propaganda."

                 Yes.  But all they are going on is 'what other people have said'.  Ask them to show you proof that proves it is fake.    And remind them that it is the same msm which said Hillary had a 95% chance of winning which is now saying pIzzagate is unreal.  So who is the 'incorrect information outlet' really?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm not saying this will work all the time.  But if you push back to get them to produce their evidence, and to question their OWN sources, it can forces them to go find some actual research.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And if people are actually forced to go do research....viola...suddenly the evidence will be right in front of their faces (versus blindly following).  And people normally don't argue with their own evidence.

               Don't let it discourage you, please. That is their goal. Ask them what part of it is fake? All the evidence, emails, ig pics etc are 100% verified.

              Let the MSM shout and scream about "fake news", almost 70% of Americans don't believe their propaganda anyway so the only thing they achieve is to draw attention to Pizzagate and make more people look into it for themselves.

              I think our best option for that is to get the infographics or some of the meme/posters into the first google image search results as they show on a normal search.

                 Sorry.  I'm super low tech, but want to do this.  Can you write that again w/o the brackets (or maybe with steps).   I'm just very low tech and don't know what this means.  Thank you!

            Do not be discouraged. Through the entire Election, the mainstream propaganda continued to say that President Elect Trump had little to no chance of winning, in an attempt to dissuade his supporters to go to the polls and vote on a fruitless endeavor. That didn't happen. Almost every poll shows how much distrust there is between the American people and the mainstream propaganda. This current push against "fake news" and labeling PizzaGate as debunked is their attempt to get out in front of the story, and controll the conversation before it gets too popular. They knew that it was gaining too much momentum on Social Media, even after the censorship, and they couldn't stop it, so they had to undermine its validity. This tactic is nothing new, and has been used by propagandists for centuries. It is even well documented of propagandists intentionally leaking scandals before they became public to be able to have control over the information, and the timing of the release. The more they talk about it, and the bigger stink they make, the more it turns people onto the topic, and allows them the opportunity to perform independent investigation (because again, they don't believe the mainstream propaganda anymore). These hit pieces aren't hurting the investigation, just like they couldn't stop President Elect Trump using the same tactics.
