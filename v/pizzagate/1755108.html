            !!!  So you have Lake Forest and the rash of suicides by train and the claim that Epstein frequented the Lf train station. Well remember how I told you that.... well plainly put, LF is Waspy whereas the town I live in is almost entirely Jewish. Both burbs = lotsa $$ and are mere miles from one another, which means that I'm sure Epstein has acquaintances around here.  Now get this, here in Highland Park is where Aaron Swartz is from. You know, the kid who co-created Reddit among other things and committed suicide to avoid the criminals charges by MIT; although, it's been suggested he was murdered because of the CP he'd found on MIT's servers. Interesting to say the least. Related, maybe or maybe not. Freaky cause it's so close to home!!!

            There is a network that links from Chicago all the way up through Wisconsin. Much is hidden by secret societies, mafia connections, and business groups that don't want negative press on the area, but make no mistake, Racine is full of pedos, satanists, freemasons, and extreme corruption. It is one of many epicenters of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, but it stands out due to the unusual levels of corruption tied to national and global groups including the Clintons, Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. There are direct ties to people in the Stratfor emails, direct ties to the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, and many ties to the corruption and Pizzagate rat lines in Chicago, Milwaukee, the Quad Cities, Pennsylvania, Denver, DC, Haiti, Ghana, Norway, UK and other areas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just this week the mayor of Racine John Dickert resigned amidst widespread allegations of criminal corruption and abuse. They are trying to cover it all up and move some of the sloppy criminals out of the picture. This closely follows the resignation of his cousin the city administrator, the resignation of the city attorney, and the resignation of the District Attorney - all of whom are involved in extreme levels of criminal corruption and were sloppy about it. The last mayor resigned due to being caught red handed in pedo crimes, and the last city administrator resigned following accusations of corruption and sexual harassment. Many others involved have resigned, change positions, moved away, or ended up dead. Racine has a history of brutal deaths and ritual sacrifice including murders of prostitutes at the county club, car trunks filled with blood, judges that end up in the river, girls who are abducted and tortured, and girls who are mutilated to death from stabbings. Racine also has high profile executives engaged in pedo crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            The newspaper is involved. Secret societies are involved. The mafia is involved. Officials are involved. Businesses are involved. Non profits and foundations are involved. Clubs are involved. Racine has a network of underground tunnels, and full control over quiet harbor and airport with a corrupt and complicit police force. It is closely linked with the Knights of Pythias that includes Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, Robert Byrd and other notable names, as well as the Pilgrims Society and groups linked to viruses, vaccines and trafficking. Everything in Racine links to Agenda 2030 and the local and global networks being investigated by George Webb (following the work of Gary Webb, Monica Petersen, Michael Hastings, Seth Rich, and others).
           </p>
           <p>
            The scariest part is that the FBI knows all about the corruption in Racine, Wisconsin, and Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Kadzik, and Loretta Lynch stonewalled the investigations at the same time they did the same thing with the Clinton Foundation and private email server investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the FBI and DOJ do not care about criminal corruption, trafficking, bribery, death threats, stalking, retaliation, bid rigging, extortion, embezzlement, murder, and other heinous crimes - what do they care about? This is Paul Ryan's district. Why is Trump not removing the corrupt actors from the FBI, DOJ, CIA and other agencies, and why is he not commanding full investigations and indictments?
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the FBI and DOJ have been exposed as corrupt, and our government officials cannot be trusted to do the job they took a sworn oath to do, we have to take another route to expose it all. That is being developed now while more complaints are filed by various witnesses to the extreme corruption in Racine. More information will follow as soon as possible.

             Back during the time of the Chicago tunnel flood (early 90's) I was working briefly for a company that did asbestos removal.  We were in the 3rd lower basement level of Marshal Fields on State St.  The tunnels had flooded, which flooded the buildings' basements.  So, while we were down there, removing wet asbestos, the water had since left the tunnels and workers from various companies would walk around in them, to check them out.  Some folks walked a few miles south, to the China Town area.  There are coal tunnels down there that were used almost 100 years ago, to transport coal (bootlegged liquor and other things) all the way out to the far suburbs.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would not surprise me if some of these tunnels were still in use and open, and went for 50-100 miles from the city.

            , another interesting tidbit is that between Lake Forest and Racine is Antioch, which sits right along the IL/WI border.  Been there many, many times to snowski, etc.... nothing out of the ordinary about this place except that a couple of years ago I ran across info while researching Johnny Gosch/MK Ultr, etc.... something having to do with someone called the Snake Lady.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google "Snake Lady of Antioch."  You'll see what I mean, as it refers to another rash of teenage suicides from years ago.

             The Snake Lady operated in Racine and Kenosha and other surrounding areas, in connection with Michael Aquino. The train deaths were not all suicides. This is a known tactic - see the Wikileaks attorney for a recent example. We are digging into more connections to the snake lady that tie in with organ harvesting and trafficking.

             Racine is also a sanctuary city with many gangs and undocumented immigrants, with major drug and human trafficking problems, a completely corrupt and complicit police force and district attorneys, and a history of satanic groups, secret societies and unusual "unsolved" murders for a community of its size. Many wealthy people end up in Racine for dialysis and transplants, and healthcare groups have known ties with the mafia and secret societies. Even a dermatologist group was recently exposed as running a drug trafficking operation. Everything is quickly covered up to avoid exposure.

             What is happening in Racine, Wisconsin is frightening. Anyone who asks questions is immediately targeted, threatened, slandered, abused, discriminated against, and retaliated against in any way possible. Gang stalking is commonplace. If people really want to solve Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, they should help put the spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin. It is an unusually active swamp of corruption and pure evil.

             , Wow! I just scrolled down to see the post about Tina and her seeking protection from "the witch." My guess is that it's all related to my above post about the Snake Lady from Antioch. From what I remember reading in the article, the Snake Lady of Antioch situation involved mind control.

            I know there was that guy that liked to rant about RACINE, WI, so, the Lake Forest train (Metra) goes all the way north to Kenosha, which is just a few minutes south of Racine.  Just some info.  Could be totally worthless.
