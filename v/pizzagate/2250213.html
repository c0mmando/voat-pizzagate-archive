            This looks like another distraction to me. It takes away from the issue at hand and it serves to divide us and have us attack each other. Anything that has us attacking each other is a waste of time and serves to help those we are trying to bring down.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that if a post looks to be politically slanted or religiously slanted, we should just move along and not give it attention. The only right or wrong is that which exposes the perpetrators and saves children.

            First off "garouwarrior", your name hints at a possible motive in writing this long divisive piece which attempts to stereotype evangelicals. A garou is a white werewolf in Gaia's apocalyptic legend. I'm left wondering if you are a wolf in sheep's clothing, full of false concern shilling, and using this inflammatory post to divide and/or distract us from the main investigation. Or are you an individual who has your own bitterness issues with Christianity?
Secondly, you are mistaking what you think is an evangelical trait, with an "Old Southern Culture" trait. My Grandparent were married after WW II. He was a young 19 year old Kentuckian when he enlisted and she was a strong willed 15 year old church girl who was sweet on him when they met at church. Dating was different in that Southern Church culture. "Dates" were sitting on her porch together with her father (and his shotgun) close by in the front room, or going out on group dates. This was to protect them both from each other and to protect her reputation in a small southern town. They married when he returned from the war and were together 60 years until his death. Dating today on the other hand is way too carnal, kids regularly have multiple sex partners, and girls are expected to "put out"- matter of fact Teen Vogue wrote an article encouraging teen girls to have anal sex this year. Teen Vogue's staff would have been arrested in those days- or worse, tarred and feathered!  Even poor Hillbillies didn't tolerate their daughters being messed with before marriage (Where do you think we got "Shotgun Weddings" from?)
Lastly, no evangelical dad I know, including myself, wants underage marriage for their kids. Donald Trump is an evangelical, and he calls for death sentences for anyone who traffics a child! Evangelical parents know Jesus's words of woe and warning for any fool who would cause a child to sin or do evil. He said it would be better for those men to tie a millstone around their necks and to be thrown into the sea!
           </p>
           <p>
            So whether intentionally or unintentionally, your article is divisive because it unfairly attacks an entire religious culture. I'd imagine there are a lot of evangelicals and Catholics on this site investigating Pizzagate. As well as Jews, Buddists, Wiccans, Agnostics, and Athiests, We are united in one driving passion- to save all of our kids from these Monsters.

            One of the reasons they want young wives is so they can dominate them.  It’s not just about sex with girls, it’s about controlling them by in essesence becoming second dad before they can develope their own sense of self and confidence in them self.  They are threatened by self assured mature women.

            I grew up in this world. I was born in it. This article is basically a hit piece on Christians. It is wildly inaccurate. It is also a hit on home schoolers, as if all home schoolers need supervision by the state or they will marry their children off at the age of 14.
           </p>
           <p>
            People home school to keep Child Protective Services and government out of their lives. Pedophiles do not like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Essentially this article is a veiled attempt to paint Christians as something close to pedophiles, written probably, by actual pedophiles themselves because true fundamental Christianity despises pedophiles, which is why pedophiles despise Christians.

            Those are lecture tour hacks and do not reflect fundamental christianity, at all, not really close. Many of these people are actually not even Christians but are actually planted in these roles by people that hate Christians. Some of them may be more similar to cults hiding under the Christian flag.

            The number of people that identify as "christians" that follow that logic are not fundamental christians. This is a very small group of people that actually practice, in real life, what evangelical preachers teach. They are a small cult masquerading as fundamental christians.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also churches that are snake handling churches that literally handle poisonous snakes to show their belief in God. They believe God will protect them from snake bite. These people are rare and not Christians. They are cult of crazy snake handlers.

            Not accurate. The subject just blatantly crossed the line between "evangelical world" and fundamental Christianity. Also tends to associate the word "fundamental" with extremism. One is not like the other.

             I dunno, it seems to corroborate an earlier submission about a 11 yo girl that was raped and forced to marry her assailant:

             This occurred in a conservative Pentecostal church.

             And most of the child marriages in the US do seem to correlate to areas of the country with the highest levels of conservative Christians/Mormons...

            It's not. Grew up in South and Baptist/ evangelicals. Never saw it. Never heard of it. It is prevalent in Mormonism/new age/masonic based churches.

              That train won't run correctly. Evangelicals are evangelicals.

            How do you know Roy Moore was a professing Christian and religious at the time he allegedly did these things, i.e. when he was young. Just curious. Too lazy to look it up right now. If he wasn't then this particular case can't be a reflection on evangelicals. I'm not defending evangelicals, too many phony Christians nowadays.

            From what has surfaced (and it's gone on for hundreds of years), this is far from correct. RC is a systemic institutionalized culture of secrecy which lends to this sort of, and other, degeneracy.

            I was a pioneer in the homeschool movement, in a pioneer county, where the DA was well-know for protecting homeschoolers. Children are homeschooled for the very purpose of protecting them from a sick society. Of course there are exceptions. There is nothing wrong w/ marrying young w/ parent's permission, including mutually agreeable "arranged" marriages. That's Biblical. Hollywood twisted our perceptions and views dating back to Romeo and Juliet, where it was fashionable and cool and romantic to rebel against superiors.

            Hollywood and music replete w/ this kind of backlash against authority. Listen to the song Saginaw Michigan, big country hit back in the day, same stuff, rebellion against parents who disapproved of a daughter's boyfriend and making the parents the fools and bad guys.

             Roy Moore was born in al, spent most of. His youth there, including his first 7 years.  It would be amazing if he wasn’t raised in a Christian church but he was certainly surrounded by the Christian mores of the time which forbid sex before marriage.  So while dating teens was not forbidden, undressing and inappropriate touching was

              These evangelicals of today make shipwreck of their ancestor's biblical teaching on the Jews. They err. The reformers of old taught that future Jews as a race (I don't buy the Khazar stuff) would turn en masse to the Messiah they rejected and killed. However, in the interim, "As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sake." Martin Luther found them to be incorrigible and deserted them. It's a complex and controversial subject. But yeah, John Hagee is a good example, he preaches the Jews are saved because they are "the chosen people," regardless whether they embrace Christ or not, which is heresy.
