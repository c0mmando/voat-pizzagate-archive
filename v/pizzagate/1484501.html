            I reside in a Muslim country. I can speak from first hand experience. The population here is 80% Sunni. We have Jews,Christians and many other religious sects as well. I live in a location where there are more churches than mosques. I frankly don't care about any of it. It is all a fairy tale to me. All religions are baseless lies. Because I can look back in history and all religious texts and come to the conclusion that it is all nonsense. It is my personal opinion.
           </p>
           <p>
            The witch-hunts and the exquisite and literally illegal lifestyles of the of the preacher/priest class in the dark ages is a testament to the scourge that we call religion. But make no mistake. If the people living in Middle East were all Christians, their life would still be the same. Any religion can be a vessel for the most disgusting acts. You have many Muslim countries in Eastern Asia, compare them with the situation in Middle East for once. A region that was meddled with foreign intervention for at least a century and beyond. With instigated coups, economical sabotage and blackmails on an annual rate almost. Those interventions clearly have their part in the current situation that is Middle East. Women in Iran were not obligated to wear hicabs or headscarfs just 60 years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The reason for my reaction against you was the needless arguments you spew in a forum that is dedicated for spreading information about potential child molesters who are masquerading as the pinnacle of human civilization. There are child molesters and criminals in the world. And sadly there will be in the future. But if those same people are presidents of nations and/or very famous and intellectual people around the globe. Then we have a serious situation here.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes there should be cultural revolution in the Middle East. Yes Islam needs a reform bla bla bla. Stop stating the obvious. And instead of bashing a group of people who are literally ignorant and powerless, and were also basically pushed into submission for accepting their role as the 'ENEMY OF THE WORLD' by the same media that is giving you #FAKENEWS, go to Washington D.C. and try to talk to your congressman/congresswoman.

            Those shitty terrorist attacks still don't compare to the shit the US inflicts on the Middle East, and shitty UK child rapist faggots selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, so that they can bomb Yememis and subsequently send their kids to a child trafficking ring, so that Queen Elizabeth can torture and murder them herself.

            You are a polarizing shill. The countries you are currently complaining about don't even claim to be the pinnacle of human civilization. Get a grip please. This has nothing to do with John Podesta and his wikileaks connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way as if every muslim regardless of his/her level of education or economical status will be a potential criminal. STOP SPREADING VERMIN please. 
This is nothing but a polarizing shill trash. This is not an insult . But a fact. Mark this name.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides, get this statistic and stick to it. More heads have been decapitated in mesoamerica than any other region of the world. In all times. The amount of human sacrifice and gore is prevalent even today with the Drug cartels killing more people than ISIS is. The death toll of cartels in the last decade is higher than the casualties of the Syrian Conflict. Stop talking about religions and people affiliated with them . PLEASE
           </p>
           <p>
            There is probably a muslim hating thread in voat somewhere. You are free to hate. Please go hate over there.

            Thanks all upvoaters its so necessary to state where we stand on these issues, IMO we shouldnt have to be labelled as "AntiMuslim" or "altright" for us to denounce the claims that we are.  Sucks that we have to be attacked like this in order to make our stance clear.

            Totally agree my cousin. As a Sephardic Jew, it really upsets me when I see this narrative of hateful comments to both my people, and to your people. I know for myself that if I have one free spare moment I am looking up things, and many nights my husband has to put my laptop on my nightstand because I will literally fall asleep while researching and trying to translate something or find something. My grandmother used to always say,"There are good and bad people in all races, religions, and orientations, we just have to sift through the assholes and bitches to find the good quality fruits of people." And then in a lighter note, she would make me eat copious amounts of falafel and hummus. This fight is for our children, grandchildren and for those of us that have been raped or molested. We owe it to these kids that someone does love them and care about them, and would do anything to protect them, even though we don't know them personally.

            All religions have probably an equal amount of rape, gore, murder, mischief and retarded non-sense within their holy books. Stop polarizing people .

            Yeah, and I were one of those shills, and I wanted to be able to downvoat, I'd do what you're doing and ask random people to give me upvoats I did not earn.

              It's very simple, islam is a corrupt and degenerate 6th century ideological, legal and political system. It really doesn't deserve the rights of modern religion and so... moslem. Does it make sense to you now goatfucker?

               Nobody fucks goats aside from whites. Animal fucking is common in Denmark, which is why it was only outlawed recently. You may be sick and twisted and subhuman, but the rest of us aren't. 
The Welsh also fuck sheep. The France fuck anything, especially children, along with the Brits, who do the same. The Germans are more normal, as are the Dutch. The latter two are civilized groups. 
Now, as for the religion (Islam) itself: it needs work, but with time it will get there and is no different to Christianity or Judaism.
              </p>
              <p>
               And again, nobody says moslem aside from Israeli subhumans. I have argued with many Israelis; they all use that method of spelling. Its a play on Arabic. "Moslem in Arabic means"one who is evil and unjust" - See more at:

              <p>
               Used predominantly by salty Israelis who know and understand Arabic who are mad that the rest of the world calls them out on their savagery. I've argued with EDLers, Neo Nazis and white supremacists, and they always use muzzy, muzzies or muslims. Never Moslem.

                  moslems by definition are ALL pedos. Period.  And if they aren't personally fucking 6 year old girls they sure as fuck aren't going to say anything bad about the practice. Can't insult muhamAss!! And that makes the rest of them even worse; worse than a pedo you say? Yep, worse, they are pedo sympathizers.

             I have no problem with bashing or being a dick. I have a problem when shills do it in order to get the site shut down, or in order to make the investigation look bad. Call me a faggot no problem here, call me a faggot to discredit this website and the investigation and we have a problem.

              Just hover over my username and you will see that getting this site shut down is the furthest thing from my mind. On the other hand, when I see such blatant shitposting  like one I saw yesterday:
             </p>
             <p>
              Shill tries to discredit the Andrew J. Kline is the same guy shit... by posting pictures of two different guys with the same name. One of whom worked for Veritas and the other of whom works for...wait for it...the fucking FCC Not the DOJ. Then to solidify my disdain for your mods another post attempts to do the same thing today. Same fake guy as yesterday only this time it was linked to a University page. Where was the link to the DOJ? None of you all noticed it? Both of those posts got massively upvoated and accusations of shilling started flying in every direction. You are all scattered to the winds at this point and if you don't start achieving some results maybe it would be best if you found a new home.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't get me wrong, all of the Voaters that I have heard weigh in on this (myself included) are wishing you Godspeed, but if your mods can't pull it together the only thing that you will accomplish will be the destruction of our beloved Voat. You all are a hot potato.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: and yes, the moslems of all flavors are WAY involved in all of this shit. Fuck them.

             Thats because the mods started to censor them, now a mod came to this thread to say they will censor muslim related stuff as well. If it is a false lead the community should step in and downvoat, mods are supposed to be janitors not dictators as to what is acceptable to investigate.

             Those things are happening in Afghanistan, yes. 
And have been happening even when Alexander the Great marched his army over there and even before that. It is not normal and should not be tolerated. Yes. No question about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             But considering the average level of education and the economical status of the country, it does not really shock me that much. it does torment me. But even more sadly, it is to be expected in a country where boy-loving is still a part of the nomadic culture. Not to mention being plagued with the greatest percentage of opium/heroin addicts ever by a country. 
Some people over there never even heard of the concept of the nuclear family and other common traditions many people in the west take for granted. So as sad it makes me I can expect that from that part of the world and by some people over there. Not all.
            </p>
            <p>
             But if the same stuff is suspected from the most accomplished, respected and powerful people in the western world, then the reaction which we are rightfully displaying can be justified. Even more.
            </p>
            <p>
             The U.S. Soldiers are not only being told to look away from acts of pedophilia but also are told to look away from opium fields. Which is actually why NATO forces are still occupying that landscape. Since 2001 I might add. We are almost living the Second Opium Wars. With only the title missing. Waiting to be crowned when the dust settles. But that is really another subject matter and arguing about it will really not help the current cause.
            </p>
            <p>
             I really don't want to blur the waters more and arguing is the last thing to be pursued in this sub. But wanted to give my input on the matter.

             I'm not saying there isn't anything going on in these countries, but there have been posts that consist of nothing but hate speech in order to make us look bad. They use no sources (like yours) no evidence and prove no point, that's the problem, those posts can easily demonize us.

              "hate speech" are you the tone police? because that is also a D&amp;C derailing tactic. there are plenty of links if you want me to start going with them on Islamic, racist, predatory pedo grooming gangs in the UK.  political correctness is the reason why those crimes were allowed to go on, because the police and authorities didn't want to seem " Islamophobic". Saudi Arabia has been buying young girls &amp; sex slaves off Isis.

               Its not political correctness. That is a front and a blatant lie. The police were most likely having fun with the victims themselves, along with the town councils involved in the case.

              That kind of terminology makes you look bad.
              <br/>
              The term "hate speech" is used as a way to support and codify censorship and create an environment of thought crime.
             </p>
             <p>
              Speech is speech.
             </p>
             <p>
              To say that someone is using hate speech is to use words of escalation to otherise that person.
              <br/>
              Otherising is the fast way to inadvertently give validity to things you disagree with because instead of attacking the idea, you attack the person with the shrill cry of 'hate speech"
             </p>
             <p>
              If you wrote your comment without 'hate speech' it becomes much stronger and more compelling

             Reports like that aren't baseless, but they're talking about posts containing anti-muslim rhetoric without actual reports or evidence...not decrying any leads involving muslims categorically.

               They are. I am not being an idiot. Have you seen how useless and horrible at its job correct the record has been and is? You are telling me I don't understand divide and conquer strategies, while you are praising those morons?

                PizzaGate is not just right wing conservatives. They know they cannot just go full liberal when confusing us, as they won't antagonize the left wingers or centralists who despise the establishment in its current form. Nobody is praising anyone. I am letting you know that these people infiltrate both sides of the spectrum and have been doing it for a long time. Its right wingers who suck Israel's cock. Left wingers get bombarded by Hasbara and Clintards constantly. If you think shills aren't on both sides, you are not paying attention.

                  They know how people think. They spend millions researching this shit. The elite have power and have developed strategies for control. These strategies have been optimized over thousands of years.

                    We all did. We're figuring this out. Don't forget that it was Wikileaks that exposed all this for the general public. Before, everyone got silenced in some way. They've maintained control for so long, that they were bound to slip up, through their own arrogance. They thought they dumbed us down enough with their stupid media and flouride. They were a thousand years too early.

                    In other words, they got slapped by the Cock of the People.

                    Divisive tactics still work tho. Gotta be careful, because that's exactly what they will try with us. They're already doing it.

              CTR is creating false narratives to frame trump supporters and proponents of said narratives.  Clearly you're clueless.  Sounds you're just as much of a kook as the person I was talking about from reddit.

             SAUDI ARABIA AND THE INTERNATIONAL SEX SLAVE TRADE
            </p>
            <p>
             Saudi Arabia has long been involved in purchasing sex slaves. Up until recently, most of these slaves were purchased in Africa. With the advent of oil wealth the Saudi princes have been able to extend their slave purchases throughout the world. This has enabled the Saudi princes to become more selective and specialized in their tastes for slaves. The Saud family continue to be the prime purchasers on the international slave trade and are known as high end buyers. The Saudi Arabian Government continues to refuse to sign the United Nations treaties on slavery or other human rights issues because they do not want to be subject to their provisions. They will not sign extradition treaties even with Washington. They constantly declare they are free of slavery but will not allow international scrutiny. We will deal with the kidnaping of US male and female children by Saudi princes and their associates in this issue. We will substantiate the pattern of abuse using documented occurrence where the princes and their associates have been caught.
