<li>Jul 10, 2015 John asks Herb &quot;Hope the Vineyard is wonderful. Can you take a meeting with Teresita? She used to work for me at CAP, then went to law school, then Government. She and her husband (he also worked at the White House with me on global development) just moved to the Bay Area and she is looking to do work on financial inclusion. She\'s very good and I think would benefit from your advice.&quot;</li>
<li>Jul 10, 2015 Herb writes to John &quot;Everything has been fine, except that we missed you and Mary. We went on another boat ride with Chuck and Nancy Parrish. Bob Solow joined us. Lots of fun. He had a great line on the Greek situation which I will forward to you separately. Also had dinner with Skip, his daughter and her fiancée.

<h2>CHRISTMAS 2015, related emails</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dec 24, 2015 Herb thanks John and Mary on a Christmas present: &quot;I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of <strong>pasta and wonderful sauces</strong>, it was a lovely, tempting <strong>assortment of cheeses</strong>, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and <strong>grandchildren</strong> from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them. Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well. I miss you both Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Herb. Ps. Do you think I\'ll do better <strong>playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</strong>&quot;</li>

            Plays dominos on cheese or on pasta... what if dominos is a blanket term for kid fucking, and cheese and pasta are code for different drugs?  And what if "children and grandchildren" are code for child sex slaves?
           </p>

            For example: "Do you think I'd fuck kids better on meth than on heroin?"

            "Delightful assortment of ecstasy pills! Can't wait for my sex slaves to be delivered so we can take them!" Just a thought.

            "Sperling has directed significant amounts of his attention and financial resources toward extending the life span of human beings—research into life extension technology or "biological immortality". Wired magazine reported in their February 2004 article "John Sperling Wants You to Live Forever" that his fortune is quickly approaching US$3 billion, and has plans to donate it to human biology research if and when he dies. If he does so, this would be the biggest private program ever devoted to human biology. However, that is no longer the case and Sperling has indicated that his fortune will go to mainly environmental causes."

             I wonder if Mr. Wyss has taken a stronger role in the cloning business after Sperling's death. I guess these issues were on the table during the get together, and it's somewhat interesting that the death occured within the same dates. Both Wyss and Sperling were into cloning, Podesta has shown interest also with financial investments, how about the Sandlers then?

            Herb brings up dominos in the context of how he is spending his vacation.  Saying in a spooky narrator voice is not going to change that.  That's just trying to make this into an anomaly. It's not.  Guy like dominoes.  Did anyone say this guy was the most interesting man in the world?  No.  He's rich.  That's it.  Dude is 85 years old.  He's going to go parasailing?  Take up parkour? Dominos seems like plenty of excitement for him.

            I kind of know a very rich dude who gets his kicks from tortoises, lives in a big Manhattan loft with a whole giant room just for tortoises. Warren Buffet plays the ukulele.  Did you know that?   Guy could hire the best guitarists to do a private concert for him seven days a week and he plays the ukulele

If we're talking about a simple, stupid game of dominoes, as seemingly insignificant as a bowl of onion dip, then why all the pointed emails about it?

            Answer:   How should I know?  But he did. People do all sorts of stuff for all kinds of reasons.   So what?      Does that mean he found it necessary or that it was pointed?  No that is your predetermined feelings about these people. You're the reading so much importance into it.

            Also picking up on the odd bits that don't make initial sense is an aspect of conspiratorial thinking called anomaly hunting.  You ingore the whole of the evidence and focus on the odd parts.

He had a great line on the Greek situation which I will forward to you separately. Also had dinner with Skip, his daughter and her fiancée. He thinks you're great. Today-dominos.

Perfectly normal responses.   Dominos is the not the subject of this email and it's a complete misreading of it to claim that it is. But dominos now seem to be a part of Vineyard vacations.

            May I gently suggest that you employ some more skepticism.   Doubt, skepticism and questioning your own assumptions are at the heart of empiricism and valuable in an investigation like this.  Otherwise, you can fool yourself into believing the story you made up to fill in the gaps of what you know about the evidence.

            <p>
             An excellent question, and I value your skepticism. The domino-related emails have always raised red flags for me, because of the sinister nature of the people involved, the cryptic language, esp. the words "whipped", "demolished", "stimulating", and the fact that the very curious handkerchief map was found in the same house.

            Humans are prone to few cognitive glitches where our brains can trick us into believing things, even we don't take a good close look at the evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               this.  One is called confirmation bias and one is called evidence blindness.  Everyone is affected by these glitches.  It's because our brains have two ways of thinking fast and slow.  Fast thinking helps us figure out if that noise is lion coming at us.  Even if this wrong, it's more likely to keep us alive.  Slow thinking is how can I sharpen this stone to make a knife or an ax?   We need and use both, but sometimes we use the fast bit when we should use the slow one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new evidence as supporting an existing belief.  The people involved are sinister therefore they must be doing sinister things.   Let's say all the people involved were completely corrupt to their core.  Couldn't they also enjoy playing dominoes? If they said hey let's get together and play dominoes and then we'll go out for ice cream.  Would this mean they were speaking in code? Lots of folks have strong feels about Bill Clinton.  Bill Clinton also enjoys a card game my family plays called Oh Hell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evidence blindness is similar to confirmation bias, it's when you already have an idea in your head, so you ignore any evidence to the contrary.  For example these emails seem innocuous to me, but if you are convinced something sinister occurred, you would ignore this innocuous reading of the evidence.  The OP"s post is great example of both of these phenomenon.  What would be suspicious that Gate's daughter joined him on a family vacation?  Gates is 66 years old.   How old is his daughter?   I just looked it up, one is 37 and one is 35.
           </p>
           <p>
            You mention they used cryptic language like whipped, demolished and stimulating.   This is not cryptic language.  In each case the words are used exactly how you would expect people to use them, even if whipped and demolished are used in a figurative, not literal sense.  It's evocative language, but it's certainly not code.  My in laws play cribbage, "gave him a whipping" in a term they use if someone is beaten badly.  "Whipped 'em, skunked 'em."
           </p>
           <p>
            Another larger issue is that dominoes has sinister meaning for you?   Who said dominoes means domination?   There's no evidence of this prior to the Podesta emails.  In fact,
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b06px/dominos_domination_podesta_is_into_bdsm_with_kids/">
             we can pinpoint exactly when this started.
            </a>
            .  Someone on reddit using zero evidence and pure speculation said.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             What if Dominos is keyword for domination
Susan whipped Sherry and me at Dominos. Using the Podesta method, she made up the rules as we played.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Somehow this got accepted as fact and people use this all the time. Again there is no evidence for this prior to these emails already being released. This brings up another cognitive phenomenon, priming.  All the talk of code words, have primed you that something deceptive is going on and we have to decipher what they mean.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Can we also ask why the domino-related emails are part of the leaked Podesta emails? Could it be that the leaker knew these characters were up to some really evil things at MV and that is why he/she risked his/her life to bring these emails to the public's attention?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Now you're really reaching.  They are part of the leaked emails because they are part of the leaked emails.  You do know that over 20,000 of his emails were released?  You know why we are discussing a few dozen?  Because the political activist who combed through his emails were looking for things they could make look bad.  Basically something like 8 full years of emails was released.

            No one risked their lives.  And it wasn't one guy.  It's a team of hackers who are very, very well known to security researchers.   The group is known as APT 28.  Is that their apartment number?  No.  It stands for Advanced Persistent Threat 28. Security researchers regard them as a dedicated hacking group with nation-state support.  In addition to hacking John Podesta and other Democratic institutions like the DNC, the DCCC and others, they are responsible for the following attacks

            2014 six month long attack on German Parliament 
2015 destructive hack that almost bankrupted a French TV network
2015 an attack on the White House and NATO.  In this case, they spoofed the domain of the Electronic Freedom Foundation spearfish users to downloading malware.  same technique used against Podesta, but they spoofed a Google security alert
2016 they hacked the organization that test for steroids at the Olympics, the World Doping Agency
2016 hack of British organization researching the missile attack on a commercial flight over eastern Ukraine
2016 Democratic National Committee (2016)
2016 a hack of the Ukrainian army artillery.  Both the Russians and the Ukrainians use old Soviet military hardware.  They hacked the software controls and 80% of a particular model of howitzer was destroyed.

           <p>
            Looking at that list of targets and knowing that this group operates out of Moscow is why Security Researchers have identified this group as being sponsored by the GRU.   The DNC was also hacked by APT 29.  APT 29 is believed to be FSB or SVR.
           </p>

             Perhaps, but the "dominos" game was the focus of the vacation, if you read the thank you notes after the occasion.
I disagree with this interpretation.  The focus of the vacation was to vacation on Martha's vineyard and be with friends/do some networking.  Did you see the pictures of the house?  It's on a private beach.  I'm sure they did other vacationy things as well:  grill out, go shopping, open a bottle of wine and lounge on the deck.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I think the dominoes game was a specific contribution the Podesta's made so people are commenting on it/complimenting them.  It's like people saying, everyone loved the dip you brought.

            There was a thread about 3 months ago, now gone, which identifies the house and talks about the realtor, and determines the realtor may have been in on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same thread also points out an art museum link: just open the house link and note that the realtor is SOTHEBY's, which also owns the Sotheby's art museum as well as an IMPORT/EXPORT firm. This must be related to the Sotheby's Cards that Podesta refers to in other emails!
           </p>
           <p>
            Sotheby's must have some kind of "VVIP" express card these sickos use.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALSO
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that they play DOMINOS in this house and talk about "Podesta rules" where "anything goes." Clearly a reference to something sick.

             'm glad to see the domino-related emails organized in a coherent fashion like this. The list of characters is of great interest; these are real power brokers on the political, financial and academic stage being invited to a vacation resort in MV to play . . . . dominoes.

            Once you apply common sense and realize that is not all they will be doing and that Martha's Vineyard is a pleasant place to be in August.  Certainly better than DC.

            Does this really strike you as odd? They bought them, the obviously wanted them. They probably wouldn't be in Martha's Vineyard for another year.  Mailing things back to clients is probably a detail that high end summer realtors do all the time.

             The whole MV trip just boggles my mind. I'm a 40-something year old male, with a family... and there are precious few people in my life (outside of a very core group of friends and family) with whom I would want to rent a vacation house. These people seem to barely even know each other, yet they are eager to go bunk in the same house together.

           <p>
            Do you truly find this mind boggling?  Seriously?  People sharing summer houses on a place like Martha's Vineyard or The Hamptons is very common.  And it's usually a mix of folks who you are close to and then friends of friends.   Perhaps this folks are just more social than you are.  Even if it's something you would never do, you can understand people still do it right.  I'll never jump out of a plane, but people do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also if you were going to be sharing a summer house and one of the people you didn't know won the National Humanities Medal and a McArthur "genius grant," you'd pass?  Sounds like an interesting three days to me.

            This seems completely normal and above board. Especiall when read together.    And seems to be a stretch to impute code into this.  The bolding really seems to be reaching.   Do you really think this was some sort of geriatric sex party?

            Put aside "pizzagate" for second.  Read all the emails before the get together.  Does this sound like they are arranging an orgy?

            The conversation just isn't normal.  It's like a counterfeit friendliness. The Podesta Emails are the heart of this. I think the media is using the Alefantis situation to distract away from Podesta.  These emails have never been explained.  If it was all innocent and there is a rational explanation than someone by now would have explained them.  Why can't someone out there with a credible media platform address them?  Now that there is increased attention because of the "Alefantis Apologies" we should be linking tweets, media articles back to these emails.

            Amazing work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's try to look at it from the innocent side: they are gourmets and cooking fans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is art cuisine "demolishing" cheese?
           </p>
           <p>
            Shipping sauces: you don't even need to be a professional gourmet to reject instant sauces!
Sauces are often central for perfect meal. Therefore shipping sauces does not fit to an alleged gourmet context.
           </p>
           <p>
            So this is definately not a club of hobby gourmets.
And if I were law enforcement and they would try to explain it that way, I would demand that they show me their cooking skills and the sauces they were talking about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Playing dominos on cheese or pasta does not even make any kind of sense in that alleged harmless context.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the mails, J. Podesta seems to be the domino king and has his special rules. Rules that others find impressing but not easy to follow.
One reason more to demand an investigation and ask him about his special "domino" rules.

             I'm confused by your post.
            </p>
            <p>
             What do you mean by "art cuisine?"  .......saying it out loud just now....do you mean "haute cuisine?"  He was talking about his grandkids wasn't he?   Demolishing sounds appropriate there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your point on shipping sauces is confusing.   You can certainly make sauces ahead. And they don't have to be instant.  In this case they are almost assuredly talking about pasta sauces.  It's not unusual at all for gourmet cooks to make pasta sauce ahead especially if they are gardeners, In August/September when the tomato harvest comes in, you have a flood of tomatoes and you can't even eat them all before they go bad.  Canning/Jarring tomatoes for long term storage is not uncommon at all.

              You need something like this,
             </a>
             it lets you make 7 quarts of tomato sauce at a time.    But you can also make pasta sauce with Canned tomatoes and jar it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I once went to Elmont, NY to go to an Italian restaurant we heard  about.  Next to the place was a hardware store.  Their entire front window was dedicated to tomato canning.  I thought this must be an old school Italian town.  I never saw that before.

             I don't know about all of them but John Podesta is well known as a gourmet cook and you can find some of his recipes online.  His mother was famous as a fantastic cook.

              You are suggesting that tomatoes were already equal the sauce? That's a laughable try.
             </p>
             <p>
              That tomato canning is an important process everybody knows, since tomatoes are needed for every pizza and pasta (the REAL ones). Ofcourse there is plenty of stuff on the market to make a sauce with tomatoes in it. A good tomatoe sauce contains not only tomatoes!
             </p>
             <p>
              And talking about making a sauce = talking about making a sauce!
Ever talked with someone about good food or a recipe? Their language does not even communicate the basic informations needed for having a conversation about food. They even are lacking any kind of taste description.

               And your initial criticism still seems unfounded.  You still didn't respond to two key points that weaken your argument.
              </p>
              <p>
               A.  John Podesta is well known as an amater gourmet chef.  (In fact, you were actually familiar with his emails not just the cherrypicked ones, you would know this)
              </p>
              <p>
               B.  There's nothing unusual at all about shipping pasta sauce.
              </p>
              <p>
               And it's quite ridiculous to think that anything in this email would lead to law enforcement getting involved.

                Ofcourse their code language does not lead to an investigation. But sending kids into a pool for adult's entertainment should. Especially if the same person who sends kids to that pool for "entertainment" of adults, seems to have run a webpage offering "raw and uncut" live webcam from a baby.
               </p>
               <p>
                The analysis of their code language about pizza and pasta is just completing the whole picture.

                     I agree with Knightsofhubris  that the wording of that particular email could still be an innocent reference to grandchildren who are entertaining and since it is the time of year were swimming would be likely,   She brings it up  They still have not shown any proof or evidence that they were being offered up as sexual play things.  No one is saying that if the intention to offer children up in this way were proven, that it would not be sick.  It's the proof that's missing.

            Wow, the way this is broken down it almost sounds innocent. This is not to say I don't think Podesta and friends are not involved in pedophilia because, I do. Breitbart's death kinda confirmed that.

            Maybe...just MAYBE, when Susan was taught the game of dominoes (mentioned in an earlier email), they improvised and used a box instead of a table? And when she received sauce &amp; pasta for Christmas one year, followed by cheese the next, she was trying to be funny by recreating the box-table situation?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because honestly, these emails don't sound as damning as they did when just a line or two are high-lighted.

            Is Martha Vineyards known for nefarious parties? I already know they (Clintons) kill people who are on their way there (See: JFK jr) but what is its reputation overall?

            A similar timeline plus coherent filling of the gaps was put together by Yoichi Shimatsu in his pizzagate series of articles. Here is his narrative of the events before and after the meeting.

              Good thread! I didn't realize Gates was at the house during "Handkerchief Weekend."  If I remember correctly Gates's incident occurred mere months before he was set to release a new book. The publicity seemed orchestrated and Obama’s intermeddling only helped Gates in his career, I'm sure.  Hell, Gates had a book and then got a TV show on PBS afterward.   I remember that law enforcement officers up north were HACKED OFF big-league about Gates's and Obama’s BS. This was the precursor of the whole #BlackLivesMatter movement, i.e., the phenomenon of managing the news to fit the Soros Agenda.  Speaking of law enforcement,  here's a good article on the incident, including a link to the actual Police Report filed on Gates (tried to upload it but couldn't):
              <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/story/2009/07/24/disgraceful-cops-angry-after-obama-slams-arrest-black-scholar.amp.html">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh, further digging revealed this little gem from a police forum up north near where Gates was arrested.  Kind of interesting to see police officers talking shop and bitching about the whole Gates/Obama mess. Makes me wish these cops were doing the pizzagate investigation:

            "Sep 2, 2014 (5 hours later) Susan writes John that the realtor found a handkerchief "(I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus?" Tells they can send it if John wants, tells no need to reply if busy or if it's not John's or if John doesn't want it"
           </p>
           <p>
            You left out a key detail which is at the heart of the suspicion about these email. And what is the key piece of information? It's the fact Susan Sandler adds in "pizza related" when describing the handkerchief. The Realtor never told her it was "pizza related".
           </p>
           <p>
            The most likely explanation is Susan probably talked to the Realtor on the phone and was told the handkerchief was "pizza related". The problem is it's not 100% sure the Realtor told her. There is no transcript of the call.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh wait there is a transcript held by NSA and whoever else skipped the week spent on the Constitution in American History class in 8th grade. Hi! How are you! Funny meeting you here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quick question why are you under the delusion the United States of America can continue to exist if the government can monitor your behavior 24 hours a day without your permission?
           </p>
           <p>
            Would YOU like to live in a house with see through walls? I wouldn't. Maybe you would. Perhaps you could share with me the exact reason you COULD live in a house with transparent walls. Heck you may be right. See through walls could be the next big thing. Oh heck I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, maybe it's cool. Just let me know why. Let me in on the secret because I'm at a total loss right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why aren't you as offended as I am that some fucking psychopath in our GOVERNMENT thought getting poor black people hooked on crack cocaine and heroin was OK?
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you ever dealt with an irate black person on crack cocaine? I've got this funny feeling............

             There could be another explanation to this. The Realtor DOESN'T KNOW what the handkerchief is used for, but of course, Susan DOES!

              Considering that the realtor was able to put up her own office soon later, we don't know how good friends she came with the people in the get together. She might or might not be familiar with the sex related terminology. For me, it looks like there really was a real handkerchief, but I guess the realtor would have mentioned "a map" and "pizza" already in the first email, so "the map" does not seem like a real map and so the "pizza-related" also turns easily into kids-related. Now... Could we be talking about a real handkerchief with some sperm on it?

                There was a thread many months ago that is now gone, which established that the realty company that lists the Martha's Vineyard house is owned by the same group that owns Sotheby's art museum! This connects it to the "Sotheby's Cards" from the other Podesta emails.
               </p>
               <p>
                Speculation: Sotheby's Cards are more than just art museum membership cards. They're some kind of fast pass.
               </p>
               <p>
                I wish that old thread wasn't deleted.

             Good point on the key detail, yeah it's visible in the reply. We don't know if Susan got that info from Kate (e.g. on phone) or remembered the handkerchief herself. That's why I added there's a 5 hour time gap on the emails. Oh, I don't have such delusion. I still think that the nation is run by money as its god. Spying on citizens is just awful. Inequity, drug problems and everything seems to be held up for the sake of control and profit. Right, left, right, left... doesn't matter, they both seem to love the profit god.

              I hope you don't think my rant at the end was directed at you. It was directed at the anonymous mother fucker(s) at the NSA who record every aspect of my life. All I can think about when I'm at home now is where is my cell phone and is it listening to me at this very moment. It's fucking appalling. We're now literally living in Orwell's 1984. Ever read that book?

               Yeah bu, bu, but....Orwell gave us almost 60 years to prepare for this so it really isn't any surprise! I don't like it but it was going in this directions for decades.

               In 50 years from now, everyone will be RFID, one way or another. They've been warned. So to know they'll complain about it (rightly so) in the year 2067 ....will only sound rhetorical. Much like the spying of today.

                I highly doubt that. The only RFIDs will be those implanted on the 0.01% before they're released into game reserves where deplorables will make sport of hunting them down, killing them, eating them and then taking their heads home to put over fireplaces all across America.
               </p>
               <p>
                The catalyst will be Pedogate, Mangogate and the truth about 9/11 finally being told. History repeats itself. Deplorables beheaded 16,594 one percenters during the French Revolution. There are probably 10x as many people living in America today than in France at the close of the 18th century. You do the math.
