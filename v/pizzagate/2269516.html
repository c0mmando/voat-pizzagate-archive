<p>•	Kish Island, Iran: A resort island (<a href="https://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?where1=Kish%20Island">https://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?where1=Kish%20Island)</a>) located in the Persian Gulf.  Because of its proximity, as well as Iran’s various state-sponsored crime (terror, heroin, etc.), it should come as no surprise that it is a human trafficking hub:</p>
<p>*“In December, the Iranian newspaper Jahan-e Sanat published an article entitled “Trafficking in Iranian Girls and Women” which revealed that this is now widespread. It reported the government’s claim that trafficking of Iranian girls and women is a cross-border problem, as part of the wider issue of smuggling.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that these girls and young women are displayed in the cafes and restaurants of many luxury hotels in Tehran. They are also taken to tourist resorts, such as those on Kish Island, and other resorts in northern Iran. Yet more are taken out of the country to neighbouring countries.”*

<p>•	If the name of Kish Island may sound familiar to some, it is because this the location where former FBI SSA Robert Levinson disappeared in 2007.  The “official story” was Levinson was working to investigate (as a private entity) a cigarette-smuggling case for British American Tobacco.  This seemed a bit sketchy to me so I started digging and came up with this story: <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2016/05/20/what-really-happened-robert-levinson-cia-iran-454803.html">http://www.newsweek.com/2016/05/20/what-really-happened-robert-levinson-cia-iran-454803.html</a></p>
<p>As it turns out, Levinson was working as a private contractor for an “analytical unit” within the CIA.  From all accounts, this unit appears to be an off-the-book (or maybe sanctioned) operation.  NYT reporter Barry Meier stated in his book <em>“Missing Man: The American Spy Who Vanished in Iran“</em> (cited within the above article) – <em>“If ever there was a case for blowing up the CIA and starting over, as many agency oldtimers have argued, the Levinson affair is it.”</em>  What are we talking about here?  Cigarettes?  Or something more important?</p>
<p>OK – So based on stories like Paddock, Welch, etc. and their likely associations with “off-the-book” operations involved with human sex trafficking…Levinson fits the same profile.  What does this have to do with Flynn?</p>
<p>•	SSA Robyn Gritz likely was lead SSA, based on this quote, (if not, she was very close to lead) regarding the Levinson investigation: <em>“For nearly a decade, Gritz worked with the intelligence community to help successfully track down global terrorists or rescue Western hostages, and was even occasionally called upon to <strong>personally brief then-Director Robert Mueller on sensitive cases like the disappearance of a retired agent Robert Levinson inside Iran, memos show.</strong>”</em> </p>

<p>•	SSA Gritz (ret) is the woman whom LTG Flynn defended against attacks from Andrew McCabe, former Deputy Director, FBI, now HNIC of the Mailroom. Let that sink in for a second.</p>
<p>The FBI smeared Gritz, harassed her, and attempted to brand her as having <strong>mental illness</strong>.  Having worked for Flynn at the DIA, he knew she was a very talented and valuable agent, so he went to bat for her.  And a giant shitstorm ensued between Flynn, McCabe and the FBI.  Remember, she was just an SSA.  Flynn was an LTG and DIA Chief, so he stood up for what was right.</p>

<p>(Hypothesis at the end for effect)</p>
<p>Levinson was involved (and fits the pattern) in human trafficking.  He got popped by IRGC or Internal Security for whatever reason (bargaining chip).  He is a private citizen, so the FBI can only monitor and conduct superficial work (Iran is an intelligence void). It then comes out that he was working for a rogue element of the CIA.  This could be a number of different types of operations, but remember, there are no coincidences.  
</p>
<p>Everything is related.</p>
<p>The CIA cannot claim Levinson for obvious reasons – this “analytical unit” is involved in something so sensitive that it cannot be disclosed for a decade?</p>
<p>Gritz handles the investigation and discovers what Levinson was really doing, who he was really working for and turns Flynn onto it while she was at the DIA.  She returns to the FBI in 2012 to work for McCabe directly and possibly either signals she knows WTF or they already know.  The smear begins.  Flynn steps in and the fight begins.</p>
<p>Pair that with what we know Flynn knows (Weinergate) and today’s events come into much clearer focus.  My bad that this wasn’t some breaking bombshell.  But for those dialed into this extremely important aspect of Pizzagate, this may be a revelation.</p>
<p>The pissing match between FBI (DOJ and CIA) and LTG Flynn playing out in the media at this very moment may be over pizza.</p>',

          <p>
           <p>
            Theory (summary):
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Flynn intentionally gets caught in "lying to the FBI"
            </li>
            <li>
             The media goes ballistic (ABC, Behar, Rose, etc.) and winds up with egg on their face.  Again.
            </li>
            <li>
             The libs go wild and start chanting in unison.  Now Flynn is their great white hope to "dethrone" Trump.
            </li>
            <li>
             Libs and MSM go wild at the thought of LTG Flynn testifying to a Senate committee - Judiciary, I would guess (versus Intel)
            </li>
            <li>
             With grim face, LTG Flynn goes to the Hill to testify on "any and all crimes he observed"
            </li>
            <li>
             Flynn gets on the stand and says "well, I never observed any crimes being broken by Trump and team, but I did happen to stumble upon this...."
            </li>
            <li>
             Flynn testifies as to what he knows.
             <strong>
              Everything.
             </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
             By this point, all of the sealed indictments are fully filed and ready to execute.  Possibly as LTG Flynn's testimony is ongoing.
            </li>
            <li>
             The hearings will be covered live by every MSM outlet hoping to scoop the story.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I know this sounds like a pipe dream, but follow my logic.  Flynn, Trump, and team know EVERYTHING.  I mean EVERYTHING.  They saw the life insurance files.  They've seen the videos from Orgy Island.  They've seen the rotten core of the DS.
           </p>
           <p>
            My belief is that this is all part of the plan.  I do not believe for a moment that Trump/Flynn and co are doing anything less than executing a plan brilliantly.  Time will tell.

            How can we get this post back to the front page and it’s obvious it’s been slid down. Everybody needs to be sharing this information. The Liberals are so fucking self righteous an arrogant they think they know what’s going on

            This has nothing to do with human trafficking, Levinson, or Iran. This has to do with the POTUS' balls in a Cuisinart. That's what this has to do with. Flynn isn't going to get up and testify and extemporaneously give a list of the Pedo elites. He's going to testify that:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <h1>
             President Donald Trump and Trump transition officials directed him to make contact with Russians during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.
            </h1>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That's everything the dems were trying to prove. That's their case! By Flynn testifying that Trump directed him DURNG THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, Trump is toast!!! There is no other testimony that he needs to put forth, and the POS Mueller certainly isn't going to ask about Iran.

             BTW---Flynn got APPROVAL from the Obama White House to talk to the Russians, as well.
Therefore, the discussions?  STILL LEGAL.
Flynn is ONLY in trouble for what he said or didn't say about them to the FBI.
            </p>
            <p>
             Biggest "tell"?  He's up on charges of "Lying to FBI".  NOT charged for the act of talking to the Russians.

             Sorry.  Flynn's discussions with the Russian Ambassador were LEGAL.  LEGAL.
Flynn got a "process" charge....asked questions over and over...any inconsistency is called a lie.  Or maybe he just didn't admit he had the talks w/ the Russians....or he forgot....So, he gets a "Lying to FBI" charge for "lying", NOT for having the discussions.
Key point?  The discussions he had with the Russians were LEGAL.  Therefore, Trump's directive--if there was one---to have the talks?
LEGAL as well.

              Not only that, but The Kenyan's administration illegally unmasked G. Flynn's communications, based on FISA warrants obtained using the phony piss dossier paid for by Podesta, if I understand this mess correctly.

             But Flynn is cooperating and he's getting a sweet deal to do so. That means there's some bigger Fish than Flynn they are after.

            “Trafficking in Iranian Girls and Women” Kish Island, Iran. Could their be a battle between the Saudi's and Iranians over the trade of sex slaves?
If Flynn Knows,maybe a trial will bring evidence to light?

            This is political theater.  Trump took total command about two weeks ago....everyone is working for him even if they may not know it exactly.  We could not arrest 3/4 of congress even after we took command.  The normies would have brain melt downs.  So they are going with a slow reveal plan.  It may take years.  But the kid trafficking is basically stopped.  Now the Jew/masons will have to snatch kids off the streets here in America to do their special spirit cooking dinner dates.

            They are leaving Pelosi free because she is a clown and fun to watch have mkultra breakdowns on camera.  Never forget Trump is ruthless and has a sense of humor.  He made them switch McCain's boot to the other foot....because now the shoe is on the other foot...lol

            You are absolutely correct. Flynn has the Pizzagate elite list. He knows the Cabal, Epstein’s flights to Lolita Island with BOTH the Clintons, Weiner, videotapes in Weiner case, etc. The Storm has arrived.

             This comment "The swamp in being drained because the money spigots have been shut off" brings me to ABCs reporting -  My guess is Soros money is being bound, so he probably had a bet on the Stock Market falling.  Not sure how to check this but it does need checking! -

               So pleased that Cernovich thinks the same as I thought 10 hours ago, and they actually have some way to check high up!  I hope this proves Meuller, Soros was doing inside trading and that they get justice for it! -

             They put everything they had at Flynn and the best they could do was hit him with a white lie charge.  You can pin one count of “willfully and knowingly” making “false, fictitious and fraudulent statements” to the FBI (Washington Examiner) on anyone if you grill them enough.  It's a speeding ticket.  He took the bullet to protect Jr.

              A white lie charge?   Is that what they are calling these days?

             <p>
              The reality is they only hit with one charge because he is cooperating and if he doesn't cooperate fully, they can revoke the agreement and hit him with all the charges they have against him.

               You are basing your argument on fake news media reporting same old bullshit lies. You need to think in a different way it's why you are here right? Stop spouting mainstream bullshit. Or go away and stop wasting your time here you might be too stupid to ever understand.

                Too stupid to understand?   I'm the one who understood Flynn was guilty of crimes for months.  I'm the only one who kept telling people this investigation wasn't going away and people would be indicted.
