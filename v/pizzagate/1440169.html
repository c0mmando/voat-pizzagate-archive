            I posted this on some reddit thread the other day:
           </p>
           <p>
            You have to read further into Winstead. He was an elected councilman of some sort. He was also a public activist. He was after the joint because of the applications for permits for late hours and outside seating. That 2007 video he posted of the premises front was because they literally set up a ping pong table outside in front of the joint which Frank considered Public Space. There were balls going out into the street. The child crying I believe was coincidental. Not that this makes the place any less suspicious. Frank is now deceased.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe Frank did know something. But maybe he also knew that the pragmatic way to get authorities involved was to file things like this --- public space complaints, after hours loud music complaints, stuff like that. I believe that CP did lose their liquor license at one time.
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW, search the premises name on washcitypaper site. Lots of items. Mostly mundane, but lots of stuff there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish I was back in DC. I did work there for several months. I have lots of questions that only a visit to the area could answer.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Late edit
            </strong>
            : It looks like Frank is alive. I had taken the word of someone else that he was deceased. Lesson learned --- always verify.

              Someone told me he was dead, but I looked further and he doesn't seem to be. I will make an edit to the post. I should have verified. Thanks. I blindly pasted this from my reddit comment.

            devils advocate .......

           <p>
            this guy looks like a busy body in the "chilling video title"  he just subtitles a ups guy doing his job and how it disrupts traffic and he greatly exaggerates in those subtitles
           </p>
           <p>
            in his other video it is again where he is concerned about traffic the playing of ping pong in a public space and how the subtitles explain his concern of some one potentially paddling a ball into traffic
           </p>
           <p>
            if you actually read the article his is accusing someone of spitting on food and food quality claiming that some one is compromising food quality for profits
           </p>
           <p>
            this guy seems like a guy overly concerned with safety and IMO has nothing to do with pizzagate

              yeah i can but you can clearly see it had nothing to do with the guys playing ping pong it was a couple walking in the street with there little girl in white dress started throwing a tantrum and doesn't even stop in CPP even the guy filming who seems like a safety freak doesn't bother to mention anything about it in his captions ...only that a kid might chase the ball into traffic.

            This is a red herring. Winstead was arguing to city council about CPPP using the the sidewalk for ping pong where kids might chase balls out into the street. This is planted misinformation designed to lead you off track.

             There's always someone on voat that claims a lead is a red herring or they looked into it and there's nothing there so don't waste your time. Except I do waste my time and it's always a good lead. So again, this goat is controlled. You can tell by the voting and the comments. Many good leads on here are down voted or excused away without much effort.

             Unless Doc Brown and Marty McFly are involved, I highly doubt it was planted to lead us off track in an investigation that started 6 years later.

             I've watched this video over and over. Ran my theory by my wife, and I think it's credible. The video is shot from across the street of Comet Ping Pong obviously, but the sound of the traffic, is just about the only thing you can hear other than the children's screams. The people playing ping pong can't really be heard. I went onto google street view, and the other side of the street has that gas station, and there is a manhole cover in the parking lot. I believe that the guy filming set his camera down about 1 foot or 2 off of the ground with a tripod, and the voices are emanating from that manhole cover or another opening somewhere in that parking lot.
            </p>
            <p>
             The screams are not the types of screams from children playing. They sound distressed. Help me! is clearly heard on the video.

            I gave the man a heads up, politely and cautiously, on Facebook. I recommended to come to the pizzagate section of Voat. I do not recommend more than one of us do the same. One message should suffice.

            But I don't think there's anything to this. The context was he didn't want Comet to extend outdoors and extend his hours and Winstead claimed it would turn that part of town into an area called Adams Morgan which is notorious for rapes and murders.

             LOL what? Adams Morgan is famous for rapes and murders? When I lived there it was called Adams Moron because it was famous for being a douchey young professional/college kid hangout.

            I read that he got harassed after accusing Alefantis of murder and rape. Wouldn't be surprised.

             There have been a few articles written by local  DC media and they were so condescending and super defensive. Check  the video he posted and read the 8 year old comments no one mentions the allegedly screaming child but ALL of the old comments were so defensive. Weird.

            definitely needs looking into. If Comet has been accused before, that could well lead to finding a smoking gun.
