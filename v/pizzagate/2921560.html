  'formattedContent' => '<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><strong>There is not TL;DR for this I\'m afraid, in short the title is the TL;DR, I broke a high court injunction by sharing a picture of a pedophile and child killer in the hopes he would remain in prison for his own safety if I got his face out there, I wanted him locked up for life as he posed a threat to child, but I now face a two year prison sentence.</strong></p>
<p>Some of you will remember me as I posted about this issue last year but things have got to the breaking point now and a court date has been set for me.</p>
<p>Anyone who is truly interested in my story and my case needs to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger">read up on the James Bulger case</a>.</p>
<p>In short in 1993 two ten year old boys, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables abducted, abused, violated and murdered a two year old little boy. They were convicted and sentenced to youth offenders.</p>
<p>When Jon and Robert reached adulthood they were let out and given new identities to help them start afresh. Robert, as far as I\'m aware, has gone on to lead a quiet and law abiding life.</p>
<p>Venables on the other hand is a sick, perverted monster. To begin with, when he was released, a few years later, he was convicted of serious fighting and assault and for having a weapon (affray) something some people may call minor and no big deal.</p>
<p>On a number of occasions he has bragged about his true identity to work colleagues and has had to be moved and re-homed because of his \'bragging\' costing the tax payer hundreds of thousands of pounds to give him a new identity each time he\'s done this. Because of this \'bragging\' about who he truly was, this is how his image of what he looks like today got out and started to be shared.</p>
<p>What is a big deal is that years later, Venables was caught with child porn on his computer by his probation officer, he was sentenced to prison, served his time and given another chance by the law and came out of prison again.</p>
<p>Again, a few years after, he was caught for a second time with child porn on his laptop, he was caught trying to destroy evidence. He was in possession of a pedophile manual that talked of how to abuse children, he was arrested and convicted or possessing, distributing and making child pornography.</p>
<p>Since I was abused when I was younger in the care system, this story made my blood boil, it happened local to me and I decided to post his picture on my blog of what he looked like now, I knowingly broke a world wide, high court injunction, preventing the press and individuals of revealing this guys identity. My hope was that if I got enough people to see it the courts would imprison him indefinatley for his own safety.</p>
<p>Obviously, this was foolish and it didn\'t work out like that and about a year ago, the attorney general in the UK started putting a case against me.</p>
<p>The National Crime Agency managed to get into my FaceBook, Instagram and Google account which are ALL set to private and I don\'t accept any friends I don\'t know, but they still managed to get in and have downloaded all of my information.</p>
<p>The attorney general submitted papers to me calling me to London\'s highest court on 31st January 2019 where they plan to prosecute me for contempt of court. When I posted about this last time people called me a liar and said I was just trying to get attention, well here is the proof I am telling the truth: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/elONzuz">https://imgur.com/a/elONzuz</a></p>
<p>Obviously, for now I have blanked out my personal info, but when this gets to court it will be all over the UK news and possibly make international news.</p>
<p>My solicitor has said that I am looking at possibly 1 year in prison for this. Two other people were convicted for this same thing 5 years ago and were given 15 month suspended prison sentences, however, they were able to plead ignorance, something I can not plead as they have my writing on my blog and social media in black and white saying I knew what I was doing was illegal and I didn\'t care if I went to prison.</p>
<p>What\'s fascinating to me is that so many people are still to this day publicly posting and sharing his picture, yet it\'s me they have gone after. I think it\'s because I run a blog (which I\'ve had to take down now) which covered topics about members of parliament, celebrities and VIP\'s who abused children and were taking part in pedophile rings. I also posted a lot about pizzagate. I specifically posted a lot about Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein, which the royal family\'s staff had removed from wherever I posted it. There was loads on my blog and I believe I am being targeted, my mail was being tampered with (I believe) I also think my phone was being listened into. I could be paranoid but with the NCA investigating me and looking through their case file on me, I think I may actually be right and that I am a targeted individual.</p>
<p>Like I said, two other people got suspended sentences but the judge said in his ruling that anyone else coming to court for the same thing next time, will not escape a prison sentence. I feel the judge is going to make an example out of me. My solicitor also thinks that it\'s inevitable that I serve time in prison, they are guessing it will be a year but it could be a maximum of two.</p>
<p>My point of posting on here guys is:</p>
<p>1) Be careful taking on the government or the elite about institutionalized abuse or abuse, rape &amp; pedophilia among the elite. They will come after you just like they have come after me.</p>
<p>2) Be careful what you post online, only 1 person complained about my article and it led to this investigation and them trying to get me sent to prison.</p>
<p>3) Get off social media, you may think you have your settings to private but somehow they have access to EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Wish me look guys, I\'m gutted, I never actually thought my post would go viral the way it did, keep an eye out in the media as this will be all over it. My solicitor is trying to push the date from 31/01/19 to a later date to build a better defense for me, so it will likely be around March/April time the court case and when this hits the media.</p>
<p>Thank you for all those who have supported me and given me kind words of help, support and advice over the past year.</p>

            The name has already been mentioned in the comment section, so I can only repeat that you should tip off Tommy Robinson to this case. Whether you agree or disagree with Tommy's stance in modern UK politics, you have to admit that his reach into the mobilization of the working class of Britain is tremendous. EVEYONE hates the Bulger murderers. EVERYONE. If they sent you to jail for exposing this bloke, you should know that it can be yet one more straw to break the camels back. It can't hurt to at least try.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, the very best of luck to you. My prayers are with you.

            I'm very sorry to hear of your legal troubles, as well as the abuse you suffered when you were young.  I can't help but wonder if it may have been better to print off pictures the dirtbag and put them up in the local area anonymously (not that I'm advocating that sort of behaviour, if any LEAs happen to be reading).  May God bless and keep you.

             Thank you for your kind words of support.

             I can't deny that I went about this in the totally wrong way, I have to be very careful about what I say as I'm likely still being monitored and this is an active ongoing legal case but I admit that I was foolish to do what I did and the way I went about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not really asking for people's sympathy, I get why people think I had it coming, I really do. What I am trying to hammer home and get people to realise is that the justice system can send me to prison for two years for sharing a picture that thousands of people are still sharing right now and was shared around the internet long before I posted it on my blog, yet the justice system regularly lets paedophiles walk away from prison sentences in court every single day. That's what makes me sick and angry!

            This is terrible. When did governments start turning against their own law-abiding citizens?  I wish you luck and will pray for you.

            When the government becomes the enemy of the people, the people must replace or destroy the government. Since your government is clearly the enemy of the people and have successfully resisted being replaced- you must destroy the UK government. There are many ways to accomplish this, but ultimately if the people will not assist in the destruction of the enemy, then you are responsible to destroy the enemy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Try biological weapons. They’re pretty easy to make. Make a vaccine to counteract your weapon and hoard it. Inform the people the only way to get the vaccine is to kill the government and all government made vaccines spread the virus. Then release the actual virus. For extra shits and giggles, break into hospitals and medical stockpile caches of vaccines and inject your bioweapon into random tubes of other vaccines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then let the government’s own indoctrination systems work against the government naturally.
           </p>

            It will be a most beautiful chaos.

            they did that to me too, and some of the people i mentioned went on to receive jail sentences for child abuse. 
I've received no apology as yet. The next step is to create a nation-wide campaign protecting whistleblowers.

            I have no idea about UK laws and I am sorry to hear this is happening to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of us here know what we are attempting to do and have no regrets. I hope you find personal peace with what you have tried to do.

           <p>
            For all others that may read this: This cause is bigger than any single one of our lives and if you are not willing to risk prison, becoming a targeted individual(being gangstalked), or even dying, this may not be the place for you. Many of us here will not back away. We will not stand down. We ALL have names and addresses and are well aware governmental agencies can access any and all digital files and likely already have full personal files on all of us. They fear what we are doing. Their homes and lives are as vulnerable as each of ours are. They have far more to lose than any one of us do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do you(not the OP but anyone else reading this)want to keep fighting when the odds are against you?
           </p>
           <p>
            Silence is consent. Consent is guilt.

            If that was you OP, you are an absolute hero and I am deeply sorry for your troubles. I’ve read all about what those demons did to that poor boy and they don’t deserve to see the sun let alone carry on life as normal. But like others have said, to take on your government so boldly... that’s ballsy. And I am not very familiar with the laws over there. Im afraid all we can do here is support you and do our part to encourage your community to get out and support you publicly during any legal battles.

            Wow man you got a raw deal from a corrupt fucking country, full of pedos in Paliamnet just like the U.S. I know prison ain't no picnic but wear that shit like a badge bro you ain't gonna get fucked with for doin what you did and they'll prolly even plead it down to 6 months. Idk the situation there in the UK but they gotta have medium and minimum security camps so if you do get any time at all it'll be a breeze a fucking year gimme a break it'll be over in the blink of an eye. FUCK THOSE EVIL LUCIFERIAN FUCKS you did a good job getting the word out there don't ever stop.

            Who gives a fuck what they got on you from the computer as long as your not threatening violence they can just hovel off and wank each other like they do any other day. Sorry bro about your luck hopefully you can turn this into a spiritual of even financial win in the long run keep your eyes open and use every opportunity maybe something will come out of the woodwork to help you out.

            I've been jailed twice for contempt now. Each time just trying to provide evidence to the court that the guardian of my 4yo daughter is molesting her.    I'm a scientist but they say "he's a professional!" and take me right out of court to jail with my family crying and protesting. They threatened my 70 year old mom with jail for speaking out.

            Courts are as sinister as they ever were in the dark ages. In the US they don't order you too death for being a dogooder against elites like back then but if the judge is vicious, they do torture and try to have you killed.  I'm still recovering after getting out earlier this year.

            If this is real, I'm very sorry for your predicament. If you had to leak any info, I wonder if it would have made a difference if you did it anonymously.

            You may, I stress may because I am not a lawyer and don't know all of the details, want to post your real name and information to help your current situation go viral and gain media attention
            <strong>
             before
            </strong>
            it goes to trial. The media is good at keeping a story like this quiet, don't think that your case will suddenly become well known just out of nowhere if the powers that be decide it won't benefit them. It takes a while to build up a buzz. Especially because you claim to be talking about elite pedophiles, I really doubt the media will cover it at all. Maybe start now. If a few internet celebrities start talking about the injustice and if you're willing to share some details verifying this case with them, the public pressure might dissuade this from going to trial or at least working out some kind of favorable plea bargain. My advice, contact a few rightwing YouTube personalities. Give them some details and proof. One short video from somebody like Styx or Tim Pool or somebody decent like that will get the internet buzzing about this and apply public pressure against charging you. You may want to check with a lawyer about what details you should or shouldn't want to publicize now, but public pressure is a real tool.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are details of your childhood trauma on the record? You may, I stress may because I don't know all of the details, want to visit a mental health professional/priest/doctor/etc and get it on the record that your abuse and trauma played a large role in your decision. It would be harder to justify punishing you sharply if you play up the sympathy angle.
           </p>
           <p>
            You may also want to publicly announce that you are not planning on ever committing suicide.

             You've raised some very good and valid points and have mentioned a lot of things I've already considered.
            </p>
            <p>
             The case WILL be covered it's almost guaranteed without a doubt, you're right though, they wont mention what I was trying to do or my blog and what I blogged about, they'll keep it very basic and brief. If you're familiar with the James Bulger murder you'll know that anything linked to it (no matter how small) always gets media attention worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have to be very careful of what I say or do as I am more than likely still being monitored.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have a very valid point that if I did it anonymously I this probably wouldn't have happened but I wanted to take a stand for what I believe in, however, now the prospect of prison is very real, it's difficult for me to process and remain strong.
            </p>
            <p>
             My legal advice thus far has been to remain totally apologetic, after reviewing the case the National Crime Agency have put against me my legal team have said that denying it is futile so the only thing I can do to try and avoid prison is bend over backwards and be totally apologetic and beg for the courts mercy.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think that's solid advice for now, should I be sentenced to prison then this will be reported in the news and I think the whole advice of getting the public on side and getting as much attention to the case will happen organically.
            </p>
            <p>
             If I approached YouTubers/Celebs or people will clout it could look awful against me in court and is a real gamble.
            </p>
            <p>
             In regards to my past, yes, there's a lot documented down as I was taken into care homes and moved from pillar to post so I do have that going for me that my past was really screwed up and documented.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you for your advice and time replying to my post, I really do appreciate all your help and support.

              Talk about this with your attorney before saying anything. Even posts like this might come back to you. Hopefully your attorney is the best at this type of case. Here in the US, an excellent and 'connected' attorney who's on your side can make all the difference.
             </p>
             <p>
              The second piece of advice is to research what you need to do to prepare for prison. Are there groups, gangs, or other types of divisions you need to be aware of? Do you need to start working out to build up your strength so you're not a potential target? Better to be prepared and end up not going than going and not being prepared.
             </p>
             <p>
              Good luck. I hope your defense is effective and able to keep you out of prison. Remember to coordinate everything potentially affecting your case with your attorney!

            What I don't understand is how a court ordered instrument can bind you to it, especially when you were never party to the proceedings. Are you employed by a government service? Did you sign an NDA?

             I agree was was stupid and idiotic, I made a mistake and poor judgement but I wasn't in the best frame of mind at the time and was overtaken by anger with this story and case and wanted to take a stand for what I felt was right.

            OP is a Brit. 
OP is exposes a pedo, gets nailed to the cross. 
OP doesn't practice opsec and posts about this again on a public forum. 
OP will now be a suspect forever if said pedo dies. 
OP is now going to jail to be ass raped by Mohammed et al.
            <br/>
            OP did not do the right thing. 
OP did not consider results of future actions, like niggers do.
            <br/>
            OP is a nigger. Do not be like OP. He will die in prison without doing good in the world.

            It involves contacting some pedohunter Anonymous groups (such as Anon Hive, Anon Collective, Dragon’s Den) sending them the names. This story gets spun as people in the British legal system prosecuting people for exposing pedophiles, which should absolutely ENRAGE them. These people are ruthless when it comes to destroying pedos and their protectors.

             The people investigating me were the National Crime Agency (UK's version of the FBI)
            </p>
            <p>
             Name of the attorney general is easily found on Google it's Geoffrey Cox (MP) however the case was ordered to be brought against me by the attorney general but the person actually prosecuting me is called Judy Kennedy the UK government's solicitor.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the judge as far as I'm aware it hasn't been assigned yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no real need for revenge as this is probably one of the most famous and high profile cases in the UK, Venables is already locked up in prison at the moment.
            </p>
            <p>
             My friends/family are anticipating there will be a public uproar anyway regarding this, it will be all over the UK media, papers and TV as it relates to the James Bulger case and the public will likely be outraged that I am being sent to prison for this, so I think this will take on a life of it's own.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not sure what these Anon Groups can do and I have to be really careful because I don't want to make my situation worse.

              If the public have let the police scare them into letting a generation of girls be raped by the invading Muslims (along with the (((elites))), then the public isn't going to give two shits if you end up going to jail. Contact everyone you can and go down swinging as hard as you can. You've already laid down your life. You are already dead. Do something with it so others might live.

            First of all I am so sorry for what you have endured your whole life, having been abused.  You may try to explain that you did what you did to this criminal because of your past abuse.  This certainly would cause someone to want to retaliate to at least make sure this abuser is off the streets.  Be very very careful.  You are more effective alive and out of jail.  Do what you must but stop short of getting locked up, for then you have no voice.  Keep in touch and Peace and Love to You too.  I will pray for you +

             Any free men in England should have been storming the police long ago over this shit. Its all over but the fat lady singing. They have a chance if the men rally and kill or drive off the invasion along with the kikes and puppets in government. Sadly this fear of going to jail is killing almost every nation on earth. We whites have chosen a slow death to a fast one.

              I don't think it's just us whites.  I think they like to let lawless pedos have their run of the towns and cities because they want All of Our Children abused and raped. Syrian Children are being murdered and their organs harvested.  There are people of all sexes and races that we need to band together with.  Think of the size of the crowds if we all charged ahead instead just us.  There are all kinds of Children being raped all over the world not just in UK by ME immigrants or Asian Gangs.  We missed the mark yeah,  but it's not too late.  But soon it will be.

               Yes, but it has always been in the hands of the white men. White men got tricked into 2 brother wars. Then giving the right to vote to niggers and women. It has always been on our shoulders. You can only expect so much from half apes. Some Negroes are good people, but reliance on them is dangerous as it is unnecessary. This is ultimately what is meant by White Man's Burden.

               Our ancestors where deceived and screwed up badly. Now it's up to us to do something about it before it is too late. Sadly history shows that while evils are sufferable men are more apt to suffer them. Its going to have to get a lot more ugly before the cleansing can begin.

                People like you that have no respect for certain races will keep people away from voat.  Oh yes, I agree there are many like you, but most people don't like that kind of talk.  That's why comments like that get down voats.  What do you propose?  Killing everyone you don't like?  Trump just banned bump stocks.

                 I didn't want to be a Raycis, but the goddamn kikes couldn't stay out of the video games so I voted Trump, and they couldn't leave us alone on the trump board so I came here and learned

                 that the good guys lost both world wars and we are a generation or less from extinction. So yes as soon as the niggers start acting human let me know. Until then you get to be the outreach to them. There are a handful of decent black people, but if they are honest they would tell you to not relax around them.
