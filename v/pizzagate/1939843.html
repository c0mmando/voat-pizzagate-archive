<p>I have found several \'interesting&quot; tidbits about George Webb\'s Charleston &quot;dirty bomb” hoax and also a movie of 33 years ago.  I\'ll start with the movie first.  
</p>
<p>In 1984 – <strong>33 years ago</strong> – the movie, “Special Bulletin” aired.   The movie involves a group of “domestic terrorists,” Ph.D.s (nuclear physicists) who had <strong>federal ties</strong> (former Pentagon) who build a <strong>nuclear bomb</strong>.  The bomb is aboard a ship parked in the <strong>Port of Charleston, SC</strong>.  Pinkos/Commies, the terrorists threaten to kill two hostages, a network TV reporter and his cameraman, if the detonators for all nuclear missiles in the Charleston area are not delivered to them so they can destroy them at sea.</p>
<p>Many did not believe that the doctors’ bomb was “real” and decried it as a <strong>hoax</strong>.  However, <strong>local, state, and federal (US Coast Guard, FBI) officials instituted an evacuation.</strong></p>

<p>INTERESTINGLY, the entire movie is viewed as though through a TV set.  Essentially it is a series of network TV news “<strong>broadcasts</strong>.”  (The network is called “RBS” – “our BS.”)</p>
<p>In 2017, <strong>33 years later,</strong> George Webb, a prolific YouTube “<strong>broadcaster,</strong>” who has <strong><strong>federal ties</strong></strong>, calls in a <strong><strong>hoax</strong></strong> of a “dirty <strong>(nuclear) bomb</strong>” <strong>aboard a ship</strong> in a terminal of the <strong>Port of Charleston, SC</strong>.  <strong>Local, state, and federal (US Coast Guard, FBI)</strong> closed the port terminal, <strong>instituted an evacuation</strong>, and sniffed the port.  After finding nothing, the all-clear was called and the terminal was reopened.</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship is called the <strong><strong>Maersk Memphis</strong></strong>.  <strong><strong>MM = 33 (turn letters sideways).  See Master Mason</strong></strong>. </p>
<p>(For those who don\'t know, 33 is the &quot;magic number&quot; of Freemasonry and holds special significance for them.)</p>

<p>The incident occurred the evening of June 14th and into June 15th.  <strong><strong>June 14 = 6+1+4= 11   /    June 15 = 6+1+5=12 = 3    /     11 x 3 = 33</strong></strong></p>

           I have found several 'interesting" tidbits about George Webb's Charleston "dirty bomb” hoax and also a movie of 33 years ago.  I'll start with the movie first.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 1984 –
           <strong>
            33 years ago
           </strong>
           – the movie, “Special Bulletin” aired.   The movie involves a group of “domestic terrorists,” Ph.D.s (nuclear physicists) who had
           <strong>
            federal ties
           </strong>
           (former Pentagon) who build a
           <strong>
            nuclear bomb
           </strong>
           .  The bomb is aboard a ship parked in the
           <strong>
            Port of Charleston, SC
           </strong>
           .  Pinkos/Commies, the terrorists threaten to kill two hostages, a network TV reporter and his cameraman, if the detonators for all nuclear missiles in the Charleston area are not delivered to them so they can destroy them at sea.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many did not believe that the doctors’ bomb was “real” and decried it as a
           <strong>
            hoax
           </strong>

           INTERESTINGLY, the entire movie is viewed as though through a TV set.  Essentially it is a series of network TV news “

           <strong>
            <strong>
             hoax
            </strong>
           </strong>
           of a “dirty
           <strong>
            (nuclear) bomb
           </strong>
           ”
           <strong>
            aboard a ship

           <strong>
            Port of Charleston, SC

            Local, state, and federal (US Coast Guard, FBI)

            I have procrastinated sorting out the latest GW news because I can't bring myself to wade through anymore of the associated doodoo, and, in fact, I can't even bring myself to do a close read of this thread. What could either be a pissing match or shills staging a fake fight doesn't help, being off-putting would be the goal of the latter, of course. However, there is the suggestion of signaling on his part, it's what they do, so I know I should get updated. Could somone who's done a recent muck-out clue me in to his "reported" status (who knows what it really is), did he post bail, are there more multiple realities being pitched concerning his situation? A synopsis since the boat thing started would be even more appreciated.

            Only problem, George didn't call in the bomb threat. You get an F on that part of your presentation. You got spoofed by fake news, go watch Jason Goodman's  (NOT H.A. Goodman who is spreading fake news because he hasn't done his homework either. Then the truth will be revealed to you).

            THIS POST BELOW IS BY YOUTUBER MILLENNIAL SAGE (bolding mine; link below).
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears that this entire FIASCO by these BROTHER OPERATIVES was to compromise the truth community.  (Obviously, in order for SUSPECTED FREEMASON GEORGE WEBB to pull this off he had to WAIT until his CULT FOLLOWING became large enough.  IOW he had to have the numbers for the media to report, "popular right-wing Internet conspiracy theorist.")   Acton is preparing a white paper for submission to DHS to "re-evaluate threats."  Millennial Sage's post is below.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            It appears that David Webb Sweigert, AKA Dave Acton, has turned the tables on us and has exposed his nature. Please refer to Montagraph's recent video to gain insight on the apparent methods Dave will be using to blackmail his brother. Now,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              below I will be posting an excerpt from a white-paper that Dave is working on. I will also be including a copy/paste of a comment from a YouTuber named "Intel Valor" that has been appointed as "incident command" and is helping Dave with the conception of this white paper.  This paper will compromise the entire truth community and you will see why.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Excerpt of the paper as shown on Dave's computer monitor on his video:
           </p>
           <p>
            Title of Paper: CO-OPTING AND EXPLOITING SOCIAL MOVEMENTS THROUGH THE USE OF LIVE-ACTION ROLE PLAY (LARP) SIMULATIONS TO CREATE COGNITIVE THREAT VECTORS
           </p>
           <p>
            "Examination of the Port of Charleston emergency evacuation and closure deliberately caused by social media "conspiracy-theorists". Such cognitive infiltration operations rely on the weaponization of "crowd-sourced" information to create additional attack vectors. NOTE: this paper is scholarly research and is distributed for discussion purposes only..."
           </p>
           <p>
            My observation is that nowhere stated within this excerpt is George Webb or Jason Goodman stated by name and, instead, a heavy generalization of an entire community of what is deemed as "conspiracy theorists" is highlighted to be using crowd-sourced information as a weapon to create attack vectors. What type of attack vectors? As the title of the paper states: COGNITIVE. the media has been stepping up the rhetoric regarding cognitive hacking, and so I find it odd that he makes specific use of the term "COGNITIVE THREAT VECTORS" within the title of a paper that he is writing that specifies social media "conspiracy theorists" to be using crowd-sourced information to create such vectors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moving on.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Intel Valor" Comment of Contribution on Dave's Video:
           </p>

            "Platform and Progression:
           </p>
           <p>
            Participants within Live-Action are lead to believe evidence exists  through the use of deception. This deceptive mechanism details the compliance of alternative roles introduced to advance the plot. The narrative follows a standard Bernays outline with additional (Neutral) (Unwitting) persons, having valid credentials(IE:Reputable Journalists) to source, validate and disseminate narrative specific data to sensationalize and further co-opt unwitting participants.
           </p>
           <p>
            Manipulation:
           </p>
           <p>
            Viewers appear to be specifically vulnerable to inclusive roleplay which simulates real time espionage efforts through mock clandestine scenarios produced on video for dissemination through public video upload site "Youtube".  Media then becomes Cognitively invasive, (Worm) working exponentially, per viewer, with each comment further forming a directed opinion, adding validation to a fabricated scenario. The exponential contamination of population centers grows, irregardless of viewer opinion. Negative and Positive opinions build further accreditation for fabricated clandestine acts as viewers clash, causing viral spread of cognitive worm; Reaching exponential readers, viewers  and mediums of dissemination. Critical mass is achieved, further time has allowed for solidification and zealotry t o form within ranks on both sides, natural dialogue has ceased and risk for violence increases, alternative conspiracies are formed, spread and promoted, the Worm replicates with mutation to infect an entirely different crowd.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a rough overlook on my end. Not nearly complete."
           </p>
           <p>
            Hmm. Now if I'm not mistaken, it sure seems that this paper is heavily aimed at the dissemination of information through online social media platforms as per Valor's post of contribution on Dave's video. It seems as if a lot of thought is going into this paper that does not seem to be aimed at one specific person rather than a specific community. It seems as if Dave and friends are constructing a research paper as to target the 1st amendment and the people who freely exercise this right. Please look into this and stay observational and vigilant. It's very funny that this paper is being constructed after George called in a fake bomb threat on the Port of Charleston utilizing this very same "weaponized" crowd-sourced information that Dave is typing this paper about. It seems as if George's actions were radical and extreme as to increase the need for such measures to be taken to inhibit such a scenario from happening ever again. It seems as if this psyop was constructed solely for the purposes of research and example. The plot is getting very thick. VERY. and I believe something more major will be taking place very soon. Good morning.﻿

            He thought the ship was somewhere between Broward county and Orlando though so this is a bunch of bullshit. The one who instigated this all  "Defango" plays cicada3301 which is about the occult.

             THE ACTOR GEORGE WEBB instructed Jason via telephone to look it up by ship name.   GW told him which websites to look up the ship name on.  This was in their POS video.

              Can you provide a source for anything that proves George Webb is/was an actor? Or is that made up horse shit?

             <p>
              You've brought up the occult in this post. I was just pointing out, the individual that actually follows it, daily. You and the rest of the shills here, ran with his info from youtube, and thats how this began from my recollection. Then again there is so many posts of this garbage who the fuck knows. 
Bottomline is your taking away from anyone interested in coming here for these kids &amp; the daily research with this crap. Guess thats your goal with your ignorant religon bashing comments daily.
 Answer one question for me. What does any of this crap have to do with Pizzagate?

             Webb must have thought no one would recognize the movie cause it's rather old. I don't know why people keep defending him. I never liked him. The FBI was gonna kill him and then he's sipping wine publicly. Others (Michael Hastings for example) have paid the ultimate price for the info they had. So I have no time for this guy. People should read the book "The Reporter Who Knew Too Much." The murder of Dorothy Kilgallen, the celeb game show host and reporter who was the only one who interviewed Ruby, and said she was gonna "blow the JFK case wide open." So many other examples of whistelblowers and their "unfortunate" demise.

              Exactly!  It's all BS and always has been.

             <p>
              I don't know what the attraction is.  Lonely housewives?  Need of a "spy" thriller story?

              The guy is a COMPUTER SALESMAN and has worked for DEFENSE CONTRACTORS.  He has ZERO research bona fides.

             <p>
              Now we know he's likely a Freemason, so this entire psy-op is starting to make a lot more sense.

              </a>
              . Defango is best known for circada 3301  which have used Allister Crowley books in riddles
             </p>
             <p>
              Claims of being a cult[edit]
As the group has gained notoriety and public attention, many have asserted that the puzzles are an introduction to occult principles, and possibly even recruitment for a cult. Dr. Tim Dailey, a senior research fellow with the conservative Christian Family Research Council, analyzed the teachings of Cicada 3301, and stated, "The enigmatic Cicada 3301 appears to be drawing participants inexorably into the dark web of the occult a la Blavatsky and Crowley. At the heart of the enchantment is the counterfeit promise of ultimate meaning through self-divination."[15][25]

                <p>
                 Now it's "several times."  Originally it was ONE comment.

                <p>
                 Then you throw out some "bias or agenda" bullshit.  Butthurt because you THINK I "dismissed" your original comment?  Then you bring up another poster?

                <p>
                 You have no case.  I didn't make the comment.  You obviously have me confused with another poster.

             33rd parallel has been discussed before. Stephen Colbert's sister is a Charleston port authority alumni. Probably trafficking and gained enough traction for the Podestas to fund her campaign. George must be in cahoots with them if he is doing freemason scenes.

              Lol equineluvr is a known disinfo distraction disruption shill on this board.  Anyone thats been here from the beginning knows  this.  These are all huge leaps of logic, turn mm sideways for number 33? what does that even mean or have to do with anything.   These are all classic disinfo and distraction tactics.

               Fatsack is right and im sick of equineluvr just being annoying and calling anyone a jew evil. Not all jews are evil. Yes there is zionism, but not all jews are evil.

                   This is how you are going to present yourself? With slurs? This is exactly what shills that come over to reddit conspiracy, comet ping pong reviews do. To make as much slurs and disses to degrade the discussion and make it into a emotional tirade. People who read your post will find you untrustworthy.

                     Yup another try at a diss. You cant get me angry or afraid. Cuz your "powerful F you" is meaningless. Only those who are weak use disses in order to appear strong.

                     You do understand that your life will be held accountable by God at the end of your life. Please reconsider what you are doing, you are not convincing anyone that you are innocent or in the right.

                     There is more than just a cultural war like you said, its a spiritual war IMO.

                     Your post doesnt make sense The MM does not equal 33. You just made up a ridiculous statement, that no one will be convinced of.

             And the excellent reply to Webb's nonsense:
            </p>
            <p>
             ' I can't really agree with most of what you say. The Freemasons and some of the others I listed are more than just a crime cult, and the criminal activities like sex-slavery, child porn, drug trafficking, and blackmail extend right up to the top people who essentially instigate it all and make sure it can happen. They control the culture we live in. The kind of societies you're talking about are only low- to mid-level players, working their way up the ladder through whatever usefulness they have to those above them. Nobody in this world rises very far up the ladder unless they were chosen to by those who are already there.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was the British East India Company - founded, owned, and controlled by Masons - that started the illicit drug trade, and it's been tightly controlled by the elite ever since. Someone like Pablo Escabar or Manuel Noriega only reached their status because they played along and played well. They were eventually removed in order that the next stage in the drug game could begin. It's the same with all the lower levels. Keep producing and don't cause problems or fuck with the boss or you get taken out. That's what happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             The illegal arms game is similarly controlled by manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, who are DEEP in the government's pocket, and their boards of directors are all filled with retired military officers who will undoubtedly be found among the higher degrees of many of the societies I listed, particularly Masonry.
            </p>
            <p>
             The same basic thing with who controls the sex-slavery and child porn rings. The only difference here is that the victims are usually acquired from the street level, so the people who engage in these activities at that level are going to be your usual scum, but they quickly work their way up to the attention of people with lots of money to spend on perverted pleasures, and there's a lot of them at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will agree though that most Masons are clueless and are used without knowing it. '

              Dipshit, it means George Webb didn't put the ship in the same harbor as the one " the movie, “Special Bulletin”".
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't you get it? This isn't complicated. You found a movie "Special Bulletin" which is about a ship dock at Charleston SC. If a Free Mason planned a Dirty Bomb attack on the Maersk Memphis to correspond with that movie they'd get the ship to dock there.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're conflating the fact George Webb found out about a possible Dirty Bomb on a container ship in Charleston SC with some Free Mason plot that parallels a movie 33 years ago – “Special Bulletin” .
             </p>
             <p>
              It would be like if I mentioned a George Orwell plot in a comment and you accusing me of being Big Brother.

               He is an AGENT/OPERATIVE.  He is at the CRUX of the HOAX.
              </p>
              <p>
               WHY do you think Webb is not in custody?!  After he and Goodman were going around saying "McCabe is after us!"  LOL.  Then they pull THAT stunt?!
              </p>
              <p>
               You are a FUCKING SHILL.  That is the ONLY explanation.  Even YOU can't be THAT STUPID.

               </p>
               <p>
                1) Because reporting a possible Dirty Bomb is not a crime.
               </p>
               <p>
                2) In fact it's exactly what the DHS
                <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/see-something-say-something">
                 TELLS PEOPLE TO DO.
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                3) George Webb made bail for a drunk driving arrest.
               </p>
               <p>
                This isn't complicated horsefucker. We like when people to alert DHS about a possible Dirty Bomb. If it was a crime THEN NO ONE WOULD DO IT.

                      Public schools are designed to program for the corporate treadmill, the bells that ring in school are conditioning not unlike (at all) Pavlov's dog. John Taylor Gatto is good on this. We homeschooled. Mullins has a lot of good info though I haven't read him much. Imagine being forced to drop your kids off to a govt. babysitter by force of a gun. Insanity. "Schooling" isn't education, it is regurgitating "facts," and designed to keep one from critical thinking and questioning. Public schools are deadly. I'm still recovering. Should not be co-ed anyway, and the psyche scars from the peer (and other) pressures are beyond sad. Nothing hinders learning more than the "talking teacher."

              Brilliant? Have you ever heard of a Logical Fallacy called Begging the Question?
             </p>
             <p>
              That's what Horsefucker used in this post. It's the part where he mentions Free Masons and 33 and old movies and then slips in George Webb's name and hopes people conclude George Webb is part of the problem. In other words it's guilt by association.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's exactly what a paid shill would do to discredit George Webb. The facts all point to GW being the real deal so "proving" he's not is a challenge hence Horsefucker had to use a logical fallacy.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's the oldest trick in the Shill Book.

               Ya think? Robert David Steele literally said "I think George is part of a CIA operation", but because he's ex-CIA, he didn't see it as a bad thing, so had no problem telling the truth. I have never trusted or liked Steele, but FWIW, he also said Jason is his Mossad handler, which many of us have been saying for weeks. It could be that they realize George was not able to hold it together and carry out the operation, I think that's why Jason was sent in, to try and focus George on the false flag op they are carrying out... but George ends up saying stuff like "I was once a sex slave", and mentioning his love for Israel, his Mossad connections, too many times - maybe part of saving this CIA operation is to just come out with it, and normalize it. 'Yep, Webb is CIA, but hey, he's told us so many great stories!!!' And the new narrative from all the shills will include ways of making George the hero, innocent of all charges, perhaps blaming mental health or drinking. Frankly, anyone who would try to manipulate the public (and women) the way he does deserves my scorn, no matter what reasons they have. The CIA is hiring unstable sex/alcohol addicts for their operations, and don't even try to save them when their play sends the lead actor over a ledge. Nice guys.
