             Eine Recliner Nachtmusik
            </p>
            <p>
             The child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart himself could not have equaled the rhapsodic thrills delivered over a two-night gig at the White House by the chamber quartet of James Alefantis, Christopher Moukarbel, Chris Crocker aka Cunningham, and Chelsea Swanger at a two-night performance, September 26-27, 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
             The star of the two overnights was Chris Crocker, who had morphed from his persona as an underage transvestite into a close-cropped gay porn actor. His notorious defense of Britney Spears, titled “Leave Britney Alone!” in which he “flashed crotch”, got the most hits of any online video in 2007, making him an instant celebrity.

             Crocker has since admitted to Huffington Post about “sending people nude photos when I was 14” and that “I have always been comfortable doing everything on camera, so I figured why not porn as well?” Is it pedophilia if a boy voluntarily pimps himself out prior to the age of consent? It depends on the age of the sex partner and the type of sexual activity that ensued. The non-penetration rule was defined by Bill Clinton’s defense in the Monica Lewinsky case: “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.” Since Clinton was never defrocked and sentenced for receiving extramarital oral sex, the U.S. courts have not challenged his legal opinion that sex is not sex so long as traditional intercourse does not transpire. Anything else goes, under the Clinton notion of jurisprudence. Young Crocker’s online exhibitionism would still constitute child porn, possibly subjecting his parents or guardian to a considerable penalty and possible imprisonment.

             The Tennessee-born gay porn idol recallls meeting the boyfriend of documentary filmmaker Mourkarbel, who then featured Crocker, under the pseudonym Cunningham, in “Me at the Zoo”, which premiered at the Sundance Festival in January 2012. At the time of the White House overnighter, the pornographer was preparing rushes for an HBO series called “Sex Now” planned for release the following year, which featured online voyeurism and sexual services (dirty talk, stripping and masturbation by part-time sex workers called “cam girls” and cam couples). The series of three episodes released by HBO in summer 2015 were renamed “Sex On”, as in online.

             The fourth person with Alefantis was Chelsea Swanger, a freelance photographer who posts photos of female athletes and published at the Harrisburg Magazine in the town where Hersheys is located. Whether she engages in pornographic work is undisclosed.

             These aspiring young talents and Boy Scout leader Alefantis were shepherded supposedly for a West Wing tour by White House staffer Monica Lee, but the duration of their stay indicates an overnighter followed by a second sleep-over. The visitor departure log indicated 2359 hours (a minute before midnight), which is not about the bewitching hour when little Cinderellas turn back into ragamuffins or Uber rides revert to pumpkins. It means an overnight stay or at least slipping out in the wee hours into the darkness of Pennsylvania Avenue.

             Did the Alefantis crew, which included a photographer and notorious trannie/gay porn star, shoot video inside the White House for a porno video? If so, let’s hope they mopped up the body-fluid stains from Dolly Madison’s carpet. Or were these young talents there to enlighten the President and select members of his team with video clips on the latest trends in online pornography? However discomforting the scenario of a pedophile coven might be for American moms and dads who had sincerely believed in change and hope for the better, Alefantis made a swell impression in the president’s gleaming eyes.

             On that first day, September 26, the President gave speeches at Kent State and Bowling Green University, and then rushed back to the White House, arriving at 8:30 p.m., ahead of the arrival of Alefantis’s pajama boys. On the following day, Obama flew to Virginia Beach for a campaign speech to the Farm Bureau, and then got back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at 2:30 p.m. for a cat nap before a second night’s pillow fight. If I’m allowed to make an editorial comment, the President should keep his gay porn viewing to a remote safe house instead of sullying the heritage of the White House. British invaders set fire to it in revenge yet the White House survived, but the national symbol cannot stand for long when termites are gnawing within.

             There are three other Alefantis visits on the White House visitor register, which have caused some confusion in re**it discussions: (I FOUND WHY IT WAS GETTING KICKED BACK)

               December 16, 2010 6 p.m. to 11:59 p.m. Alefantis arrived at the invitation of POTUS with 497 other guests to attend an evening ceremony to appoint singer Jon Bon Jovi to the new White House Advisory Council on Community Solutions. The 1980s glam rocker from New Jersey was adored by fans for his androgynous pretty JonBenet face and tail wiggling that appealed to married women and young boys. Meanwhile the president and his guests ignored the military veterans in the cold outside protesting against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without offering them even a cup of hot coffee, quite deplorable as far as hospitality goes.

               December 11, 2012 2 p.m to 9 p.m. Jimmy Comet was invited with 757 other guests to First Lady Michelle Obama’s Toys for Tots collection. Alefantis, who collected toys from customers at Comet Pizza and his Buck’s restaurant, was scheduled to arrive at 2 p.m. indicating that he may have attended an unlisted meeting before the evening reception. Undoubtedly, the regulars at Comet Pizza had closets full of toys for young boys and girls with enough to spare for orphans and poor youths in the ghetto, an investment in the future if there ever was. Merry XXXmas, kids. Want to sit on Santa’s lap?

               April 9, 2014 6:45 pm to 11:59, is an odd meeting, the nature of which has mystified Pizzagate online researchers.
