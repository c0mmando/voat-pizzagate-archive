             I know, and one person who was on the CRIES membership (not in the case UNICEF per se) was highly connected to the owner of North Fox Island, Frank (Francis) Shelden aka Frank Torey, in Michigan, he fled to the Netherlands after his pedo/porn ring was exposed.
            </p>
            <p>
             That link is huge to in connecting the national pedo circles in the US to the International pedo movement and possibly to their pedo rings.  I will continue to post about him and tell more about that, I have a ton of research, even after posting a lot of info.  (What I've posted was background stuff, a lot of details to come.)  I was surprised to find out about CRIES (even though it had been posted about here half a year or more ago), and then to find the name just blew me away because of the bigger picture, not speculative. (Certainly more connections to make and work to do don't get me wrong.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The Monsters of CRIES piece alone needs to be researched and broken down into a series of threads imo.  I'm going to start some, like the Exotic Fish thread.  People can spin off of whatever angle within that articles info that they are interested in or gather existing PG research surrounding specifics within it, which is quite a bit I suspect.

            You have discovered a Gold Mine of information. The list of those at the top that they are holding and will not divulge is disgusting.  The crimes they are responsible for, we can only imagine.  The reference to the SPARTACUS network is also interesting. This was another cover-up. The Spartacus network hid behind the Spartacus publication, whose editor was the defrocked English priest John Stamford. This publication masqueraded as a holiday guide for gays on the travels round the world. John Stamford was finally committed for trial, however, accused of using the publication as a front. The information inside it was not related to inexpensive gay-friendly places of entertainment; it was pointing out places which were attractive for paedophiles.  DEFROCKED PRIEST.

             Spartacus, the publication, has ties to Francis Shelden.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              1975 - 1976 - North Fox Island abuse, USA. Francis D Shelden missing since his “youth camp” on Fox Island
turned out to be a pedophile and child porn haven. Frank Shelden owned North Fox Island in Lake Michigan–
a private island near Traverse City. Shelden also wrote for Better Life Monthly “seeking liberation for boys
and boy-lovers.” He was also Frank Torey editor of PAN and of Spartacus notoriety with Stamford.

             He also has ties to one of the persons on the list, something I'll get into later.

             The overall picture, eventually shows that the pedo 'BoyLove' movement in it's core (the idealists) have a vision of dominating the world with a twisted vision of what constitutes a society, (of course it gives them unfettered access to all ages of children).  Useful idiots have enabled them to make a lot of inroads across the world.

            I have posted a video twice about the Catholic church canadian genocide documentary of priest murdering, torturing and molesting children and MF has twice deleted it siting rule #1. This despite the fact that Hampstead, Dutroux and other cases are allowed. What is to be done about these compromised mods? Here is the documentary

             CRIES  (pronounced cree-ess), the name given to a huge paedophile scandal that erupted in Belgium in 1986. Several names that Heylens provides are in fact CRIES members, as well as Philippe Carpentier who is correctly identified as an ex-President. CRIES was a cover organization for paedophiles, CRIES in fact stands for Centre de Recherches et de l’Information sur l’Enfance et la Sexualité (Centre for Research and Information into Childhood and Sexuality). This ‘Centre for Research’ was in fact a club for paedophiles from all over Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             One list, which was leaked to journalists, is the list of members. This was seized from the CRIES computer. There are hundreds of them; securing this list was a valuable prize for the journalists. One of the members was
             <strong>
              Beat Meier.
             </strong>
             He is joined there by some interesting individuals, some of whom are every bit as bad as he is.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 1986 scandal erupted because, unsurprisingly, this ‘Centre of Research’ was nothing other than a paedophile magnet. It was also, however, a huge embarrassment, and not only to Belgium. The problem was that CRIES had been operating under the auspices, and full approval, of UNICEF. One of the four men who were eventually convicted was the head of UNICEF Belgium!
            </p>
            <p>
             It was clear that a lot of people wanted this little scandal to go away as quickly and quietly as possible. I was therefore intrigued as to how anyone at all came to be convicted, if this was indeed a cover-up.
             <strong>
              The CRIES files I have had access to (by virtue of having been copied into the main Dutroux case file)
             </strong>
             made the reasons perfectly clear, however. The Belgian authorities really had no choice!
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The four defendants freely admitted having sex with children and using CRIES to organize meetings with fellow paedophiles, meetings at which they exchanged photographs of abused children. They freely admitted owning photos that were seized by the police, and even named some of the children. It was an open and shut case for these four. They received relatively light prison sentences, however, possibly reflecting the fact that they could not have been more helpful.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             How bad was CRIES, on a Richter Scale of depravity? About 9.0, according to one policeman who worked on the case, who happened to be Patrick De Baets, who led the investigation into the X’s. When, during a newspaper interview, he was asked if he was qualified to lead the investigation into the X’s, this is what he had to say.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a policeman I had already seen and heard things that defied the imagination. I had worked on the ‘ballets roses,’ eh? (Ed: an early investigation into sex parties at which children were suspected to be present). I had learnt what normal people think is impossible. That what they believe is unthinkable, or even unimaginable, does indeed exist and take place. At the end of the 1980’s I saw the case file of the astonishing paedophile affair around CRIES. Photos of unnameable acts, atrocious, with children and even babies.
            </p>
            <p>
             De Baets knew what he was talking about, of course. The CRIES affair involved paedophiles who met up and exchanged photos and information with others who were like-minded in their levels of depravity. The four who were convicted exchanged photos which depicted ‘straight’ paedophile sex, without sadomasochism of any kind (I hesitate to use the word ‘straight’ in this context but I hope you know what I mean).
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              De Baets makes clear, however, and this was confirmed by many of sources, that the contents of the CRIES files were apocalyptic in nature. The producers, suppliers and consumers of these photographs were, for the most part, far more devious than the four co-defendants.
             </p>

            There are def things going on with kids being used for CP.  There was the Operation Cathedral in the 80's, I believe.  It was global and it included the US as well.  We have to keep at trying to expose these Pedo CP Rings for they are not just CP (which is horrid enough) but they also include Snuff.

              Yes, well Beat Meir is def a piece of work and at the bottom of the barrel.  He is the publisher of LIBIDO (yuck) I can imagine what is pictured in there.  Also if there are 4 Belgian men from Unicef involved in this disgusting matter of taking these CP pics of kids, then we can be assured that the head of the Organization and others at the top are doing this as well or are pedophiles.Hmm.  Head of Unicef is Anthony Lake has been National Security Adv. to Bill Clinton!  Whoa. And held the chair as Distinguished Professor at Georgetown Univ.  With a past like this we can only imagine what he allows with those that are working within the Org.

               Great info thanks!  This group of pedo rings (CRIES, Dutroux and others), are related by the names of Elites on lists that keep getting destroyed, or buried. This is partial evidence of the mother of rabbit holes in recent history IMHO...
