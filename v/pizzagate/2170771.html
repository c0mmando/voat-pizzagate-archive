<p>Mods, this is PIZZAGATE-related because Hollywood is allegedly a hub of child exploitation and pedophilia, and this story states that that one of Hollywood\'s biggest moguls is preparing for some very unflattering publicity regarding his alleged sexual proclivities.  Furthermore,  the author of one of the stories that Variety claims are about to be published is none other than Attorney Ronan Farrow, who is the son of actress Mia Farrow and  either Woody Allen or possibly Frank Sinatra.  Ronan Farrow\'s adopted sister is a victim of Woody Allen\'s pedophilia.  Farrow is an outspoken attorney who hates child abuse and his upcoming stories will likely paint an ugly picture of Mr. Weinstein.  I can think of no one better qualified to write  a cogent, articulate, and compelling hit piece on the inner workings of Hollywood  than Attorney Ronan Farrow.  The text of the Variety article follows below.</p>
<hr />
<p>Harvey Weinstein has hired a high-powered team of attorneys to push back on soon-to-be-published bombshell stories from the New York Times and the New Yorker detailing sexual allegations and improper workplace behavior against him. Some women making the charges are believed to be on the record.</p>
<p>Weinstein, the indie mogul and founder of the Weinstein Company, has retained star litigator David Boies, as well as attorneysLisa Bloom and Charles Harder in an effort to rebut the claims. Jodi Kantor, an investigative reporter who wrote about harsh working conditions at Amazon, is working on the story for the Times, along with Megan Twohey, who wrote a piece about Weinstein’s questionable charitable work for amfAR, a charity involved with AIDS research. Ronan Farrow, the former MSNBC host, is doing the story for the New Yorker, according to multiple individuals with knowledge of the situation. One individual said that at least one of the stories could be published as early as this week.</p>
<p>In a brief interview on Wednesday, Weinstein declined to comment on the charges.</p>
<p>“I’ve not been aware of this,” he said. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, honestly.”</p>
<p>When asked if the publications had called him for comment, Weinstein replied that he was too busy in the editing room working on “The Current War,” an upcoming historical drama, to know the answer to that question, adding that he’d had a “crazy day.”</p>
<p>&quot;Why don’t I get, since I must have these high-priced lawyers, let me get them back to talk to you,” said Weinstein.</p>
<p>Weinstein later issued a statement through a spokesperson, as did Bloom. “The story sounds so good I want to buy the movie rights,” said Weinstein.</p>
<p>“Harvey Weinstein is obviously excellent at assembling a legal team,” said Bloom.</p>
<p>The Weinstein Co. is bracing for the impact of the stories, but most employees are largely unaware of the details. Weinstein is trying to retain the services of Lanny Davis, a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton, to help advise him on public relations strategy, according to one insider. He has also reached out to several crisis PR firms in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the New York Times declined to comment. A spokesperson for the New Yorker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Weinstein Company’s films include Oscar-winners such as “The Artist” and “The King’s Speech,” as well as box office hits such as “Silver Linings Playbook” and “Django Unchained.”</p>',

             .  Weinstein and his pedo pals must be in full #ApeshitMode.  Full disclosure here.  I used to be so unenlightened that I voted for Bill Clinton for President.  TWICE.  Now that the truth's coming out, I want them all locked up.  So it's not a partisan thing for me, by any stretch.  It's all about LAW AND ORDER.  Law and order.  Follow the bloody law on the books and if people break it, #LockThemUp.  BOOM.  Simple.

            the NYT was responsible for some of the most egregious and blatant disinformation during the elections, and does anybody really know how long before that? I find it incredibly hard to believe that NYT would be hanging one of their own unless they are either A) trying to side up before the real shit hits the fan with all the investigations or B) throw a big slimy one under the bus as a distraction - offering him up to the mob. I'm highly suspicious. NYT = flaming garbage pile of lies

             It's really the only thing that makes any sense. They've only acted as a shield to protect The Cannibal Elite. They haven't engaged in investigative journalism in years and now all of a sudden they're announcing they are and doing a story on Harvey Weinstein?

             .  The New York Times is run by the globalists and they hate America.  So I think your assessment -- i.e., that the NYT scumbags are trying to side up before the real shit hits the fan -- is quite encouraging.  We all know that Pizzagate, Pedogate, or whatever one wants to call it is quite real.  I give Attorney Ronan Farrow a ton of credit, and let's not forget that he's been consistently blowing the whistle on Hollywood pedophiles for years.  Here's a story he wrote for The Hollywood Reporter last year (

             My Father, Woody Allen, and the Danger of Questions Unasked (Guest Column)
3:00 AM PDT 5/11/2016 by Ronan Farrow
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite Dylan Farrow's damning allegations of sexual abuse, the director of Cannes' opening film today remains beloved by stars, paid by Amazon and rarely interrogated by media as his son, Ronan Farrow, writes about the culture of acquiescence surrounding his father.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some reporters have drawn connections between the press' grudging evolution on Cosby and a painful chapter in my own family's history. It was shortly before the Cosby story exploded anew that my sister Dylan Farrow wrote about her own experiences — alleging that our father, Woody Allen, had "groomed" her with inappropriate touching as a young girl and sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             Being in the media as my sister's story made headlines, and Woody Allen's PR engine revved into action, gave me a window into just how potent the pressure can be to take the easy way out. Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted out by Allen's powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father's sexual relationship with another one of my siblings. Those emails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer — therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points — a self-perpetuating spin machine.
            </p>
            <p>
             . . . .
            </p>
            <p>
             I had worked hard to distance myself from my painfully public family history and wanted my work to stand on its own. So I had avoided commenting on my sister's allegations for years and, when cornered, cultivated distance, limiting my response to the occasional line on Twitter. My sister's decision to step forward came shortly after I began work on a book and a television series. It was the last association I wanted. Initially, I begged my sister not to go public again and to avoid speaking to reporters about it. I'm ashamed of that, too. With sexual assault, anything's easier than facing it in full, saying all of it, facing all of the consequences. Even now, I hesitated before agreeing to The Hollywood Reporter's invitation to write this piece, knowing it could trigger another round of character assassination against my sister, my mother or me.
            </p>
            <p>
             But when Dylan explained her agony in the wake of powerful voices sweeping aside her allegations, the press often willing to be taken along for the ride, and the fears she held for young girls potentially being exposed to a predator — I ultimately knew she was right. **I began to speak about her more openly, particularly on social media. And I began to look carefully at my own decisions in covering sexual assault stories.
**
**I believe my sister. **This was always true as a brother who trusted her, and, even at 5 years old, was troubled by our father's strange behavior around her: climbing into her bed in the middle of the night, forcing her to suck his thumb — behavior that had prompted him to enter into therapy focused on his inappropriate conduct with children prior to the allegations.
            </p>
            <p>
             But more importantly, I've approached the case as an attorney and a reporter, and found her allegations to be credible. The facts are persuasive and well documented. I won't list them again here, but most have been meticulously reported by journalist Maureen Orth in Vanity Fair. The only final legal disposition is a custody ruling that found Woody Allen's behavior "grossly inappropriate" and stressed that "measures must be taken to protect [Dylan]."
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is exactly what charges not being pursued looked like in my sister's case in 1993: The prosecutor met with my mother and sister. Dylan already was deeply traumatized — by the assault and the subsequent legal battle that forced her to repeat the story over and over again. (And she did tell her story repeatedly, without inconsistency, despite the emotional toll it took on her.) The longer that battle, the more grotesque the media circus surrounding my family grew. My mother and the prosecutor decided not to subject my sister to more years of mayhem. In a rare step, the prosecutor announced publicly that he had "probable cause" to prosecute Allen, and attributed the decision not to do so to "the fragility of the child victim."
            </p>
            <p>
             My mother still feels it was the only choice she could make to protect her daughter. But it is ironic: My mother's decision to place Dylan's well-being above all else became a means for Woody Allen to smear them both.
            </p>
            <p>
             Very often, women with allegations do not or cannot bring charges. Very often, those who do come forward pay dearly, facing off against a justice system and a culture designed to take them to pieces. A reporter's role isn't to carry water for those women. But it is our obligation to include the facts, and to take them seriously. Sometimes, we're the only ones who can play that role.
            </p>
            <p>
             Confronting a subject with allegations from women or children, not backed by a simple, dispositive legal ruling is hard. It means having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures. It means going up against angry fans and angry publicists.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are more reporters than ever showing that courage, and more outlets supporting them. Many are of a new generation, freed from the years of access journalism that can accrete around older publications. BuzzFeed has done pioneering reporting on recent Hollywood sexual assault stories. It was Gawker that asked why allegations against Bill Cosby weren't taken more seriously. And it is heartening that The Hollywood Reporter asked me to write this response. Things are changing.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the old-school media's slow evolution has helped to create a culture of impunity and silence. Amazon paid millions to work with Woody Allen, bankrolling a new series and film. Actors, including some I admire greatly, continue to line up to star in his movies. "It's not personal," one once told me. But it hurts my sister every time one of her heroes like Louis C.K., or a star her age, like Miley Cyrus, works with Woody Allen. Personal is exactly what it is — for my sister, and for women everywhere with allegations of sexual assault that have never been vindicated by a conviction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tonight, the Cannes Film Festival kicks off with a new Woody Allen film. There will be press conferences and a red-carpet walk by my father and his wife (my sister). He'll have his stars at his side — Kristen Stewart, Blake Lively, Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg. They can trust that the press won't ask them the tough questions. It's not the time, it's not the place, it's just not done.
            </p>
            <p>
             That kind of silence isn't just wrong. It's dangerous. It sends a message to victims that it's not worth the anguish of coming forward. It sends a message about who we are as a society, what we'll overlook, who we'll ignore, who matters and who doesn't.
            </p>
            <p>
             **We are witnessing a sea change in how we talk about sexual assault and abuse. But there is more work to do to build a culture where women like my sister are no longer treated as if they are invisible. It's time to ask some hard questions.
**

              Wow - this was pretty powerful. I remember watching this stuff as a youngster (the Woody Allen stuff) and trying to understand it; but how can you when you're young? - I remember seeing the news reports about it and vaguely remember how everybody seemed to shame him for a while, but then, there'd be subtle spots on the TV etc; people praising him as a genius, a "joy to work with' , trailblazer, etc. Had no idea what really went down, and you know, - time goes on, you don't even think about it anymore. Thanks for sharing. Keep it up! Hang in there, and be good.

              Thanks and thanks for this also. Dylan Farrow was put through hell. Even now when someone brings up what she said, there's always some stupid comment like, "I really don't know what to think!" WHAT?!!!! How the hell does anyone not know what to think when this victim is now all grown up and stated in no uncertain terms what happened?!!!! It's bad enough being dismissed as a child, but even now they're gaslighting that girl?!!!

              It's so disgustng and bless Ronan for his staunch defense. I agree so wholeheartedly that it's so much easier to go along with the false narratives. It's why I admire people like him who insist on the truth and justice being done.

            Hoping some big things will be happening. Just don't trust NYT, but if New Yorker too, that's two separate sources. Also the fact of him lawyering up like this?  Gives hope we could see some big names. Come on please.

            When you see Ronan Farrow, it is impossible not to believe that he is Frank Sinatra's son.
He has also been involved in calling out Woody Allen (and the Hollywood community for 
supporting him) in regard to Allen's "alleged" sexual abuse of a young girl adopted by Mia 
and Woody.  The activity was actually witnessed by a babysitter/nanny taking care of the
children.
            <br/>

             , as usual.  Very good points about handsome Ronan.  He definitely looks like he inherited Frank Sinatra's good looks, rather than Woody Allen's horrible looks, so perhaps, deep down (at a genetic level), he's not beholden to protect Woody the Pedophile.  I don't tow the liberal lefty line, by any stretch of the imagination, therefore I never watched Ronan Farrow's short-lived program on Cable TV.  Regardless, I'm open-minded and more than happy to give credit where credit is due.  I agree that Ronan Farrow's taking a big risk by naming names, but perhaps the tides are turning and there'll be more things released soon (a scenario which makes a single whistle-blower like Ronan Farrow less of a target).  Ronan has big, ole, Sinatra-style cajones.  For his bravery, strength, willingness to blow the whistle, and willingess to go on the record as far as Woody Allen goes, I give him tons of credit.

              Second -- 
Actually, didn't know that Ronan Farrow is a lawyer.
But you do point to something about these cases where being actually
biologically related to the pedophile can be a handicap in reporting sexual abuse.
For one, the other parent would feel economically threatened -- in fact, the entire
family may be threatened by arrest of the pedophile.
              <br/>
              Of course that wouldn't have been true of the Farrow's/Allen's, but thinking of a 
situation like the Podesta family if it was actually generational sexual abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've never seen Ronan's cable TV show either... 
but looking back on the Woody Allen exposed at that time -- 
and also what seemed to me his Bill Cosby-like ability to evade 
the consequences of his behavior, there may be more to this than
we can understand simply from what Mia uncovered.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also very much am hoping along with you that the tides may be turning
in Hollywood and that more may be revealed.  The younger actors still
seem very much threatened by what happened to them.
Seems Jodie Foster may have some experiences she will reveal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Roseanne Barr volunteered immediately that Bill Cosby's story was
well known in Hollywood.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, of course, MKULTRA survivors say there were connections to Hollywood.
That is, beyond the political connections.
Hugh Hefner is also in question now as to his involvement with CIA/MKULTRA.

             There was babysitter testimony for and against in the Woody Allen case.

              As I recall it -- and it was TEXT so imagine it was stories published in Vanity Fair --
the babysitter walked into a room where Allen was alone with the young girl of about 
3 years old and Allen had his face in her lap.  I should probably try to find the story again.
Also, believe it was either that baby sitter or another who took care of the children who
was involved in another incident where they had trouble locating Allen and the young girl...
and the baby sitter found Allen had taken her up into a very dark partial attic.
I don't recall anything by a babysitter who testified for Allen.
Can you go over your memory of it -- or give a link?
             </p>
             <p>
              The case has never been reconciled and while there was some kind of 
input from ... was it Yale ... it seemed suspicious.
             </p>
             <p>
              Allen also at the very same time was involved with Mia's older 
daughter who was only 16 or even younger at the time ...
and Mia found pictures of her in Allen's apartment where she 
had posed naked to be photographed by Allen.
Ultimately, he married the daughter.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, Mia wasn't only finding out about the 3 year old daughter being
molested by Allen, she was also finding out that he had been grooming
the other older adopted daughter.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's been a lasting marriage which I'm sure Woody is very careful about 
keeping going as that young women could probably tell us a lot about 
Woody's and his relationships with the children in the family, including 
herself.
             </p>
             <p>
              At this point, I've forgotten many of the details and the names ...
and will try to find the source again.

               I linked to news article from when it happened
              </p>
              <p>
               Soon-Yi Previn was 20 when the affair was discovered.    She wasn't groomed.  She wanted to get away from Mia.
              </p>
              <p>
               A team of doctors and trained social workers from Yale's sex abuse clinic examined  Dylan and concluded no abuse at all occurred.  This is why he was never charged with a crime.

It will be a while before I can check into the Vanity Fair article and what Dylan
herself has said about what happened at that time.
And old reports of what happened in regard to Mia's discovery and what babysitters
actually said.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 1990: Farrow and Allen engage Dr. Susan Coates, a child psychologist in New York, who will later testify in a custody hearing that Satchel (now Ronan) was alienated from Allen and that the parents’ relationship was “in considerable trouble.” Coates also evaluates Dylan, whom she finds to be “taken over by fantasy” when asked to describe even a tree. Coates counsels Allen about his relative indifference to Satchel as compared with Dylan, 5, upon whom he lavishes attention. Of the latter relationship, Coates will testify, “I did not see it as sexual, but I saw it as inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else, and it placed a demand on a child for a kind of acknowledgment that I felt should not be placed on a child.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 December 17, 1991: With Farrow’s willing consent, Allen formally adopts Moses Amadeus Farrow and Dylan Farrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                 January 1992: Mia Farrow finds intimate Polaroids of her (adopted) daughter Soon-Yi Previn, age 20, under a box of tissues on the mantle in Allen’s Manhattan apartment. After confronting Soon-Yi and confirming the affair, she tells all but the youngest children what she has learned.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Also as I begin to recall various parts of the story --
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Even though Allen was accused of grooming and molesting Soon-Yi, the way he allegedly did with adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, both he and Soon-Yi have denied the accusation.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Actually, as I recall it, Moses had noticed Woody's over-attentiveness to Soon-Yi
and was concerned that Soon-Yi wasn't capable of understanding or defending 
herself.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, whether Soon-Yi was part time at school, she was still technically
living in the home Mia Farrow provided for all of her children.
She was still Soon-Yi's Mother.  And certainly Soon-Yi was aware that Mia 
and Woody had an on going relationship for a 12 year period.  Soon-Yi had
been adopted when she was 7-8 years old by Mia and then husband Previn.
But she would have been at home most of the time of that 12 year period 
when Mia and Previn wee involved.

            Yeah, not sure how I feel about this story if we have to rely on their journalistic integrity. Hope this isn't all hype and that there's something there. It' be interesting if some revenge i being played out here. Like making Weinstein the scapegoat for bigger fish that need frying, but we'll see. Maybe it'll go uppa da food chain!

            Weinstein made a good choice choosing Lanny Davis.  He certainly has a lot of experience with Bill's problems.  The Clintons and Lanny are good friends.  I can just imagine the stories sitting around the fire.  He and his brother started Miramax this is from his Wiki Page In the early 1980s Miramax acquired the rights to two British films of benefit shows filmed for the human rights organization Amnesty International. Working closely with Martin Lewis, the producer of the original films, the Weinstein brothers edited the two films into one movie tailored for the American market. The resulting film was released as The Secret Policeman's Other Ball in May 1982 and it became Miramax's first hit. The movie raised considerable sums for Amnesty International and was credited by Amnesty with having helped to raise its profile in the United States.[7][9]   Weinstein gave Amnesty Int. a Big Boost here in the US
