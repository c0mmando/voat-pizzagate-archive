<p>Just a few days ago!!! pretty quick notice, three days before the special month begins? This is pretty sudden, if not Urgent? But regardless of the intent, now you can say that the President Ordered You to do the voodoo you do so welllllll! [homage, blazing saddles]. But this is pretty awesome, even extraordinary from a presidential duties perspective. A last minute thing, a last minute imperitive! Keep on keeping on! He\'s calling upon everybody, &quot;to recognize the vital role we must play in ending all forms of slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.&quot; </p>
<p>Sounds like a cowabunga 10/4 good buddy, to me anyway. Could say we got patriotism on our side, at least for January.
