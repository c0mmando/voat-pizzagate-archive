<p>Summary of what I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Anyone can add anything to Google Maps, but that doesn\'t mean it will be viewable and searchable  to everyone else - it has to actually be reviewed and accepted by Google Map Maker moderators, <a href="https://support.google.com/mapmaker/answer/157164?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3180755">which can take several weeks.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to add a business, you need a <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6320846">Google Business account</a> in order to add verifying information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if the moderators accept the business you have added, you don\'t get to pick if your business will have an icon on Google Maps. If you do get an icon (e.g. the fork and spoon icon meant to signify restaurants), that is something you have no control over, Google picks it based on algorithms that determine what kind of business it is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6056435?hl=en">Source from Google Support:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The place labels shown on Google Maps are determined algorithmically based on a large number of factors. <strong>One factor these algorithms consider is the accuracy of the business information and the richness of the content associated with the business.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Verifying your business improves the chances that your business will display with a place label.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that business accuracy and Google being able verify the information are important factors.</p>
<p>You can go to the Google support pages about this subject and see pages of people complaining that their businesses are not on the map or showing up with an icon, and the <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/maps/w4KwDZUpQHk/A9b9ftSxdPsJ">moderators will ask them to verify their businesses.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must be getting a generic POI/Establishment Place label icon, usually Google Local algorithms is good enough to determine the type of icon, based on the categories used, but sometimes it makes mistakes or take a long time to assign the proper icon.</p>
<p>Could you please provide your business details to investigate and see if we can offer any suggestions</p>
<p>URL of the public Local listing:</p>
<p>Business name (as it is in your account):</p>

<p>So as you can see above, first your business needs to be reviewed and approved by moderators, and <em>after</em> you have been approved, to ensure your business gets an icon, you need to provide some actual information that Google can verify either automatically or that moderators can later verify manually. </p>
<p>This makes me wonder how Podesta\'s Pizza Mansion was accepted, and how it got an icon? If it got the icon automatically, how did Google\'s algorithms approve of the searchable label and icon, given that it\'s in the middle of no where and there is no evidence of it being a real place?</p>
<p>I\'m not saying that Podesta\'s Pizza Mansion is real.   It could still be a troll. I just wanted to point out that it is not as easy to add a place as others have been claiming it to be.</p>
<p><em>edit</em>: fixed wrong URL and made the information easier to understand.</p>',

            Possible ties to what we are researching here due to the nature of Burning Man -- remote, etc. but there is a rule that children must be allowed to go anywhere and see everything or some such. Mainly, just the same as the 60's was a CIA counter-culture creation BM appears to be similar. Origins steeped in mystery (conflicting/different stories as told by the same person, possible ties to Satanism, etc.) as well as the shape of the place (pentagon = five points = pentagram) and the giant circle around BM apparently has '666' in it (the distance if I remember correctly.) Many, many other coincidences which are thoroughly pointed out throughout the presentations in the link. Jan Irvin and Steve Outtrim are to be credited for the work they've done on BM. Lots of really good investigative work. --

            -- there's a ton of info. I used to think it was cool, never went, but wanted to. But I think it's b.s. now... Something about learning the truth in history and letting it speak for itself... seems to shatter the lies... all six million of 'em.

            You no doubt will have re-opened the conversation and investigation on Voat into how Google Maps is being used by 
traffickers to communicate.
There is plenty of flexibility to manipulate and create your own map when you become one of Google's 'Local Guides'. 
You seem to be computer literate so why not post a second submission all about Google Maps Local Guide???
JOIN NOW. It's free and very easy to manipulate and you can attach a photo album of the location you want to pin on your map, write what you want about it, answer questions, and of course name it whatever you want.

            Are you kidding?  You're one of 12K people in here doing this work out of the billions and billions of people on earth.  You're helping to save kids all over the world. I can see your cape from here!
           </p>
           <p>
            ps. I do know what you're saying. It's totally unnerving, upsetting, and depressing and worse.  We have each other, though, through this very tough journey. Since I began this work, I stop every day and think deeply about at least 5 things I'm truly grateful for in my life. Then, I take a few minutes to savor each one of them.

            Also people can request that Google take their home OFF THE map, or place the home in a differant location than it really is. A lot of celebrities do this so fans don't show up at their house or stalk them.

            I believe you're on to something here. Lately, when I see maps or images that have been obviously tampered with in some way, my first assumption is that the bad guys did it. But your post reminded me of something one of the Insiders recently posted on 4chan,
            <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/112808283">
             https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/112808283
            </a>
            and that was, "You must start fighting. This is a cyber war and an information war. There are no rules." WHAT IF someone with inside knowledge of Podesta and the other POS also has the ability to use cyber warfare (i.e. hack Google maps) and is offering us clues, or Look At This! Regardless of who put that icon there, it got you thinking, several of us thinking, and that will likely bring us something good. I'd like to hope they're not ALL larpers, but the challenge is in figuring out the who, what, why, when, and where.

             This is like a giant game of Pokemon Go.
            </p>
            <p>
             Example -  Pokemon Go is an intel operation to get "eyes on the ground" to collect the geospatial intelligence that google earth can't. The creator of the game even has ties to intel.

             It's the same principle at work. I like to think the good (and bad) guys at the alphabet agencies are monitoring VOAT, 4Chan and others for leads.
            </p>
            <p>
             So if they wanted eyes on something, they "plant a pokemon" so to speak, and thousands of diggers show up to analyze the data six ways to sunday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump is doing the same thing. He says "Incident last night in Sweden", and the attack dogs start fact-checking to find out there was no incident in Sweden, while at the same time, millions of people are becoming redpilled on how much of a shithole sweden is becoming.

            What this means, (btw I've done some of this type of work for others), is that was added by the business itself and done so because they wanted to expand their market presence.  If I'm doing work for a local business, say Joe movers, this is the sort of thing I might do while doing a shit ton of other stuff on top of it.  You don't think about adding a business to google unless you've been doing a lot of other stuff to attract business.
           </p>
           <p>
            So then if this is a business entity that at least at one point was trying to grow its web presence, can we find other products of that effort as well?  A website with links on other sites?  That or maybe his situation was unique and he was trying to make it easier for customers to find on a map because he's thinking about it in that level of detail.  That or it is a troll and it really is that easy to edit.  One customer of mine (a local) was in complete disarray about ownership and access to a lot of digital things.  Both myself and his daughter spammed the google places listing for him with updates until they stuck.  It worked.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of those things was a website listing.  I could have phished his customers if I were a third party.  The information on the site matching 90% with the content on the places listing so google accepted it.  Google doesn't know these businesses better than anyone else so they generally believe people.  How is Google to know it's not called John's Pizza Mansion?

            More important is who gets to Hide their locations on Google Maps? We know the Government can hide any secret installation they want to. Many people search for Area 51 and that's so well known it can't be hidden but there are many other Top Secret bases that are completely hidden.
           </p>
           <p>
            Barbra Streisand wanted to hide her Malibu mansion she was angry that sight-seers and tourists were so easily able to find where she lived but it backfired on her she got so much negative publicity it's now known as the Streisand Effect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta should be powerful enough to hide anything he wants he can pick up the phone and call Eric Schmidt at Google any time he wants and Eric will do whatever Podesta tells him to do.

            is this too much of a stretch? Brandon Hurlbut being the one who named the pizza mansion. Probably pure coincidence right?
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: I should have look harder bc the email id isnt the one that actually includes Brandon Hurlbut

            I also have first hand knowledge. This was about a year ago. A friend of mine wanted to start a painting business. We built the website in an evening and later I added the location to google. I am 100000℅ sure that in my case, the business was added within about a week and there was absolutely nothing needed to verify it from google. So in other words, in my experience, it was very simple to add a location to google maps.

             Become a Google Map Local Guide and you can add anything. It seems to be a favourite with traffickers. One can edit on the run and add photos, write up a written review and assign whatever title or name to a destination/location.

               If it was planted by another it's up to distract. If it was posted by Podesta you'd think he might have had it scrubbed when PizzaGate broke. 
But then again he's got a lot on and it may well have slipped his mind. Has anyone confirmed it is his address? Regardless of a pin name on a map, if he own the property - just miles from Bohemian Grove, that's a huge win for the knowledge bank of PizzaGate.

            I don't know if this has been posted but for those who are having trouble locating the alleged Podesta Pizza Mansion, here are the coordinates you can paste into Google Earth. The label, "Podesta's Pizza Mansion" has been removed but I saw it there last night. Typed it in and went right to it.

            It's there, a house in the woods alongisde 'Bearpen Creek' with a big dirt area in a clearing outside the house, there's a red parasol on the other side of the clearing, facing the house. Nearby is 'Camp Cazadero' - they're in an area called 'Truth Home' next to an area called 'Goat Rock.' Weird. I remember with the Pegasus listing in DC you could see when it had been added and by who. I wonder why you can't with this one.

             It's only 15 miles away from Bohemian Grove apparently. Maybe someone added the PIzza Mansion to try to draw people's attention back to this area?

              Yeah, and when. I posted under my last comment that this Camp Cazadero came up before in December, and no one mentioned the Pizza Mansion then, so seems like it must have been added since.

              Here's what my other commnet said:

              Camp Cazadero has come up before in early December.

              - the comments in this one are particularly enlightening.
             </p>
             <p>
              And this post also:

              It's only 15 miles away from Bohemian Grove apparently. Maybe someone added the PIzza Mansion to try to draw people's attention back to this area?

            What is really easy to do is take over an existing business, it's currently a bit of a loophole. Providing the owner of the prior business at a location gives you ownership of the account you can change quite a lot without having to reverify.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps look for other business/point of interest at that location

             If a business isn't claimed already, with some finagling anyone can claim it and then it takes an act of congress to fix it.

             I did a website for a motorcycle shop where a competitor had claimed listing and put up all their pics and info.  It was painful to get it back.

             Personal opinion here: On the face this doesn't seem impossible. Maybe it's unlikely but seems hard to estimate how unlikely it would be. Not sure why you got downvoated.

            I can tell you that I legitimately placed an icon for a small business on google maps a few years ago.  It was as easy as just registering an address and a name, and to be honest, seemed largely automated, or at least routine that is they don't look too closely.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as icon's go I was never familiar with the process for that.

             When maps first arrived, you're right, it was as simple as that.  A couple of years ago (maybe 3), they started to be stricter and you had to verify your business address through a card sent from Google to the business address with a code.
This often took weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
             imho it depends when it was entered.  Could be an easy one from years ago (maybe by Brietbart or someone who knew), or it could be a leak for us to follow, idk.

            What if you're very rich and powerful and have a lobby group employed by google? Podesta lobby group. I bet them it's easier to ad and remove dots from the map.

             AND the Youtuber was wrong when he said its just an empty dirt patch now. Podestas Pizza Mansion is a building off to the side of the Dirt patch. BUT THey clearly were building something in that dirt patch which could easily be an underground chamber

            <p>
             I know OP says its not easy to get a Business Marker on the map but I may try it myself to see. I'm still highly skeptical of this Pizza Mansion.

              After the election, somebody was able to change the name of "Trump Tower" to "Dump Tower" on Google maps. So apparently it can't be that hard for a troll to change the name of an existing place. Could that be what happened here?

              It's as easier as! Look at Google Maps Local Guides. You can make your own special pizza map if you like and create a photo album with it too.

            Well that's good to know and can be checked off the list but still the issue that these caps could be VERY easily faked and everything outside of the name ie the construction etc. is kinda meaningless speculation. Not liking the trend of very speculative pieces like the fatherhood video and this 'podesta mansion' being immediately tossed around claiming to be connected to podesta when there isn't enough to back up the claim. The more people post that fatherhood video or stuff like this 'mansion' on twitter and it turns out to be a dead end it will be very tough when actual evidence comes out to convince people. This is real fucked up shit and big claims we are making, we need to be smarter about this stuff. 
EDIT: to the grammar Nazi's, I know I didn't capitalize podesta's name but frankly he doesn't deserve it.

              I agree. Mostly because the voice is so similar. I work with audio production and have a pretty good mixing ear and the voices sound very similar to me. That being said, you can't see the guy in the video at all so better to be careful about what we claim.

               Right, I agree no need for pitchforks yet but we do need FBI to step in... It's also possible they were responsible for leaking the evidence on worldcorpo... or the efit of the Podesta Bros in Madeleine McCann kidnapping.

                Yeah, that's what I find fascinating about the fatherhood video - where did it come from? Did someone go searching through random child abuse videos online until they found one that could plausibly sound like Podesta, and has lighting similar to Comet, and then plant it somewhere for us to find? That would be awfully time consuming and unlikely. Or did someone leak real evidence hoping we'd find it? The latter seems more likely to me.

              Google is actively promoting anti-Trump &amp; pro-Hillary propaganda as well as censoring Pizzagate searches. As its CEO, it is his responsibility for overseeing everything the company has done and he should be investigated for that.

               It appears that Google has gone to war with POTUS and his family. Here's Google+'s page live one minute ago.
Google might even have it in for Podesta.

                If Vault 7 is what FBIanon claims it is, and it is released, then I expect all hell will break loose. Schmoogle is most certainly in the enemy camp and lord only knows the powers that have been given to them.
