            Been involved with scouts for a couple years with my son and many years as a youngster. Never seen or heard of any fuckery.
           </p>
           <p>
            CORI checks for anyone near the kids. And we never let adults alone with kids. Theres always a gaggle of parents there, men and women.
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea of pederasts in our scout troop is ridiculous.

             You need a new moniker because you are clearly wearing blinders.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's good to hear that your troop takes precautions, but that doesn't mean that others do.  There are too many BS abuse stories coming in from disparate places.

              New England town here.. We all know each other. People bring their extended families, sons and daughters and wives. We do family campouts and such.
             </p>
             <p>
              About a quarter of us dads are ex-mil.  Two actives. Mixed crowd, conservatives and liberals and nobody talks politics.. we stay friendly.
             </p>
             <p>
              NOBODY gets time alone with kids. Too crowded ;)
             </p>
             <p>
              Even non-contact personnel like treasurer gets full cori check.
             </p>
             <p>
              The odds of this troop harboring any predators is non-existent.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let me spell this out: You will do a lot of work being in scouts. Potential predators will quickly realize they will  get zero alone with kids. Tell me why a predator would bother?
             </p>
             <p>
              Myself and wife attending meetings last few years is plenty of time for me have to come to this conclusion.

            This article is HORRIBLY inaccurate.  The founder of the Boy Scouts of America was W.D. Boyce.  He was not a pedo.

             The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) was inspired by and modeled on the Boy Scout Association, established by Baden-Powell in Britain in 1908:
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America

            </p>
            <p>
             There were multiple boys scouts orgs but Powell created the first that inspired the creation of all other boy scouts orgs like the BSA. That's why he is looked upon as the main founder. 
Also, the new York times says he was the founder:

                    You're a moron.  This pedophile did NOT start the first scouts.  The first scouting organization was in 1907.  The BSA (America) was formed in early 2010.  This pedo formed his pedo scouts in late 2010.

                     2010? The guy died in 1941. You just said a complete lie. He founded the boy scouts association, which inspired the boys scouts of america:

                     You are lying by saying he only wrote a book when clearly many sources claim he founded the scouts. The New York Times and several other sources consider him to be the main founder

                      He wrote a book.  The book influenced a shit ton of people to found organizations.  He is NOT the founder of the BS of America.  The BS Association he is credited as founding was LATER than the BS of America.

                      Let me give you an example you may understand.  Do you know who founded Alcoholics Anonymous?  Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith.  The basis for which the entire program is modeled after is a book called the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius.  St. Ignatius is not the founder of AA but wrote the book AA is based on.  Same with the scouts.  Pedo writes a book about scouting.  A bunch of countries start scouting organizations shortly after.  Let me put it this way, when I was in the Boy Scouts, we learned about W.D. Boyce, who is credited for starting the Boy Scouts of America.  This kid diddler's name never came up.

                       "On January 24, 1908, the Boy Scouts movement begins in England with the publication of the first installment of Robert Baden-Powell’s Scouting for Boys." The book founded the boy scouts but he didn't just write the book, he also did this:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       "On July 25, 1907, he took a diverse group of 21 adolescents to Brownsea Island in Dorsetshire where they set up camp for a fortnight. With the aid of other instructors, he taught the boys about camping, observation, deduction, woodcraft, boating, lifesaving, patriotism, and chivalry. Many of these lessons were learned through inventive games that were very popular with the boys. The first Boy Scouts meeting was a great success.
With the success of Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell set up a central Boy Scouts office, which registered new Scouts and designed a uniform. By the end of 1908, there were 60,000 Boy Scouts, and troops began springing up in British Commonwealth countries across the globe. In September 1909, the first national Boy Scout meeting was held at the Crystal Palace in London. Ten thousand Scouts showed up, including a group of uniformed girls who called themselves the Girl Scouts. In 1910, Baden-Powell organized the Girl Guides as a separate organization." -

                       Baden created a boy scouts group all the way in 1907, before the BSA

                      <p>
                       Now read here: "The American version of the Boy Scouts has it origins in an event that occurred in London in 1909. Chicago publisher William Boyce was lost in the fog when a Boy Scout came to his aid. After guiding Boyce to his destination, the boy refused a tip, explaining that as a Boy Scout he would not accept payment for doing a good deed. This anonymous gesture inspired Boyce to organize several regional U.S. youth organizations, specifically the Woodcraft Indians and the Sons of Daniel Boone, into the Boy Scouts of America. Incorporated on February 8, 1910, the movement soon spread throughout the country. " -

            In the early 1900s, bathing suits were regarded by current medical science at that time to be unhygenic.  Nude swimming was often manditory in sex-segregated facilities where modesty was not necessary.

            Much in the same way that sleeping surfaces were commonly shared in the 1800s, with bundling boards used to separate unmarried men and women sharing the same bed.

            Bolshevik social deconstructionists, however, will never cease their unrelenting attacks on history. Their agenda is to normalize the abberant, and to demonize the normal.

            Yep.  This has been known for years.

            Even the tangential actors associated with the BS, like photographers for their "Boys' Life" magazine, were homos.

              The Boy Scouts' logo -- both in England and the BSA in the USA -- contains the fleur-de-lis, the symbol of the powerful Illuminati Merovingian bloodline.

            Following the evolution of the BSs is a good study of how all these orgs operate.  Initially, they pretend to be "pure and wholesome" -- the antithesis of their founders and REAL/OCCULT philosophy.  Over time, however, as the Agenda advances they begin to relax and let their real nature be shown.  The Roman Catholic Church has done this too.

            The BSA had a ban on gay leaders that was lifted just a couple of years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Boy Scouts of America relented to unprecedented pressure on Monday and lifted its national ban on gay adult leaders, paving the way for historic change — and debate — within the organization.

           <p>
            Monday's vote by the group's 71-member board followed an impassioned plea in May by the Boy Scouts President Robert Gates, a former U.S. defense secretary, who told the group, "We must deal with the world as it is, not as we might wish it to be." Gates, an Eagle Scout, told leaders, "The status quo in our movement's membership standards cannot be sustained."
           </p>
           <p>
            Zach Wahls, 24, an Eagle Scout and executive director of Scouts for Equality, which has pushed for the new policy, said the vote "marks the beginning of a new chapter" for the Boy Scouts. "As of this vote, the Boy Scouts of America is an organization that is looking forward, not back."

            The organization has been slowly, steadily, moving toward this moment. In 2013, it allowed openly gay youth to be scouts, but stopped short of allowing gay adults to be leaders.

            From the OP's link -
           </p>
           <p>
            "Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scouts, may have been a pedophile. Tom Jeal’s The Boy-Man, a biography of Powell, details Powell’s attraction to young boys. The book also tells us how Powell liked to look at photos of nude schoolboys with his friend, a schoolmaster and amateur snapper of his pupils.  If this were done in today’s world, Powell would have been arrested for child porn. But it gets worse, Powell also had requirements that Scouts in his care should bathe outside naked.
           </p>
           <p>
            The could mean that Powell created the Boy Scouts as a front for pedophilia. J.L. Tarr, a Chief Scout Executive in the 1980s, said regarding sexual assault cases against Scout leaders in all 50 states: “That’s been an issue since the Boy Scouts began”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prior to 1994, there were over 2,000 reported cases of sexual abuse within the Boy Scouts of America. In May 1991, the Washington Times published an investigation into the sex abuse in the BSA. In the conclusion of the investigation, they wrote:
           </p>
           <p>
            The Boy Scouts are a magnet for men who want to have sexual relations with children…Pedophiles join the Scouts for a simple reason: it’s where the boys are.”
