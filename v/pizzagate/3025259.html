<p>Thank you to the person that managed to capture the raid on video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slCN7oz-420&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a> showing 3 miltary helicopters landing in a downtown LA street to which troops ran from the buildings and piled into. Just after the 3 leave a blackhawk then lands and another group comes out of the building and appear to have a person captured which the OP has shown <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ceTa4PX">here</a>. It was origanlly stated that this may be a training OP but then those in the know said that it just wouldn\'t make sense to be training as it is far too much of a risk of lives and public safety.

<p>Why is this relevant to PG? Because the building they breached and took a target from is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Girardi">Thomas Girardi</a> high profile attorney and currently representing Allison Mack in her case. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Chb1SZQ">This</a> is the building they raided. The current leaser is Eduardo G Sanchez and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/MOqRtUi">Guatemalan House of Culture</a> both the owner and leaser are attorneys. They both have investments in law firms, big pharma, casinos, labs and cold storage.. Go figure. OP also notes than on <a href="https://imgur.com/a/UVNtgmJ">the list of investments</a> that the Guatemalan House of Culture is NOT listed. Op also states that Girardi investments have been linked to human trafficking, cloning, organ harvesting and MK to name a few. Also said to have close ties to the Clintons and Clare Bronfman. </p>
<p>The leaser of the building also has <a href="https://imgur.com/a/G6i7dvK">questionable investments</a>.</p>
<p>As OP said, this seems to be a whole new rabbit hole..</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/7e58AnC">The building next door is also tied to Girardi and resembles a creepy looking temple</a> I noticed also that there is the high set roller door there for loading/unloading yet there appears to be a street light in front of it and a gutter.. Then to the left of that it looks like another door has been bricked up. Not sure what this place is but it looks creepy as fuck.</p>
<p>Girardi is also <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GbOB6kn">linked</a> to the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6c1fEH4">building on the left side</a> of the one that was raided. </p>

            I think that with this president we wont get any announcement about what happened till what ever was going on has been examined and talking about it wont  endanger any investigation....past presidents would of released info even if the info was a lie.

            , Since it appears MilSpec Ops Monkey was mistaken about Thomas Girardi being an
            <em>
             attorney
            </em>
            for NXIVM, I'm flairing this "Accuracy in Question".  Girardi is an attorney, but not for NXIVM. I dig into the details of his claims
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3028717/16721160">
             here

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The Guatemalan House of Culture building IS owned by Girardi and does have suspicious Yelp reviews,
            <a href="https://twitter.com/MilspecP/status/1095059150067982338">
             including pics that look very similar to the NXIVM Rainbow Cultural Garden childcare centers
            </a>
            . Photos of new plywood over doors also support the idea that
            <a href="https://twitter.com/JTweets1234/status/1094726078759718912">

            This is very interesting, but I don't see a Pizzagate connection here - sorry to say that. I wasn't able to find any evidence that Girardi is Mack's attorney like you say in your headline, or the attorney for any of the other NXIVM defendants.

            Wow👀!  Creepy AF x a billion.  Whatever kind of f*ckery goes on in there, it cannot be legal.  Excellent post, but most value this pic, as had not seen it anywhere on the Twat feed.  Reminds me immediately if Littke St James/Epstein temple, Comet Ping Pong basement that J. Ilovechildren first publicly noted, then after the controversy was outed he denied.  WTF?

            I bet they're filming for a future fake mass shooter/terrorist event so they can pass off the footage as the real thing once it happens, just like they did with Pittsburgh, Sandy Hook, and however many others they've pulled off.  No one's getting "cleaned up".

             Quite possible, that footage of cops running into that other school ("saint rose of Lima" or what ever) at sunset is what made me realize Sandy Hook was 100% fake.

            Looks like the last 2 helicopters extracted a body each. There's like 40 people being extracted by 6 helicopters. Why are their clothes so light colored? 
Whatever just happened here was BIG.

             It looks like they were wearing biohazard suits without the helmets/face covers. If you watch again, there are a couple of them still wearing their head protection. I'm guessing whatever they were raiding, and recovered those two people from, had massive amounts of chemicals being used.
            </p>
            <p>
             YOU DONT JUST EXTRACT 40+ AGENTS IN BIOHAZARD SUITS, IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT, USING MILITARY HELICOPTERS IN ONE OF THE DENSEST POPULATED AREAS IN THE COUNTRY. Something big went down, and the owners of these buildings makes me think they are finally going after the heavy hitters in the trafficking rings.

             Yes this was a massive operation, obviously extremely dangerous and high value  otherwise why the need for so many men and special ops too. I also wondered why their clothes look so bright..

              No, I believe they wore bio-suits.  Think about
              <em>
               why
              </em>
              military personnel would wear clothing that makes them HIGHLY VISIBLE, when conducting any operation under cover of night, in BLACK, hard to see helos.  Duh!

               They had the exercises in Long Beach.  The distraction.  These could be from a private unit where Trump took the best of the elite to handle the situation properly.  Plan Z possibly from new Space Force.  All

               The special ops forces wore white.  There was likely a biological weapon target intended to infect the population when the GHC is demolished next month.  There were witnesses who saw the breach and extraction.

                Yes I do. Just made a post with all the material so people can check it all out for themselves.
               </p>
               <p>
                I knew when I saw the original video there was no way that was training. Way too dangerous. Brother in law flew the 1960's equivalent of the Little Birds, known then as a Loach, in Vietnam. The way he met my sister was because I was helping him write a book about his tour of duty, so we spent a lot of time talking about how you fly those things and what the risks are so the combat scenes would be accurate.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is zero doubt in my mind this was a real operation.

                  The MSM cannot report freely on Classified military operations. I don't know what the exact legal limitations are, but they routinely don't report on them, even when they have the inside information.

             I've seen quite a few military experts talking about it and the person who posted much of this is military.
