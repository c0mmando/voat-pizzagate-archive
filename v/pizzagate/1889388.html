<p><em>Congressman Blake Farenthold from Texas who sits on the oversight committee told CNN this afternoon that there has to be a proper investigation into the D.N.C. leaks in view of developments on the Internet, i.e., the Seth Rich story and CNN aggressively challenged his reliance on fake news swirling on the internet. Farenthold refused to budge from his position. Will someone please make a proper post on this story as I do not have the computer skills to do so. There are important people listening to us.</em></p>

<p><strong>Here\'s a link to the CNN.com article, that includes a 2:02 CLIP from CNN\'s interview of Congressman Blake Farenthold</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/politics/blake-farenthold-seth-rich/"><strong>A Texas Republican Congressman just said something deeply irresponsible about Seth Rich\'s murder</strong></a></p>
<p>The interview NEVER directly mentions Seth Rich. Vague implications were made during the shortened clip (that part is noted in the transcript I\'ve posted in the comments). Yet, CNN writes this article, citing their interview with Congressman Farenthold, with a headline that directly refers to <strong><em>Farenthold\'s irresponsibility</em></strong> regarding Seth Rich\'s murder. CNN bending six ways from Sunday for the opportunity to say <em>DEBUNKED</em>, <em>UNFOUNDED</em>, and using the words <em>CONSPIRACY THEORY</em> <strong>SIX</strong> times in this one article.</p>
<p>CNN said they\'ll &quot;reconvene&quot; with Farenthold, &quot;after evidence comes out in public.&quot; <strong>If this was supposed to be a &quot;confrontation,&quot; CNN will have to do a lot better than these two stuttering fools.</strong> Farenthold was not the least bit intimidated, and seemed even a bit &quot;upbeat.&quot; Bravo to this guy, I\'ll take all the hope I can get. </p>

            Every Senator and Congressman should be doing the exact same thing.....I don't expect the Democrats too, of course, but Republicans should be jumping on this story, ......if they don't then something is very wrong, something smells......if the democrats can tout their Russian story, then why want the Republicans look into the Seth Rich story, investigate both and, see which one has legs.

               I fail to see how the DNC claims of "the Russians hacked us" isn't a conspiracy theory itself. They have produced NO evidence. The MPD saying SR's murder was a "botched robbery" (notice how that changed from robbery to "botched" robbery) is merely a theory as they have provided nothing as evidence to prove it was or wasn't.

            This is the committe that JASON Chaffetz leads but is leaving. The top guy is Trey Gowdy who was a federal prosecutor and even Comey is afraid of. Trey is scheduled to take control.
           </p>

            We should all call Congressman Farentholt office and flood him with support for taking a stand for truth.

            Turn David Brock, John Podesta, &amp; George Soros tactics on them. They will go after him ruthlessly now. Call Trey Gowdy's office as well.

              Agree completely except for Chaffetz. I believe it is going to be uncovered that he had a hand in covering over Extortion 17 &amp; that is why he is leaving suddenly.

             (Poppy, CNN): Republican Congressman Blake Farenthold of Texas. It is nice to have you here, and as we look at these pictures, let me just get you to weigh in because you are an attorney, and we learned overnight that the President is retaining, we're hearing, private counsel, aside from White House counsel, Marc Kasowitz, a big name attorney. Does it make sense to you, him bringing in private representation right now, is it a smart move?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              FARENTHOLD:
             </strong>
             Well listen, I'm happy it's gonna save the taxpayers potentially some money.

            <p>
             <strong>
              FARENTHOLD:
             </strong>
             Absolutely.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              HARLOW:
             </strong>
             Okay, but aside from that, in all honesty, are you, a et look, we've seen this before when White Houses have been in crisis, in the Clinton administration, around Iran contra the Reagan administration, what does this signal to you is it a good move for this president?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              FARENTHOLD:
             </strong>
             I think it's a defensive move, anybody whose facing some issues probably ought to have a lawyer. You know the saying they teach us in law school, is the person who represents themselves has a fool for a client. I don't think there's anything particularly there that Donald Trump needs to worry about, but when you've got people constantly pecking at you, you need some defense.
            </p>

              BERMAN:

             There constantly pecking at you, you actually have agreed with the president's
             <em>
              framing
             </em>
             of this. You
             <em>
              agree
             </em>
             that this is a
             <em>
              witch hunt

             </strong>
             Well, we just saw in the Intelligence Committee yesterday, the chief of the CIA was asked was there any evidence of collusion with the Russians on the part of the Trump campaign. And the answer, several times he was asked that, was "No, There was NOT." Yet we still see the constant level of attacks. You see
             <em>
              stories
             </em>
             that are coming in, based on
             <em>
              anonymous
             </em>
             sources,,,
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              BERMAN:
             </strong>
             Congressman, congressman, congressman (+ Harlow chiming in:
             <em>
              That's not fully what he said
             </em>
             ) yesterday, he was asked repeatedly if he saw evidence of
             <em>
              collusion
             </em>
             . He said he didn't deal with evidence. What
             <em>
              he
             </em>
             says is he saw intelligence which led him to believe there were
             <em>
              contacts
             </em>
             between Russia and people involved with the Trump campaign that raised questions that were unanswered when he left office, but he would not directly
             <em>
              say
             </em>
             he saw evidence there. It just gets the idea that there are these open questions.
            </p>

             <strong>
              FARENTHOLD:

             Well, again, there you're going, taking the worst possible spin on what's being said,
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              BERMAN:
             </strong>
             I'm just saying what he said. I'm not spinning, I'm just saying what he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              HARLOW:
             </strong>
             Yeaahh.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              BERMAN:

             That's all I'm doin.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              FARENTHOLD:
             </strong>
             Well, uh, you know, my takeaway from it was, that there wasn't really any evidence of anything improper, and we are spending hours and hours in Congress, with uh, folks saying, "investigate this, investigate that," yet they're not willing to give the investigators, which we now have with our special counsel, the chance to investigate it. It's just a constant,,,
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              HARLOW:
             </strong>
             So Congressman, let me, alright, you say we're taking the worst part, and that's your opinion, you're welcome to it, we watched the entire hearing as it sounds like you did as well. Let me read you a quote from former CIA Chief John Brennan, "By the time I left office on January 20th, I had unresolved questions in my mind, as to whether or not the Russians had been successful in getting US persons involved in the campaign, or not, to work in their behalf [unclear where this quote ends], again, either wittingly or unwittingly, he went on to say, "I saw interaction that raised question in my mind as to what was the true nature of it. Th, th, that is more than just, uh, you know, the worst part of it. That is what he said over and over again.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              FARENTHOLD:
             </strong>
             Again, he, he, constant questioning, he was unable to point to any specific evidence. And I think that's what we're going to continue to see there, and...

               do you think it's responsible

              to bring up, as a representative of the American people,

               there

              I think the same is true with what the media is doing with Trump. We're basing allegations on anonymous sources,,,

               HARLOW:

              Okay, so do you mean quoting the former CIA director who said, quote "I saw evidence worthy of investigation by the bureau to determine whether there was cooperation or collusion that was taking place. Think those are equivalent?

              I'm going back to the Comey memo. I'm going back to the Comey memo, which is based entirely on anonymous sources. So, my overall point is, this needs to be fully investigated...

Instead, we're hearing a constant barrage of anti-Trump, I'm going to call it "propaganda." [END

             Well, okay, again, if the propaganda is coming from the former CIA Director, if that's your opinion, you're entitled to it. If the FBI Director James Comey says he wrote the memo, will, if he says it out loud from his mouth, will that be propaganda?

             But to John's question, if the former FBI Director James Comey says, "Yes, indeed I wrote those memos, as WE have reported from multiple reliable sources, will that still be propaganda in your mind, Congressman?

             No, it won't, but we need to hear the facts and circumstances associated with that memo, and

              I'll tell ya, if he's such a big memo writer, there's

             Congressman Blake Farenthold, I think we all agree, we wanna see people speak and see the evidence for ourselves, out in public. We will reconvene this discussion after that point, cause I think that'll be interesting to have a talk with you then, too.

             Thanks LookingforRedPillers. Sorry that I have to work thru an intermediary.  I found the CNN reporters to be bold and obnoxious and expected some deference to a Congressman.  The BAMN  principles are at work here ; our opposition is deadly serious.  Good post.
