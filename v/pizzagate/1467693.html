            Please remember that wikipedia officially says that "Satanic Ritual Abuse of Children" does not exist in USA or UK.
           </p>
           <p>
            How may that be when Podesta art collection 100% represents something FBI/CIA/GOV say's doesn't exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's almost like the witches themselves are denying the existence of witch-craft, yet the people who attack CPP are called witch-hunters. Maybe the hunted are on to something, that indeed this really is a witch-hunt.

            That all makes sense to me. But I can't help but wonder at the reasons these folks don't address these arguments.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I was being correctly accused of something that would ruin my career, I would try to come up with an alibi as quickly as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the other hand, if I was being incorrectly accused of something that would ruin my career, I would worry that addressing would:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Set the precedent that I'm willing to entertain false accusations
            </li>
            <li>
             Provide lots of sound bites for career opponents to say "robertakarobin was linked to so-and-so... and denies it, of course!"
            </li>
            <li>
             ...and I might just be too busy, anyway.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But, then, if I was being correctly accused of something I might also just do all the things as if I was being incorrectly accused, to throw people off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ugh. It's such a chicken-and-egg thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess my frustration is that I really want to see these things proved one way or another, and people on both sides will always be able to make compelling arguments. I just want closure, but it sounds like that's too much of a luxury.

             Doesn't that mean it's not a legitimate argument? There's an overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence, but neither side has unequivocally been proven yet.

            The accused actually addressing the evidence and showing us why, piece by piece, the circumstances are all coincidence.  To be honest, I thought pizzagate was a bullshit distraction from evidence of basic wrongdoings in the podesta emails, at first.  Then ALL the circumstantial evidence overwhelmed me, and I just can't really imagine there isn't something sinister going on, anymore.  I'm pretty all-in.  It would take quite a lot, and boy it would be a relief to go back to normal life and conspiracy theories that kind of trail off to no where.  This one just keeps gaining traction, and the way its being handled in the main-stream media only serves to convince me more.  Thanks for putting me to the test, though.  This is heavy shit we're all thinking about, and we do need to be careful leveling accusations.  But its just so much evidence.

             To be fair, it's not really
             <em>
              evidence

              Here's an answer to your rhetoric.
             </p>
             <p>
              In USA 200,000 children a year go missing, worldwide its millions. If it were proven there were NO MISSING children that would be proof that Pizzagate is a fraud.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, its a FACT that millions of children per year just disappear, as if they were processed for meat and blood and just vanished from the earth. Thus pizzagate is an investigation as where did those children go.

               Yes, I agree there are lots of connections, and something must be going on behind the scenes. But how could one specifically
               <em>
                disprove
               </em>
               the child abuse aspect? If there's no way to disprove an argument, I feel like it's not a valid argument, which I think is the issue people tend to take with conspiracy theories. Facts can always be cherry-picked to support either side.

                This is not new. In McMartin there were 100's of children, but no proof ever found. Later GUNDERSON (FBI) proved the assertions were true satanic torture house in moutains, tunnels all proven, but at the time there was no proof.

                The common thread here is that LAW ENFORCEMENT is the pedophiles and they protect their masonic luciferian kind. That's why NO evidence is found LEO job in USA is to destroy evidence.

              </a>
              and started putting together a short-list off the top of my head...Its a crappy comment, but I'll copy paste it here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Probably just coincidence that a Department of Justice prosecutor whose specific wheelhouse is handling child trafficking and child porn cases liked the most questionable of the posts on alephantis' instagram, right? Just coincidence that Clinton speechwriters own the bookstore "politics and prose" down the street, and across the street there is a non-profit charity called beyond borders proclaiming to combat child sex-trafficking in Haiti, of all places. Probably just coincidence that Clinton herself was proven, through the wikileaks emails, to be personally involved in the pardon of Laura Silsby who allegedly was caught trying to grab 33 sum-odd kids out of that very same disaster-stricken country, most of whom weren't even orphans. Probably just coincidence that Podestas emails refer so much to pizza out of context, and that there are articles from years ago about his and his brother's weird taste in artwork. Probably just a figure of speech when they were referring to the torture chamber in their own home. Probably not unusual that there are proven to exist TUNNELS under these businesses. Probably not weird that Alephentis has been caught in a lie about the existence of a basement under his business, and that there used to be controversial artwork on the walls depicting strange acts with children. The video of majestic ape speaking at Sasha Lord's (a woman who self-proclaims to work with at-risk kids and books most of her events at comet ping-pong) is TOTALLY normal nothing to bat an eye at there. Should I keep going? The evidence is circumstantial, yes, but it is more than enough cause for reasonable suspicion, which is the central pillar of any serious investigation. This is a serious investigation, you cannot refute it just by saying "fake news". I resent you so much.
edit: oh and spirit cooking that's normal practice too. And alephentis' name translating to I love children.
more: Oh its just a coincidence that the Podesta bros don't even deny their connections to convicted pedophiles Dennis Hastert and Jeffery Epstein and that they appear in Epstein's butler's little black book, along with the Clintons, other politicians (including Trump), famous Hollywood and music industry icons.
             </p>
             <p>
              Like, I think that's a pretty overwhelming amount of coincidences for any reasonable person.  Its not like I'm a serious researcher, either, I just browse these forums and wikileaks a lot.

               I agree. These are all really alarming, and more than enough cause for suspicion. To my mind the Podestas and other parties involved should be falling over themselves to address these.
              </p>
              <p>
               But they're still coincidences, rather than "hard" evidence. I'm not attacking PizzaGate, I'm just trying to stay objective.

The Wet Cleaner disposes of the bodies, massive amount of missing children disappear never to be seen. Cannibalism and Ritual Satanic abuse what's left  is dissolved with LYE and flushed at the wet-cleaning shop. There is even a pharmacy where drugs can be obtained to keep children alive for next event.
....
Yes, its all a very deep story involving 1,000's of players, but the Franklin Cover-up showed that it goes to the white-house. CIA/SAUDI involvement on all property's in the immediate area of Besta-Pizza, DOJ involvement, but always superficially denied by BOTS.
...
IF all claims were false the story would have died.
Like Flynn-JR said yesterday "Follow all leads no matter how insane until proven false",

               <p>
                largely PIZZAGATE is just about building a HUGE dossier on the WASH-DC child sex trafficking history and network.
               </p>
               <p>
                It may be left for future generations to search the DC sewage treatment plants to find the DNA.

                I know, and this post is really constructive for our community.  We need to take a step back and ask questions like this.  Investigations, however, do operate under suspicions, they are never objective as long as you have suspects.  Its okay to lose some of your objectivity in pursuit of the truth when you suspect something to this degree, in my opinion.  Real investigators certainly do.  The tone of that comment was addressing a huge jerk of a Schill over on reddit.  Its hard not to get emotional.  We don't have to hold ourselves to the standards of a professional investigation, here.  We mean well.  If we are 100% wrong I will start giving credence to the official 9/11 narrative.  Also, I'd rather never see the hard evidence.

                 Thanks for hearing me out. I think we all just want to know the "right" answer, one way or the other. I don't really like the act of arguing, but I do like to feel like my perception of the world is correct.

                  Patience is key.  If you haven't noticed, this is really taking off like wildfire.  Mainstream media printing the word Pizzagate, even in an attempt to discount it, is helping it spread.  I saw it printed in places today I never would have dreamed of a couple weeks ago.  I think its much more likely we'll see more strange events tied to the subject than refutations.  I believe the population of the world is more awoken than ever in history, and if this is real, it can't possibly stay suppressed.

              James Alefantis is/was Brocks BOY-TOY.

             <p>
              Given his composure I would say that James Alefantis is the strawman, that he's an actor playing the part of a man defamed.

             <p>
              The problem is that the masonic order takes a blood pledge for life not to divulge, thus none of the perpetrators will talk, and as all our research has shown, Pizzagate is about snuff-video, cannibalism, and occult anal rape, and blood letting. Thus the victims will never be found.
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              What can be found? 
Like Flynn-JR said keep looking and any lead no matter how insane follow until you can prove not true.
With 100,000 world wide looking evidence will be found.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sadly since this involves CP, the evidence can never be shown, which is an investigation paradox.

              There are means to upstream analyze sewage waste, if they're disposing corpses at wet-cleaners with LYE, there are ways. I read some years ago that the CIA had tech to lead DNA investigation up stream to find Bin-Laden, so this tech exists.

              I think the user is trying to say its actually MUCH bigger than this restaurant and that block.  I think he's right.  I think this is a key straight to the biggest human trafficking conspiracy ever, and probably MKultraa.  BUT.  This restaurant and the owner's sloppiness on social media and the way it corroborates with the podesta emails are the best leads available to me, anyway, therefore it is about the restaurant and its owner to an extent.

               There's too many links to CPP and JA to say there's nothing to see there, obviously. This is only the start, once the true extent of this operation is exposed I'll be surprised if every orphanage and foster service on the planet isn't involved after all the governments runs them all. Just look
At Saville he had fucking children's hospitals named after him. Sickening shit! Someone needs to link this with the Royals, it will be in due time. David Icke has been saying this for years now

               I think the CIA would call this a bone.
              </p>
              <p>
               When a known CIA operative like Alex Jones, plays on emotions for weeks about CPP, and then a guy walks in with a gun, at the very time an arab lawyer that tied to the case witnesses the gunman, and the arab-lawyer last to leave, then the next day the arab-lawyer appears on alex-jones. First Alex Jones crys about the 'children' the last few days he calls pizzagate "rumors", rather than 'real'.
              </p>
              <p>
               CPP has nothing to do with PizzaGate it may have been a bone all along, we know that besta-pizza pulled their 'I fuck boy" logo first day, we know its related to andrew-kline DOJ,
              </p>
              <p>
               Sadly the pizzagate investigation has largely been managed, that said there are 100,000 ppl worldwide, and most are ignoring the managers.

              <hr/>
              <p>
               Why is BUCKS ( also owned by MR.CPP ) ignored which has a basement? Why R all the other Saudi's owned biz on the block with known PEDO symbols ignored over CPP?
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe 90% focus on CPP, but that still means 10,000 ppl are looking at the big picture.

                Just feels like more information is surfacing every day from many avenues.  Its a beautiful thing, good people trying to route these vipers.  I hope we accomplish something.  It would be the biggest investigative break ever, probably, and broken by citizens.  A true revolution.

            there would have to be massive transparency on the side of the accused, which seems to be what any normal person would do in this situation. I understand why political figures would be advised to not address these claims, but people like alefantis have no reason to be so dismissive if they are innocent. If I were in that position, I would invite people on personal tours through the store, and have local law enforcement inspect the premises. that would just be the start. Innocent people would also be smart to engage the accusers and justify these "misunderstandings".. It seems like the opportunities for measures like these have past though..

              Which outside agency would be widely-accepted by PizzaGate subscribers? Short of Julian Assange or Edward Snowden themselves, I can't think of much — and even then, people would probably say they were coerced.

               Well I can mention one that has always bothered me. Professional liar Alex Jone say's there are 100's of 1,000's of reference to pizza in Podesta email, not true in all 55,000 emails there are about 18 which reference pizza, which is less than 1% of total content,
              </p>
              <p>
               99% of the emails are largely constituent brown nosing for HRC
              </p>
              <hr/>
              <p>
               IMHO trumps-kids @ 4Chan begat pizzagate to destroy HRC, but they started pizzagate which now has a viral life of its own, and the issue is HOW does the CIA kill its CHILD? Without killing their ability to create the next pizzagate hysteria?

              Pizzagate got  people interested in child-sex-slavery, which is HUGE in USA, 200,000 children/year go missing and the FBI and MSM keeps it silent.
             </p>
             <p>
              4CHAN retards for TRUMP got the pizzagate meme going on Comet-Ping-Pong, where to date NO EVIDENCE of crime has ever been found. Now a retard under the spell of Alex Jones walks into CPP, and MSM can call all insanity around CPP as Pizzagate.

              Pizzagate is Franklin, McMartin, J Edgar Hoover, MK-ULTRA, and millions of missing children from CIA led war's
Its about the OWNERSHIP of DC by Saudi Elite who are provided children to rape &amp; murder.
Pizzagate is a VIEW into the dark bowels of the USA EMPIRE
