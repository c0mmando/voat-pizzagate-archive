            Let's face it there is something pretty sketchy going on in that state with regards to this. There is a reason that all the Seattle rock stars die young and that Chris Cornells charity for children didon't spend more than 10 percent helping kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also where Tony Rodriguez was held as a pizzagate slave before he was sold off to the military programs.

            Misleading. And appeasement story.

            This is all baited trap shit. For all we know they could have created some of these situations. A lot of people would argue this is entrapment too. I'd be very interested to see the texts exchanged.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHERE ARE THE ORGANIZATIONS?  Why do 1/3 of the people in organized pedo crews never get their identity published?  More recruitment likely..
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the opposite of what we want. This is how they actually build their networks in some cases.

            This is related to PG as it is about an organized large pedophile ring of sex offenders looking to sexually abuse children and the organized effort to combat these horrible crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             From the article:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            " A multiagency law enforcement operation in Washington’s tri-cities area targeting individuals intending to sexually exploit children resulted in the arrest of 26 suspects, including five individuals with access to children at risk of being abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            The operation, which took place July 5-10, was the result of a probe by the Washington State Patrol’s (WSP) Missing and Exploited Children Task Force (MECTF) including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).
           </p>
           <p>
            “The number of predators interested in sexual contact with minors is overwhelming and made clear by these targeted operations,” said Brad Bench, special agent in charge of HSI Seattle. “Interagency cooperation is paramount in combatting this crime. We work tirelessly with our partners to protect our youth from these perpetrators.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Undercover agents communicated online with individuals interested in sexually abusing children through various websites. The agents received hundreds of responses from would be perpetrators who agreed to meet with undercover detectives posing as children in order to engage in sexual activity.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Children are becoming increasingly vulnerable to sexual predators due to the growth of the internet,” says WSP Chief John R. Batiste.” Thanks to the hard work by our law enforcement and prosecutor partners we are able to make Washington communities safer for our families.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Additional follow-up investigations are currently underway to identify child victims and arrange the appropriate assistance for any abuse they may have been exposed to. Crimes investigated range from attempted rape of a child to communicating with a minor for immoral purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the eighth such operation in Washington state since August 2015. MECTF, an Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force affiliate, includes partners in federal, state and local law enforcement. The “Net Nanny Operation” series, conducted throughout Washington, has netted a total of 115 arrests and rescued 21 identified victims."
