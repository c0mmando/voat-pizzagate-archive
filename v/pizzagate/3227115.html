            I suspect his website was taken down at the advice of a lawyer.    I also suspect since the passing of the child victims act, a lawsuit will be filed soon.   If you google Matthew Lazarus, Child Victims Act, you can watch a video of him speaking at the capital.      Also, if you visit the Westchester County Taxation website, for $20 you can view Marsh Sanctuary’s incorporation documents filed electronically.       The owners of Marsh Sanctuary include  Nelson Peltz, Tommy Mottola, and Stanley Jaffee.      Aren’t some of those names friends with Epstein? Also, apparently Christian has a new project, which can be found via his Instagram.   It’s called the head hunter.     You should check it out.

            1Lol.  This is pretty comical shit.  So far, even with just the information you have, you could easily find out who I am.  You know that though, I suspect, it's why you went with deflection.
           </p>
           <p>
            You handlers have been busy since I posted that btw.  Over a dozen bites.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as your insinuation that I'm some kind of employee or agent, you know better than that.  Or should by now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thing is, I really really do know you.  I know your generation.  I've been watching, pushing, and fighting against what you've done to the world for my entire life.  I know you.
           </p>
           <p>
            We were the butt of jokes to you 'people' for about a year before you decides we weren't interesting enough to care about.  You decided being distracted by something else,  ANYTHING else was better than being confronted with the inescapable proof of your narcissism and solopsist obsession with 'me me me mine mine mine!'.  Your interest faded in just over a year.  We don't get that option.  We get to do this every day for the rest of our lives and it never stops for us, ever.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been watching more closely since I got out of service.  The ONLY reason the vast majority of you bqqmers can convince yourselves you even give half a shit about these kids is because the correct jew told you to.
           </p>
           <p>
            You care right now because it's politically convenient to your handlers.  When the election is over you will once again forget any of us ever happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's not a prophecy boomer, that's a pattern of behavior.  You're being played and nudged toward 'muh pizzagate' because they need a foil to use against the other group of jews you handed the country (and us) to in the eighties.  And when the correct jew tells you to care about something else, you'll go pretend to care about something else.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has been your generational pattern of behavior for fifty years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever you believe you've accomplished here on this far flung free speech life raft with all your scrapbooking and grousing, it is truvial.  It has accomplished exactly nothing that really matters.  It is a place for you to come and virtue signal at each other until your handlers tell you to be outraged about something else.  You don't actually care about any of it, and the proof of that is that youre sitting here virtue signaling and being outraged at me for callung you out instead actually doing anything of substance.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you keep on keeping on there rabbi.  Do you understand why no one cares about anything you hqve to say yet?  Because your programmed pre responses are so utterly predicted and hard wired into you that hearing them is unecessary.  All we have to do to figure put what you believe is put on Hannity or Tucker or Ru Paul.  Your talking points are their talking points.
           </p>
           <p>
            So no.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't actually know.
           </p>
           <p>
            I only care about things that are true.  And the pattern of your behavior and motivations dictate more than any other indicator that these things are simply true.

             Tim Burton is one of the key pieces to this puzzle. In fact, I’ve realized that if we played connect the dots (dots representing PG’s major known concerns) he is connected to almost all of them.

            What a harrowing story.  And, try to forgive yourself.  You did nothing wrong, although I understand your regret. And ignore that venom-spewing shill. Keep up the good work.

              I remember you DMing me at the time, asking about what to do and we both were worried it was a set up. As I recall, that was only very shortly after Trump won. Security was a huge concern back then. People were constantly getting doxxed and threatened -- Bigfish, Liz Crokin, Abortionburger, Will Craddick. Then there were all the "suicides". Scary times.

              You don't get to just shrug.  Fuck yourself and fucking die in a fucking fire boomer.  I KNOW YOU.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know the limitations of your boomer ability to commit to anyrhing outside your personal fakery.  I suffered for it for years.
             </p>
             <p>
              So now this guy is out there and not onve, but now twice, your bqqmer narcissism is going to cost him everyrhing.
             </p>
             <p>
              You are a fucking disease.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I was here long before you boomer, and will be long after.

                Boomer, your penchant for straw men, and your ability to contort your own perceptions aside, even you have to be aware that this is not reddit.  The same rules do not apply here.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, if you've warped your own thinking into believing an account's age is the signifier of it's user's time here, you're gonna have a bad time.
               </p>
               <p>
                Lol have you really been operating under that belief this whole time?  AHAHAHAHAHAH.  User incompetence that aloows you to convince yourself that you have some kind of 'internet points' like this was reddit.

                Piss off coward.  Any excuse to prevent you from having to match convictions with courage.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your cowardice made you drop your Gethsemne cup, and you are at your Rubicon boomer.  I give 0 fucks about you and your litany of excuses.  I do this for a living.  If that veteran is out there, right now, and suffering, you put him there.
               </p>
               <p>
                If that veteran is dead you killed him.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am one of the kids you're pretending to care about bitchtits.  All grown up.  We all told you for thirty years what you were letting the jew do to us, and then, as now, it was a blizzard of excuses and 'not my problems' and 'oh someone shoukd do something's'.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will find him.  I will do whatever I can to help him.  I have the courage my convictions bring me because they are True.  You failed because yours are not.
               </p>

                  So back to lying deflecting and bullshit from you.  Shocking.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Here's  hint you mentally diseased cumstain.  Boystown NE, Wegner Elementary.  Ringing any bells?  Or did you let the jew memory hole us along with every other glaringly obvious ring.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As far as the rest of your deflective bullshit diatribe goes, no one who matters gives a shit what you defective worthless cunts think.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The fact that there is such a thing as pizzagate at all, that it took you blind geriatric narcissists 30 years to listen, is evidence enough of your worth.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm done with this.  Twice you have failed this veteran for no other reason than to be egotistical and spiteful and obstinate.  Do you think he or any of thise kids give a flying fuck about your excuses?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Man, you guys are like some kind of dark miracle.
