            : Here's an article that explains the matter:

            Indeed, this is a pushback compared to the proposed change of law suggested earlier this year, which would have made any sexual activity between a person under 15 and an adult to be classified as rape.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             France passes new law on child rape, sexual harassment
            </p>
            <p>
             French lawmakers have passed a law that can impose fines for street harassment and make it easier for sex with a child under 15 to be classified as rape. But critics say the law does not go far enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             French parliamentarians endorsed a new law on sexual violence on Wednesday, described by the government as a signal of deep social change in the European country. While it passed with 92 in favor and none against, left-wing lawmakers abstained, saying it did not go far enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most notably, the new law, which goes into effect in September, makes it easier for sexual intercourse between an adult and a minor under 15 to be charged as rape.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under current legislation, sex with a child under 15 years of age is considered an offense, but prosecutors need to prove it was forced in order to classify it as rape.
            </p>
            <p>
             In November last year, a French court acquitted a 30-year-old man on the charge of raping an 11-year-old because it could not be proven that the minor did not consent. A separate case, involving a 28-year-old and another 11-year-old, also caused outrage in February this year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the new law, judges would be able to classify intercourse with a minor as rape if the sex resulted from an "abuse of vulnerability." Specifically, sex between adults and children under 15 would be considered rape if it were to be found that the adult abused the child's lack of understanding to engage in the act.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest legal authority, an earlier draft text that said minors under 15 would be assumed not to have given consent to sex with an adult could have been ruled unconstitutional.
             <em>
              (fucking pedos)

           <p>
            NB: Sex with a minor under 15 will still be charged as an 'offense' in any case; so that France hasn't 'legalized pedophilia'. And it hasn't 'killed any age of consent laws'.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             the legal onus is now on the child to present evidence that they were forced or coerced
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            No, it can be considered rape even when the child hasn't been forced, but the child must show that it didn't understand what the adult was up to in this situation.

            Lots of troubling aspects to this whole story.  First of all, according to MSM reports, this all stems from a rape case of an 11 year old in 2009.  The mother contacted the authorities and a 29 year old man was arrested.  However he said that the child told him she was 14, nearly 15, and she consented to sex, and that they had 'flirted' before.  (That's how pedos think - read the academic literature on them).  Anyway, the judge acquitted the case based on what the rapist said.  So all this talk in the media about younger children being old enough to consent is bullshit for the originating case that sparked the whole thing.

             French newspaper, Le Parisien, reported that the prosecution

            <p>
             It was in January 2010 that the case started when Justine's family discovered her pregnancy. Until then, the child had never mentioned his aggression. The "bad meeting" took place one evening in August 2009:
             <strong>
              Congolese origin
             </strong>
             , Justine, who then lives in Nevers (Nièvre) spends her holidays with an uncle. While she plays with her cousin at the foot of the building, a man approaches her.
            </p>
            <p>
             Justine has always maintained that she gave her age to this stranger, who asked her to accompany him to the park, which she accepted.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Put simply, the child was black.  Is that the reason the French court acquitted the man? Why is it that the name of the judge does not appear in any article?

             She is a devastated mother, stunned by the verdict. Chantal * is the mother of Justine *, remained cloistered in her room, without going to school, after the decision of the Assize Court. The young woman, now 20 years old, is a BTS student. "This man has destroyed the life of my daughter, who has fallen into her trap. After the rape, she was placed in a family because she was pregnant, it was to avoid contact with neighbors. "
            </p>
            <p>
             Chantal returns the question in her head: "I thought I was relieved by the justice but this verdict increases my anxieties. The jurors, are they parents too, anyway? They would like to take their child to the street and sleep with? "
            </p>
            <p>
             Stéphanie, a street educator at the Interstice association in Nevers (Nièvre), has known Justine since the material time:

             </strong>
             She was prostrate, inhibited. Today, she speaks to me a little more easily because we have a relationship of trust. "The educator attended the trial:" When she told the rape at the bar, she was crying. But during the rest of the hearing, she did not move. She suffered very honorably, .. "

            what is your evidence for this assertion?
           </p>
           <p>
            You directed us to an article written in  fench hidden by a paywall.
           </p>
           <p>
            France has never had an age of consent  when it came to involuntary sexual relations while the USA  has sex abuse laws that presumed lack of consent when under a certain age.
           </p>
           <p>
            France had a consent law of age 15.for marriage and birth control..purposes. And it had rape laws prohibiting any penetration by violence  or coercian  regardless of age. This created a gap whereby children  could be groomed and agree to sex or could agree to sex by virtue of their naivete.  Recall my lecture here  recently about the technical difference between child abuse laws and age of consent laws?
           </p>
           <p>
            In March 2018  the issue arose wherein  an 11 year old allowed herself to be picked up by a 28 year old  and " willingly"had sex with him.  A judge ordered him to be charged with rape but the rape laws did nt apply.
           </p>
           <p>
            Macron who did not have sex with his wife before age 15 , supported new legislation to correct this injustice and at last report in the Atlantic Monthly there was wide spread suppor for this new law. The new law called for statutory rape if a child was under age 15.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since,, I dont speak french, I cannot tell you if the law passed.

             nearly all moot points. this isn't the stone age and your not helpless. should the evidence be prechewed and delivered to your nest? allow me: perhaps find someone with access to a paywall? can there be any way to find out how to get french words to turn into english?  holy guacamole i hope so.
            </p>
            <p>
             see, i've been looking into this and checking this place out for a long time. those of you who are not and can never be light bearers...you can start preparing to exit this reality whereby you think you get to not get to the point. human beings who's brains are still not fully fucking formed are children. they are not for sex or marriage they know nothing of either in a healthy way. little dorks like you go round and round never getting to the point.
            </p>
            <p>
             your weak and helpless. "lecture about the technical difference between..." shut the fuck up. real people are out here doing real shit to spread word directly to the faces of the people that are gonna help me squash the guts out of anyone who thinks this shit is alright.
            </p>
            <p>
             can't be helped that no one else has been able to do it.  move out of the way your clogging up the works obvious freak.

            MH, could you edit this to clarify there is debate over the implications of this law and include some of the more detailed information from the translations given in comments below? The title you've given this is pretty click-baity. We don't want to look like we're pushing fake news. Thank you.

            Your title is wrong. There has never been a specific age of consent in France. So it wasn’t suddenly made legal in March. They seemingly just did not change the law as was proposed.

             yes ive since learned that. Turns out France's laws were always pissweak (although modern interpretations of that law may err in favour of the perpetrator given the islamisation and postmodern devolution of moral relativity)
            </p>
            <p>
             from that Atlantic story:
            </p>
            <p>
             "While French law does not include a fixed age of consent, it does recognize sexual minors. A sexual minor can still legally be considered able to give their consent—in this case, their perpetrator would be charged with sexual infraction, not rape. In the 19th century, the age at which children were considered sexual minors was 11; later, it was raised to 13, and since 1945, it has been 15. Meanwhile, the issue of consent—or the failure to establish a clear age of consent—festered. In 2005, spurred on by a case involving the sexual abuse of three children under the age of five, France’s highest court ruled that sexual “coercion is presumed to be present in cases involving children of a very young age,” and that lawmakers must establish an age at which it should be assumed that a child could not consent. Exactly what this age should be was left up to judges to decide. While a law was passed in February 2010 specifying that “moral coercion” could result from a “difference in age,” what that age actually should be was, again, left unclear. In 2015, France’s highest court reaffirmed that there is no set age of consent when it comes to sexual relations."

            This is part of a wider agenda to legalise child rape so as not to be culturally insensitive to the effluent tide of "new Europeans" infesting western civilisation.  Sweden legalised child marriage in order to be more inviting to its Muslim infestation rather than enforce its anti child rape laws (Swedistani authorities had previously warned girls to take a different route to school or stay indoors rather than expect to be protected from Muslim child rapists; privileged little white princesses that they are!) and the supreme court of Iceland declared that child rape is fine within Iceland if one comes from a culture where raping children is acceptable (namely Muslim).  German courts have on two separate occasions let Muslim rapists go free, in what must surely be precedent setting cases.  One saw a Turkish migrant walk free after raping a 23 year old German woman because violent rape might only be considered, "...a night of wild sex" in his homeland, according to the judge.  Another case saw a 10 year old German boy so badly sodomised by an Iraqi migrant (who had a "sexual emergency") that he was rushed to the hospital in utter agony.  Although initially jailed for the offence, he was later freed because his lawyer successfully argued that the prosecution failed to prove that the
            <em>
             child did not consent
            </em>
            .  Therefore by implication 10 year olds can consent to be sodomised in Germanistan.  Bongistan has long protected Muslim child rape gangs (who have raped, it is estimated, upwards of a million English girls), going so far as to arrest victims and the family members thereof, the most notorious recent example being the internment of Tommy Robinson.  This is the absolute state of the world in which we live.

            So France has no age of consent eh?  Hmmmm....this explains why all those weird movies with child actresses exploring their "sexuality" come from France...it seems they're huge on pedophilia over there but they sell it as "art" and it gets film awards.  Also I heard Belgium is a hotbed of exploitation...heart of the U.N and all...

            Time for a real revolution. These kikes in power have declared war on the goyim a long time ago.  Their laws are illegitimate at this point. Are we seriously going to allow the (((legal))) molestation of these children?  they already cry anti-semitism when we try to ban (((circumcision))). There's not other solution.

            France didn't have an age of consent before the proposal to set the age at 15, and since the proposal didn't make it into the bill to be voted on, it simply continues to be business as usual for child rapists in that country.

            March 6, 2018
           </p>
           <p>
            "The French government has proposed making 15 the age of consent for sex after two high-profile cases in which men escaped rape convictions despite having intercourse with 11-year-old girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             It would be a first for France, which does not currently have an age of consent.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            While the punishment for rape when a victim is younger than 15 carries a heftier penalty under French law (20 years), prosecutors must prove that the sex was forced.
           </p>
           <p>
            As The New York Times explains, "In France, as long as 'violence, coercion, threat or surprise' is not proven, sexual intercourse with a minor — even one under 15 — is considered an atteinte sexuelle, which is an infraction and not a crime." "

            unfortunately most don't realize how lucky we are to have Trump as our President during these dark times. Things are bad here in America, yes; but so much worse in other countries. Whether we like it or not, there is a war coming, with its shadow already here. how much longer will we tolerate this filth?

             Here is the bill in question according to the French government's website
            </a>
            .  The key portion is as follows:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Renforcer l’arsenal juridique permettant de punir les viols et agressions sexuelles commis à l’encontre des mineurs de moins de 15 ans, pour mieux protéger les enfants : les éléments du code pénal permettant d'établir le viol ou l'agression sexuelle sur un mineur de moins de 15 ans sont précisés, en prévoyant que la contrainte morale ou la surprise "peuvent résulter de l’abus de l’ignorance de la victime ne disposant pas de la maturité et du discernement nécessaire pour consentir à ces actes" (article 2 du projet de loi). Les moyens juridiques mis à la disposition du juge sont ainsi considérablement renforcés. Le projet de loi prévoit également un doublement des peines encourues en cas d’atteinte sexuelle avec pénétration. Il prévoit enfin que si la Cour d’assises estime non caractérisés les faits de viols sur mineur de moins 15 ans reprochés à un accusé majeur, la Cour devra se prononcer sur l’existence du délit d’atteinte sexuelle, ce qui évitera une décision d’acquittement.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            From what I can read of other commentary and my very poor knowledge of French, the key part appears to be that it doesn't just say, "If you have sex with someone under the age of 15, it's rape," but rather it says, "If you have sex with someone under the age of 15, and there's some abuse due to the victim lacking maturity or judgement to consent, it's rape."
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone wishes to clarify me, please do so.

             I get it, you're saying their intention of the legal argument is to provide scope to remove legal jeopardy for relationships with minors who are 'mature enough to consent'
            </p>
            <p>
             but of course the riposte to that is, in whose fucking opinion ? every 12 year old on this planet thinks they're old enough to drive.

              You'll still be charged, it'll just be 'sexual abuse,' which is a much more minor charge, from what I've been reading for the past half hour on this.

              Thanks. I found articles related to this but I was hoping for a story explaining how it's legal to rape 11 year olds because of a law passed today as the OP suggests.

            TAKE NOTE: Nobody rose up to fight this, and expecting that it will go any different in America is foolish. We have tranny children here ALREADY, and nobody did a thing. Other means of agitation/radicalization or commie removal must be found, or things will continue to get

            look at this disgusting News. I was having a alright day, but now. Now I am so angry! I don't understand the thinking behind this at all! Gay people with their stupid fucking ill brains need therapists.  I thought the same for pedos and animal fuckers. But seeing france just take a knee is despicable and I wish death on all of them! Fuck their stupid crazy feelings pieces of shit! Fuck you Macron you WEAK NIGGER!

               Is this artist depicting a  future dystopia  or events occurring  now? There is definitely a white/black dichotomy in this artist's work.  I am  not up on South African politics but apparently white farmers are  being raped and tortured and murdered by black gangs.   Biracial law enforcement &amp; military has been unable to stem this wave of violence.

               White people who have dominated .so many parts of the world  are  realizing  that they are eventually going to be outnumbered.  We have to find a way to cohabit  and protect our children.

             It's already happened. They are full of nuclear power plants. Just look at what happened at Fukushima. Perhaps that is how their elected officials are controlled.

               Well, if they join a mosque then the guns will be free,  fully automatic and they can get a few grenades for their vacations in Sweden.  But, uh, they will have to agree that paedophilia is in the way of Allah, so, I guess they won't be down with fighting the gubmint so long as the Jizya keeps flowing.
