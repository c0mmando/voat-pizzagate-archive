           </p>
           <p>
            This is the heart of pizzagate. There have been many posts trying to explain this. In NAZI germany trauma based mind control was perfected. At that time it was already know from ancient cultures especially Egypt that sodomy would affect the nerve endings at the base of the spine. See Osiris.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Sigmeund Freud first began his experiments in Vienna following WW1 he was focused on trauma shock in soldiers "shell shock" There was a mysterious condition that appeared in young combat soldiers. Even if not physically injured they came back seemingly "broken inside" PTSD was unknown. The soldiers seemingly lost the fight or flight response and fell into freeze conditions which had only been observed in animals. These soldiers were often executed for being weak or mentally ill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Freud and others including Hitler &amp; Stalin were all in Vienna. Freud decided it would be beneficial to measure what exactly breaks the human soul. He went about conducting experiments by intentionally traumatizing subjects. Freud was also a vicious pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aleister Crowley "the beast" and founder of Thelema was a self-destined satanist but also a British M15 agent. He was using Black sex Majic rituals to bring forth Lucifer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Freud and Crowley and intelligence agencies combined this knowledge and Germany was used for state sponsered human experiments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Freud had discovered that sexually assaulting children prior to age 3 through sodomy would induce severe dissociation like he witnessed in soldiers. A broken soul with the fight or flight system shattered as well as memory and conscious States.
           </p>
           <p>
            The goal became traumatizing young children and creating alters which could be triggered and programmed for future spies, assasins, sex slaves, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hitler and NAZI camps were used for this by Dr.Mengele who would take whatever child they wanted and perform horrific experiments. At this time Eugenics was at play and as understanding of the Pineal Gland as "the third eye" came to light an attempt began to genetically alter human beings that carried certain traits that through gene expression allowed the Pineal Gland to remain Uncalcified. This corresponds to the Coloboma which is an outward expression of Pax 2 &amp; 6 (help

            This corresponds to certain genetic history and is an extremely rare occurrence. Although seen in most world leaders families. This was a breeding program that was initiated and maintained to current day. #CARIS...

           <p>
            When WW11 ended segments of the US was already involved in this. Freud had started the Tavistock Center....a massive human experiment.
           </p>
           <p>
            The top OSS agent Allen Dulles was involved and used Dr.Carl Jung as his agent #488....Jung disagreed with Freud on some issues but was part of the Psychoanalytic movement.

            Unbeknownst to most Americans wealthy politicians and families had financed Hitler. As well as the Vatican which was used by the SS to help indoctrinate German children.
           </p>
           <p>
            After WW11 the OSS merged into the Vatican CIA Jesuits answering only to the Pope. In 1948 the CIA was unconstitutionally founded in the US and went into black secret programs bringing the very same NAZI scientists into the US in Operation Paperclip. They were given new names and massive experiments were continued including MK Ultra. All hid from congress until JFK found out and was assasinated after threatening to break the CIA into a thousand pieces.
           </p>
           <p>
            All cases since then Franklin cover-up, the Finders, the Children of God (Julian Assange) in Australia, pizzagate, pedogate, etc. are the outcome.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hitler and his scientists discovered Flouride would completely calcify the Pineal Gland in essence numbing out the population. The US began putting Flouride in drinking water and pushing it for toothpaste and dentistry intentionally.

            That is all for now. Millenial Falcon will delete this I am sure but I had to get the truth out. There are many nuances to this of course. Pedophiles started it and made it a National Security secret and program basically institutionalizing child rape and torture for the good of the country. It is still happening.

             This is not about "jews" and this is not about "banking." They are just subsets of parallel construction to hide the families who can invoke their children without applying the archaic means mentioned above. Or the technology now deployed by the government as a consumer good, to track and manipulate un-aware children/adults/latents.

             I would weigh Jem777 comments very carefully, though. She claimed, among other things, that I traced her IP and sent thugs to her house to beat her up, which is a giant crock of shit. :-)

                 I hope you do not find this reply too abstract. And I also hope you are up to date with 'conspiracy' and 'non-conspiracy' alike.

                <p>
                 A - Chemical spraying; proven, using aluminum, barium and strontium; proven, are every and on every-thing. Nano particulates
                </p>
                <p>
                 B - Ionization of the atmosphere 24/7; proven, for weather control, radar, and transmission reflection/bouncing off of clouds; proven
                </p>
                <p>
                 C - X-rays; proven and old, Aura cameras; proven and old (commercially available); Kirlian photography; proven and old (also stolen and misattributed by the CIA)
                </p>
                <p>
                 D - Radio and 5G dosing, whether intentional or not; proven and old
                </p>
                <p>
                 E - GrillFlame, Stargate, Gateway program, Sunstreak; proven and old
                </p>
                <p>
                 F - TSA scanners work very efficiently, too efficiently
                </p>
                <p>
                 G - Supposed bloodlines of the royals, religious, and initiated
                </p>
                <p>
                 H - Children missing (sex crimes are a version in some cases, but also an excuse others)
                </p>
                <p>
                 I - CIA/DOD heavily invested in training the masses for jobs yet invented during the 50s, 60s and 70s (Created recruitment agencies and hiring agencies, etc. to source and test the general public and incoming immigration schemes already play)
                </p>
                <p>
                 J - Heavy religious indoctrination, lets say, from the 20s - 60s, until drugs entered the mass consciousness, literally, also introduced by the intel groups
                </p>
                <p>
                 K - Lots of secret societies and fraternities around for thousands of years. Not just about clubbing around and policy making, but real ancient knowledge about mind and body; proven through the contemporary term "occultism" as well as much dated research from 1700-1800s
                </p>
                <p>
                 L - CIA could pull soft images from Tube TVs in the 80s. It makes perfect sense that a nice flatscreen these days, works as well as an MRI or X-box kinetic in reading both physical presence and biometric data, at the least, capture an aura.
                </p>

                 Spray enough people with specific materials that further radiate their bodies, making scanning easier, from the airport to a drone flying high above. Perhaps to stop child-lose, perhaps to find specific children exhibiting specific traits that can be identified via their auras. Knowing these children are in abusive families, part of elite families, or just doing fine but show great 'potential,' would make for a highly advanced tracking method. Saturate the atmosphere with enough radiation, varying wave-lengths at different elevations and altitudes, and you have a thorough and efficient mechanism for discovering your next recruits.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Step away from this for a moment; consider the online recruitment games; Cicada, Tengri, Capstone, etc. These are generally intellectually based tests, but eventually lead into ancient history and code-breaking, not just computer codeâ€”all of this is proven by years of existing research by the participants themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Knowing CIA/Germany were heavily involved in mindkontrol, and knowing they also performed research to prove physic ability, remote viewing, and astral projection capabilities; consider the scope of these things in the hands of a few affluent groups who contain historical records and research that stipulate the same things. Perhaps calling them wizards, witches, oracles, soothsayers, heretics.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Just consider what you might do knowing that in order to reach the young, you must find the young. And consider the complete media obfuscation and total day-to-day bonkers-ness of the circus we find ourselves in... average people not knowing what the same issues arise over and over again. Most agree the news is controlled, in-fact JFK made it point to ask the media to stop revealing secrets. Later the CIA took over.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Consider the ramifications of psyops like Q, Ciacada, 3301, Tengri, and the tests people went through.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Are ALL the children missing, or have many been recruited? Is it really all about sex? That seems very limited in the scope of so much known and available research. While those shitty things exist, and I personally know they do, I know as well, many of things mentioned above also exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If I were a wealthy family with a long personal library and records related to my family going back hundreds of years, a lot of this research would be in my library. And as my children and family grew, I would either want them to be part of it, control it, support it, refute it, be safe from itâ€”somehow I would be involved at a much higher level.
                </p>
                <p>
                 All of this tech does exist and is in play as commercial goods and services (deliberately?), and we all use it without regard for their previous incarnations or previous versions. I think their groups working both sides of the fence, and often times researchers find themselves working for both sides. As finders, and founders.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What would your family do if you exhibited traits or potentials considered heretical? Send them to the church? (as was done in older times), contact someone you know in a private fraternity? (as was done in older times). Sacrifice them to your 'god' (as was done in older times).
                </p>
                <p>
                 I am aware of the sex-ploitation. Fully. But I am also aware of the initiations conducted right in front of our faces in media and hollywood.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is not just about sex. And all of these unsolved, never-heard-of-again criminals, make the case for something larger than just prostitution or pedophilia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My gut tells me those are results of people trying to do what the governments have long known about, rites and rituals to invoke young potentials. Or suppress them and remove their bloodlines from the record all-together.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I know you are focused exclusively on PG. But this has been shared on PG many times now, and is starting pop-up on other threads and online forums.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Scalar is a weapon. It's total known capabilities are not even documented well, other than admitting it exists in wave/energy form. We also know how terrible ELF, EMF, Radio and Microwave are on the human biology; sleep, fatigue, organ breakdown, lower testosterone, incite or invoke rage or passivityâ€”all available within the CIAs declassified research reading room.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Finally; There was a few youtube clips of a guy purporting to have been form a military family, used at a young age for remote viewing and astral projection because KIDS are easy to use since they are not 'weighed' down by the burdens of life like we are. Ascension, light bodies... initiates etc. The occultism is masked and obfuscated as well by weapons of sci-fi and media alike.
