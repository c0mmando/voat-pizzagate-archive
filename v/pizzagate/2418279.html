<p>A staggering 22 aid organizations signed a letter which apologized for what has unraveled as a massive failure to deal with abuse in the sector. ActionAid UK, Christian Aid, Cafod, Care International UK, and Voluntary Service Overseas, as well as Oxfam, Save the Children and others were among those named</p>
<p>OXFAM</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the initial scandal, further abuse claims have emerged in countries including Chad; while Penny Lawrence, deputy chief executive of Oxfam, resigned. “Across Oxfam Great Britain, we have had about 26 stories, reports, come to us which were either new reports come out as a result of the stories, or earlier stories where people said, ‘I didn’t necessarily report this at the time,’” Mark Goldring told the government’s International Development Committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Save the Children</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the Children has been alerted to 176 incidents involving the possible abuse of children by its workers over a period of three years. A total of 35 cases of sexual harassment were reported at Save the Children International last year, while in 2016 a reported 53 cases were investigated.</li>
<li>
Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children UK, told MPs that a total of 19 staff are believed to have been dismissed. A further 11 are believed to have been dismissed by Save the Children International. Watkins blamed “predatory men” who seek out work in the charity sector to be able to get to vulnerable people. Staff are also calling for the removal of Sir Alan Parker as the charity’s international chairman.</li>
<li>
Women in the charity have made allegations of unwanted advances by Justin Forsyth, the former chief executive, and Brendan Cox, the former policy director and widow of Jo Cox, the murdered MP.</li>
</ul>
<p>CAFOD</p>
<ul>
<li>
Catholic aid organization CAFOD confirmed it has dismissed a member of staff who was named in the Oxfam Haiti scandal.  (although it sounds like just one related to Oxfam GB) &quot;When we were made aware, we immediately put the staff member on leave to investigate in line with our Code of Behavior protocol,” CAFOD said. “We can confirm that the individual has been dismissed today. Our review found that there have been no formal complaints of misconduct about the employee during his time at CAFOD.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>International Red Cross</p>
<ul>
<li>The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that 21 workers had been sacked or resigned from their roles since 2015, after paying for sexual services.</li>
<li>
A further two staff members suspected of sexual misconduct did not have their contracts renewed, Yves Daccord, the ICRC’s director-general, said in a statement on Friday. </li>
</ul>
<p>So when are people who molest kids or withhold aide money to pay to molest them go to jail?</p>',

            As Sam Vaknin says charities are Narcissistic by their very nature. The people who work for charities and acting the role of savior while abusing kids, should be punished like anyone else who abuses a child while in a position of power - not let of with an apology!

              While there are no specific regional data on violence against children, national studies in Kenya, Tanzania Swaziland and Zimbabwe suggest that between 30 and 40 per cent of girls under 18 years of age suffered from sexual abuse and violence in their lives.

            Catholic aid agencies pledge “zero tolerance” as sex scandal grows
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             LEICESTER, United Kingdom - Catholic international aid charities have pledged zero-tolerance for sexual exploitation by their employees, as a sex abuse scandal affecting one of Britain’s largest charities is now latching onto U.N. aid agencies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Andrew MacLeod, the former Chief of Operations of the UN Emergency Coordination Center for the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, estimated in The Sun - a British tabloid - that tens of thousand of people have been raped by UN employees, and the international body employs at least 3,000 pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             “There are tens of thousands of aid workers around the world with pedophile tendencies, but if you wear a UNICEF T-shirt nobody will ask what you’re up to,” MacLeod told the newspaper.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You have the impunity to do whatever you want,” he said. “It is endemic across the aid industry across the world.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The scandal began last week when an investigative series by The Times, an English newspaper, revealed Oxfam staff used prostitutes in “Caligula”-like sex parties while providing aid in Haiti in 2011. The newspaper alleges some of those prostitutes may have been underaged.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the initial report, several agencies have been caught up in the scandal. IRIN News reported that in 2004 the man at the center of the Haiti story, Roland van Hauwermeiren, had been pushed out of his job as Liberia country director for the British charity Merlin, a medical group now merged with Save the Children.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Doctors Without Borders issued a statement saying it has taken action on 24 cases of sexual harassment or abuse among its 40,000 employees last year, and dismissed 19 people in the process.
             </li>
             <li>
              World Vision, an evangelical Christian aid agency, denied press reports its staff had been involved in a sex scandal after the Haitian earthquake.
             </li>
            </ul>

            I have come to the conclusion that the Foundation/ 501c3  part of the law code needs to be REPEALED. 
It has ruined the Church and our country. The Founders of America recognized the church charity and did not tax them. Many actually did good works, and Christians participated without pay. It was charity, not business.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Rockefellers and other industrialist families soon learned that they could maintain control of their fortunes and avoid taxes by setting up Foundations pretending to do charitable works. Of course, the Federal Reserve Act gave the IRS the power to oversee who gets to be a "charity". Later, the churches, who were already tax exempt, became 501c3 charities to give them some lawsuit protection. Now most churches are run like corporate charities for profit. Sad.

            You guys want to test Trump's metal? Crank up the social media platforms and tell Trump to use his executive order. His executive order pertains to the confiscation of the assets of human rights abusers. Demand that the assets of the UN (child rapist) be confiscated and that they be kicked out of this country. Same for Oxfam and the rest of these.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Titus Frost made a four minute video announcing that he made a petition to kick the UN out of here. Spread it too along with a request for Trump to use his executive order. Include Oxfam et:al

             I was hoping the 666 Dow Jones was indicative of people wanting to move around to avoid the teeth in the EO (and that they would be intercepted at some point).  Thanks for the links, the UN is beyond corrupt...sick!

              I have a friend that is married to a Jew and he said, he thought all that was done with.  He had not heard of it for years.  He finds it useless as well.  He said this must be the Old Timers.

             Thank you!  Sadly they will avoid it, no doubt.  It's as if they're in a death cult.

              I keep hoping they will surprise me, but it doesn't happen.  Not even my local station that covered the Elsagate.  We can hope. But I won't hold my breath.
