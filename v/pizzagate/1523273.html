           I'm sure this will get deleted by a mod, which would be fine if someone has a zip file of 1-36 and post it before that happens.

            Yes, I downloaded  a few months ago, you need to use wget the unix command with the -c ( continue ) option for retry, as it will almost always fail.
           </p>
           <p>
            The file is 6gb, and when you decompress it you end with 10gb, its all in .eml format, easy to use grep, or you can write a python script using 'mail' to process as you wish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lots of fun,
           </p>
           <p>
            Again don't click on the browser that will fail, use
           </p>
           <p>
            wget -c
            <a href="http://filepath">
             http://filepath
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Run's for awhile and will fail, when it fails then run the cmd again it will pick up again, took me 3 days to download all 6gb podest 1-60,000
           </p>

           <p>
            That's the link, but you must use "WGET -C" ...
on the cmd line old school
           </p>

            Anybody wants remind me here I can share my python I wrote to process the headers, very interesting stuff.

            My favorite is Alex jones said "There are 1,000's of pizza references", ... no there are not, there are 18 pizza references in 55,000 emails involving millions of words of text.
           </p>

            Like somebody said should have been called coffee-gate as "Lets meet for coffee" was said over 1,000 times :)

            Post this OP as a sticky over at

            , as it will get deleted here, and this question does come up frequently.
           </p>

            It would be great to provide a tool site so researchers could be handed the python tools to do their own original work.
