            Off topic, but related.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was 12-13 I was walking by a church I used to go to at 3am. I could only describe the sounds coming from the church as if a demon was inside. I was with a friend. We both had dunkin donuts in our hands. We heard the demon noises 3 times before we threw our food and ran away. Looking back now, I wish I would've stayed. But I was 13 and had no idea of this stuff. It sounded not human and not friendly. I didn't stay long enough to hear anything more than noises. There was no talking. It was more of a deep, loud, mean, demonic, growl.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone familiar with the occult knows 3am is a great time for contacting spirits / entities. I do believe the church I used to go was in contact with demonic spirits / entities. It sounded like the entity was inside the church. Could have been channelling. The noises sounded very demonic and not originating from a human. Some type of evocation / invocation of demonic entities was going on at 3am at a church I used to go. Maybe an exorcism.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a friend that channels "interesting" entities (non human, but physical), so I'm familiar with how people can sound when another entity is connecting to them. It sounds as if he's not human when he's channelling. A person hearing him channel but not knowing or seeing him could easily think a "demonic" entity was talking, and they'd be partially right. He's just channelling. He channels 2 main entities, but he's channelled a dozen+ entities and only very dark entities request sacrifices if you want to connect to them more fully. Every entity sounds different. The more powerful entities amplify his energy many times over and can be heard very distinct and clearly in his voice. Its quite fascinating, really.

            I have a personal anetdote. I was talking to an elder care worker who happened to be from Ghana (also an old slave triangle trade site) and mentioned some of the child trafficking problems we discuss on VOAT. She volunteered that a Ghanan friend had told her about children there being taken and killed for organ harvesting. My blood ran cold......
