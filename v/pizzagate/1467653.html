            We owe them so much!  Thanks to people like Snowden,  Assange and wikileak team we would still have been blind. If it was a fair system,  such warriors of trush deserve the Nobel peace prize and every honorary degree from every institution in the world.  They did us a favor we shall never forget.

            Julian Assange deserves a new prize. Fuck the elitist nobel prize. The elitist class can fuck itself and their worthless self adorning trophies. New prizes for hackers too. Extra prizes for hackers releasing elitist pedo evidence;)
