WTF?
you can see their incredibly well produced music on  youtube here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31rQiiqsv4A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31rQiiqsv4A</a></p>
<p>A lot of people in the comments section are surprised at how good they are, everyone is flipping out about how good the video editing is, how expert it is.</p>
<p>What no one mentions is how just good the music is....this is not garage band production on the music especially. </p>
<p>In fact the biggest thing they all have missed is how slickly edited and produced the MUSIC ITSELF IS. </p>
<p>The whole thing is so slick , I suspect that the same people who created the video also did the production on the music.
Its got the same \'sampled\' and repetitive feel as the video.</p>
<p>Everyone is focusing just on the video. This music is top grade, reminds me of whoever recorded PRince\'s stuff for him and Fine Young Cannibals.</p>
<p>isten carefully to just the audio intro to the above song. The real \'talent\' here is the studio whiz who put together this elaborate song. Someone in the comments said it was too slick a vid, too professional, too expensive.
If anyone is highly paid, its the studio team behind this music. It sounds as if they took snippets and glossed it up into this technical marvel of synthetic music. THat is the work of a top professional studio.﻿
the music is very slick , and combined with the slick video , it smacks of professionalism in fact it is the music which stands out most as expertly produced. this is some pizza joint basement band?﻿
yes, the music is incredibly tight. not only is it technically perfect...its just the embodiment of the \'hipster cool\' angle everyone in the comments section picked up ....but mistakenly attributed it to the video visuals alone.</p>
<p>when in fact.. this music is movie-studio-quality music.</p>
<p>This is the type of song which could be the theme song for a major movie , the intro song...it is very elaborate and tasteful....this is no amateur effort.﻿
then there\'s this other Heavy Breathing song called \'I no Love\' :
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_euND7Acs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_euND7Acs</a></p>
<p>again, super-slick song \'I no luv\', same expert production and editing.
Of the two songs, this one, U the ONe I Want, in my opinion is better, but both are definitely mainstream elite studio productions....cutting edge stuff really.
also note the elements of sadism, torture, even murder in the first video, this is the rarified world of military intel , espionage, prostitution, interrogation, torture, assassination. and since we know that intel runs the music industry, are they gradually \'bleeding in\' these elements of their reality and making it our own? The ultra rich, ultra debauched, untouchable class dangling these things like prizes, like goodies, to potential recruit psychopaths﻿?</p>
<p>Or just the usual game of keeping Mama Grizzly gnawing on the balls of Average Joe?
Sally Soccer Mom there too , for moral support.</p>
<p>My guess is that a Hollywood soundtrack team put both of those songs together. Part of the psy-op for sure. I think Pizzagate may be more limited hangout gradual desensitization going on. The public is incrementally introduced to the idea of \'yeah, those pizzagaters got away with it. Times are changing\'\' etc. Also see more of the intentional blurring of reality with fiction so that it gets progressively harder to distinguish what is real from what is not real. </p>
<p>Its got a bit of Elisa Lam mixed in with a bit of Franklin Coverup and throw in a handful of the funny Sandy Hook dancing cops and a bit of the Boston Marathon drill fakery , fake rocker superstardom and fake deaths, with the believable and unbelievable all mixed in together into one big disgusting mess.﻿</p>
<p>The biggest giveaway to Pizzagate being a psy-op to make MEN look bad, could be  the money the idiots threw at creating those music videos. </p>
<p>Is this  the same Laurel Canyon psy-ops crew getting in on some of the CIA budget money?</p>
<p>the Heavy Breathing tracks have David Rivkin (AKA David Z) written all over them.
check out the Wiki, he\'s got the exact profile which I just laid out. Extensive connections to Prince, Fine Young Cannibals, and Hollywood film editing</p>

<p>David Z (music producer)</p>
<p>David Z (born David Rivkin) is an American music producer, engineer, mixer, and writer from Minneapolis, Minnesota who currently resides in Los Angeles, California.[1]
He is most well known for his long-standing work with Prince, but has also contributed to award winning albums by Etta James, Billy Idol, BoDeans, Buddy Guy and Neneh Cherry. He worked with Elisa Fiorillo in 1990 on her album I Am, which included the singles &quot;On the Way Up&quot; and &quot;Oooh This I Need&quot;, and with Terri Nunn from Berlin on her 1991 album Moment of Truth. He also produced the US #1 single &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; by Fine Young Cannibals (creating the song\'s signature snare drum sound[2]) and the a-ha album Memorial Beach. He was a member of Lipps Inc, with whom he had a US #1 and UK #2 hit with &quot;Funkytown.&quot;[3]</p>
<p>Biography</p>
<p>The Z Family</p>
<p>David is eldest of three brothers each of whom work in media entertainment. His youngest brother Bobby Z. was the original drummer in Prince\'s band The Revolution whilst his middle brother Stephen E. Rivkin is notable for his work as a film editor, particularly as editor of the Pirates Of The Caribbean trilogy of films and Avatar.[4]</p>
<p>Early Work</p>
<p>After spending much of his teenage years in a variety of local rock\'n\'roll bands around Minneapolis, Z spent time between Minneapolis and Los Angeles throughout the early 1970s songwriting and engineering. His early work is perhaps most known over this period in his writing contributions for Gram Parsons\' first solo LP GP, particularly the track \'How Much I\'ve Lied\', before going on to play a major role in establishing not only the Minneapolis sound but through his innovative use of drum machines, loops and samples much of production aesthetic now synonymous with music from the 1980s. Many collaborations of material were produced by David at Paisley Park throughout the late 1980s and 90\'s.</p>
<p>Prince</p>
<p>During the mid-1970s, David encountered Prince playing around the Minneapolis scene. The pair went on to record a set of demos with Z engineering which ultimately led to Prince signing a recording deal with Warner Bros. Records. Although much of the detail of Z\'s exact contributions to Prince\'s albums is lost in the myth surrounding Prince and his prolific writing and recording, it is clear that his input, recording technique and production are intertwined intrinsically into those recordings. His most well documented contributions to Prince\'s folio of work are his writing, production and engineering on 1986 hit &quot;Kiss&quot; - originally a song given to the band Mazarati by Prince for their debut album which Z was producing[5] - and his recording and engineering of Purple Rain.</p>
<p>Soundtrack Work</p>
<p>Z continues to work successfully in the field of film soundtracks and scoring. Aside from his early work with Prince on Purple Rain and Under The Cherry Moon, Z\'s work can be heard on the 1996 John Travolta film Michael directed by Nora Ephron, where he produced songs by Al Green and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. His songs with Tevin Campbell &quot;Stand Out&quot; and &quot;I 2 I&quot; are featured in Disney\'s film A Goofy Movie.</p>',

            I'm not really all that impressed by their stuff. Their compositions mainly consist of basic, almost childish-sounding call-and-response patterns, its juvenile, lullaby-like nature seeming to hint at something darker. Their production "quality" can be obtained with about $3k in hardware and software, tops. Take it from me, I do a little stuff with digital audio workstation programs now and then. Music production tech is far more advanced than it used to be. Hell, you can do competent-sounding mixes with softsynths on a laptop. That's just how powerful processors in modern computers are.

             Amazing, I remember when the Beatles were hailed for dong four track on loop analog tapes. What do you think of the video itself, not the music, as far as quality, cost, production. BTW, if you're about to come unglued like the other guy please ignore this question. (Relevance to pizzagate is the amount of money involved.)

              That depends. If you're exceptionally skilled with Premiere and After Effects and have a nice camera and a decent computer, I'd say the video could be done for $5k, not including the cost of hiring actors and staging shots. If you farm it out to professionals, it's going to be over $20k, and for something at this level of quality, the budget would be somewhere well under $100k. Hell, anywhere from $20k to $100k, actually. It depends on who they hire and how much money they ask for. It's one thing for a bunch of friends to get together and shoot something gratis, and another thing to use paid actors and compositing pros.

            Im a musician and have recorded at home fro 10+ yrs...There's software and relatively cheap equipment out there that can give you really high quality recording so I wouldn't put too much stock in the quality. I have stuff on CD's that took me 3 hours to record &amp; mixdown at home and my friends who aren't musicians can't tell the difference between that and a professionally produced track.

             Sigh. Back to the question then, what is all the money spent on then with the pros? Because "tweaking" etc. can make such a huge difference? Don't answer, people are getting irritated w/ me :)  I shall henceforth remain confused.

              another thing which is screwing people up here is the LOW expectations they had of Majestic Ape and the team of kiddy diddlers at Comet Pizza, and then hearing this uplifting, upbeat , driving, good music purportedly from them.
             </p>
             <p>
              It just doesn't match at all.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nothing about it makes sense.  Someone put a hell of a lot of time and effort into creating this music and making it good and making the videos along with it seem very good as well. The music is listenable, and the videos are watchable , and of surprisingly good quality.
             </p>
             <p>
              No one expects that from some sneaky cult of drinking 'instant gratification' kiddie diddlers. Sorry. It just not JIBE with the purported facts  here.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is why INTUITION tells you that something doesn't smell right here. On one hand Majestic Ape is sounding like some transgendered psychopath planning rape, on another hand Majestic Ape is capable of putting out music so good that you want to listen to it for more than ten seconds before switching it off.
             </p>

              I will explain to everyone what this is .  This is a psy-op to distract from the DEBACLE which was Hillary Clinton and her horrible dyke oriented campaign failure.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is all about getting mothers upset about males again . That's all it is. Mothers can get upset about males, so they don't have to cry about Hillary and her insanity being rejected.

                it is not easy to make music which is this rich in electronic detailing and this flawless, on a technical basis. It is appealing in the sense that it holds one's attention expertly, whether you like the genre or not, which I don't like either. This sounds like satanic interracial rape music of the sort which Queen Elizabeth would masturbate to or play in satanic rituals.
               </p>
               <p>
                it sounds like they had Eddie Grant singing for 'I no Luv' and had Pherrel Williams singing 'U the One I Want'

               Are you fucking dense? That's the THIRD person with experience in this field, a field in which you have ZERO experience with, to come and tell you that this means NOTHING. This is exactly why people have a hard time believing PG because idiots like you, who seem incapable of understanding basic information that is being communicated to you OVER and OVER again, keep posting and talking about BULLSHIT like this. All the while corrupt mods keep garbage posts like this up and delete the ones with real info. Provide real proof or just stfu and fuck off already

               EDIT: Anyway if what you say is true then why isn't HB more popular? They aren't on the radio, they aren't on TV? Who in the fuck even knows they exist but us? If they put all this money and energy into this then why isn't it being broadcast to the masses? This is just a local band that performs occasionally on a local level who are most likely just some more pedo friends of CPP et all. USE YOUR FUCKING BRAIN, MORON.

            This video with Majestic Ape uses subliminal messaging. I don't suggest watching it in full. It has pictures of absolute abuse and torture.

            I think it's a pretty good point, I like the music, hate that I like it, but like it. I thought the same thing, my thought was this person put a ton of time into it, too much time for a garage band. It seems like it's supposed to do something, subliminally, with all the flashing, etc, hypnosis? I don't know just speculating, I'm not one to fall for that crap, but I can see how some one might, or you're supposed to be on hallucinogens, then you see something more. Reminds me of those of color puzzles you're supposed to stare at and you see an image, I never can see them.

            It's not that good, imho, and I've been producing music in my house for 20 years.  Don't know about the videos, but an amateur could easily produce music of that quality with an off the shelf program and a couple grand in gear.

             Sorry to ask again, but I'm gunning for an answer. What then would be the difference between what's involved in a 'Beyonce' (gross) level recording and what you are talking about?

              Dozens of hours of post production with pro tools and half a million dollars of equipment?  That said, there's nothing fundamentally different between pro recording and amateur, the pros just generally have a lot more time and money to tweak things, and better equipment, and employees to do the grunt work.

               By this logic (amateurs can produce pro quality) then the pros are wasting a lot of time and money, money justified only by "extra tweaks" and "better equipment." Can these really make that much of a difference on the unknowing and unsuspecting general consuming public?

                The difference is amateurs have to muster up passion and use their limited time to produce their product, while professionals get paid to spend a lot of time working on things.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you are some big time musician, and you want your music to be produced and released quickly, do you pay a lot of money to some guy who does this all day five days a week, or do you pay little money to hobbyist who can work on it on his free time when he's off work and when he feels like it?
               </p>
               <p>
                It's not a matter of what the final product looks like. It's a matter of how reliably and quickly you want to get to that final product.

                 Bingo. I think you finally answered my question! Thanks so much. I knew there was something I was being dumb about :)  And thanks for not getting irritated w/ me! (To me this is very much linked to pizzagate in regards to how much money is/was involved.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 I guess the deal is with a pro studio everything is set up and ready to go, a joint effort, so bigger bang for less buck (I guess relatively) etc. For example, I'm in graphic design and marketing. As a business do I want to hire an ad agency and get it knocked out (but still w/ quality) or use a freelancer and drag it out and take my chances. Thanks again.

                Well, that's my opinion, you are free to disagree.  That said, most albums below the 'famous' level are recorded in small private studios like mine, and they sound great.  Also, go listen to 'ghosts' by NIN.  That was done mostly on a laptop, and is way more complex than this psychsynth bullshit.

                 I'm not disagreeing, just trying to figure it out, was genuinely wanting some pro opinions.

                  That said, most albums below the 'famous' level are recorded in small private studios like mine, and they sound great. Also, go listen to 'ghosts' by NIN. That was done mostly on a laptop, and is way more complex than this psychsynth bullshit.

                 I'm sure. Do you remember about Boston, how he produced those songs on their debut album? Then I'll leave you alone :)

                  Well, anyways, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  This doesn't sound like a particularly great to me after 20 years of recording and 30 of playing music, but that's admittedly my opinion.

                   None of my comments were disagreeing in any way. I was simply trying to get some expert advice. You might have taken these attempts as me being adversarial, that was not the case. Anyway, thanks for your thoughts.

                Better equipment will give you better quality obviously but I think his point was that nowadays you don't need much to make music sound 'professional' And honestly to a casual listener a lot these differences will probably be discernible.

              Honestly if you aren't really into music you might think its something 'elaborate' but it's really nothing special. I do actually like their music tbh but it isn't anything insanely 'elaborate'.  Music is a pretty broad spectrum these days.

               the fact that it is GOOD , is elaborate.  Not everyone is GOOD, it doesn't matter how technically 'easy' it might seem. There's a difference between 'doable' and talent. This is talent. 
an 'off the shelf program and a couple of grand in gear' my ass. That's like saying that if you buy the same brand of shoes that some sports star wears, you will be capable of doing everything they can. 
This is elaborately good.

                Lol, now you are just embarrassing yourself. You have no experience with actual music production and yet you are making claims on how it was produced? Based on what? Your amateur unqualified and inexperienced EAR? lmao, stop wasting everyone's time here. You are clueless or just trying to get attention and you're making this investigation look bad.

                 I am making this look bad because I am exposing it as the feminist propaganda that it is.
Pizzagate is more 'hate the males' bullshit from the dykes at Windsor Castle .
That is all it is.  Cleverly disguised to look like it implicates Hillary, when everyone knows that 99.9% of the societal hostility and suspicion for this BULLSHIT will be directed at MALES. Am I supposed to be impressed with drooling little David Semen and Titus Frost and your team of Brit youtubers pumping out this bottomless pit of filth which will GO ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE but up the asses of every average male out there trying to get by.

                 yeah, there was nothing elaborate about Michael Jordan, just a guy in good shoes with a good ball and good floor and a good hoop and decent legs.  Nothing that plenty of amateurs out there cannot reproduce with a bit of equipment and practice, yeah. 'In this day and age', yes, there's lots of kids who learned to copy what he could do and make a decent facsimile of it .....that doesn't make it anywhere near authentic. 
You can reduce ANYTHING to the mundane, yes.  Like I said, what you cannot do is remove people's intuition.
This is professional music created by the same people behind the biggest names in music. If that 'embarrasses Pizzagate' , good.

             another thing about this music, is that it is not live stage band music at all. That clip of Majestic Ape cackling at Comet Ping Pong and then this fucking sonic glory coming from THEM five minutes later, live, right there in the basement of weinergate with its sticky floors and rape rooms etc....
            </p>
            <p>
             Majestic Ape is groaning about diddlers one minute , and then the band launches into a scorching live version of 'U the One I Want' or 'I No Luv'....sound plausible?
its ludicrous bullshit
            </p>
            <p>
             Not to mention that the voices in the youtubes singing sound nothing like something which the lineup of Heavy Breathing could have.  It sounds like Billy Ocean singing it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry , this whole thing is elaborately - financed bullshit.

              You are an idiot. I just proved in your own thread that this music was recorded at the guitar players house. 'Casa de Shmid" Says so right on their website.  At a home studio. Not some big time fancy LA studio. It sounds like to me you just really like their music, that's cool if you are into pedorock, you don't need some big post on voat to hide behind. So you like pedo music, it's ok, Just don't take the rest of us down with you.

               this was recorded at his house...lol...what bullshit.  I guess Majestic Ape stopped choking down the vodka and raping kids long enough to crank out sonic  gold like this....and manage to sound like Billy Ocean teamed with Prince and the Rock Revolution produced by David Rivkin with the Wrecking Crew and David Geffen standing by,  and make videos worthy of Steve Rivkin to go along with it....sure.

                "Sonic Gold"? You sound as if you have never heard music before. Not only that, you are blatantly disregarding accurate info of where the album was recorded which I proved in this very thread. You are little more than a bored kid in his mothers basement I'd guess and I suggest you move on and stop discrediting the investigation.

                    Your point is moot anyway as Heavy Breathing doesn't even have an audience. What do you say to that? Why put all this time and money making some mind control videos if they aren't even going to be seen by the masses. They have no following! Think a little more and you might actually get somewhere.

                     this is psy-op money to bribe off their LA people, who are sorely lacking much to do....how's that?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     the CIA has their studio psy-ops team to look after, and this is the 'transition' from dying lamestream media ops to internet ops..hence the need to get them paid off and happy and busy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Prince's death was faked, and his LA circle needed some work, so someone threw them a bone, and involved them in the Pizzagate psy-op. That's all this is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And it was a boner move too, because it exposed the whole thing as a psy-op. As usual the money and greed fucked them up.

                       it makes plenty of sense
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       studio producers don't come cheap, and we know the labels work for the CIA and Ministry of Propaganda
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       so it would make sense that they used the same people to create the music for Pizzagate. The same CIA milieu which Prince walked out on.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In disgust.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So the Rivkin Brothers  team behind Prince and behind probably several other acts needed some big bucks, so they pull in Eddy Grant and a whole pile of other LA people to get work on Pizzagate.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       makes sense , the CIA buys loyalty all the time, even if  no one in their right mind would listen to this

            This is again some more over speculation. I like your spirit but you are reading wayyy too much into this. I am a musician, I have played around the local music scene in NYC for almost 15 years and producing high quality music and music videos is much easier than it looks and extremely common. It's not hard at all to produce stuff like this nowadays. I hate to admit it but I really do like their music and it kinda makes me sick to my stomach, lol. Their videos are awful however. But really nothing to it, the fact that their music and videos are well produced is nothing strange in this day and age.

             What do you think about the production costs of the video? Edit: Also, why are the Taylor Swifts etc. of the big-time music scene ... why are they spending so much on their music productions, if it's so easy? Just a question. I used to play also, years ago, never recorded but it would have been not high-tech, analog.

              Not as much as you think. Honestly this stuff isn't particularity hard or expensive to do these days and many lower level local bands I know have professional videos and albums.

               lower level local bands do not put out music this good with identical stylistic signatures to famous producers like David Z (born David Rivkin).
you can try to pull the wool over people's eyes, but the one thing you cannot do is remove things like intuition from people. Everyone who hears this knows intuitively that this is from David Rivkin or someone at his level.  People go to movies and hear movie theme songs and hear radio hits and see professional music videos on MTV or Muchmusic or wherever , and they know what they are hearing when they hear it again. That's just the way it is. You sense all sorts of things about the cultural infuence of the music, the esthetic , the sensibilities and basic genre of it. Not just 'the electronic equipment required' 
there's way more to it than that. you can see how expertly the music and video caters to the limited attention span generation, how the music periodically  transitions from one 'mode' to another, just before the listener loses interest, the same way that the accompanying video for it flits from scene to scene to keep the attention riveted..
These people know what they are doing, and why they are doing it, and they are making money to do it expertly.

                You are grasping at straws. Music "this good"?! This is AVERAGE music for a band that plays music at a local level. I have been playing and recording music for 20 years and this is NORMAL. Give it a rest ffs

                 bullshit, plain and simple. this is not music which is 'played at a local level', what planet are you living on?
This not even 'playable' live , for the average local band. It is studio-created electronic, synthetic music.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Listen to the percussion alone. Try to reproduce that live. Try to play this live with three people..
                </p>
                <p>
                 it's not going to work
                </p>
                <p>
                 this was created in a recording studio from the ground up, from the get-go. They would have to reverse-engineer it all live, with the assistance of a lot of pre-recorded backing tracks to get even close to this.

                Honestly that depends on your taste in music I would say. But of course you will hear the difference if you were recording in a $20K per hour studio but what I'm saying is it doesn't take much to put out something of 'professional quality' on a lower budget. Those HB videos could have been done on 5K-10K or less depending on who you are working with. Many times bands will get discounted prices on production from their friends, acquaintances etc..

                 Still a bit confused, but thanks. It's hard for me to correlate "taste in music" w/ level and skill of musicianship, and again I am wondering what is the difference between the 'superstar' recordings and productions and 'nobody's.' Are we not in need of George Martins or (excuse the name) Phil Spector's etc. anymore? Don't worry if you don't have time.

                  Like I said that really depends on your taste in music. If you like huge production or not. Or if you like something in between. Big time producers exist because there is a market for that. There are also people who like more lo-fi sounding stuff like early White Stripes or Black Keys just to for example.

                    bopper, its the old 'baffle em with bullshit' strategy. They cannot see the contradiction of dog shit which is up to chin level immersion levels here.

                   <p>
                    On the one hand , everyone knows that there are STILL expert music producers like the Rivkin brothers around who can STILL sell their skills and expertise to movie studios and record labels
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    On the other hand, there are hot air shills here claiming that its all effortless 'in this day and age' and there is no special expertise or talent involved in earning millions as a music producer or video producer
                   </p>
                   <p>

                     They're not shills, but the whole thing (music quality, production) is still pretty confusing to me. And getting so caustic and angry about it really bummed me out. Oh well.

                    Not even close. I am however unable to find 'casa de schmid' which is where HB supposedly recorded the album:
                    <a href="http://www.dischord.com/release/gm02/body-problems">
                     http://www.dischord.com/release/gm02/body-problems
                    </a>
                    HB is on the well known indie label Dischord Records which is not an establishment type label. As for 'casa de shmid'? Well Jeff Schmid is the guitarist for HB so they most likely recorded it his house at a little home studio. So can we move on from this pointless speculation now?

            Very professionally done. I was saying that a while back on here but someone took offense (as if I was praising them and the music). Too well done for a nobody band.

            There is a long video/documentary (they keep trying to take it down) on youtube called The Winged Beatle, no one is quite sure who produced it (but there is speculation), and it too was done very professionally, it is estimated to have cost many thousands of dollars to produce, also because they had access to very exclusive 'memorabilia' and inside info. Not to sidetrack, sorry.

             I agree with you. the people pushing the Pizzagate psyop are here claiming that amateurs can bang out stuff which is of identical or higher quality than what you see coming out of even the sound track studios of Hollywood and the elite LA music scene producers.....

              Yeah, and I'm not accusing anyone of shilling, not at all, but I can't seem to get a satisfactory answer to that, at least to my satisfaction.

               There also seem to be video games developed and sold for free, that rival the quality of professional video games. Maybe there is not much difference in the quality of the product. The only difference is whether money is involved or not.

              Buddy, you are greatly speculating at nothing. And you are out of your element in regards to music so your opinion isn't really worth much in regards to this subject anyway, no offense. That's like me making claims that some architect has made some brilliant plan that only experts could design. What the fuck do I know?! Anyway this kind of speculation literally goes nowhere and clogs up the investigation.

               Take a look at the posts deleted by mods and the ones allowed to stay up.  Ask yourself why some are deleted while others aren't.  What direction are the allowed posts taking us.  What direction do the deleted posts point.  Keep in mind,  some deleted posts are legitimately crap.  They can't only delete good ones or it would be too obvious.  But it's obvious that there's an agenda being pushed on this board by what is/isn't allowed. #questioneverything.

            Everyone, everything, I mean everything that is connected to CPP/Pedogate is VERY well funded. The average cost of low end row house in DC proper..... $1million. Its been uncovered that Alefantis owns fifteen (15) such properties in DC.  So it's not surprising  CPP has bands that are obviously part of the laundering money cesspool scheme

             Everyone knows that the media is part of the government, and that MTV etc. are part of the Ministry of Propaganda.
This 'Heavy Breathing' music SCREAMS of the intel crowd at MTV putting it out. The same people who CREATED Prince, George Michael, MJ , et al, from the Top Down, and told us their fake careers were some sort of 'bottom up groundswell' .
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone knows that the 'bottom up groundswell' model for popular music was BULLSHIT all along.
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone got smart a long time ago and created the whole bullshit lie that musicians are 'outsiders' who are 'the little guy finally finding a voice' etc.
As opposed to the whole Hollywood Golden Age story, which went something like  'all the parents put their daughters and sons into dancing schools and acting classes and piano lessons,  and then BIG HOLLYWOOD sifted through them all to find the best, and then PACKAGED and sold them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Marketing genius to turn it all around and say
            </p>
            <p>
             'but, rock and pop music are different. It's the PEOPLE in the streets who discover them, and who PROPEL them from the gutters of seedy dive venues to SKY ROCKETING MASS SUCCESS!!!"
etc. 
What a con job. 
It is bullshit.  Its the same system of the elite selecting people from among the 'connected' secret society milieu and grooming them and helping them and building them , and creating the 'bottom up' illusion of it all.

              That's a lot of blanket statements you are making about a broad and vast subject. Don't let the establishment ruin the whole of music for you, lol. Not all musicians are a part of the Illuminati.
