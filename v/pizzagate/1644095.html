<ul>
<li>
<p>The numbers of people caught in the net are staggering, yet the number of actual arrests is paltry.</p>

<p>There is virtually no follow up or curiosity by the press. The media, if they report at all, either drop the issue or sometimes delete all evidence of the story (e.g., recent pedo bust in Norway below). </p>

<p>I am providing a starting point here, but I want to compile a list of these major busts, the numbers implicated, and the actual reported arrests.

<p>Six-City operation involving 12-year-old boys and centered on DC was exposed by NYT (1982).

<p>Franklin Scandal (1988 - 1991). Before his very suspicious plane crash right after receiving a trove of incriminating photos, investigator &quot;Gary Caradori had compiled a leads list of 271 victims of sexual abuse in the Franklin area.&quot; Not only was this story barely covered by the media, but the police/FBI actively thwarted the investigation, threatened witnesses and victims, and ultimately charged only 2 people, alleged victims of these crimes, for perjury for daring to name names of public officials: <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2014/03/the-franklin-scandal-elite-child-abuse.html">http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2014/03/the-franklin-scandal-elite-child-abuse.html</a></p>

<p>20 arrested of at least 51 suspects in an international pedo ring centered in Norway (2016). The striking factor here is that it involved 150 terabytes of data. That massive amount of data would indicate a much larger ring than 51 people and likely involves 100s of children at a minimum, based on the numbers.

The other disturbing aspect is that initial reports indicated that all of these kids rescued were released back to the Department of Chidren and Families (DCF), the government agency under which they were given to pedo sickos. Top this off with a discovery that many of the police badges, including for LA Sherrif, were found to have the FBI-confirmed pedo logo on them: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1620028">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1620028</a></p>

</ul>
<p>An interesting pattern emerges: If you try to find original stories or investigative reports on these major sting operations, something that could win a Pulitzer prize for the exposure that it brings, one cannot seem to find any such coverage in major media sources like the big network news networks (CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS) or print media (NYT, WaPo, etc.). In the rare case you find a story, it is more often a release of an AP story, with no work on the part of the paper, and with zero follow-up activity. <strong>The MSM has shown an absolute lack of interest in these stories.</strong> Think about the importance of sharing this information to help protect our weakness, let alone the human interest side of trying to help those who were targeted. On top of this, when these stories start touching into the inner circles in which the MSM and elite operate, the media is no longer silent but hostile, with an active effort to silence any investigation or minimize the scale and scope of what has been uncovered.</p>',

            Thank you for your post. I have been lurking on here following pizzagate for a couple of months now and made an account just to comment on this. If nothing else about this scandal is true, the lack of attention and the covering up of what is really going on by the media is staggering to me. One thing I've learned from following this is that the problem of child sex trafficking is much, much greater than I was aware of before this scandal broke. Thank you for compiling this list of sources, it can be hard to find objective information like this in the midst of all of the mess.

            OP this post deserves multiple upvotes.   Do not let this post vanish.  I have been following this for a long time and the pattern pointed out is spot on.  Big news splash then we never find out what happened to all the children and how many went to jail and for how long.  Or if there is a follow up we hear of a few that ho to jail and nothing on the kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will post some tomorrow.   Once we have a number of these I think we need to think anout how to get the information out there.  Where are they and What happened.       I am beginning to think a lot of this is for show and is a ploy used to make the public think LE is doing something

            There was a bust in Japan as well I will try to dig up the link. Edit:  168 children identified and 9 arrested.
