<p><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p>It\'s all in this article. The founder of the SPiN Ping-Pong nightclubs, who also helped The Standard Hotel hotel open up their own Ping Pong clubs, first used the clubs to run naked Ping Pong events. But then the article goes on to explain that the guy had his own ping pong palace where he regularly fucked women, and then had these orgiastic parties there too. With investments from celebrities like Susan Sarandon. Some important tidbits from the article. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prince of Madagascar lives in a penthouse apartment at the National Arts Club, overlooking the barren trees and locked gates of Gramercy Park. The Prince loves Ping-Pong. His mission is to properly introduce Ping-Pong to Manhattan; he’s plotting Ping-Pong establishments all over the city.</p>
<p>So went the tale around a recent party at the National Arts Club for Argentine artist <strong>Rirkrit Tiravanija, whose works include a $40,000 Ping-Pong table made of mirrored glass.</strong> “Have you heard about the Prince who lives in the Penthouse? He’s about to open an exclusive Ping-Pong club.” <strong>The party featured an exhibition match between a pair of 14-year-old Nigerian-born twins and 78-year-old U.S. singles champion Marty Reisman.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The artist in question,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612122921/http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1423887/rirkrit-tiravanija-brings-ping-pong-to-amsterdams-museumplein"> Rikrit Tiravanjia, has run art exhibits with &quot;Berlin-style&quot; ping pong</a> -- which is something that Jimmy Comet has mentioned over and over when referring to Dr.Pong, one of his &quot;sister&quot; establishments in Berlin. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prince is Franck Raharinosy, a 33-year-old fledgling filmmaker and Ping-Pong impresario who last week signed a 15-year lease for the <strong>13,000-square-foot basement of 304 Park Avenue.</strong> [directly across from the Waldorf Astoria] In the past six months, Mr. Raharinosy says, he and three business partners have raised close to $1.5 million to build Spin, a 14-table Ping-Pong social club, which will include a natty members-only lounge designed by Todd Oldham and sponsored by sportswear designer Fred Perry. They hope to open in May.</p>
<p>“We call him the Prince of Madagascar,” said Jonathan Bricklin, 31, one of Mr. Raharinosy’s partners. “He lives on the top floor of the National Arts Club, and right below him <strong>he’s got his own private Ping-Pong room. It’s like his own little palace.”</strong></p>
<p>“Franck can’t be stopped,” said Bill Mack, 35, another partner. <strong>“He’s the type of dude who’s going to meet a girl at a club and make out with her—or have sex with her in the bathroom.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Naked Ping-Pong began as the solution to a problem: Friends kept dropping by the loft for a game at all hours, so no one could get any work done. After the first Naked Ping-Pong party—June ’07, 15 friends, $20 buy-in—the roomies knew they were onto something.</strong> They began pushing the narrative that they were training for the 2012 Olympics. You paid $20 at the door, $10 more if you wanted to play. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there\'s this weird moment where the guy compares playing ping pong to being abused as a child. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We rode the elevator down to a sixth-floor library, a vast space with an overhanging balcony, where Tim Nye, gallery owner and heir to a real estate empire, has allowed Mr. Raharinosy to set up a makeshift Ping-Pong parlor. I picked up a paddle. <strong>Despite my having reached the finals of a Ping-Pong tournament at a beastly summer camp when I was 13, Mr. Raharinosy promptly gave me a beating that reminded me of having my head held underwater by the camp bullies.</strong> His favorite move is a forehand smash, which involves a dramatic whip of his entire body, hips and all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there are the celebrity connections:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, Vitamin Water flew this Ping-Pong posse to Phoenix to be part of 50 Cent’s Super Bowl party. Last April, Susan Sarandon came to one of their parties; she ended up hiring the boys to make a tribute video for boyfriend Tim Robbins’ 50th birthday; she is also an investor in the new club. As is Jean Jacques Cesbron, <strong>the president of the classical music talent agency Columbia Artists Music</strong>, who commissioned the boys to make a Web series chronicling a tour by Chinese pianist Lang Lang.</p>
<p>“It turned into a networking orgy,” said Mr. Mack. “There’s something about the game that lends to that. I’ve never seen anyone network as well as Franck.”</p>

            Also, Susan Sarandon was mentioned in blind item rehash about her seeing a 16 year old (in the April 2018 write ups.) So, she evidently is all about this, still.

            This reminds me of some leads I was looking into last year. Ended up moving on but I was interested in the origins of ping pong (table tennis).
           </p>
           <p>
            From Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The sport originated in Victorian England, where it was played among the upper-class as an after-dinner parlour game.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Figures that it was first played among the upper class. Anyways..
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the podesta emails come from a domain called zzranch.com.  This domain was last purchased in 2007 and is hosted by godaddy and there is no site built. Whoever owns and uses the domain uses gmail as its email host. Point is whatever "zzranch" is, it's unknown. Maybe someone likes the name, maybe because of "
            <em>
             zz
            </em>
            ranch", think "pi
            <em>
             zz
            </em>
            a".
           </p>
           <p>
            Well from what I could find out, a previous owner of zzranch.com was a real estate agent named David Elson (
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040129212645/http://zzranch.com/">

            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            That page showed a message:
           </p>
           <blockquote>

            This about shuffle board:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The game was played and gambled over by King Henry VIII of England, who prohibited commoners from playing; evidently he did not always win, as the record of royal expenses for 1532 show a payment from the Privy Purse of GB£9, 'Paied to my lord Wylliam for that he wanne of the kinges grace at shovillaborde'
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Most of the comments seem normal for the time, but a few stand out (also showing the ones from David Elson):

             I live in a small community in Ohio. My family moved here from Newark, new Jersey. I belong to the Fraternal Order of Eagles. We recently purchased a regulation shuffleboard for our club. It has been well received by our members. Your web page is very interesting. I was pleased to see that shuffleboard was played years ago in New Jersey. I remember when I was a kid growing up in New Jersey, my dad taught me how to play the game. I am now 59 yrs old and I am teaching others in my community how to play this wonderful game.

             i like to play naked shuffleboard here in Louisville, KY, any other naked shuffleboard players in KY email me, i like hanging with the nuts!
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So apparently naked shuffleboard may also be a thing?
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I have this is a folder I call "probably dead ends" but just posting this here in case. I am still interested to know more about zzranch since it's included in the podesta emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if ping pong gives the "elites" an excuse to get together. Ping Pong tournaments and such.

             <em>
              received
             </em>
             , but not those he sent? Did they ever explain?

            Can we go over what ping pong means again? I was listening to Green Day today and their cd cover for America’s greatest bad has a lot of small imagery.  Saw billy Joel with a paddle and looked like two dudes in the corner.

            Can someone explain how you play ping pong naked without smacking your junk on the edge of table?

              So do you know why these parties were called 'naked ping pong parties'? Honestly curious.

               I don't.   But I honestly think it was a way of suckering people into paying $20.  If your flyers said Ping Pong Tournament, would you get the same crowd?

                Well, if you attract the type of guys/gals that expect nudity, let them pay $20, and they won't see nudity, they'll certainly be pissed off. Can't imagine they won't complain.

                 I didn't mean it to be that explicity, but it was a way of advertising the party.  There's a lot of folks in the NYC nightlife scene who want to find the next thing, to get in on something before others know about it and $20 wouldn't be the issue for them.  Oh, you go to Spin?  I used to go to his ping pong parties in his loft.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have no doubt that this was intended for an exclusive crowd who considered themselves in the avant garde of trends.

                You embarrass yourself every time you touch a keyboard. Everything I do is to find the pedos and out them. Are you for or against that mission AWS? Do you believe all pedophiles should be hung and disposed of

                 This is a form of fallacy.  It's called arguing from personal incredulity.  I know people who never go to an NFL game that doesn't mean you can argue because
                 <em>
                  I personally won't go see an NFL game, then it must be true NFL games are not popular.
                 </em>
                 It's just not a valid argument.

                <p>
                 Because the report explicitly says so.  It says there was no naked people playing ping pong.

               yeah god only knows how many open-minded normal folks have been totally turned off by seeing the word 'kike'.
               <br/>
               "hmmm pizzagate eh, seems plausible.  *click OMG theyre bigots nvm, pizzagate is a Nazi lie"
              </p>
              <p>
               meanwhile in reality nobody considers PG real because its been endlessly labeled a hoax by........the media I.E. KIKES
              </p>
              <p>
               so logically exposing kikes as liars is a prerequisite to exposing PG, which is what WE DO IN THE REAL WORLD while you faggots are lurking on message boards taking potshots at the real activists.  what a fucking bunch.

               You are a shill for Trump, the Rothschilds pet, Rockefeller business partner and Jeuit insider. You also push Q, follow the anonymous leader psyop. When AreWeSure asked, "what is a shill anyway?", you answered as if you did not think or  know that AreWeSure is a shill.
