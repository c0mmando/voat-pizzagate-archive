<p>Pizzagate is clearly debunked, right? I mean... Snopes said so, it must be false. This article focuses on their history and some recent &quot;debunking&quot; they\'ve done but is careful not to wander into Pizza territory. They state that the traffic skyrocketed when people visited to verify the impossibly evil claims re: 9/11. (Example I pulled, Building 7: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/journal-endorses-911-conspiracy-theory/">http://www.snopes.com/journal-endorses-911-conspiracy-theory/</a> - where they go on to make a claim that no one can prove the building fell at free fall speed. They conveniently ignore the fact that NIST eventually admitted that Building 7 DID fall at free fall rates).</p>
<p>They go on to explain how they work directly with Facebook as the &quot;fact checking&quot; de facto decision makers. And how &quot;in the age of Trump&quot; their traffic has picked up significantly (nice dig to our POTUS who has an admittedly hard time fact-checking before he speaks sometimes). The article ends with:</p>
<p>&quot;I often feel like we\'re not really changing anybody\'s mind,&quot; he said. &quot;The people who use the site are the people who are looking for something that confirms what they already think.</p>
<p>&quot;But the people whose beliefs are being challenged, who think something is really true, and we\'re saying it\'s false, they\'ll just say (Snopes) isn\'t credible or it\'s biased or it\'s not qualified. Yeah, it\'s kind of disconcerting at times.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Mikkelson, here\'s your problem. And OUR problem when it comes to Pizzagate. Snopes is cherry picking and clearly following the <strong>exact</strong> same narrative that the media does. </p>
<p>Example 1: HRC and the Russian Uranium: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-uranium-russia-deal/">http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-uranium-russia-deal/</a> They go on to explain a series of questionable actions/contributions and dealings with Russia re: Uranium. Ending the assessment by saying they know far too little and that the scrutiny is well deserved. If you know &quot;far too little&quot;, why is it labeled &quot;FALSE&quot;? </p>
<p>Counter-Example: Russian Computers tied to Trump: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/trump-server-tied-to-russian-bank/">http://www.snopes.com/trump-server-tied-to-russian-bank/</a> Ending with &quot;In March 2017, CNN reported that the issue was still under investigation by the FBI, but nothing substantive had yet been turned up:&quot; And yet THIS is labeled as &quot;UNPROVEN&quot;, not &quot;FALSE&quot;... with far more access to intel and still no solid evidence. </p>
<p>And lastly, how does this relate to us? Well... the article sparked concern and I checked their database re: Pizzagate to see if anything has been added. Nothing since December. They &quot;debunked&quot; the Podesta sketches, they &quot;debunked&quot; Comet Ping Pong, but at the end of the day they are still simply cherry picking to follow the MSM narrative. It is so obvious it hurts. </p>
<p>So, let\'s keep a very close eye on any connections to collusion with Snopes. That would be a very strong arrow in our quiver if we could somehow isolate a specific series of examples/communications that clearly illustrate how Snopes may be either taking direct orders, or just indirectly following the obvious path. </p>
<p>It is easy to \'debunk\' something if you cherry pick extremely specific examples. The entire article (<a href="http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/">http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/)</a>) is solely focused on linking everything to Comet Ping Pong. This is something we\'ve all moved away from for many months, yet, they don\'t bother to look at the exponentially deepened ravine that we are peering into. But, why would they? Most of the connections, historical examples, artwork, financial transactions, insider information, George Webb\'s amazing work and social media imagery/commentary is far too hard to explain.</p>
<p>They will continue to cherry pick and undermine all efforts to scrutinize the narrative until WE can find a smoking gun that proves their bias. </p>

            Snopes was operated by operatives of government in Obama admin to control the narrative. They were outed at the beginning of this investigation as such. They were a major part of the push to call everything about Obamas past false or debunked which is actually true. People would say in the first few years "snopes" said it was false or debunked and most moved along. Not knowing Snopes was created for this purpose to counteract truth that government wants hidden. If you want to know what is true just wait for snopes to comment then research the topic realizing they are covering up something.

            Snopes was exposed by the Daily Mail last year. These people are 1000% trash, into prostitution, etc.  They are rumored to be Soros-funded.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             It was founded by husband-and-wife Barbara and David Mikkelson, who used a letterhead claiming they were a non-existent society to start their research
            </li>
            <li>
             Now they are divorced - with Barbara claiming in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on 'himself and prostitutes'
            </li>
            <li>
             In a lengthy and bitter legal dispute he is claiming to be underpaid and demanding 'industry standard' or at least $360,000 a year
            </li>
            <li>
             The two also dispute what are basic facts of their case - despite Snopes.com saying its 'ownership' is committed to 'accuracy and impartiality'
            </li>
            <li>
             Snopes.com founder David Mikkelson's new wife Elyssa Young is employed by the website as an administrator  She has worked as an escort and porn actress and despite claims website is non-political ran as a Libertarian for Congress on a 'Dump Bush' platform
            </li>
            <li>
             Its main 'fact checker' is Kimberly LaCapria, whose blog 'ViceVixen' says she is in touch with her 'domme side' and has posted on Snopes.com while smoking pot
            </li>

            I often submit Snope articles that need debunking......to Snopes themselves. It's gotten that bad. About 80% of Snopes is accurate and objective, the other 20% not so much.

             Just out of curiosity - because it sounds like you are probably more familiar with them than I am...
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you think that the estimated 20% of questionable articles they post tend to fall into the "fringe" arena? (9/11, Pizzagate, JFK, DNC &amp; Podesta Leaks).
            </p>
            <p>
             I noticed how they are also avoiding the Russian hacking/Trump connection stories like the plague. Is it because these stories can be so easily debunked? If there was any hint of this kind of propaganda around Clinton &amp; Co. I'd bet $5,000 that Snopes would have debunked the claims in under 24 hours. It's been months of anti-Trump Russian stories,
             <strong>
              hundreds of them
             </strong>
             , and they focused on the one "UNPROVEN" connection between the bank &amp; Trump and the "FALSE" claim around HRC and the Uranium story.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't imagine how many people have submitted the "Russian Connection" stories (hacking, influencing the election, creating Pizzagate, Flynn, Sessions, PissGate, etc) to Snopes... and they seem to be dodging it. Again, pure cherry picking from my POV. It really seems like they are trying to support the MSM narrative by avoiding FALSE stories peddled by the media/our government, and focusing only on disproving/proving items that do support the narrative.

              "articles...fall into the 'fringe' arena?"..........Yes. They do two things wrong:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Won't debunk controversial stories about The Right.
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Won't verify stories critical of the The Left.
             </p>
             <p>
              The stories of type "1)" are obvious and glaring omissions. But people don't realize stories of type "2)" are much more damaging. For example in the case of 2) you don't ever see things like "Barrack Obama smoked crack in the back of a limo with a convicted drug dealer named Larry Sinclair" validated as Possible or Probably given Larry Sinclair gave an hour long press conference saying exactly that.
             </p>
             <p>
              A million stories like that are ignored lest they present the narrative our government is corrupt beyond recognition.
