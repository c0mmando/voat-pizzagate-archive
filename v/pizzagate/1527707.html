            Why is it that some people can see it and have always known it's all a bunch of evil sociopaths following their own agenda? There must be some telltale sign that some people pick up on, but I can't put my finger on it.

            This shit is ridiculous and can't believe they put their names on it. Reminds me about the FBI recently publicly complaining that they couldn't get enough qualified bodies in their cyber crimes division because, "too many people smoke weed"

            I was just reviewing the links you've provided. Good stuff, these seems like legit connections you've shined the light on here. One thing I noticed that didn't seem to get mention is, among other titles, Senator Dorgan is apparently the "Congressional exec of China" which if these connections are true, would make sense because you'd certainly want a friendly in congress that was working closely to "sort china out" on paper, but his real job would be to manage the contacts on the otherside who would be doing the actual kidnapping, trafficking and organ harvesting.

            This man could very well be a lynch pin. Consider him a project manager of sorts: Except he's not working on IT projects, he's managing filth around the globe.

            Ok so my comment now is 13 hours after yours and they just changed their website. All pics on Heather Podesta's goofy website are professional up to date photos. So Heather Podesta is actively monitoring this site. Why Heather? Got something to hide? Why have u never had children of your own Heather? Would it conjure up too many bad memories for u of things u have done? Too many reminders of times passed. What goes through your weak mind when u and Tony go into your dungeon theatre to watch pedophilic snuff movies? U know, the ones u have paid so much for the rights to own. What happened to u in the beginning of your life Heather? Do u want to go back and change those childhood memories? Have u ever tried making it better? Do u ever wish u could sleep well at night, to stop the intrusive thoughts, the nightmares, the faces, the screams? I know u know what I'm talking about...

            Interesting. That 9/11 documentary was produced for
            <strong>
             <em>
              Citizens United
             </em>
            </strong>
            ... and it directly targeted the Clinton wing of the Democrats for setting the stage for 9/11 ... which, lets face it, was part of the larger NATO 'stay-behind' network operations designed to maintain control over Afghanista, the MENA, and to keep Russia down and make them submit to the New World Order and full privatization of their national resource combines by Rothschild/Rockefeller controlled western capital cartels ... same NWO agenda the Bush Family was so effective at laying the groundwork for prior to Bill Clinton, and directly after him with Bush Jr., ... Clinton was just a fit gap used to bridge the Bush dynasty, and Clinton's wars in Yugoslavia were the groundwork for the next stage of the 'stay-behinds' and the expansion of NATO into former Soviet block countries, in contravention of the agreements the US made with Russia under Reagan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton's and Bushes were just two halves of the same toxic problem, gaming the 'democratic' mechanics of the Republic. Doug Band was all pissed off because he had worked so hard to build the Clinton brand into a post-office lobbying and foundation network, that would net the Clinton's millions of dollars whilst Hillary was positioned up for a launch from Senator to President.

            Organ harvesting takes place also in Syria:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201612291049111417-aleppo-human-organs-trade/">
             https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201612291049111417-aleppo-human-organs-trade/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Could child trafficking and organ harvesting be among true reasons for the war? Because there are certainly easier and more profitable ways of financing the military activities in the area, whereby these news of organized organ trading sound odd.
           </p>
           <p>
            Relevant things to follow in my opinion:
1. Related NGOs and individuals working/worked in the area - and their relations to pizzagate
2. White helmets and other possible field organization for the task - connections to NGOs
3. Related decisions by US and European governments
4. Destination of the illegal organs
           </p>
           <p>
            Through turkey-russia co-operation more related information may surface (via RT or Sputnik). However, as the source is russian, reliability should be questioned.

            As of right now there are several with no childhood photos. That's seriously the weirdest thing I've ever seen done on a professional online photo vcard. Must be code for "here are the people at our firm who will help with child trafficking" or something.

            I really think that Life Extension for elitists through harvesting ( third-worlder body parts, young blood rejuvination, umbilical blood-stem-cell rejuvenation ) is the big attraction for Democrat Party elite money funding.

            I'm speaking objectively because I'm not very religious myself: When you don't believe in an after-life scenario, everything revolves around staying alive.  They'll drain kids blood because they don't believe in hell. They just want to keep sucking oxygen and not be decomposing in a hole in the ground.

             Agreed.  They are almost certainly involved in illegal and highly immoral parabiosis through the ritual murder of infants.  Pretty much everything points to that being the main motive.

             A little off topic, but They also believe in UFOs according to this Wikileaks email.  This is the first I've seen of podesta and UFOs.  Maybe he is really reptilian.  Lol

               You're right.  The guy insinuates that he knows podesta wants UFOs to be exposed.  I should have said UFOs not Aliens.

               Podesta says they have a lot of work to do in his reply

              <p>
               I took that as him saying a lot of work to do before UFOs would be "revealed" to the public

            I've been trying to research the organ trafficking angle for some time based on these leads among many:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still working on it, mainly because of my geographic location and contacts.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're dealing with some serious issues, trying to peel off the cover of the crimes these people have been involved in. Expect them to fight back. They may be working furiously, trying to cover their online and real-world tracks. There are many of us though, and I expect more to join and help out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep researching. Some leads may lead nowhere, but we may hit the jackpot at some point. I expect some Anon-intel help along the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck to everyone in whatever way you choose to help.

             I've often wondered about the whole 23 and Me, and other new age crap where they encourage people to send in their DNA to look for possible diseases and to match them with family members around the world in their database, as well as to inform u of your origins. They would have so much info on u in their hands. If that is linked to any of these organ trafficking groups then they'd know immediately where to grab the person who was an exact match. Not saying this is the case but there are numerous tv commercials and online ads pushing u to pay and send in your DNA swab. Makes u wonder...

             For at least the last 4-8 years they've been committing crimes right in front of our faces every day so that our heads were spinning so fast that we couldn't do anything about it. And now, we are exposing their crimes every day and so fast that they won't be able to lie, confuse and propagandize fast enough. Then we win!

             "serious" doesn't begin to describe what's going on if they're organ harvesting - "body snatchers" is more like it, only they're snatching living persons... that's "murder", even if only by degree. And they need to find appropriate DONORS - using govt records, most likely, but also medical records - which means MASSIVE HIPPA violations, major Federal prison time for anyone involved, and that's BEFORE you tack on murder / medical malpractice / manslaughter.

              You  know  about  10  years ago the  hospitals adopted  a  new policy  of treating  all medical  information as classified  material, not the  name  but the effect was the  same,
it  was  preached as a way  of  safeguarding  patient's  privacy, but I am  beginning to  think  it  was all  about  exploiting the  public  on  many levels, and making  it impossible to blow  the  whistle  on  what's  going on,
what  we  have  today  is in  the  words  of Eustace  Mullins "Rockefeller  Medicine," which is  all about exploiting  your  illness for  profit,  keeping you returning to your  physician in  a  revolving door cycle  that perpetuates a  sick  society, taking the poisons  of  Big Pharma, which  results in an  endless line of payors to this institution  of  suffering;
hospitals,  research  centers, are all interrelated, and  becoming  much  more so as  technology skyrockets and the  need for organs and living  human  tissue increases for science,  experiments and medicine,  this  feeds into  this International Slave  trade that  includes the  Zenith of evil-Luciferian Pedophobes

               On this note, I have personally witnessed the smearing and misinformation campaign involving afrezza, and the naked short selling of MNKD stock. Afrezza is the closest thing to a cure for diabetes that we have seen yet, and patients blood sugar levels normalize to that of non diabetics. Obviously this threatens a massive amount of profits from current diabetes drugs. This also happened with a prostate drug called provange, that was eventually sold to Valeant for pennies on the dollar.

               The financial/health angle is a massive part of the globalist game, and it deserves a little more attention to understand how it all ties in.

            Huh, that 9/11 letter reminds me of the time politicians panicked over that discovery channel Boystown doc that eventually went unaired, because you know it was just so untrue and ridiculous right? Oh wait it turned out to be 100% true oh yeah, so I think I'm going to watch this 9/11 film.

            All these people do is the opposite; our heart association illegally procures hearts, our anti-child trafficking teams actually do the child trafficking, our adoption agencies actually steal children. What did someone say, Satanists do the opposite of what the right thing to do is? I'm seeing a lot of patterns here.

              Thanks for the giggle ~ I really needed that. I spent a good part of this early Saturday morning (after midnight) catching up on George Webb's
              <em>
               Where is Eric Braverman
              </em>
              series. Feeling a bit drained, but never giving up!
             </p>
             <p>
              NEVER GIVE UP ~ NEVER SURRENDER!
             </p>
             <p>
              oh boy, am I deliriously tired
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank You ~
              <br/>
              Thank You everyone for working on this ~💟

               I've heard about the series, but haven't watched it yet. Is it online, or where can I find it?

               After what you've seen, do you think he's approx victim #50 in HC's circle to be suicided/kia?

               And glad you got a laugh out of that stupid comment. I know that feel. Been drained myself, so I know how big a simple pick me up can be. Almost like a survival situation being lost out in the woods or something; you've got to keep your head straight, independently thing and apply logic, but having a little fun in the process can go a long way. Unfortunately for these scumbags, I have not yet begun to fight!

                Hi there mrjdouble ~
So sorry I hadn't replied. I ended up in the hospital very shortly after this post. -_-
               </p>
               <p>
                But I'm home now &amp; slowly recuperating. I have some ongoing health issues so I won't be making it back to 100%, short of a miracle, but there are
                <strong>
                 MANY
                </strong>
                other ppl who deserve/truly need that so I'll be fine at my 70% or so. It's my new 100%!
               </p>
               <p>
                Some of my health issues are considered "progressive" (NO! NOT THE #SJW KIND OF PROGRESSIVE! I'D RATHER NOT HAVE
                <em>
                 THAT
                </em>
                DISEASE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! ~ _ ^)
If I can keep it close to that 70% or so &amp; not experience too much
                <em>
                 progressiveness
                </em>
                or getting too much worse I'll be alright!
How's that for a bunch of confusing numbers &amp; stuff? lol ^_^
               </p>
               <p>
                So anyway, after all that babbling, I'm sorry I hadn't replied about the "Where is Eric Braverman" series that George Webb has so diligently researched &amp; studied &amp; posted pretty much daily for months now on YouTube. It's brilliant &amp; ties
                <em>
                 everything
                </em>
                together so well. I was in bed/resting for  much of my viewing of it, on my little tablet mini &amp; I personally I have a tougher time opening new tabs to research or double check stuff without losing what I had on a previous open tab than I do while sitting at the pc, so I haven't verified everything, but damn. Deep rabbit-hole, shadow govt., CIA GLADIOS, private army/mercenaries, foreign govt coups, takeovers of toppled leaders' finances, takeovers/stolen funds from a small country's entire banking systems (nobody ever seems to ask about what happens to the money &amp; infrastructure of a toppled regime!) -
                <strong>
                 OR EVER THINKS TO ASK WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE WOMEN OR ORPHANED CHILDREN
                </strong>
                but I digress. George Webb covers this. ALL OF THIS and more.

                Braverman was CEO of the Clinton Foundation. John Podesta mentions him as a possible whistleblower on their corruption in a wikileaks email. Braverman is missing now. No one is sure if he was killed or under witness protection.

               News stations pick sides by design so you're only going to hear whichever one you lean toward, it's human's tribal nature. That's why I think political parties should be banned. Trump is truly an independant like Ross Perot was, but they have to pick a side because it's the only way to go anywhere. Republicans and Democrats are buddies, the fights are all for show like a wrestling match.

               Doesn't it seem these last two years are Alinsky on steriods? Especially these last months with the pushback against pizzagate and all the obama bs about russian hackers.
