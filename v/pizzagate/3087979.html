            , please review our submission guidelines. This post doesn't really meet any of them. After you review, if you think this is truly relevant to our readers, please edit this into a proper research post with linked support for all claims and a full explanation of how this is relevant to the sexual abuse of kids by the globalist elite. Thanks.
           </p>
           <p>
            "No Share-A-Link Posts" means you have to paste the url into the body text of the submission, not submit just a link with no explanation per Rule 1 via that button.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit. Thanks.
