<p>** Allegations of child sex abuse by Catholic priests more widespread than previously known, Illinois attorney general finds **</p>
<p>A scathing report from Attorney General Lisa Madigan finds the number of Catholic clergy accused of sexual abuse in Illinois is much higher than previously acknowledged, with 690 clergy accused, although Catholic officials have publicly identified only 185 clergy with credible allegations against them.</p>
<p>The determination was part of a preliminary report made public Wednesday by Madigan’s office, which has been investigating Catholic clergy sexual abuse of minors following revelations over the summer of widespread abuse and cover-ups by Catholic officials in Pennsylvania. The report was critical of the six Catholic dioceses that govern parishes across Illinois for their lack of transparency and flawed investigations.</p>
<p>Although the report says that “Clergy sexual abuse of minors in Illinois is significantly more extensive than the Illinois Dioceses previously reported,” it does not estimate how many of the allegations against the 690 clergy should have been deemed credible. It also doesn’t make clear how old the allegations of abuse were.</p>
<p>“It appears that the Illinois Dioceses have lost sight of both key tenet of the Charter and the most obvious human need as a result of these abhorrent acts of abuse: the healing and reconciliation of survivors,” the report stated. “Long after legal remedies have expired, the Catholic Church has the ability and moral responsibility to survivors to offer support and services, and to take swift action to remove abusive clergy.”</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich acknowledged that victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests continue to live with the pain. He said the archdiocese has been looking into the issue of sexual abuse since at least 1991, when then-Cardinal Joseph Bernardin formed a special commission.</p>
<p>“I want to express again the profound regret of the whole church for our failures to address the scourge of clerical sexual abuse,” Cupich said in the statement. “It is the courage of the victim-survivors that has shed purifying light on this dark chapter in church history.”</p>
<p>The report found that in many cases, the dioceses did not conduct proper investigations into allegations, particularly when the priest had died, left the ministry or was a member of a religious order, rather than a priest under the authority of a diocese. In some cases, the dioceses referred an allegation of abuse to a priest’s religious order rather than investigating the abuse themselves.</p>
<p>And in other cases, an allegation was not investigated at all if a lawsuit had been filed, if the person making the allegation wanted to remain anonymous, if a police agency was investigating the incident or if a priest had left the United States, according to the report.</p>
<p>Madigan’s office found instances in which the dioceses used personal information against the person making the allegation to discredit them, which then led to the accusation not being found credible. The report didn’t specify when the dioceses used the tactics.</p>
<p>Across the state, the terminology used by the various dioceses differs, making it confusing to understand when an allegation of abuse was deemed credible. The dioceses governing the Chicago area and Joliet area were the only ones in the state that made information public about sexual abuse before the attorney general began investigating, according to the report.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until this fall that the other dioceses across the state made efforts to make the information public. And there were some victims of abuse who were never told the results, if any, of investigations.</p>
<p>None of the dioceses across the state have taken steps to put in place policies to hold officials, such as Catholic bishops, responsible for covering up abuse of children, according to the report.</p>
<p>Madigan’s inquiry into sexual abuse by Catholic priests began earlier this year after a Pennsylvania grand jury found more than 1,000 children had been sexual abused by priests. In that case, some of the abuse dated back to the 1940s, and the revelation included information that senior church officials played a role in hiding what happened.</p>
<p>Last month, the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago added 10 names to an online list of clergy with substantiated allegations of sexual abuse involving children.</p>
<p>More names, more abused Children, more rapist priests and more lies.   Cupich Must Go Now!</p>

             Me too.  I hate to think about it but it is a possibility.  If there are covered up cases all the way back to 1940, this is just one diocese.  Yes, think of the numbers.  Shocking but not surprising.  And that is sad.

              Not only the aspect of priest, consider every Catholic institution, school, organization, etc since the 1940's at least.........Now consider ever life-long, loyal family member that holds a position working with and/or around youth, children..........mentoring, teaching, etc. Take into account many abusers were once abused(this does not justify them, only acknowledging fact). There are not only seven virtues, there are not only seven sins......there are seven secrets(incest, bestiality,necrophilia, pedophilia, cannibalism, homosexuality, transsexualism), which are used to control. This is built into the foundation of not just Catholicism, but considering only Catholicism and it's global following of roughly 2 billion members(I'll assume half are devote and tithe) This is the mental picture I must live with daily when I work with people and go anywhere in public.
             </p>
             <p>
              Knowing the stat that 1 in 4 females, 1 in 6 males, were, are now being, or will be sexually assaulted, and considering population density around me, gives the odds of a rapist on virtually any city block and of a child rapist being 1-3 within a 1 mile radius of me, anywhere I go. This is the nasty ass world we live in.

            Madigan’s inquiry into sexual abuse by Catholic priests began earlier this year after a Pennsylvania grand jury found more than 1,000 children had been sexual abused by priests. In that case, some of the abuse dated back to the 1940s, and the revelation included information that senior church officials played a role in hiding what happened.

            Some of the abuse dated back to the 1940's.   These priests are suppose to be men of God.  Caring for God's families and Children.  They have been covering up abuse and rape of Our Children for 80 years and then some.  Just Shameful.

             There is a direct correlation with the rise of fascism and the systemic child sex abuse.Also at this time KKK became a viable political party...Also the Family in DC is more than just a group of christians...they hold the prayer breakfasts once a year in DC. But they sent a missionary to Uganda to work toward execution of gay people. They work behind the scenes and are very dark....I think motorcycle gangs have enlisted in aid as well.......selling drugs and children.

              I have read that others said it as well.  We don't really need a "pope"  We need a person that  spreads the Real Teachings of Jesus Christ, not some twisted normalization the devil has put in power.  We also need to strike out that the person sitting in the Chair of St. Peter of Rome is Not Infallible.  He is not Christ.

                I am recommending every Catholic say the St. Michael the Archangel Prayer  It was written to Cast Out Satan by Pope Leo XIII  He was going through a similar crisis as we are now.  It is for everyone to say for all Christians want to purge the devil.

            It's a shame the only contribution the RCC can make during this period of anti-Christianity hatred is to further the notion that Christianity is bad. I spit on RC priests and their high priest in Rome.

             our traditional priory here in west yorkshire (kirkstall abbey) would never pay tithes to the papacy, claiming that they were too poor, and yet when henry viii took over, there is a huge list of donations and gifts that went his way. we almost avoided the dissolution but the messengers were delayed by plague.

             There are numerous Catholics on this board helping bust pedophiles, NoRoyalty, inside and outside the church. It's their Christian faith that motivates them. Of the world's 1.5 billion Catholics, only around 400,000 are priests. Priests are a tiny fraction of the Church.

              Christian faith has

               nothing
              </strong>
              to do with the Catholic (or any other church). God's word is in the bible and

               not
              </strong>
              in the Vatican-corrupted priests' churches. The only way to stop the ritual rape of children is for Catholics to remove their children from churches. I did it. It's my life work to destroy any remaining facade of respectability the RCC still enjoys.

              There is a difference between the RCC ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH (organization) and individual Catholics.

              We are attacking/criticizing the corrupt organization not the lay people.
             </p>
             <p>
              Individual Catholics are pretty powerless within the organization. (Not saying that they aren't powerful once they reject the corruption)

             <p>
              Priests and Popes are artificial constructions that are not Biblical.

              It us evident the problem is systemic by the massive cover up from the top down. It is also evident that the catholic church has an awful lot of clout just to be a church...i.e. when the priests have raped children in the past, local authorities allow them to just move. Do not prosecute. This would be important evidence in  a fair court of law......the problem is systemic not only with the church, but they are working with governments all over the world. Haven't heard of Russia allowing it , however.

             About 50% are rumored to be sodomites.  The rest are too scared or are harassed and driven out.  But we do have some that are quietly fighting. Everyone should be reading this and start fighting back because this is not just an attack against the RCC it is against all Christianity.  They want to kill Our Believe in God.  They are doing this in all Christian faiths.  The Chinese Catholics and priests have been driven underground and they are confiscating Bibles and statues, etc.  The Vatican has brokered this deal with the Chinese Govt. and does not back up their own priests.  Wake Up EVERYONE.   If you are Catholic find a Traditional Mass Church and support it.  I heard that if you donate on Christmas day and write on the check That this is for food for the rectory or for cleaning the school they or some specific item it will not be sent to the Vatican.  This is the only way to fight.

               There is always a new News Flash of Pain.  I have been posting not just because I am Catholic, but because I want everyone to realize what is behind all of this.  They want to kill off all of Christianity not just the RCC.  Frightening.

                 My faith has been strengthened, which seems silly, especially now.  Little did I know that all of this abuse, well was to Kill the Faith.  Just think about how many have left the Church because of the abuse reports.  Possibly this is why they are protecting all the sodomite priests.  More abuse= Less Parishioners.  Just a thought.  And a sad one.

                   By anti-papist I take it you mean you don't believe in a pope.  After seeing what damage they can cause I wonder if we need one too.  If we could only get a holy man that preaches the teachings of Jesus, well OK.  But lately we have men that think they are infallible and can change his teachings including the sacraments.  I get it.

                    The pope admits he is in place of Christ until he re turns...
U r right ..u dont need the pope...its each one of us through which Christ re turns..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Our names are set up in Christ the double book entry system that accounts for our sins or debt ..created from the original sin ..when we r born in sin..ie we owe our mother for her labour ...there is an account receivable trust she creates at baptism we call the name ..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The satanist want to destroy catholicism because it decodes the secular code of banking ...
For example the words of the preist...during the baptism ceremony can be decoded if one understands it is accounting code..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    When u baptised ur children did u listen to the words of the preist..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If u post the words of baptism ceremony i will decode it for u ...
It is setting up a savings account in Christ..ie the child is saved in Christ..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The same goes for the seven sacraments ..it is secularised in the 
Birth account 
social.security account 
Tax number ...
Marriage certificate 
Death certificate etc

                     I hope this is not too confusing or wordy.  This is the Real Traditional Sacrament of Baptism as it was since the beginning until they changed it.  You will see the explanation at the end as to how different the exorcism of the devil is between the Traditional and the New Rite.

                      I am guessing theu changed it around the time of the introduction of the fed reserve or social security system...
The satanists took over since the 1500s...and drove the kingdoms into the new world to bankrupt them ...resulti g in the take down of silver and gold as money of exchange...they used our consent to create money of account and exchange ie bank credit after the great depressiin...th ebaptism changes must reflect that ..
Thanks for the link...
Will there be a latin version as well..i want to see whether they use the word namium in it ...
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Google : what is namium
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      As the bible.says ..satan control this world ..ie the payment system and its ceasars..
When we use ceasars money we have to be sub survient to ceasaf and satan his payment system..
When we relieve what we owe our mothers back to God and his accoutant ..ie the US treasury ..we will gain his redemption ..no more debt ..no more works ..the work is finished ...redemption is in our hands ..
Surrender unto Ceasar what is ceasars..
We forget to surrender to what is Gods redemption for us..

                       I just went over the whole Sacrament in Latin and it does not contain the word namium, which means pledge, I believe.  I looked it up.  No wonder they wanted to change over to English.  They could pull a switcheroo by changing wording as well and the dumbbell people were never the wiser. Just take their word for it, yeah.  Already then the Sheep Were Asleep. I was very depressed over it.  I always loved the Latin language.

                     If I can find the site where I saw this I will post it. There was a write up about what you speak, The Original Traditional Baptism protected the Child form the devil.  BUT.  It was changed.  Just like the other Sacraments.  Anyone that received the Traditional Sacraments, is protected, the rest, not.  So I believe what you are saying.  St. Michael the Archangel prayer that casts out the devil, well the original prayer was also changed.  The pope has spoken about changing the Our Father and the Hail Mary as well.  If blasphemy is not jorge's middle name, well then it should be.  I will post the Traditional Baptismal Words if I can find them.  Thank You so much.

                    All mortal men fall short of the glory of God. I see the elevation of the Pope and Priests as blasphemy against God, and an attempt to create a false, pyramidic hierarchy under the guise of Christianity.

                    Check out the Protestants (Martin Luther and John Calvin especially).

                    The Jesuits were created as a Military order to counter the protestants and the democratization of the gospel.

                    I follow no man, only Jeshua. I need no popes, no priests, no deacons, not one bit of it.  My head is my husband and we follow Jeshua.
