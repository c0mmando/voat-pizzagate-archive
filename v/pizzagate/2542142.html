            Ugh. Watching these brought back so many awful memories of being this age in school. Also that assurance about boys breasts going away? Might want to check that lololol. 😏 This was pretty straightforward stuff, I just feel bad for poor kids having to listen to some granny talk about breasts and penises over and over. At least in my day, they gave us relief from our opposite sex peers by separating us. You know? Fucking common sense? That's so embarrassing for kids at that age. Really unfair to them.

            there is a well known all girls private school in Canada teaching about “LGBTQ+” yes + and they will not talk to parents about what the + stands for. They also celebrated Alice Day on April 25 with a “mother daughter Alice in Wonderland day” at school where all the little girls wore Alice costumes with the red shoes. Most of the parents are oblivious to what it meant. I couldn’t believe when I was told but there are also photos of this online. Unbelievable.

            A couple of interesting thoughts about this cringeworthy video series. I think its kind of gross that the example of a boy having an "attraction to an older person" was TEACHER seriously? They might as well just give them keys to the classroom to have sex with her wtf! It could have been movie star or rock star but nooo just direct the thoughts to the already abundant perv teachers that teach children. I also think that its interesting that the girls discussion was alllll about PHYSICAL APPEARANCE already with the predictive programming of discussing body type and referring to breasts as NICE and talking about weight. Everything is about either apperance of the woman or reproduction but the guys get the "advantage" of pleasure and doing sexual things for other means besides having kids. This is too much for this age group I cannot imagine having a talk like this with my child and considering that I spent most of my adult life as a stripper I am hardly a prude. I just find the mere afterthought of one sentence about women and self pleasure to be a little unfair and telling about how we are still perceived as baby makers generally. I see that third wave feminism did WONDERS for women...pfffft!!

            The kids in the video are too young to even be interested in this..
As there is an attack on the young generation by the pedoempire ..to think sex is the mainstay of society via the constant barrage of images ...
As a parent i would explain to my children the nature of this attack ..and how it connects to the debt currency system..and the need for it to turn us into mere pleasure seeking consumer drones...
If they understand how a balance works one can explain central banking to them...and how more debt is forcing deep state to make a fool of themselves ...
...the game is simple to understand ..as well as the solution ..which u can instruct ur kid how to take his..her pocket money and email the US treasury to use it to reduce debt ..
In exchange for the treasury acknowledging the US as a debtor of the kid and his name..
           </p>
           <p>
            The response i got from the US treasury was positive..
This will teach the children how commerce is connected to intercourse..commerce is intercourse..
This is the first lesson of intercourse i teach my kids..
How the govt is fucking us up..how we fund those fuckers..and how to turn it right around ..

            Eh, I was raised by an extremely religious mom that didn't allow me to participate in the sex Ed program, so I had to sit in the principal's office and read while the entire rest of my class learned what was going on with their bodies. The ironic thing was that I had already started my period by that point, but nobody knew because I was too terrified and ashamed to tell anyone about it, AND, I had NO IDEA what a period was! So for over TWO YEARS I would frantically scrub my panties in the sink and wring them out and wear them damp several times a year thinking I was possibly dying, but couldn't tell anyone because then they would know I had been touching myself down there. I really don't find anything wrong with this curriculum because I've been on the other side and it is NOT OK or healthy.

             That's as bad as Carrie the Stephen King story her mom never told her about menstruation the famous scene when she gets her first period in the girls locker room showers after gym class and she freaks out thinking she's dying. Sad.

             You are also known as the exception to the rule. We never had the ability to tell them what to teach and had to cover same ground to keep up with the tards like your mom.

             I went to Catholic school and we had none of that either.  I kind of went through what you did, regarding the period thing, very frightening, since my grandmother had cancer and I thought I was getting it too.  Until my gf and her older sister took me aside and somewhat educated me.  But no we did not have any of that.  We did have the thing in 6th grade where the boys went in one room and the girls in another.  But really it was the bare bones stuff and most of it went right over our heads.  Basically we were taught to not let any of the boys come near us.  Actually I think that was good advice for that age really.  So yes, I believe there is a middle ground too, Extremes are never a good idea.

            Damn, did this thread just burn out right away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's make something real out of it though. People should post when they were first taught about sexual tendencies in school and we'll actually find out what's going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like for instance, my first lesson in public school was in the fourth/fifth grade (as well) but I know for a fact they didn't say anything AT ALL about ejaculation and orgasms. It was bare bones, reproductive organs. Penis. Vagina. that sort of thing. Nothing like the videos from OP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh and this was in New York. The year was 2002.

             I can assure you, it was not taught in California when I was in grade or middle school.  Ninth grade in 1980 was the first encounter and it was just like you said, very biological and not sexual. The most graphic example we faced the entire semester was the teacher putting a condom over a broom handle.  Every student hated sex ed and thought it totally useless. You know what else? It was a much better time in America.  In a school of 2800, only 2 girls in my class over a 4 year period took a pregnancy to term, that I can recall. We were not prudes, we were normal healthy teens working towards things that mattered.  You didn't want to 'get laid', you wanted a nice, cute girlfriend.  You were looking towards college and a career.

            I had my first sex education class in fourth grade, over thirty years ago. That's the normal age to start bringing up topics like ejaculation and orgasm.

            But by all means, don't let the above calibration get in the way of your pearl-clutching.

             You're full of shit...  Sex education was not until 9th grade in the United States when I was in school 30 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             If parents want to talk about orgasms to 8 year olds, they're fucking perverted.  If the Federal government wants to do it, it's sanctioning pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Funny how STD's have exploded in this country since fuckers with blasé attitudes like you have taken over.
            </p>

              Congrats on growing up in Butt-Fuck, Nowhere. Did they have running water/electricity there, too? Probably too busy working on the farm to learn something like how your body parts meet up, so they pushed it back to 9th grade for the one-room schoolhouse in your little hamlet.

              My account has been active/posting for two years, so good job on that research on my account's "dormancy". Got any more COINTELPRO tactics to throw out at someone that disagrees with you?

               Farm kids learn about how those “parts meet up” pretty early. You may not know this, but animals have no modesty. Mom, grandma explain it to the girls, Dad, grandpa explain it to the boys. The consequences are made clear, love and marriage are included in the conversation, and nobody makes a big deal about it. Country living often lends itself to acquiring responsibility and maturity at an early age.

                Me too, which is why I'm 100% sure you're lying. I don't even have to prove it anymore, because no reasonable Voater is going to believe that Commiefornia waited until 9th grade to teach kids this shit. I know you're lying, because I was in California 30 years ago taking sex education in the fourth grade.

                I'm definitely becoming convinced you're not as old as you say you are, despite your penchant for pearl-clutchery and immediately branding those that disagree with you as "kid fucker". I'm guessing you're probably 22. You don't even type like a GenX'er or a Boomer.

                 San Diego, 6th grade, boys &amp; girls in separate classes for the several 50 min.  Boys instructed by the 6th grade male teacher. Girls by the school nurse. Had to have parents' permission.

                <p>
                 Very clinical. Leaned about getting your period and the very basics. That's it. Was told to ask the school nurse if we had any more questions.

                  Nice snipe edit there. Now you're flip-flopping on whether or not you actually went to school in California. You probably should've stopped while you were ahead. three posts ago.
