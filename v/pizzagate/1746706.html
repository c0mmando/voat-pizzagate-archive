<p>Models Denounce the Sadistic Practices of the Fashion World
March 21, 2017</p>
<p>After years of silence, models are speaking out against the sadistic behavior of people in the fashion industry where abuse, exploitation, and even torture is rampant. And that is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>In my series of articles Symbolic Pics of the Month, I often feature fashion photoshoots where abuse and violence are celebrated and even glamorized. This abuse is however not only for the cameras – it also happens behind the scenes, for real. Indeed, the disturbing photoshoots that are often published by major magazines are symptomatic of an industry that is diseased to the core with a mindset that is bent on dehumanization and human exploitation.</p>
<p>Other models stated that sexual abuse is also a major problem in the industry … and industry that is full of underage models.</p>
<p>“Leading British models have revealed they regularly suffer degrading and humiliating treatment at the hands of casting directors, agencies and photographers.</p>
<p>While some recount emotional manipulation and bullying, others claim to have endured physical and even sexual abuse at work.</p>
<p>An astonishing 30 per cent of models report being touched inappropriately at work, while 28 per cent say they have been pressured to have sex with someone at work.
In no other industry would behaviour like this — and the behind-the-scenes horror stories — be so commonplace.”</p>

            Marc Jacobs -- outrageous.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also have to look at the magazines which feature these photographers and the fashion designers.
It's an old story -- once told by Betty Friedan in "The Feminine Mystique" -- 
These magazines are major means of propaganda and manipulation - mind control.

            I work in film so I had a special interest in the neon demon because it stars my favorite models and actresses though this film is so much more than meets the eye...haha if you've seen it you will understand that line. The film is full of occult rituals and most of the fashion industry gladly falls in line if it means more publicity.

            If you haven't watched the documentary "Girl Model" then you should. It's about 14 year old Russian girls who are sent to Japan. They have a creepy manager who likes virgins. It's quite hearbreaking.

            As far as I'm concerned, Big "Insert Industry Here" are all in cahoots. Big fashion, big media, big meat, big pharma, big whatever the fuck. If we're following the money the biggest players are the first place to look.
           </p>
           <p>
            Big Defense, Dyncorp, big Religion, Jerusalem, Vatican, Saudi Arabia. Any industry that produces shit and sells it for a super profit needs to be investigated. Every corner cut and every overpaid aristocrat, every piece of shit child raping motherfuckers.
           </p>

            Honestly I'm scared. I feel like there's going to be a lot of PLANNED revelations, everyone will own up to their pedophilia, but then a planned and installed technocracy involving Bill Gates and Elon Musk is gonna pop up...

            Amazing things happen when people unite in a common cause -- great that these females are doing this and 
probably a few males have also had problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire industry is abusive to women and is used to control the minds of young girls with very unrealistic images
of the human body.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "fashions" being offered rarely have anything to do with what women wear in real life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nor the sizes they wear!

            Of course fashion is a huge part of this.  Look at the cape that pulled mediocre madonna off the stage at an awards show.  Armani cape that looked just like an illuminati.

           <p>
            Playboy Foundation - possibly a CIA psy-op, board of directors members connected to Alefantis art group.

             I agree. Remember Rachel Chandler has worked for Vogue as a photographer. Many of the creepy Instagram posters have connections to Vogue. This title in particular is very dubious.

             There is a genre of photo shoots, i.e. fashion spreads, that depict models who appear dead, murdered or suicide?, subtle visual suggestion that a rape possibly happened.  Very creepy.  I can try to find some examples and post the details...fashion company, photographer, magazine.

              Yes -- and coincidentally they are very similar to what we see in some of Tony Podesta's "art" collection -- !!
             </p>
             <p>
              We need to hear more from these models about the industry and the problems they have there.

               Terry Richardson...Artist or a Predator?  A very long article...

               But instead of breaking it down, let this person, Jamie Peck, give her thoughts, when the reporter contacted her for her input before putting out the article.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Is Terry Richardson an Artist or a Predator?" Is that supposed to be a trick question?
From Roman Polanski to Woody Allen and thousands of "nice guys" in between, it should be obvious by now that artists and predators aren't mutually exclusive. Sexual predators aren't drooling monsters that hide in caves: they are husbands, fathers, employees, friends and, yes, sometimes artists. Why is this so hard for some people to understand?"

              <p>
               Start her article from the beginning..
"The other day, I woke up to find several sexually explicit photos of myself in my inbox (part of an email from  New York Magazine reporter Benjamin Wallace). Some of them showed me doing things I'd already written about in the widely quoted account of my encounter with photographer Terry Richardson at age 19. Others showed me doing things of which I had – and have – no memory at all. My body language is stiff, but a close reading of my face reveals nothing, even to me. The lights are on, but no one's home."
              </p>
              <p>
               This was not entirely unexpected. A little while before that, I came across a photo of Richardson reaching out to grab my breast. It jogged a vague memory of "Uncle Terry" groping me without asking – something I was always terrified would happen when I was modeling for Guys With Cameras (
               <em>
                what The World of a Professional Naked Girl calls the guy with the money
               </em>
               )– but which I didn't precisely recall happening in the shoot I wrote about. It made me wonder what else I wasn't remembering."
              </p>
              <p>
               Some other Models, such as Sena Cech, had bad experiences with Richardson, as well as Wallace (in the reporting of their side of the story):  The twisted tale of the penis or the twisted penis tale?

              <p>
               So how about that article by Wallace anyway? Well he does have a lot to say about Terry Richardson:
"Best known for his fashion and celebrity work, much of it with an erotic bent, he regularly shoots covers for Harper’s Bazaar and GQ and has photographed virtually every major contemporary figure in film and music, not to mention Barack Obama. In the last few years, he and Lady Gaga collaborated on a book (Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson), and he made videos for Beyoncé (“XO”) and Miley Cyrus (“Wrecking Ball,” viewed more than 665 million times). He works for luxury brands Valentino and YSL, and mass-market brands Target and H&amp;M, at a reported day rate of $160,000." (also worked for Vogue years ago btw)
              </p>
              <p>
               and this..
              </p>
              <p>
               "Richardson is also famous for another reason: He has cultivated a reputation of being a professional debauchee, a proud pervert who has, outside his commercial work, produced a series of extremely explicit images—often including himself naked and erect—that many find pornographic and misogynistic, and which can make viewers distinctly uncomfortable. In recent years, a number of the models in those images have indicated that they, too, weren’t altogether comfortable, filing lawsuits and, increasingly, speaking up in essays and interviews. Richardson has been called “the world’s most fucked up fashion photographer” by the website Jezebel, “fashion’s shameful secret” by the Guardian, and “America’s Next Top Scumbag” by Wonkette. Baron von Luxxury, a Los Angeles DJ, wrote a song called “Terry Richardson” with the lyrics “She’ll have a few more sedatives / I’ll have whatever comes next / And then I’ll burn the negatives.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Perusing through Benjamin Wallace's 7,000 word article (Jamie Peck's count) is tedious as overly introspective Artsy Expose' are, but also interspersed are porn-ist scenerios or accounts, when compared to what the Models themselves wrote, we have a generation gap, a culture gap, along with a sulking famous photographer whose sexual predation was just part of doing his "Art".

                Richardson is just another Bill Cosby with a camera, but the wine and drugs are still there.
So is the manipulation, mind control, bullying and all the rest of it.  Including denial.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 It treats the central question of Richardson's many critics – Was meaningful consent given for the sex acts in these images? – in a cursory fashion, given that it's the theme this major magazine article promises to explore. It isn't as though the author lacked for material: Wallace and I spoke for over an hour, and the only quote he used from me was in regard to the aforementioned images.&lt;
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                All of what Jamie Peck wrote should be read -- she is an extremely intelligent young woman making clear what goes on in this industry -- the exploitation -- the sexual perversion of those who have control in the industry.
               </p>
               <p>
                While I would also point to the vulnerability of these young women and to the fashion magazines themselves also engaging in using these exploitive photographs and wonder how they all get away with it, I have to remind myself that as an adult woman I had to a number of times tell my aging male dentist to stop drilling down my front bottom teeth; but sadly I didn't immediately stop using that dentist.  We imagine that people doing their work and getting paid for it are sane, stable.
In the case of heterosexual males, females (and young males) can't always be sure of that.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thanks again for bringing our attention back to Jamie Peck's actual thoughts.  :)

            Low key, I work in the fashion industry. This is the single most important factor to Pizzagate that no one understands. Most fashion conglomerates are fronts.

              Sure. Basically old fashion brands have been bought and subverted by Qatar and other anti-American interests, and pizzagate people have placed figureheads at the helms. Balmain is a perfect example. I would suggest looking into Oliver Ruisting and everyone that surrounds him.
             </p>
             <p>
              High end fashion brands typically DO NOT make sales, especially if they re-appear out of nowhere. They are moving large amounts of money with outrageously expensive items as a front for actual Pizzagate activities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Good examples of a brands that can be trusted is Ralph Lauren (American icon), Louis Vuitton (luggage always sells).
             </p>
             <p>
              Brands that can not be trusted, Balmain, Jeremy Scott, Brandon Maxwell.
             </p>
             <p>
              FASHION MEDIA IS THE #1 THREAT TO TRUMPS RE-ELECTION, as they have a massive influence over suburban American women believe it or not. Right-wing infiltration of fashion media is crucial.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pizzagate in fashion actually deserves its own forum.

            Fabric printed with pizza motifs has been trending in fashion in the last few years.  Started with outfits worn by Cara Delevingne and Miley Cyrus etc.  Now it's filtered down to the chain stores.  (They know what it's a codeword for.  They're having a laugh.)

             The one that sickens me is Victoria's Secret "PINK" line. Marketed to young women. Slang for vagina/pussy.
I get so sad when I see all the girls wearing that brand.
You're right, the creators of that shit are having a laugh. We worship the world they create through the almighty dollar.

             We also have young girls clothing - tops -- which feature the SKULL&amp;BONES image -- 
burned thru on black velvet tops for dress wear.
