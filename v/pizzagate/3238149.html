<p>The reports of missing persons, and <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-missing-children">missing children</a> in particular, decreased in 2018, reaching levels unseen since the beginning of <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ncic">available FBI data</a>.</p>
<p>Nearly 613,000 Americans were reported missing in 2018, more than 424,000 of them under the age of 18. That’s a drop of almost 6 and 9 percent respectively from the year prior and the lowest shown in available records going as far back as 1990.</p>
<p>The numbers had dropped precipitously from the high of more than 980,000 reported missing in 1997 to less than 628,000 in 2013, but then started to pick up again—until the drop in 2018.</p>
<p>It’s not clear what exactly is behind the latest decrease.</p>
<p>Part of the long-term downward trend may have to do with technology, said Robert Lowery, vice president for the missing children division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p>
<p>Most of the missing children are runaways between 13 and 17, he said in a phone interview. “A lot of these children now have, frankly, cellphones or smartphones. They’re also using social media. … The point being that parents are able to find their children themselves much quicker than they had been, before they have to engage law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Law enforcement techniques to locate missing children have also improved, he said.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t quite explain the sudden drop in 2018. Smartphones and social media have been popular among youth for more than a decade and there seems to be no indication that law enforcement techniques made a sudden advance in 2018.</p>
<p>“It may have been an anomaly,” Lowery said. “We’re going to continue to watch the trend.”</p>
<h2 id="md-link-to-trafficking">Link to Trafficking</h2>
<p>While most missing persons are found, runaway children are vulnerable to exploitation, particularly sex trafficking.</p>
<p>“Traffickers, as well as buyers, strategically prey upon runaway children because of their mental, physical, and financial vulnerability,” according to the 2009 National Report on Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: America’s Prostituted Children (<a href="https://sharedhope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SHI_National_Report_on_DMST_2009.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>
<p>“The stark reality is that the supply is never-ending … I mean, that little girl who started as a runaway on the streets in Washington state and ended up on the streets of Miami Beach as a prostitute is way too typical,” said Andrew Oosterbaan, then-chief of the Justice Department’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, according to the report. “There is an endless supply—and it is almost surreal to have these words leave my mouth—endless supply of victims. But that’s the stark reality.”</p>
<p>“The victims view running away as a way to escape an environment that they cannot control,” the report said. “It is not a coincidence that the average age of a runaway falls squarely within the age range a child is recruited into prostitution, as the victimized child who flees from home often lands straight in the welcoming arms of a trafficker posing as protector and caretaker.”</p>
<p>The most at-risk group are <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/children-in-social-services-system-most-at-risk-of-being-sex-trafficked_2933128.html">runaways from the social services system</a>, such as foster care, group homes, or government facilities, Lowery said.</p>
<h2 id="md-trump-cracks-down">Trump Cracks Down</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has put a major emphasis on fighting human trafficking during the past two years. In February 2018, he signed an executive order to dismantle transnational criminal organizations that traffic and exploit people.</p>
<p>In April 2018, Trump signed into law the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or SESTA-FOSTA, that stopped the shielding of website operators from state criminal charges or civil liability if they facilitate sex ads or prostitution. Just days later, sex-trafficking website Backpage.com was taken down by the FBI.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the demand for online sex trafficking has dropped as the operators of smaller sites struggle to stay afloat, according to <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/online-sex-trafficking-demand-drops-after-backpage-takedown-trump-admin-policies-report_2875865.html">a report by a counter-human trafficking technology company</a>.</p>

<p>Demand for online sex-trafficking has dropped as the operators of smaller sites struggle to stay afloat, following the shutdown of the largest human-trafficking portal in the United States, according to a new report shared with The Epoch Times by a counter-human trafficking technology company.</p>
<p>In April 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or SESTA-FOSTA, that stopped the shielding of website operators from state criminal charges or civil liability if they facilitate sex ads or prostitution. Just days later, sex-trafficking website Backpage.com was taken down by the FBI.</p>
<p>The report by Childsafe.AI—the world’s first artificial intelligence platform for monitoring, graphing, and modeling child-exploitation risk on the web—details how the twin acts “dramatically changed” the sex-trafficking online marketplace, specifically the distribution layer that served the underground commercial sex economy.</p>
<p>Now, a year later, the report explains how the industry has since been fragmented across dozens of websites, all competing fiercely for market share. No single dominant site emerged in the past year as the popularity of the online economy “remains volatile and shifts quickly.”</p>
<p>One key finding from the report—that’s prepared for use by law enforcement agencies across the United States—was that web traffic to advertising websites selling sex drew only 5 to 8 percent of the total unique visitors of Backpage drew at its height in 2016.</p>
<p>Childsafe.AI’s CEO, Rob Spectre, told The Epoch Times in a phone interview that the underground marketplace is now more like the “the Wild West” rather than a “high-quality, well-groomed advertising channel.”</p>
<p>“What we are seeing overall is an evident drop in demand… a number of these operators are struggling to continue operating their services,” he said. “There is also a significant influx of scam advertising.”</p>
<p>These sites are also fiercely competing with each other in surprising ways, Spectre said. He described how they are actively engaging with each other in disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>“One website will claim that another website is working with the police, obviously not true. The other website will react, saying that the other website is completely hacked they are going to steal all your personal information,” he said. “It’s pretty wild.”</p>
<h2 id="md-struggling-competition">Struggling Competition</h2>
<p>After Backpage.com was shut down, a number of other popular sites at the time also closed down or discontinued their activities. As a consequence, the search volume for sex in the underground commercial sex economy dropped 90 percent in the months following April 2018, the report found.</p>
<p><strong>Nearly three-quarters of the cases submitted to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children relate to ads posted on Backpage.com.</strong></p>
<p>“Backpage had a monopoly. A lot of people called them the Google of commercial sex ads, I think it’s more like the Google and Facebook of commercial sex,” Spectre said. “They had a stranglehold on the entire market.”</p>
<p>Spectre said that the current sites are mostly run by small-time operators.</p>
<p>Since October, eight out of nine of the most popular advertising websites aside from Backpage.com “demonstrated either flat or declining growth,” the report said.</p>
<p>“They all seem to have a popularity that is only regional at best,” he said. “There will be three or four websites that are popular in each metropolitan area, and that’s basically it. So you’ve got a cluster of websites trying to fight for New York, you have a cluster of websites trying to fight for Los Angeles.”</p>
<p>Despite the overall dip, Spectre noted that other demand-oriented online communities known as “hobby boards” and “sugar daddy” sites are showing growth in popularity.</p>
<p>Hobby boards are online forums where buyers can rate and review sexual providers. Users pay a monthly subscription between $20-30 per month for full access to these reviews. Sugar daddy sites, meanwhile, are more of a social-network platform, where the user experience is similar to a dating website that connects men with women under an ongoing financial arrangement.</p>
<p>Spectre also described how payment methods contributed to the decline in demand. He said the new sites are struggling to implement credit card transactions.</p>
<p>“The most critical fact is that they can’t make money like Backpage. They can’t keep the credit cards working the same way,” he said. “All these sites start using PayPal, then they get shut down, then they use Venmo and it gets shut down.”</p>',

            So it's an almost 9 percent drop?  That's the hook for this article?  It's progress, but it's nine percent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the nonsense at the end trying to say Trump is responsible for this is pretty funny.  The long term trend since the late 1990's for these numbers is downwards. Trump obviously had nothing to do with that.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the drop was about 8.7%, this isn't and unprecedented number.  2009's numbers was about 9.2 % lower than 2008.
2008  614,925
2009  558,493
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also nuts, because these numbers DO NOT counting the number of sex-trafficking children.   This IS NOT a count of kidnapped children.  These are just people and children missing for any reason at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is just ridiculous
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On Dec. 31, 2018, Trump proclaimed January 2019 as “National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month”—after issuing a similar declaration for January 2018.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This happened in 2017 too and every year since like 2013.....actually even longer, here's the details
           </p>

            Yeah, this was established by President Obama in 2010

           </p>
           <p>
            Prior to that the US Senate established January 11th as the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness back in 2007.

            This is good news for the youth. Trump has actively taken this on and the numbers show it. Pizzagaters keep the pressure on the elite exposure.
            <br/>
            There is a high national awareness of child trafficking. If everyone quits watching Hollywood films, we might get there faster. Quit taking vaccines. Don't get abortions. Make your own clothes. Home school. Read the Bible. Don't buy porn. Don't watch MSM. Citizens need to do their part.

             I am doing all of that.  Home school is out since I don't have Kids.  SO AGREE.  No shots.  Someone in my distant family decided to keep the Baby.  We were all so happy.  Have sewn some of my clothes too.  Hate porn.  Stopped watching MSM about 5 years ago.   I never go to the show either.  They are all a waste of time.  Keep on preachin'.

             Your 11yo grandson wants to watch The Walking Dead online on some pirate site, BOOM multiple porn ads pop up throughout.  Not just women, but 3-D interactive games featuring popular cartoon animals etc.  This happened to me the other day. The games were fantastic.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's the problem and always has been, sweetheart: JEWS forcing smut on kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             I posted about an app (with kids getting smartphones younger and younger) tempting girls to accept "donations" for interacting with her viewers. These girls sought out and downloaded the app themselves out of greed, vanity, lust, or another Jewish trait.

            <p>
             And now here he is posting some SINO-JEWISH MAGA SITE NOBODY EVER HEARD OF telling us Trump closed a website of mostly teens girls, as if that has anything whatsoever to do with cults or elite pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you see why he called me pedo now?

            <p>
             They want the waters muddy because acknowledging that, thanks to Jews, today teen girls can and do prostitute themselves voluntarily/hook up with older men would blow apart their claims that its pizza-related rather than the world's oldest profession.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why if you even suggest:

            <ul>
             <li>
              our girls are unacceptably promiscuous
             </li>
             <li>
              measures could be taken to limit their freedom to be so
             </li>
             <li>
              it's better to be teen wife than of-age slut

              Isn't that listed in the Protocols?  Sumner Redstone certainly pushed "soft" porn to the masses. And enriched himself doing so. They can push it, but we don't have to buy it.
             </p>
             <p>
              "* Viacom Inc, known for producing pornographic videos &amp; violence-inducing gangsta rap on its MTV station, is owned by the Jewish billionaire, Sumner Redstone.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Sumner” was actually born, “Murray Rothstein,” who resides in Newton MA.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rothstein told Jewish investors in 2005 that its proposed Gay cable channel “LOGO” would cost only $30 million to launch, but by 2007 would be worth over $1 billion.*
             </p>
             <p>
              The Jewish investors have not been disappointed. Yet at the same time, millions of Americans, mostly American youth, are being morally corrupted by LOGO’s Anti Christian programming.
             </p>
             <p>
              LOGO Gay TV promotes anal sex between two males by using Biblical titles in its programming such as “Jacob &amp; Joshua” and “Noah’s Arc.” The Jewish owned LOGO now has over 20 million viewers.

              The stuff that's free is the drug that gets you hooked. Of course they make money off of it. Las Vegas is family friendly.....unless you pay. Why are women and their boyfriends raping their child and filming it? In their eyes, it's easy money.  SICK SICK SICK.

             When it became known that Kevin Spacey was a violent pedaphile, he did not go to prison. His popular TV show was cancelled however, and his movie only made $200. 00 first weekend. So there is way more public awareness than we know. Your advice to read the bible is questionable since it does say, slaves obey your masters, wives obey your husbands......this has allowed pedaphilia to grow undeterred in the west.

            I hope no one flags this as not pizzagate related because it doesn't involve the elite. It gives us hope that the elite know that we are aware of their devious plans. It may not end them but it's a good start.
