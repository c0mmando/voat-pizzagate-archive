            Dr. Christian F. Richter who was sued in court in 1996 by Jane Roe as part of the Doe vs Maskell suit against the Archdiocese of Baltimore (from his obituary):
           </p>
           <p>
            He was a master Mason and an active member of Boumi Temple, where he had been medical director. He was also a member of the York and Scottish Rites and Royal Order of Jesters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Royal Order of Jesters!
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a newsclip video of Dr.Richter denying charges, saying it was an "embarrassment".

           </p>
           <p>
            Bob Fisher, a Baltimore auto repair shop owner who was familiar with Maskell, also told HuffPost that he remembered the priest telling him similar stories: "He would say, 'Me and the doctor, we take them back and we give them exams and check them' [...] There’s no question he was always involved with the exams — that he made clear."

             These orders are all over the world.  International.  It goes from Masons to Shriners to Jesters.  Jesters rule everything.  I just found another order that Bill C belongs to and it has a chapter in Racine. These orders are what we must take down.

            Browsing the facebook page The Keepers Official Group - Justice for Catherine Cesnik and Joyce Malecki
gives some interesting current info on the ongoing open investigation of the murder of Cathy Cesnick.
One blog states:
           </p>
           <p>
            Joanne Suder an attorney for several of the women is interviewed here on the podcast "Best Case Worst-Case" and she drops some bombs. 
*She reports that more than one girl was taken to see a a dead body.
*Multiple unsolved homicides are linked to Maskell 
*Nurses reported girls being brought to them for abortions.
*Multiple LEO's were involved in the abuse and it was not just limited to Keough, public school girls reported as well.
*She made a specific request to men who had attended St Martin's camp in the 1950s. Maskell worked there and she feels abuse occurred and it wasn't reported.
A very compelling listen to say the least."
           </p>
           <p>
            Found another article that seemed to indicated girls were being brought to gynecologists (for abortions?)
           </p>
           <p>
            "It is possible he may have been in the exam room,” said Dr. Christian Richter, a gynecologist Father Maskell took some of the Keough to and who the 1994 plaintiffs alleged had participated in their abuse, “in the absence of parents, I don’t know, to calm the girl. She was 16. She probably had a great deal of faith in him."

           </p>
           <p>
            Also on the facebook blog when a "Skippy" search is made, this comment pops up:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Gemma (facebook page cofounder) has said multiple times that Podesta is not Skippy. Since she has 100% of the investigation notes and footage....and we have 10% ....I tend to believe her until documentation is provided."

            Also note that this facebook page, though initially started as requesting help from the public in solving this case, now states that they decline friend requests to protect their safety.

             Well, It has been bothering me quite a bit, the part about how her car was left there right by her house, she would have returned from shopping so how did she get to the garbage dump with her car at her apartment?  I think Gerry Koob was somehow involved.  She was pregnant with his child, no?  Did he want her to be?  He may have arranged to pick her up when she returned in her car and they made a trip out there to talk, you know to be quite alone.  Or, he was involved in the rapes of these girls with others and offered to ride her out there for Maskell, knowing she would never accept a ride from the priest.  This is the one I most believe, for why would he do that for the priest, unless he was also involved. We know he was somehow involved because they were told to lay off.  I am convinced he was willing to help get rid of her because it was a kill two birds with one stone situation.  His friend could also have been involved and was happy to help lie to give him an alibi.  They probably already knew that LE would cover for them.  He passed two lie detector tests?  Who gave those tests? Why LE of course.  He also felt perfectly safe now denying he had said he had a relationship with her because he trusted he was safely covered.    So this should be the end of wondering about JP being the Skippy involved in Sr. Cathy's murder?  Is she finally saying it?  Who says "I tend to believe her"?  Idk, it is possible it is not him, but with him being Italian and his father in with the mob, I think about Pelosi's father being Italian and in with the mob in Baltimore and the Army tie in with Podesta's dad too.  Then there are the coincidental Eugene McCarthy dates as well. Could be just a lot of coincidental evidence.  So many loose ends.  But I am so very sure about Koob.  So very sure.  What do you think?

              I don't think it was Podesta as Skippy. Reading the Facebook page The Keepers Official Group Justice for Cathy Cesnik, the comments there describe Skippy as someone who ran around with a Bill Schmidt and they liked to run around parading as a pregnant nun and priest. If Podesta was a McCarthy political volunteer, he'd hardly do that,right?
             </p>
             <p>
              Koob's current pictures show a satisfied 79 y.o. retired from the Methodist ministry. Now why would a Catholic Jesuit switch to being Methodist? Was he under a cloud and quietly asked to leave the Church? Did he know more about the crime but kept silent? I'd like to know if he came forward in 1994-95 and helped support the Jane Does court suit. I'd like to ask questions on their  Facebook page but in viewing it, it looks insular, doesn't want new members and criticizes some of the members inquiries. 
I also don't understand why the authorities continue to doubt that the Keough sex scandal was connected to Cesnick's murder when in old newspaper reports there was testimony by former Sister Mary Florita indicating that. She is now deceased I believe.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the Catholic Church knows more, probably sheltering in it's nursing homes some relict that will go to his grave with hidden knowledge of the crime. Surprised to read that Catholic nuns are not mandated reporters like nurses, teachers,etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, the 2002 Catholic lay panel designed to report on sex abuse by priests is (or was) headed by ex-Fbi twice. First chairman Gov Keating (ex FBI) quit. Leon Panetta (ex CIA) quit, interim chairman Ann Burke, a judge, quit. Probably didn't want to collude in a coverup. And the bodies of some of those women were placed on military ground , I believe, to avoid local police jurisdiction (like Maskell's brother, a lieutenant in the Baltimore police force for 20 years) and to give the FBI a chance to cover it up like they did years later in the Finders fiasco.

               Yes, I too after seeing the little item on their facebook page, have finally concluded that it is not Podesta either.  But I do think that Koob is involved in some way.  I don't think he killed her, but drove her there for the priest.  How other wise did her car remain at her residence?  Also, the reason many will not sign on or quit as judges is because of whom they may be covering up for.  I believe some very high up in the sky people were partaking of the horrible disgusting crimes.  I think getting to the bottom of this case would bring down  the Archdiocese of Baltimore.  They are afraid to be involved in such a high profile case and to cause the Catholic Church any more payouts.  Especially in Baltimore.

            This is what puzzles me: in 2017 Baltimore  police investigators are saying this
           </p>
           <p>
            "Investigators 'have never established that [Cesnik] was killed because of information that she had about abuse in the Catholic Church,' said Armacost, though she acknowledged that's a theory, among others, that police have pursued."

            But in 2005:
           </p>
           <p>
            "but the most startling evidence comes from now-retired Sister Mary Florita, a former School Sisters of Notre Dame teaching nun. 
“I knew several of the kids at Keough,” says Marian Weller of Harrisburg, Pa., the former Sister Mary Florita. “And one of them described to me how three or four girls who were being abused by this priest had gone to Sister Cathy for help. There’s no question but that she knew about the abuse that was taking place during the months leading up to her death.”

            Are the Baltimore police picking and choosing what testimony they follow?

             I believe they are.  Some are either caught up in it themselves or they are being controlled by those in power.  Think Army Generals, Police Commanders and Bishops and the Hierarchy.  A Powerful Wall.

            There wasn't just one murder about that time in Baltimore in that area:
           </p>
           <p>
            "20-year-old Joyce Malecki—was found strangled and stabbed to death in a small creek located on the U.S. Army’s Fort Meade military base in Anne Arundel County, only a few miles from where Cesnik’s body would later turn up. That crime also has never been solved.The FBI held the original jurisdiction on the Malecki case because the body was found on a “government reservation  Father Maskell was Joyce Malecki’s parish priest during a two-year period shortly before she was killed. "  But a spokesman for the Anne Arundel County Police insists that no investigation of any kind had ever been conducted by his police department and referred the inquiry back to the FBI."
           </p>
           <p>
            (How convenient: dump the body on military grounds, then the FBI gets to close the case a la Finders in Florida)
           </p>
           <p>
            "County police said Thursday they also are exploring possible connections between Cesnik's death and those of three others whose bodies were found in other jurisdictions: 20-year-old Joyce Helen Malecki, who disappeared days after the nun did and whose body was found at Fort Meade; 16-year-old Pamela Lynn Conyers, whose body was found in Anne Arundel County in 1970; and 16-year-old Grace Elizabeth "Gay" Montanye, whose body was found in 1971 in South Baltimore."

             From the Baltimore Sun/City Paper:  “If all of these new findings are accurate, it looks to me like we’ve got two murders, four days and a few miles apart. And both of the victims seem to be tied directly to the school and the church,” he said. “I just hope they’ll figure it out. I hope we can get closure on Sister Cathy, before I go to meet my maker.”  Roemer solver nearly every case.  Seems to me he was right, those two were connected and that others were trying to push the theory that they were not.  Who would you believe?  This article is an amazing account of The Keepers case.  Riveting, imo. I am now going to read the other one.

            Thanks for keeping this on the front burner at Voat.

            From the article:" Real change is brought about when ordinary people refuse to yield."
           </p>
           <p>
            A few discussion points:
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Paul Mc Hugh, a witness for the defense in the 1994 suit, who pretty much debunked Jane Doe's testimony because it was "false memory", has this in his background:
           </p>
           <p>
            In the 1960s : "Following his year in London, McHugh went to the Division of Neuropsychiatry at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.[8]
-- University Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
-- Former member of the United State Conference of Catholic Bishop's National Review Board
           </p>
           <p>
            is a practicing Catholic.[3] According to a 2002 New York Times article, he is a Democrat "who describes himself as religiously orthodox, politically liberal and culturally conservative -- a believer in marriage and the Marines, a supporter of institutions and family values."[3]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2001, McHugh was appointed by President George W. Bush to the Presidential Council on Bioethics
           </p>
           <p>
            2002, McHugh was appointed to a lay panel assembled by the Roman Catholic Church to look into sexual abuse by priests.[3] and was "the panel's lone mental health professional"
           </p>
           <p>
            ''If you discover that the content is wild,'' Dr. McHugh said, ''like the person says the priest and they went to a Satanic cult, if you discover that the person has another serious mental illness that deranges them, and if you can't find any corroborating evidence of any sort, then those things should be weighed into account"
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. McHugh has had experience with Army Research, is a devout Catholic . His statement above fails to take into account that pedophiles will actively seek out "damaged goods" as victims so that their credibility is questioned by "experts" like Dr. McHugh. Like Father Maskell in Baltimore did ,receiving confessions from troubled girls and riding around in police cars : "used to ride around at night in an unmarked patrol car with a cop,” says one woman who told City Paper she’d been abused. “They had a portable flasher they could stick on top of the car, and they would sneak up on kids who were making out and harass them. I remember feeling very frightened and very angry when I saw how Father Maskell and the police were getting away with that.”
           </p>
           <p>
            And in reference to "uncorroborated" evidence, if evidence is suppressed by hostile or biased prosecutors then witnesses are left without a leg to stand on. Father Maskell's brother was a 20 yr Baltimore police officer. Bias?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Catholic lay panel on sexual abuse by priests begun in 2002 that Dr. McHugh served on had as chairman former Gov. Frank Keating who quit after a year. " The resignation letter sounded the same law-and-order note that Mr. Keating, a former prosecutor and F.B.I. agent, has used from the beginning. That tone had set him at odds with other members of the 
board, which is made up of prominent Catholics and includes lawyers, business figures, a psychiatrist and a former White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta. 
The church, he said in the letter, is a ''home to Christ's people.''
''It is not a criminal enterprise,'' Mr. Keating said. ''It does not condone and cover up criminal activity. It does not follow a code of silence. My remarks, which some bishops found offensive, were deadly accurate. I make no apology.
''To resist grand jury subpoenas, to suppress the names of offending clerics, to deny, to obfuscate, to explain away; that is the model of a criminal organization, not my church"
           </p>
           <p>
            This was Dr. McHugh's response to Keating's resignation: "
''I think his reckless behavior in his verbiage reflects a lack of caring for the job he has, not being able to commit himself to it,'' Dr. McHugh said.
           </p>
           <p>
            The panel came out in 2004 with results of it's audits:" In March, a bishop's committee refused to authorize audits for 2004.
Some bishops oppose such audits, particularly after two reports released this year showed that the sex scandal in the church over the last 50 years was worse than expected."
           </p>
           <p>
            Would it be fair to say that although Dr. McHugh has valid credentials ( the coauthor of the MME (mini mental exam) and  the Psychiatry chair at John Hopkins who ended gender reassignment surgery) might he be a little biased against testimony that would harm the Catholic Church?

             Thank you for this write up.  I am so sick of these politician church going hypocrites and liars.  They run around espousing their "family values" while cheating on their wives, or sodomizing children. Yes, he was put in by Bush to do the dirty work of the Vatican and the pedo elite. His background and credentials speak to us about how he would back up those that appointed him and in 1994 that  was why he made that decision to ignore the real truth.  He was well on to his way to a lucrative career.

              Thank you,  we all  have to deal with  our personal  lives besides our lives on voat.  l thank all for all they do.  I am waiting to get a molar tooth pulled Tues. morning and even though I am on antibiotics til then the pain meds are not helping.  Keeping my mind on here helps when I think of the pain of others mine does not seem so bad.  The True Earth article is phenomenal, imo.

                OOH!  I will try that.  I have heard of oil of cloves.  Will get some in morning.  Thank you for tomorrow will be the hardest day probably.  I feel like a pregnant woman that wants to give birth.  Get it out already!  I am not one to be afraid of the dentist.  Usually the treatment is less painful than the problem.

                 I am still reading the article and researching at same time.  I am looking into the Fort Meade Army Base because remember that we have seen articles on here about CP and rape taking place on army bases.  Fort Meade in MA could be involved.

              It will take me time to read both of these.  I am also working on something in Racine, but I will read them.  Tooth comes out tomorrow and the oil of clove worked.   I only used a dab.  Thanks!  I am hoping to sleep tonight.

             I understand your frustration when posting-- this forum format isn't always user friendly. If you can add all of your information to the link you originally posted by clicking the edit button, then all the info will be in one place. If EL already jumped in, that means you might end up with a lot of comments and people might miss some of your info that you posted in the comments section.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it's easier, create a new post with all the info you now have, plus incorporate
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Enigmatic_Continuum">
              @Enigmatic_Continuum
             </a>
             's suggestions, and then delete this one before too many people see it.
            </p>
            <p>
             And thanks for pinging me. ;-)

            "possible" info that "suggests"
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, because speculation by a blogger is somehow of import.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALL ANYONE HAS TO DO is INTERVIEW the woman featured in The Keepers and ASK HER.  She actually MET this "Skippy" and interacted with him enough times to ID him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone actually done that?  NO, that would make TOO MUCH SENSE and would CUT THROUGH THE CRAP and get RIGHT TO THE ANSWER.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't have that, now, can we?  No, it's "more fun" to write about it for CLICK REVENUE and speculate about it incessantly!!

             Good question.
            </p>
            <p>
             I checked this Facebook site: " There is still an active Facebook group run by the two now-retirees and grandmothers, asking for any theories or information pertaining to Sister Cathy's death. "https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Who-Killed-Sister-Cathy-Cesnik-43583533#photo-43583527
            </p>
            <p>
             I found this comment in June: 
"Roberta Roberts If Sharon daughter of Barbara Schmidt is on this FB group she needs to print this picture and show it to her mom!!!! Also Margaret needs to look at it too."
·  June 3 at 8:55am 
I asked to join their group, if accepted and able to make comments,if I find anything out will post to Voat.

            : I have been lurking for quite some time now and while always feeling the need to comment, I have not. Reason being is someone usually beats me to the punch, so to speak, with obvious outrage or providing various links to corroborate the info. Today I feel the need to post a link with possible information that suggests that JP is, in fact, tied to Sister Cesnik's murder. I have included the link for further review. While this website is not what would be labeled at main stream media, it is very informative and very well laid out with links to his own research. Thank you for your time.
