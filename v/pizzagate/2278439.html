            Watch the Movie called Mother! (2017).
Then you will understand what is going to happen.
They are going to burn down the pizza organization and then rebuild it with a new face!

            Just found out Oliver Stone offered James Files an "encounter" if Files would sign the offered movie agreement. Bad move, Files hated David Ferrie cause Ferrie was a homo child molester. Stone hasn't mentioned Files since, and Files loathes Stone. Stone is another sicko. Files, says his friend, would have gladly stuck a knife in Stone's throat. Stone made a movie about the bi-sexual Alexander the Great.

             Ferrie actually carried on sexually with a teen age Lee Harvey Oswald.
There is at least one picture online  of them in a group in an  Air National Guard setting, Ibelieve.
Oswald's known bisexuality was used for blackmailing purposes in an era when homosexual activity was taboo.

              I'm aware of the photo, wouldn't surprise me if Ferrie did that, tho I'd want to run it by LHO's mistress Judyth Baker first, get her opinion. Tho she defends him vociferously ... but she might have no problem admitting this about Lee.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's hard to get the truth, for example, Lee told Files his lip scar came from an accidental gun butt. but he told Judyth it was from high school football. Lee simply could have been lying to Judyth.

            Charles Rangel would be leaving today but he's already gone. Remember the 99,000 cash in his freezer? That money is on hand to do things you can only pay cash for. Think pedo parties and live streaming parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Larry Craig and Mark Foley how Republicans and they are gone. Early outed pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish I could get help I'm doing the Deeds of Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Omaha is where it was built. Sen. Ben Sasse was tied to the page boy scandal along with Congressman Mark Foley.
           </p>
           <p>
            During Ben Sasse is campaign I contacted the Nebraska Republican party and Democratic Party. I gave them both the information. I told the Republicans they could win with their guy if they came out with this. I told the Democrats they would lose unless they got somebody else. They told me they had no idea about Ben Sasse. Both parties sit down and did nothing and let him go in. We already know there is no real party system in the US. But princess needs to go down. Chris Todd is another one but he is gone. I believe Lindsey Graham is one of them also.
           </p>
           <p>
            How come no one's ever looked into Ben Sasse when he has already had these problems surrounding him before he was even elected?
           </p>
           <p>
            Further governor vilsack had people around him like staff who were involved. Noreen Gosch shared with me some of those sacks people where in the snuff p*** party watching it be filmed live. The killing of kidnapped Paperboy Eugene Martin. The next paper boy taking off the streets like Johnny Gosch. I know Ben Sasse is one of them. Just wanted to share this. It's all about pizza!

            I'm surprised people believe this jewish snake. Milo endorsed sex between young men and older men. He said: "13-year-olds and 25 or 28-years-olds, claiming “these things do happen, perfectly consensually".  His ass got canned over at Brietbart for it. Now he's trying to walk that shit back. Why cant people see the alt-right movement was jew-jacked from the git-go???

               ? Let's be more constructive. I'm happy to pay someone $20 for a book given the work that goes into it. When you look back at last year, Milo did more than the whole of the republican party to get Trump elected without whom the swamp would still be growing. If his next book is a pile of shit I'd still buy it

              Yes....it takes courage to try to find your way to truth after being ass raped and groomed as a kid.  Honestly I know the white right folks hate him for being homo....but think about it.  He was MADE.  It is not his fault.

                Dude we will have to give some people a pass because it will hasten the surrender of the leaders.  Do you understand that if you make it a MEGA CULLING with no discrimination you force the people on the edges to fight to the death.  If you want to hurry the surrender you offer hope.....weither you plan to keep you end of the bargin when the normies realize that all the vaccines are just a population reduction plan....weither they can avoid the noose is debateable....but offering them a way out just speeds up the victory.

               "Biosocial" is the term some professionals use to describe external events (social) that permanently, measurably - impact on developing nerve systems (bio). 
Putting a patch upon one eye of a newborn kitten, and removing it after 6 weeks will leave that one eye permanently sightless, despite being a completely healthy eyeball.
The nerves will simply not grow and attach without external stimuli.
In like fashion, if a younger person experiences orgasms with an older person, that imprint will be carried within the individual's nervous system for a lifetime.
