<p>this is very much a global problem, traffickers  capitalize on the demand for our children, yes yours.</p>
<p>About 2/3 of victims live in Asia.  Cambodia, because of its poverty. 
Children born into poverty and sold to pay the parents debt ,they are sold for sex. Parents know this but do it anyway.  they are desperate and go into denial . thousands of men flock here each year.
it has become a magnet for people who prey on the young .  
</p>
<p>......when Sushila managed to flee from a brothel   in Nepal, the big scar on her back did not matter. What mattered to her was that she was home alive.  later, when she saw another woman with a similar scar . She made inquiries  and found that their skin was “stolen” to “make rich men and women beautiful”. </p>
<p>Unicef have found that a number of children - many having lost their parents in Haiti earthquake - are been sold for next to nothing for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. </p>
<p>Low-skilled workers from China, Romania, Africa, Turkey, Thailand, the Philippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and India migrate voluntarily for contract labor in the construction business.</p>
<p>......in Spain, birth parents were told the children had died and forged documents were presented to back up the story. Parents never saw the bodies of their children or their graves. No one knows how many children were stolen from their parents . </p>
<p>......The step-mother  would often duct tape Natalie’s arms and legs to her body, tape her mouth closed with a sock in it and but her in a suitcase from 8am in the morning until 10pm at night. </p>
<p>.......two older men invited  them to a birthday . Both girls were knocked unconscious, driven to Romania, blindfolded, taken across a river in an dinghy , a dinghy you would not count on for survival, to somewhere in Hungary, made to walk through the forest across the border during the night. Food , rest, bathroom issues , cries for momma weren’t answered as the traffickers did not have a care....they took a long journey with hi risk to move these kids.   Some were beaten for not keeping up, some raped.  
</p>
<p>....They were sold on to two separate men. Katya worked on the streets. she managed to escape and was sheltered for a while in the Moldovan embassy when she discovered she was pregnant.
She chose to return to her family in Moldova but her traffickers found her, beat and raped her brother as a punishment .the friend she had been kidnapped with had been murdered by traffickers in Israel who had drugged her and thrown her off a seven-storey building. </p>
<p>Most kids come from environments 
Where they have already been abused.</p>
<p>......What if then it angered my brother and made him do even worse things as punishment? I hoped keeping my mouth shut would show him I was willing to be silent forever and keep this as just an ‘incident’ and he would stop in return. But he didn’t.</p>
<p>.......Police found the girl in the closet, with only her shaved head sticking out of a black cloth bag. She had been duct taped in a seated position with her arms and legs bound so she couldn’t move. She was also covered in feces because she could not get to a bathroom from her closet prison. Police said that, once freed from her bindings, she was so weak she couldn’t stand up.</p>
<p>an 11 years old has spoken out about her abuse at the hands of the cult.  She was forced to sleep with a married couple. sexual contact was allowed with children from around the age of 11 — the same age Berg had sex with his own daughter.
Christina, has finally spoken out about the horrific abuse she suffered during childhood.</p>
<p>Typically regions with less education, wealth, and public media suffer the worst, ie. poverty stricken areas. </p>
<p>I would still recommend looking through all the links below about how people in positions of power will take advantage of those weaker than them whether it\'s a doctor, politician, teacher, business owner, or even your parents.  pedophilia in some regard is being aided by government agencies,  (CPs) businesses ( pizza restaurant )and possibly the president,(The franklin affair).  I believe boys were taken to the WH to be drugged and raped by Bush Senior.  We also know there is suspicion with Obama.  
</p>
<p>So this is where they get access to our kids.</p>

            Thank you for this and all you do here ! My heart goes out to those poor children .  What they’ve endured just stabs my heart with sadness .  Really how can anyone not believe who’s presently ruling this world ? “THE ruler of this world will be cast out,” said Jesus to the people on one occasion. Later, he added that ‘the ruler of the world had no hold on him’ and that “the ruler of this world has been judged.” (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11) Of whom was Jesus speaking? I think we all know . If God was ruling this present system of things , this kind of stuff would never be a thought in anyone’s mind .

            apparently the problem freemasons are only 1st degree or entered apprentices with different stakes compared to uncle masons. The grandpa masons (1st degree grandfathered inter-generational bloodlines) direct regional and local human sacrifices. This is of course done through the lodge system. The lodge system is the local masonic lodges that are either places of deception and controlled violence against men woman and especially children non-masonic family member children profane children without repercussion. Tis the way of life in this world its the good ole' boys aint no doin no harm. Fuck around and talk candidly about this it doesnt matter if its a uniformed police officer or any mason hears you saying this they are either going to slit your throat in a corner of the nearest building. they will call a local clown to drag you into a closet or a janitors room and slit your fucking throat. They threaten to murder peoples families and every masonic lodge talks about the "sexy" (in their words) local schoolchildren. They are the people who go to public schools and take the yearbook and photos of the children. The school photos that they send back to you in an envelope. Notice the flash and photography paraphernalia. Along with the thing that you pose in front of the cloud backround canvas or cloth. This is what they do in the lodge of the members having sex and even snuffing children. In the beggining they are raped that there is the third eye. Then you have to sit in a kiddy pool and members will urinate and defecate and bring Tupperware containers of their feces and smear it over you as you are being photographed. That is why everyone in the mainstream and the alternative media say nothing. The skippy video was podesta paying his dues. Child sacrifice is the staple of freemasonry

            Fogdryer, this would be a more effective post if you embedded the links supporting each of your points in the text referencing them. All you have to do is select the relevant text, click the third formatting button, paste the url in the little window that pops up, and hit save.

            We are unable to see true evil because it’s too horrid... it shuts my brain down, like a tidal wave... like undertow, it wants to pull me under.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the sickness that they want to make legal. I cannot even conceive of a world where these crimes are ignored... yet it’s this world that I live in.

            Most youth who fall victim to prostitution today come from environments where they have already been sexually abuse. To be sure, the majority of children in America who are exploited sexually have already endured a life of physical, sexual, or psychological abuse. Indeed, the contributor to a child entering into a life of child sex trafficking is a prior life of sexual abuse. Along with this, many of these children who have already been exposed to sexual abuse have problems with low self-esteem, and do not receive the educational opportunities they deserve. For some teens who have suffered abuse from the hands of family members, they may seek escape by running away from home. As a result, they are more likely to end up homeless, and may choose a life style of prostitution in order to “make ends meet,” financially, so to speak. These youth are more inclined to be placed into foster homes or group homes, and are also more likely to run away. Pimps also attract children by targeting them in group homes, promising them gifts, a sense of belonging, and a place where they will be loved, as well as encouraging them with presents and gifts, all while grooming them for a life of prositution.

            Before the Association of South East Asian Nations does something, at least 5 nations must approve of it.
Anti human trafficking measures were approved on 2016, with Philippines as the 5th approver.

            An Upvoat for You.  Phenom Post and So Heartbreaking.  All of the examples you gave show how our caring for children has faltered.  Greed has made people do the most horrid things and people are not paying attention.  There minds are on other things.  They think because they have all kinds of electronic Watchdogs on their kids, that they are safe  No.  Not in this New World Order.  I will check out all of your links, for Our Children are so Dear to My Heart.  Thank You for all your hard work.

             Mine too. In each of these tales, I resist imagining that it could be my kid, or the neighbor kid. I can’t help it. I feel angry, helpless and just shocked. I desire a just reckoning for this evil perhaps more than anything I have ever wanted in my whole life and I’m sure many of you feel the same.

             They all where so heart breaking True.  The Haiti story especially touched me.  I also must add that when the horrid devastation happened, and all those bodies were buried and so much death in Haiti, it was one of the largest Satanic Sacrifices ever.  The degrading way they buried those people.  It speaks of how they treat them day after day.  They created the horrible environment they have today, and parents have to sell a child to feed the others.  All the children in all the stories, they have no one.  Tears again.:(

             Of course they do, they all deserve better much better than what they get.   They are innocent, angels from heaven. And what do we do ..........?
Anyway mom just isn’t paying attention anymore, dad neither.  Our courts are testimony to this as is our literacy rate, pregnancy rate, number of runaways , and child kinapping.  Mom knows, she just doesn’t  want to get up, too much work.

               Me too but people in neighborhoods looked out for each others kids. My mom fed anyone who came home with one of her children. There is no one home now but the internet. What a sad way to grow up.
