             Yes that's what it seems. It's speculated that grandpa knows it is the little boy because the others who were on the compound claimed he was buried there, but it hasn't been confirmed.

            I was researching Little Abdul and found this from Fox News
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/09/investigators-dispute-new-mexico-granddads-claim-that-remains-in-extremist-muslim-compound-belong-to-missing-boy.html">
             http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/09/investigators-dispute-new-mexico-granddads-claim-that-remains-in-extremist-muslim-compound-belong-to-missing-boy.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators dispute New Mexico granddad's claim that remains in 'extremist Muslim' compound belong to missing boy
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigators told Fox News on Thursday that those claims were in dispute, and that medical examiners are still working to identify the remains.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The remains are in a state of decomposition that has made identification challenging," chief medical investigator Kurt Nolte said. "Investigators often try to compare remains to radiologic images, fingerprints, DNA or other identification materials."
           </p>
           <p>
            "At this time, investigators are using all known methods to make an identification, but this will not be a quick process. If we must rely on DNA results, identification could take many weeks," the office said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Siraj Wahhaj, a Brooklyn imam who, according to the New York Post, was named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, claimed the remains were the missing boy's.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said he learned from other family members that the remains were Abdul-ghani's, and that other children who lived at the compound said the child was buried there after he died.
           </p>
           <p>
            We may still get bad news regarding Little Abdul but as of yet, the coroner and investigators have not mad their final announcements.  The Imam Wahhaj should not have come out with this statement.

              Idk.  Possibly the children missed seeing him.  He was not around them and when they saw his grave they arrived at the conclusion that he had died.  Or one of the adults told them what happened.  Again, another question and no real answer.  I am thinking of doing a post on what happened to the children.  They were sent to Child Welfare Workers.  There have been reports of Juvenile Abuse in NM Youth Homes.  They are frightening.  And I am worried if they have been radicalized what are they doing to help these children.  They may just be farmed out like others.  Even more frightening.  I hope I find time.  Maybe the simpler the better.

               I looked up missing kids in NM
              </p>
              <p>
               seems the most missing have been recently
              </p>
              <p>
               on 6-26-18, 3 kids reported missing, 2 girls, ages 14 and 15 and a 16 yr old boy
              </p>
              <p>
               on 6-13, girl, 15 missing
              </p>
              <p>
               7-3 16yr girl
7-5 15 yr boy
              </p>
              <p>
               whats really strange on another site, they were naming kids that weren't on the National Missing page
              </p>
              <p>
               NCMEC is really missing a lot of kids

                Wonder if they are recruiting them for shooting like the other kids?  I put nothing past these evil people, not just the Rad Muslims but the cabal behind them.

             It seemed really fast for authorities to make a positive ID. It makes sense that the children would be talking and relay that information. How sad for all those kids having to live like that and see what they have seen.

            Wahhaj's father was an unindicted co-conspirator in the first WTC bombing attempt.  He was also a mentor to that piece of shit Linda Sarsour.  Muslim extremist/activist/leftist.

             This is an even bigger story MSM wasn't covering:
            </p>
            <p>
             TAOS, N.M. (AP) — Prosecutors said in court documents obtained Wednesday that the father of a missing Jonesboro boy was training children at a New Mexico compound to commit school shootings.
            </p>
            <p>
             The documents say Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was conducting weapons training with assault rifles at the compound near the Colorado border where 11 hungry children were found in filthy conditions."
