<p>Kathy  Jackson was a student when she went  out with friends. “I really thought they were students at the college [I attended], but</p>
<p>they were not,”  “They were finding out information about me—where I was from, who my mom is, who my dad is, </p>
<p>what they do for a living, typical questions. When you’re in college, you don’t have a reason to wonder why people would ask.”</p>
<p>Lack of critical thinking</p>
<p>“We were in this nice hotel, and they were saying we were going to lunch.  It’ll be fun.’ I was reluctant again, but the free spirit in </p>
<p>me said</p>
<p>, ‘It’s nothing.’”  Jackson said they went to a beautiful condo—where she was assaulted, raped, and repeatedly beaten.</p>
<p>Jackson was trafficked all over the world...……………………….</p>
<p>“There are only two continents I haven’t been on and only five states I haven’t been in for more than a day,” she said.</p>
<p>$150 Billion Industry</p>
<p>Human trafficking is a $150 billion industry. It is the second most profitable illegal activity in the world.</p>
<p>Human trafficking, often called modern-day slavery, involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or </p>
<p>commercial sex act. About 21 million people around the world are victims. Sex slavery is a big component of human trafficking,</p>
<p>contributing $100 billion of the $150 billion brought in by the illegal activity. Birmingham is a major hub in the Southeast for human</p>
<p>trafficking because two of the busiest interstates for trafficking intersect here.</p>
<p>. “Those people who think we’re a relatively small Southern city, don’t realize that Birmingham sits right on two of the most traveled</p>
<p>trafficking interstates.”  I-20, due to its direct connection  of 2 cities, is one of the main routes for traffickers. And I-65, I-59, and I-459 all interconnect with major ports and cities, making it a magnet for illegal trafficking activity.</p>
<p>The truck stops along the interstates are big hubs for sex trafficking as well.     A typical model for trafficking, “The average age is 12</p>
<p>to 14 in relation to females. It’s usually a young girl who has come from an abusive, dysfunctional family setting, and she’s easily</p>
<p>lured into trafficking because of it. Sometimes she’s a runaway or a girl on the street. She is vulnerable. The trafficker will pose as</p>
<p>someone who will care for her. … And he will take care of her: he will buy her stuff and make her believe that he will never hurt her.”</p>
<p>Usually, after he has emotionally bound the girl to him, the trafficker, or “pimp,” makes her sell herself.</p>
<p>Drugs are often a factor with victims/ Many of the women rescued  have been victims of child or sexual abuse or some type of domestic violence. Many are homeless, struggling with substance abuse, or dealing with mental-health concerns.</p>
<p>“There is still a mindset to view these girls as prostitutes, but these are people who are actually struggling,” Potter said.</p>
<p>One way to identify women who are possibly trafficked is by looking for any brandings, Potter said.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the pimp has his name branded or tattooed on the victim,” she said.</p>
<p>It Can Happen Anywhere</p>
<p>Denial</p>
<p>The big misconception about trafficking is that it’s somebody else’s kid, it will never happen where we live.</p>
<p>“[Some people think], ‘We’re safe. We live in Mountain Brook or Hoover, and it takes place only in poverty-stricken areas.’ .</p>
<p>“Everybody’s child is a potential trafficking victim, and it can happen quickly. If you go to the shopping area,  you may see a </p>
<p>parent who wants to slip into a store, so he or she tells the kids to wait outside [of the store] or don’t run off, thinking that they</p>
<p>are safe. It takes literally seconds for someone to grab a kid and throw him or her into a truck. Within 24 hours, that child</p>
<p>could be on their way to South America.”</p>
<p>“When I grew up, the side of a milk carton would have a picture of a little girl 4 or 5 years old and the word ‘Missing.’ People would </p>
<p>think the child had wandered off, run away, or been kidnapped. What people didn’t realize  was there was a chance those children </p>
<p>were taken, and now they’re 30 years old and have been sex slaves since they were 4 years old.”</p>
<p>What I am hearing now, on tv, in news articles, frpm police is this: kids are being grabbed from their parents arms right on the street.</p>
<p>With trafficking lines being narrowed there is less inventory,</p>

            Forbes admits the illegal trade in human beings is
            <em>
             "one of the fastest growing criminal activities globally"
            </em>
            - many news blogs only cite the number around $30 billion for the industry, but the $150 billion annual estimate is according to the ILO report from 2014. 30 million slaves, that we know. $99 billion is from strictly commercial sexual exploitation. It's the third largest illegal industry / trade in the world, succeeded only by counterfeit &amp; pirating, and then the drug trade at $320 billion:
            <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/drugs/">
             https://www.worldometers.info/drugs/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course these industries can often be linked, drugs being used as a tool for control of said victims. You could even say it's just as damaging / important to sabotage
            <em>
             "adrenochrome"
            </em>
            trade supplies, as one anon working for a military / state patrol once documented on 4plebs, with details of the truck cargo, cloesup photos of the powder and all. Many facets of attack are required to bring down these criminal fraternities, some of them I believe to be the oldest leagues in the world. It is far from an easy task, but there are many good people in the medical, military, political, technological, even entertainment world more ready to expose this than ever.
