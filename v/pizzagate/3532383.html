<p>Kathy  Jackson was a student when she went  out with friends. “I really thought they were students at the college [I attended], but</p>
<p>they were not,”  “They were finding out information about me—where I was from, who my mom is, who my dad is, </p>
<p>what they do for a living, typical questions. When you’re in college, you don’t have a reason to wonder why people would ask.”</p>
<p>Lack of critical thinking</p>
<p>“We were in this nice hotel, and they were saying we were going to lunch.  It’ll be fun.’ I was reluctant again, but the free spirit in </p>
<p>me said</p>
<p>, ‘It’s nothing.’”  Jackson said they went to a beautiful condo—where she was assaulted, raped, and repeatedly beaten.</p>
<p>Jackson was trafficked all over the world...……………………….</p>
<p>“There are only two continents I haven’t been on and only five states I haven’t been in for more than a day,” she said.</p>
<p>$150 Billion Industry</p>
<p>Human trafficking is a $150 billion industry. It is the second most profitable illegal activity in the world.</p>
<p>Human trafficking, often called modern-day slavery, involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or </p>
<p>commercial sex act. About 21 million people around the world are victims. Sex slavery is a big component of human trafficking,</p>
<p>contributing $100 billion of the $150 billion brought in by the illegal activity. Birmingham is a major hub in the Southeast for human</p>
<p>trafficking because two of the busiest interstates for trafficking intersect here.</p>
<p>. “Those people who think we’re a relatively small Southern city, don’t realize that Birmingham sits right on two of the most traveled</p>
<p>trafficking interstates.”  I-20, due to its direct connection  of 2 cities, is one of the main routes for traffickers. And I-65, I-59, and I-459 all interconnect with major ports and cities, making it a magnet for illegal trafficking activity.</p>
<p>The truck stops along the interstates are big hubs for sex trafficking as well.     A typical model for trafficking, “The average age is 12</p>
<p>to 14 in relation to females. It’s usually a young girl who has come from an abusive, dysfunctional family setting, and she’s easily</p>
<p>lured into trafficking because of it. Sometimes she’s a runaway or a girl on the street. She is vulnerable. The trafficker will pose as</p>
<p>someone who will care for her. … And he will take care of her: he will buy her stuff and make her believe that he will never hurt her.”</p>
<p>Usually, after he has emotionally bound the girl to him, the trafficker, or “pimp,” makes her sell herself.</p>
<p>Drugs are often a factor with victims/ Many of the women rescued  have been victims of child or sexual abuse or some type of domestic violence. Many are homeless, struggling with substance abuse, or dealing with mental-health concerns.</p>
<p>“There is still a mindset to view these girls as prostitutes, but these are people who are actually struggling,” Potter said.</p>
<p>One way to identify women who are possibly trafficked is by looking for any brandings, Potter said.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the pimp has his name branded or tattooed on the victim,” she said.</p>
<p>It Can Happen Anywhere</p>
<p>Denial</p>
<p>The big misconception about trafficking is that it’s somebody else’s kid, it will never happen where we live.</p>
<p>“[Some people think], ‘We’re safe. We live in Mountain Brook or Hoover, and it takes place only in poverty-stricken areas.’ .</p>
<p>“Everybody’s child is a potential trafficking victim, and it can happen quickly. If you go to the shopping area,  you may see a </p>
<p>parent who wants to slip into a store, so he or she tells the kids to wait outside [of the store] or don’t run off, thinking that they</p>
<p>are safe. It takes literally seconds for someone to grab a kid and throw him or her into a truck. Within 24 hours, that child</p>
<p>could be on their way to South America.”</p>
<p>“When I grew up, the side of a milk carton would have a picture of a little girl 4 or 5 years old and the word ‘Missing.’ People would </p>
<p>think the child had wandered off, run away, or been kidnapped. What people didn’t realize  was there was a chance those children </p>
<p>were taken, and now they’re 30 years old and have been sex slaves since they were 4 years old.”</p>
<p>What I am hearing now, on tv, in news articles, frpm police is this: kids are being grabbed from their parents arms right on the street.</p>
<p>With trafficking lines being narrowed there is less inventory,</p>

            Forbes admits the illegal trade in human beings is

            - many news blogs only cite the number around $30 billion for the industry, but the $150 billion annual estimate is according to the ILO report from 2014. 30 million slaves, that we know. $99 billion is from strictly commercial sexual exploitation. It's the third largest illegal industry / trade in the world, succeeded only by counterfeit &amp; pirating, and then the drug trade at $320 billion:
