            Interesting proposition. Kinda like the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission in South Africa  to end apartheid. The process was viewed as restorative justice rather then retribution justice like the Nuremburg trials. Controversial still to this day. When it came to murders, family members felt deprived of justice.  But it was a quick process compared to what it would take to bring  thousands  and thousands to trial via the ordinary criminal process.  Those being granted legal immunity would forever be stigmatized  like  wearing  a "P" sign (for pervert)  on their forehead because  of Internet perpetuity.  I think before anything like that could be done the general population needs educated on just how pevasive this conduct is;  it is indeed a cancer throughout our society.

            Yep. They should do this with the whole fraud actually because at this point those associated with Deep State crimes probably number in the thousands. My guess is between 1,000 and 10,000 and that's a conservative guess. This fucker is massive. It's all throughout the government and military. It's a horrible cancer on America's collective soul and it will keep attracting more and more attention until it's removed. Blame the Interwebs.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they don't this type of blanket immunity deal I don't think the Deep State could be brought down. It's too massive.
