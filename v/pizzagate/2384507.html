<p>This video covers several (but by no means all) of the links between the Clinton\'s and people at Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), Nickelodeon, and Paramount.  Here are most of the links it covers (and some that it doesn\'t):</p>
<p>1) <a href="https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/3143d5c/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-origin-images.politico.com%2F2015%2F04%2F22%2F150422_bill_clinton_frank_giustra_ap_1160.jpg">The Clinton Foundation</a> is the link between Bill, Hillary, and Frank Giustra.</p>
<p>2) Bill and Frank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Giustra#UrAsia_Energy_Ltd._(2004%E2%80%932007)">worked together</a> to sell UrAsia Ltd. to Uranium One and to create <a href="http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d01b8d2104fd0970c-pi">the Clinton-Giustra Global Initiative</a></p>
<p>3) Frank Giustra founded Lionsgate Films (<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/71550323.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px">notice the pedo-swirl behind the logo</a>).  The first hit film Lionsgate released was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XhVCEtYhH0">American Psycho</a> and was based on the novel of the same title by <a href="https://orig00.deviantart.net/3050/f/2012/247/1/f/1fdfa8c889fc591e947cff9204c4b522-d5dj3ni.jpg">Bret Easton Ellis</a>, who recently claims to have been invited to a <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/bret-easton-ellis-tells-alan-ball-invited-bryan-singer-underage-party-audio/">Bryan Singer &quot;underage party&quot;</a> on his podcast.  Bryan singer was an investor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Entertainment_Network">DEN</a>. </p>
<p>4) Through Giustra\'s <a href="http://radcliffefoundation.org/project/elpida-home/">Radcliffe Foundation</a>, the Elpida Home for refugees was founded.  &quot;Elpida&quot; is a Greek for &quot;hope&quot; and we should all hope that the presence of the <a href="http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Social_Tech/elpida-factory-logo-and-office.jpg">boy-love symbol</a> in their <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Co1QiGtWcAAQ9-M.jpg">corporate logo</a> and on their <a href="http://radcliffefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_1764.jpg">premises</a> is a coincidence.  We should also hope that Daniel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltbzdKB8jZE">&quot;Radcliffe&quot;</a> Schneider (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHwPZckZkQ">of Nickelodeon fame</a>) is not connected in any way to Giustra\'s Radcliffe Foundation.  As of yet, I have not uncovered any information about which Radcliffe family Giustra\'s foundation is named after.  I could definitely use some help with that.</p>
<p>5) Bill Clinton has a cameo in the Disney\'s First Kid, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Kid">starring Sinbad and Brock Pierce</a>.  There are no links to the particular scenes of interest in First Kid, but my video does include Bill Clinton\'s cameo, 1 of 2 blatant pedophile symbols casually snuck into the set, and an awkward scene as the President tries to find out what sort of &quot;stuff&quot; Sinbad has been doing with his son.  What\'s weird is that I knew I would find a pedo symbol in First kid because just before that, I had come across <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Vm0onhB.jpg">these ones</a> from D2: The Mighty Ducks, which Pierce also appears in.  Appearing on the helmet, I thought, hmm, the costume designer would have been in charge of that helmet, so I <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109520/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast">looked up</a> who it was.  Her name is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0696417/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr16">Grania Preston</a> and when I saw First Kid on her credits list, I knew I would find more symbols.  I have not yet checked other movies she worked on, but they would be a likely starting point if your searching for more.  Anyways, Pierce was one of the original partners of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Entertainment_Network">DEN</a>, but currently he chairman of the board of the <a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/board-of-directors/">Bitcoin Foundation</a>* and gives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWTqdlY1S3o">speeches</a> about concurrency and self-improvement.  
</p>
<p>*Although it is not induced my main video above, there are many ties still to be found between Bitcoin, Hillary\'s 2016 Campaign, and the Clinton Foundation.  For instance, we all should know by now that pedophile rely on cryptocurrency on the dark web.  We also know that several people <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-foundation-members-resign-following-controversial-appointment/">left the Bitcoin Board when Pierce joined</a> due to his past.  Also not included in the main video is a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIXXbxssoyA">clip</a> of Giustra talking about his &quot;dabbling&quot; in Bitcoin.  These are all possibly leads to go off of.</p>
<p>6) Perhaps the most prominent donor to the 2016 Hillary Campaign was Haim Saban, a billionaire in the entertainment industry who helped create the Power Rangers TV show.  While researching the <a href="https://archive.org/details/ViacomParamount">Hollywood sexual abuse scandal</a>, I found an archived version of Alphy Hoffman\'s website from back in the day.  In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010630205508/http://www.bobbyhoffmancasting.0catch.com:80/alphy_hoffman.htm">Hoffman\'s bio section</a>, it is claimed that Saban produced a TV special for Alphy\'s Soda Pop Club and that Saban\'s daughters were members of the club.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6jFmjad37s">Corey Feldman has claimed</a> that Alphy was the son of Bobby Hoffman, a big-time producer at Paramount, but <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/corey-feldman-appears-on-dr-oz-show-names-third-alleged-paedophile-calls-out-hollywood/news-story/3441d2ece68ca4d5e54353939bafd395">later claimed</a> that Alphy was actually Bobby Hoffman\'s step-son/lover.</p>
<p>7) Finally, the Clinton Foundation is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/amid-presidential-campaign-launch-clinton-foundation-reports-rising-donations/?utm_term=.284fe3b0d99a">directly connected</a> to Prince Al Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia.  The prince has done business not only with the Clinton\'s, but also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LxRAweU7Fs">with Michael Jackson</a>.  For the record, I still do not get any bad vibes from Michael, but him  popping up among these other people may explain some of Michael Jackson\'s more cryptic statements about the elite/occult.  However, Jackson and bin Talal did <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/03/myth-prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-saudi">buy a controlling stake in Landmark Entertainment</a>, which was founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Goddard#Sexual_assault_allegations">Gary Goddard</a>.  Goddard\'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Entertainment_Group">Landmark Entertainment</a> is a massive company with a lot of big-name hotels, casinos, and them parks as clients.  Now, Goddard has been accused of pedophilia as recently as November of 2017.  Back in 2014, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1202986-egan-v-goddard.html">Goddard was sued</a> for similar behavior <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1202857-2000-burton-ryan-egan-vs-collins-rector-complaint.html">along with fellow DEN investors</a> Brock Pierce and Bryan Singer.</p>
<p>8) Pierce, Goddard, and Singer are each founders of DEN, which is the ground floor of the REAL Hollywood abuse scandal which starts with Feldman\'s claims and works its way up to the topmost levels of Paramount and Viacom.  And it is the Viacom-owned Nickelodeon that has yet to address its own scandal regarding Dan Schneider and other accused pedophiles in their ranks.  The fact that all of these people are so easily linked to the Clinton Foundation and Frank Giustra shocks me.</p>
<p>In summary, there is a lot more research that must be done before we can prove what we all want to prove: that the Clinton\'s evil goes far beyond money-laundering/pay-for-play and into much darker territory, specifically the abuse and trafficking of minors around the world.  Please check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmGULvhP8do">video</a> presentation detailing the above links and subscribe to my channel.  In the next few weeks, I plan to make more videos going deeper into this rabbit-hole.  I encourage anyone to feel free to post/share/download/cut/edit/mirror my videos so that we can expose these things as quickly as possible!</p>
<p>Oh, and here\'s links to my <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2360675">previous post</a> on the pedo symbol I found in a disturbing video from one of Dan Schneider\'s websites and also my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfFC_f69BnlrFSmOxLEPEA">Youtube channel</a>.</p>',

And it is the Viacom-owned Nickelodeon that has yet to address its own scandal regarding Dan Schneider and other accused pedophiles in their ranks.  The fact that all of these people are so easily linked to the Clinton Foundation and Frank Giustra shocks me.

           In summary, there is a lot more research that must be done before we can prove what we all want to prove: that the Clinton's evil goes far beyond money-laundering/pay-for-play and into much darker territory, specifically the abuse and trafficking of minors around the world.

He was also friends with Michael Jackson.

            <p>
             Canadian mining financier Frank Giustra formed a company called Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. for business in Colombia. From 2005, former President Bill Clinton arranges a series of meetings between Giustra and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, in which Clinton is frequently present. In 2007, Clinton even meets Uribe and Giustra at the Clintons’ home in Chappaqua, New York. Also in 2007, Pacific Rubiales signs a $300 million deal to build a pipeline in central Colombia, gains control of Colombia’s largest oilfield, and acquires the right to cut timber in a biologically diverse Colombian forest. Giustra will later insist that was purely coincidental, and he has traveled frequently with Bill Clinton without business deals. (Clinton has flown for free on Giustra’s private jet at least 25 times.) But Bloomberg News will later note, “Giustra’s globe-trotting adventures with Bill Clinton have coincided with lucrative business deals.”

            <p>
             In 2007, Giustra and Bill Clinton cofound a Canadian offshoot of the Clinton Foundation called the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP). It will later be alleged that this is a “slush fund” allowing foreigners to donate money indirectly to the Clinton Foundation in the hopes of getting favorable treatment from the Clintons.

             In 1991, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) issued a secret intelligence report showing that Uribe “worked for the Medellin [drug] cartel” and is “a close personal friend of Pablo Escobar Gaviria,” the notorious drug lord. Uribe continues to be linked to a variety of scandals and human rights abuses during his presidency.

            <p>
             A small cadre of players--executives, investors, consultants and underwriters--have a hand in many of the junior mining deals being done in Canada at any given time. At the centre of this web is Frank Giustra, who repays the loyalty of friends and partners with lucrative roles in his various mining-related endeavours. Many of these same people are also major donors to the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative

              The William J. Clinton Foundation has announced a $100 million pledge to the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative (CGSGI) from Vancouver-based Lundin for Africa, the philanthropic arm of the Lundin Group of Companies.
The goal of the recently launched initiative is to alleviate poverty and build sustainable local economies in developing countries. The grant, which matches $100 million donations in support of the initiative from Canadian mining financier Frank Giustra and Mexican businessman Carlos Slim, will be directed toward approved projects in Africa, where the Lundin Group has significant mining, oil, and gas interests.

            I remember a picture someone posted of BC and FG walking in Haiti.  Walking with them was the most beautiful little Black Girl.  She was about 4 or 5 yrs. old.  I have never forgotten it.  I can draw it up in my mind at any time.  My husband remembers it too.  Very Telling.  Where were they taking her?  Scary.

            Sonny Bono also makes a cameo in First Kid. apparently he was a bit of a sadistic fuck, at least some posts on crazy days and nights (CDAN) would lead one to believe that. interesting that he made his way from entertainment to politics and seems to be hanging around with some of these seedy types.

            Excellent post, OP! Upvoat! :-)

             Jackson was MK Ultra since he was a child and was always easily controllable. He, like most every famous act in the last 40 years, was a facilitator that to deliver fans (child groupies) to the Pedo Elite.
