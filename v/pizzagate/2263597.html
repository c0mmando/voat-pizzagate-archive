<p>As I went through these links, I noticed that all these stories have something in common: <strong>They happened in the state of Virginia</strong>. Hmmm. Interesting fact, the state of Virginia is said to be one of the <strong>WEALTHIEST</strong>: <a href="http://247wallst.com/economy/2016/05/19/virginia-dominates-all-states-with-wealthiest-towns-in-america">http://247wallst.com/economy/2016/05/19/virginia-dominates-all-states-with-wealthiest-towns-in-america</a></p>
<p>Virginia also seems to be the state with the highest number of missing kids per capita (<a href="http://www.newnationalist.net/2016/11/29/pizzagate-virginia-dc-areas-hubs-for-missing-children/">source</a>). As state in the article,  &quot;<strong>apparently, the state of Virginia has by far the highest number of missing kids per capita in the nation at 0.00467</strong>&quot; </p>

            <p>
             On June 28, 2011, a human resources manager of a poultry farm in Winesburg, Ohio and members of his family were threatened with death by possible members of the Mara Salvatrucha Gang (MS-13).
            </p>
            <p>
             The human resources manager believes he is being threatened due to a labor union issue at the poultry farm. Three unidentified males are believed to be responsible for placing a threatening hand written note in the mailbox at the managerâ€™s residence. One of the males was seen with a camera and appeared to take photographs of the residence. The men, who appeared to be of Guatemalan descent according to a witness, left the scene in a gray or silver standard cab pickup truck.

             Second one on how MS 13 guards Mexico's southern border, collects taxes,  and keeps Arabs out.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>

            </p>
            <p>
             As I may have mentioned earlier, corruption on Mexico's southern border works
very well. Migrants are allowed to come and go, MS13 is charged an
operating tax in Guatemala, and drugs are allowed to flow, all in
exchange for money and a very strict commitment to keeping out
shady "persons of interest" (Arabs).
            </p>
            <p>
             No migrant smuggler in that part of the world will risk moving shady people into Mexico...their
jobs would be terminated.

            <p>
             The subcontract for Green Eggs has been worked this week and I would
expect that you will see that early next week. I met with the Customer
yesterday and asked about the clearances for Mark. When we asked on
Tuesday we were told they are "in process" but could not get any further
details. The Customer was going to check with his representative to see
what could be done to expedite the process. If his past clearances were
held by the same Customer and just lapsed due to time, this should not
be too big of an issue. If his past clearances were held by someone else
or terminated for any other reason, it may take longer than expected.
Can you confirm that his deactivation was simply due to lapse of
need/sponsorship and that they were previously held by this Customer?

            My guess is that most of the missing kids are organ harvested. Child organs get twice the price because they grow into size. I kid can be turned into $1+m  thats a lot of cash for a low risk crime.

             Bingo!  This is why the Clintons and CIA are using MS-13 for their dirty work, more and more.  They're all one big, happy, satanic family.

            Counties across the Washington, D.C., region are suffering from a large spike in criminal activity from the MS-13 gang, which is increasing violent attacks and recruitment.
           </p>
           <p>
            2016 appears to be no different. Fairfax County, Virginia experienced a 163 percent increase in MS-13 crimes from 2015 figures in the first four months of the year, reports WJLA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Washington, D.C., has the second largest Salvadorian community in the country behind Los Angeles at roughly 228,000 people.

            Interestingly, VA and MD have a significant MS13 problem in the immediate counties surrounding DC.  Like many other things (riots, lootings, terror attacks, etc)which don't seem to happen with any frequency in DC proper, MS13-related crimes seem almost non0existent within DC. It all happens in the suburbs.  MS13 has very large presences in Montgomery, Frederick, and Prince George counties in MD.  In VA, Prince William, Fairfax, and Loudoun counties are infested.
           </p>
           <p>
            MS13 regularly murders, rapes and disposes of its victims in Fairfax County.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the story of the Muslim teenage girl murdered as she walked home from the mosque after Ramadan services?  Not a racist white man, but MS13 member, who raped and bludgeoned her to death with a baseball bat.  That doesn't get reported.
           </p>
           <p>
            MS13 is a crime syndicate which makes its money on drugs and human trafficking.  Given its nature of business, it only makes sense that they would be snatching kids for the DS.  Given the demand around the Beltway, a constant and steady supply is needed.
           </p>
           <p>
            So yes, MS13 is balls deep and likely heavily accounted for in the sealed indictments, IMO.

             Thank you for mentioning about the Muslim girl coming home from Ramadan service. Beaten with a baseball bat. I got in a twitter war with a young No VA guy right before the gubernatorial  election, when I told him that No VA is ruining the state for the rest of us. I used the example of Fairfax County not being safe to be in after dark and didn't he notice how buttoned up it is after 6:30. Little creep said it was the nature of the area-that businesses close for the day and people go home. Um no....been going up there for family member doctor appointments at one of the big hospitals up there since 2011 and they have started warning you to use extreme caution in Fairfax and venture out at night to a minimum. It's gotten really bad and it's nto going to get any better with McAuliffs successor of idiot north am.

              Fairfax is/was 2nd or 3rd richest county in the US.  Loudoun next door is the richest county in the US.  Fairfax is extremely safe with a competent and professional police force.  I'll make the assumption that FCPD is pedo-free, but I doubt that that.  There are sections of Fairfax and other surrounding counties which are heavily Latino, and by default, MS13.

              I'd be willing to bet it's a lot more than one prison in VA they control.  Likely every prison CA across through TX.  MS13 is very big in the DC area - prisons in MD, WV, and VA are heavily dominated by MS13.  Right down to the county level.  First hand experience.  Correct side of the bars.

               It's just another economy for the mob to control. In prison drug dealing is a huge money maker for them.
Going further down the rabbit hole, MS13 were being released from prison with the help of a corrupt judicial system (esp corrupt Judges) to go out and do hits for the mob.
They have their street soldiers everywhere. Gang members make their presence known if you've ruffled some feathers, or they will go straight for the hit. Sanctioned hits called by very high up people in this country.

               Agreed and not my post above. The only solution is the death penalty for child trafficking. Except that it costs so much to get to the point of execution with the public paying Public Defender fees. Of course on paper gang members are broke. Or their girlfriends own the vehicles they drive.

               Deport them? They'll be back the next night via the underground tunnel system. Make them life the rest of their lives in total isolation so that don't create more havoc in the prison system?

                By the time PG reaches full steam (next year), I think you will see a resurgence in calls to bring back the gallows and firing squad.  Electricity is expensive.  Riding the lightning isn't cheap.

               Yeah, I'm not disputing that.  I was only vouching for the intel that I had.  That's why my source quit his (high-paying) prison job - he was too worried that he'd get dragged into some prison bullshit and knifed over a misunderstanding.

             Eh, maybe. Some of the states don't add up though. 50 indictments in Utah? Bro, MS-13 isn't in Utah.

            post below:

           <hr/>
           <p>
            I DID A CURSORY LOOK AT NCMEC POSTINGS FOR A FEW STATES AND FOUND SOME ODD THINGS  which made me wonder if the pedophiles don't shop NCMEC for their kids.  NEARLY HALF OF KIDS MISSING IN VIRGINA ARE LISTED WITHOUT A PICTURE!
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY ARE THERE NAMES OF MISSING KIDS BUT NO PICS? ARE THE NAMES OF THE KIDS MISSING IN VIRGINIA REALLY THE KID'S NAME?
           </p>
           <p>
            ARE THEY THE CONTACT PERSON'S NAME?  IS THE POST JUST SO THE 'BUYERS' CAN SEE A DESCRIPTION OF THE KIDS AVAILABLE FOR SALE?
           </p>
           <p>
            ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE THE KID'S UNDER A PHONY NAME?
           </p>
           <p>
            WHAT IF THE KIDS ARE NOT EVEN FROM VIRGINIA, BUT FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,  AND VIRGINIA , USING ITS OWN PROGRAM, IS JUST A CENTRALIZED CLEARING HOUSE?
           </p>
           <p>
            YOU WOULD THINK THAT IF 34 KIDS WENT MISSING, EVEN RUNAWAY, IN ONE CITY, IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER ALONE TO DATE, IT WOULD  MAKE THE NEWS.

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On October 30, 2007, the body of an unidentified Hispanic male, age 18-30, was located in a field behind an office building located at 1800 Wittington Place in Farmer’s Branch, Texas (Dallas County). It is believed the John Doe had been deceased for 1 or 2 days prior to discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
             He had black hair, styled in a Mohawk.
             <strong>
              He had multiple circular scars on the anterior and posterior surfaces of his forearms and legs and three parallel linear scars on his anterior left wrist
             </strong>
             . He had a
             <strong>
              tattoo of a barcode with “080387” on his right shoulder
             </strong>
             . He was found wearing a black and blue zippered sweatshirt ("Iron Fist" brand), a red “Reebok” brand shirt with "New Jersey" and "Jason Kidd" printed on it (described as a basketball jersey), black jogging pants ("Athletic Works" brand) and white athletic style shoes.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was wearing a yellow metal bead necklace and had a yellow metal square earring with a clear stone in his right ear.
             <strong>
              He also had a white cloth band around his left ankle.
             </strong>
             The reconstruction featured above is an artist’s rendering of what the John Doe may have looked like. Anyone with information should contact the Farmers Branch Police Department, reference case number 151838 or the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office, reference case number 3729-07-2722Z.

             I am a new poster, but not a new user. I was given some interesting information on NCMEC and in particular the state of Virginia. It appears that Virginia has a larger than normal amount of missing children that have no picture attached. I had this infographic appear in my timeline and tagged for me specifically

             This seems very odd to me as less than half of these children have pictures.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you click the link to see the poster of the child, still no picture. OP of /pol/ thread called NCMEC and asked why no photos and they stated that

             they can't post pictures without parents/guardians permission. This seems as if it is PG related as Brian Podesta is NCMEC Senior Analyst

             , with a security clearance of of TOP SECRET-SENSITIVE COMPARMENTED INFORMATION. This is the highest security clearance there is. Why would this guy need security clearance that high? and at the NCMEC? WTF is this guy into? And why?

               Are you aware that the CIA created the Bloods &amp; Crips South Central LA gangs and the subsequent violence over the control of territory to distribute drugs and to promote genocide of poor Blacks? Note the current music trends and the general dumbing down of society.

            Back in the 80's, there was an influx of El Salvadoran refugees into the NY metro area (and elsewhere).  If you remember how corrupt and dangerous things were in El Salvador - that US missionaries were raped and murdered by the National Guard - then you remember why.  These people were fleeing the dangerous slaughter, and locally they were known to be hard workers and very religious.
           </p>
           <p>
            MS-13 was constructed and created by El Salvadoran refugees in Los Angeles IN RESPONSE TO OTHER GANGS.   Then it spread across the country and across the border.  A lot of the MS13 kids are second and third generation Americans.   These people were corrupted right here on US soil.

            So yeah they're heavily involved in trafficking, and I have no doubt they're hired for hit jobs as well.

             They run all of the prisons in CA. To curb the violence they were split up and sent to other prisons. That meant more bases from which to run their statewide criminal operation. Also a convenient way to recruit other incarcerated violent men given a choice of join or die in gang fights.

            Virgina also seems to be the state with the highest number of missing kids per capita (source). As state in the article, "apparently, the state of Virginia has by far the highest number of missing kids per capita in the nation at 0.00467"    I HAVE felt for quite some time that MS 13 could be pulling these kids off the street. Do I have proof? No.  But somehow it sure Seems To Add Up.

             MS 13 is Mara Salvatrucha  and are committing SRA crimes across Mexico and the US.  If is of utmost importance that we start eradicating them from our country and Mexico.  First of course comes us, but we will never stop them from coming over the boarder.  In Mexico they have burned their victims beyond recognition to the point that even their teeth have disintegrated.  I don't know if many of you remember when we researched the Seth Rich case and the SEIU janitors possibly being the hit men.  There were two guys that drove from DC down to VA (where they lived) and they were found dead in their van gangland style about 12 hrs. after Seth was shot.  They had MS 13 Ties.  They worked for SEIU.  They have been infiltrated.
