<blockquote>
<p>In 2001, Spielberg was stalked by conspiracy theorist and former social worker Diana Napolis. She accused him, along with actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, of controlling her thoughts through &quot;cybertronic&quot; technology and being part of a satanic conspiracy against her. Napolis was committed to a mental institution before pleading guilty to stalking, and released on probation with a condition that she have no contact with either Spielberg or Hewitt.[169][170][171][172]</p>
<p>Jonathan Norman was arrested after making two attempts to enter Spielberg\'s Pacific Palisades home in June and July 1997. Norman was jailed for 25 years in California. Spielberg told the court: &quot;Had Jonathan Norman actually confronted me, I genuinely, in my heart of hearts, believe that I would have been raped or maimed or killed.&quot;[173][174]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diana Napolis has her own page - <a href="http://archive.is/gSAiF">http://archive.is/gSAiF</a> - it is eerily similar to what has been uncovered so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diana Louisa Napolis (born 1955),[1] also known by her on-line pseudonym Karen Curio Jones[2] or more often simply Curio,[3] is an American former social worker. Between the late 1990s and 2000, Napolis posted a series of pseudonymous accusations alleging that individuals skeptical of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic were involved in a conspiracy to cover-up the sexual abuse and murder of children. The pseudonymous poster\'s real life identity was confirmed as Napolis in 2000.[4][5][6]
In 2001, she was charged with stalking film director Steven Spielberg, and in 2002 faced more charges for making death threats against actress Jennifer Love Hewitt,[7] and was committed to a state hospital until fit to stand trial. After a year in prison Napolis pleaded guilty to stalking and was released on probation.&gt;</p>

            Says something about aquino's response at the bottom. If JLH was involved I'm not sure I could say no to a sex ring... You do bring up a good point though. We could probably look into people that have gone after suspected celebs.
