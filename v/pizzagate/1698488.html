            I can absolutely agree with that.  Let's remember, the story goes that Donnie was a Democrat up until 2012, and then switched to a republican and then ran as one.  There's got to be a good reason for that.  I'd love to read his "When I Was President..." book.  I'm sure there will be one.

            I'm totally down for this. My skills as a researcher are limited but I can be a great internet troll. A group as small as 10 people could have a big effect on social media working together.

            That's what I love about the meticulous and simply diabolical nature of Donald Trump's investigation.  Though I wish this were more swift, I love how calculated, cool, calm, and collected he seems.
