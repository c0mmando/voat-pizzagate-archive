<p><strong>Can some of you watch this video and give me your thoughts?</strong> I am just shocked at how blatant and mind controlling this piece is attempting to be.  The &quot;Man&quot;, his name is NEVER given, and interviewed in his home, in front of his computer screens.  He discusses some bogus story he ran during the final weeks of the campaign about an FBI Agent\'s suicide.  He said he made $8K on the fake story, and &quot;most of the money went to the writer&quot;.  He talks about how he feels &quot;a little remorse&quot; in sending out a fake story like this and how it could have impacted the Hillary campaign.  What the HELL??  Am I actually watching this on a cable news channel broadcast???</p>
<p>I am absolutely astonished at this report.  I truly believe, now after seeing this, Pizzagate has a lot of important people\'s attention. Pizzagate is no PSYOP!  This shit is scary real.  A lot of people are not going to be able to handle 20% of the truth found out through investigating this story.

            CBC (State controlled news in Fucking Leafada) ran a similar story and another one about two writers who write right-wing shill opinion "news" that only the dumbest of barely literate inbreds would take seriously. Of course these get dragged out as evidence that "fake news" tricked people into voting for Trump or that Trump supporters are idiots. Of course all my Canknucklehead friends and family bought it.
1984 happened, and America is the only country that has been able to break free of it so far.
Don't give up! We can win this war for freedom!
