           <blockquote>
            <p>
             State police suspended a search Wednesday night for a teen missing since he left his Dixon Road home in Sterling Monday afternoon for a dirt bike ride, officials said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last contact with Todd Allen, 18, was a text message just before 2 p.m. on Monday saying he had crashed his dirt bike and hurt his leg.
            </p>
            <p>
             Authorities said they have tried to call, text and ping the phone, but it has died or been shut off and they cannot get an accurate location.
            </p>
            <p>
             The search grew in scope Wednesday as state troopers were joined by search-and-rescue dog teams, as well as police and firefighters from nearby Connecticut and Rhode Island towns and the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
            </p>
            <p>
             The state police also sent up their helicopter in an attempt to help find Allen.
            </p>
            <p>
             State police said on Thursday that they do not intend to resume the search, but said DEEP staff members would continue looking for Allen. They did say troopers would return if new information was developed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trooper Kelly Grant said the bad weather — and concern for the searchers' safety — played roles in the decision to stop the search. She said troopers have been in touch with the Allen family.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dennis Schain, a DEEP spokesman, said Thursday that staff members will keep an extra eye out for Allen during their usual rounds.
            </p>
            <p>
             Troopers first learned Allen was missing when they were called to his home about 7:40 p.m. on Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
             State police said he left his home about 1 p.m. that day on his red Honda XR100 dirt bike to ride on some local trails — a common activity for him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The dirt bike does not have a headlight, so Allen's family expected him home before dark.
            </p>
            <p>
             Troopers spoke with family and friends and searched the areas he frequents, including the rails to trails bike path that runs from Sterling to Coventry, R.I., state police said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Allen is 5 feet 10, weighs about 130 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes. He was wearing blue jeans, a camouflage sweatshirt and a backpack when he left home.
            </p>
            <p>
             Troopers from the nearby Troop D barracks had asked the public to refrain from independent searches for the missing teen, but rather go to a checkpoint or speak the fire department for a search assignment, state police said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police are asking anyone with information about Allen to contact Troop D at 860-779-4900.
            </p>
