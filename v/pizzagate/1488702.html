            On Dec 6th, at 3:40 p.m., I sent an IM OUTLINING THE IMDB LISTING INFORMATION to a public figure.
           </p>
           <p>
            They didn't use the info, but I still have the record of that IM. That's about a full day before people are claiming Welch was "added" to the listing, and it was NOT my first time seeing that information (I had first seen it a day or two before, most likely on the evening of the 4th).
           </p>
           <p>
            So there goes your theory. Welch WAS listed, Welch WAS in the film, WayBack has the ARCHIVED (older) version from the 7th, when Welch WAS REMOVED.
           </p>
           <p>
            If possible, I can validate the IM... could get a screenshot I guess.

            "There was already a thread here about it which concluded with the discovery that Welch was added to the IMDB listing post-pizzagate."
           </p>
           <p>
            And that proves? Precisely. Inconclusive, and since I'm still reporting what I've been able to find, the whole thing is odd. Here's what I know, at present:
           </p>
           <p>
            The original IMDB page backup at WayBack, Dec 27, 2008? Lists 3 actors, with a continuation tab for "cast".
ON OR ABOUT THE 7th of DECEMBER 2016, that 4th actor, whom previously resided below the tab, was REMOVED (since a 4th actor is no longer SHOWN at the listing).
This is REFLECTED in a Dec. 7 2016 ARCHIVE of the PREVIOUS PAGE on WayBack.
The CURRENT IMDB listing, SINCE Dec 7 2016, shows only 3 actors.
The BEST WAY to solve this issue, without further speculation, would be for the director to release the film, to make it public. That might solve it. I know plenty of folks who made films at 16, 18, some younger - legitimate indie work. That's nothing, so imho I think the director is not being completely honest, for whatever personal or professional reason/s.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, IMDB doesnt' just allow anybody to "march in" and edit a listing. Those need to be submitted for review, or else someone whom ALREADY HAS an IMDB Pro account, that's ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAGE, would be making those changes - so yeah, something's fishy in Luxembourg here.

            as a result, I've just left this notice at the comments section for "Something About Pizza"'s IMDB page:
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            "you know, now that I think about it I'm calling BUNK on the "added Welch" theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have an IM which I sent to a public figure, Dec 6 at 3:40 p.m. Eastern - nearly a day before it's claimed Welch was "added" - and so, I CLAIM THAT DEC 7 2016 WAS THE DAY WELCH WAS REMOVED, because in that Dec 6 2016 IM, I was REPORTING the "something About Pizza" listing to a public figure, and Edgar Maddison Welch was ALREADY showing up as "The Gunman".
           </p>
           <p>
            Dec 6 was also NOT the first day I had seen this listing, I had checked it on the evening of December 4th, the night of the incident, or else the following day, December 5th - and in any case, Edgar's name WAS PRESENT, listed as the 4th of 4 cast members on the FILM LISTING - though it did not show at his PERSONAL IMDB LISTING, which is a separate matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            On December 7, 2016, someone entered the IMDB page for "Something About Pizza" and REMOVED the name of the 4th actor, Edgar Maddison Welch. THAT is exactly how I experienced this information during that period, regarding this film listing, and I can prove it."

             hardly. I was able to verify this PRIOR to the Dec 7th "scrubbing" of the IMDB listing - it used to live on IMDB just as WayBack machine shows.
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, the director would have been the person to have made the INITIAL LISTING, which apparently was created on or before Dec 27, 2008 (according to Wayback Machine)... so the director of the film "denying" Welch's involvement? Chalk that up to reluctance to admit an embarrassing feature of an extremely obscure film, which the director himself has ALREADY scrubbed reference to... and had ALREADY (as of about Dec 7th) begun publicly telling people that Welch "had no part" in the project, despite all available evidence as existed online FOR EARLY 8 YEARS at IMDB (there is no "intermediate" backup between Dec 27, 2008 and Dec 7, 2016).
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a bit like saying "Charles Manson did our soundtrack!" I mean, Charles Manson WAS a musician at one time, you know, and he made several recordings - he's even been covered by some heavyweights. But yeah, Welch is playing an imbalanced kook in the Comet drama, so yeah - most people would distance themselves (most filmmakers I know of, at any rate).
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't just barge in here with pronouncements and accuse me of not doing any research. You haven't shown anything in this particular thread yet, except perhaps inability to comprehend information that;s been lain out in front of you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Throw down or go down, I don't care, I'm standing by the information as posted and I say "type casting": Dude had ALREADY played a gunman, in some bizarre "pizza" film.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a slam dunk for a casting director looking for someone stupid enough to take the Comet Ping Pong role, imho. Doubt we'll ever find out how either went down tho, but I can just IMAGINE the conversation...
            </p>
            <p>
             "Man, you'll be GREAT. And you were decent in Boston, Sandy, not that bad - but this is different. It's a lead role, solo performance. And you've already DONE this. You know that. This is your chance to prove to the world that you CAN act. And look at the upside: No one gets hurt, and you "disappear" to live out your days with a once-in-a-lifetime starring role. It's the best thing ANYONE is ever going to offer you, and you know it. So whaddya say? Are you IN?"

              Easy tiger, I didn't accuse you of not doing any research. There was already a thread here about it which concluded with the discovery that Welch was added to the IMDB listing post-pizzagate.
