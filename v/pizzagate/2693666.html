<p>In all, 29 children came forward with details of being severely sexually abused and raped by the workers, the mayor of Edenton and the sheriff of Chowan County. There were 429 instances of sexual and physical abuse over a three-year period.. They told of adults dressing in satanic garb, forcing them to drink urine, forcing them to watch adults have sex.</p>
<p>These are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://law.justia.com/cases/north-carolina/court-of-appeals/1994/9315sc539-1.html">claims</a> made by three children (aged aged 2½,  5½ and 2½) of one of the workers (Patrick Figured):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>being sodomized with a screwdriver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being forced to engage in satanic rituals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>watching Patrick dress like a devil while burning bibles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>before forced to drink urine and blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being sexually abused in the presence of a video camera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>watching Patrick, his girlfriend and daughter have sex in front of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being drugged </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being whipped with a branch from a thorn bush</p>
</li>
<li>references to \'white powder\' and \'black poison\'</li>
<li>being forced to drink dog urine</li>
</ul>
<p>The previous attachment details how three doctors and a professor of paediatrics examined the children and found evidence of anal and/or vaginal trauma.</p>
<p>The children\'s testimony was found by social workers and doctors to be consistent and convincing.</p>
<p>From same document  :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Everson testified … child B told him that defendant inserted the sharp end of a screwdriver into his bottom and into Child C\'s bottom, inserted his penis into the bottoms of all three children, made Child B and Child C lick white powder off defendant\'s penis, threatened them to keep them from telling, and made them drink dog urine. Dr. Everson further testified that Child A told him that she saw white stuff come out of defendant\'s penis when he stuck it in Child C\'s bottom and that Child A and Child B told him that defendant threatened to kill their parents if they told on him. Over defense counsel\'s objection, Dr. Everson testified that, in his opinion, Child A and Child B were sexually abused by defendant.</p>
<p>The State presented strong evidence that defendant was the perpetrator. Each child testified defendant inserted a screwdriver into his or her anus. Two of the children testified that the defendant made a dog urinate and forced them to drink it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been able to find no other details of the case, except for <a href="https://monarchprogramming.wordpress.com/2016/01/06/the-demons-of-edenton/">this piece</a> which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… babies ritualistically killed, victims taken out on boats and thrown overboard, and inappropriate trips in hot air balloons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Details of the appeal of defendant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928171907/http://law.justia.com/cases/north-carolina/court-of-appeals/1995/931sc1277-1.html">Kathryn Wilson</a>.</p>
<p>Details of Bob Kelly\'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031131248/http://law.justia.com/cases/north-carolina/court-of-appeals/1995/933sc676-1.html">appeal</a>. Kelly\'s lawyer argued that the opinion of parents of the children should not be admissible..   It also details how his former lawyer, Chris Bean, had defended Kelly on another matter and was due to represent Kelly on these charges. Bean was adamant that Kelly was innocent. Bean then found out that his child was one of the victims.  Rob Kelly appealed the decision to allow Bean to testify. This is what Bean testified during the trial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had believed adamantly and completely in Bob Kelly\'s innocence. (I) … believed in his total innocence. And for me, I\'ve never been so shattered, I don\'t think, in my life as I was on that Saturday...  And then to think that my own child had been abused. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From my understanding (happy to hear from a legal eagle) the technicality used by Rob Kelly to get off all charges was that Bean should not have been allowed to give evidence as they had once been friends.</p>
<p>In 1992 Bob was convicted on 99 counts of child abuse and sentenced to twelve consecutive life sentences. Kelly, his wife, and five employees were charged.  Another employee, Don Wilson was also convicted.</p>
<p>Bob and Betsy and all the perpetrators were clearly not well-educated and on the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder.  I\'m flummoxed as to how they could afford a team of high-powered attornies for the duration of the investigations and trials.</p>
<p>All charges against all defendants were dropped based on technicalities. Prosecutors said they intended to prosecute Kelly on an unrelated new charges that he raped a young girl outside the day care in 1987. </p>
<p>The only person I can find who has defended the children and their parents is a Anne Earle, who has a whole page <a href="https://www.littlerascalsdaycarecase.org/wordpress/?p=135">dedicated to her</a> on a website set up to disparage the parents and defend the rapists.  She was a member of   [International Council on Cultism and Ritual Trauma in 1995](the www.hawk1.net/public/browse-online/raven1-eleanor-white/mcf/iccrt.htm)   <a href="http://www.hiddenmysteries.org/conspiracy/coverups/rascals.html">This</a> is her website, in which she states:</p>',

           In 1992 Bob was convicted on 99 counts of child abuse and sentenced to twelve consecutive life sentences. Kelly, his wife, and five employees were charged.  Another employee, Don Wilson was also convicted.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bob and Betsy and all the perpetrators were clearly not well-educated and on the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder.  I'm flummoxed as to how they could afford a team of high-powered attornies for the duration of the investigations and trials.
          </p>
          <p>
           All charges against all defendants were dropped based on technicalities. Prosecutors said they intended to prosecute Kelly on an unrelated new charges that he raped a young girl outside the day care in 1987.

           The only person I can find who has defended the children and their parents is a Anne Earle, who has a whole page

           on a website set up to disparage the parents and defend the rapists.  She was a member of   [International Council on Cultism and Ritual Trauma in 1995](the www.hawk1.net/public/browse-online/raven1-eleanor-white/mcf/iccrt.htm)

            Child rape is systemic in US, UK , EU and catholic church. It is a way to subdue a population....maybe why those with the proclivity more up in govt. , business and entertainment.........not prosecuted? It is now coming out that the catholic church has been involved in trafficking; that will get  them where it hurts most, money.

            Moral and Satanic Panic my Bleeping Arse.  The Pa. grand jury reported Benestad's washing out the mouth of a child with holy water as SRA.  We also just right now on the board have the post about the nuns at St. Joseph Orphanage perpetrating SRA on past Wards in their Care.  The only panic is what they are feeling right now, for more and more we are seeing accounts of SRA appearing on the internet and Victims finally having the courage to come forward.  The Panic Shoe is on the other foot.
