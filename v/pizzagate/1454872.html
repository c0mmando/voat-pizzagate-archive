            The connection of Jimmy Wales, the former CEO of Wikipedia, with child pornography is extremely weak. You make it sound like Jimmy Wales, the former CEO of Wikipedia, purposefully put up porn on Wikipedia, child porn at that. That's simply not true. Wales didn't deal with the FBI either, not that we know at least:
            <a href="https://archive.is/3v0sD">
             Larry Sanger, a co-founder of Wikipedia, did
            </a>
            . There is no mention as to whether or not Wales knew about the child porn that was being put up, and it seems unlikely since
            <a href="https://archive.is/cU7a">
             it was a loose effort by pedophiles
            </a>
            to put the porn there and since no one in the organization thought to check for it up until Larry Sanger thought to do so (resulting in the FBI connection). Wales' actual porn related activity was on a separate website of which
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomis">
             10% of the revenue came from what was largely "soft-core" porn
            </a>

            That article does include the number 11 but omits the number 22, which is very important in certain belief systems. It is considered one of the power or master numbers which cannot be divided into smaller amounts.

            I find when investigating people, which I was paid to do for many years. it takes patients.  I followed a path from Bouncing Ping Pong in London. There are so many following the obvious. I was pretty good at my job,very good. So I will just go down this path. I think you all are amazing for following yours. I have a gut feeling and I am sticking to it.

            Doesnt surprise me. This is one of the biggest disinfo sites on the internet. If you you want to look up a chemical formula or something its ok but for anything that contradicts the govt "approved narrative" it is full of lies. Anything health related such as vaccine info or alt cures are completely trashed ,  i dont even need to check what they say about pizzagate, this site is worse than big media because many kids use it as reference, the misleading Wikipedia name is what makes people trust it... i guess it should be renamed to Wikipedifilia.

            Not denying symbolism in freemasonry or occultism, but there are far too many leaps in logic, random connections, and meaningless procedures for that to be considered actual research. The EPA = 13; controlling what we breath? I can't take that seriously. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.

            13 is not an occult number. It is a number that some occultists find meaning in, and other occultists don't. But primarily it's just a fucking number people use.

             the occult is what people believe it to be. doesn't matter if it makes sense or not, only that they believe it. 13 is however generally recognized as significant, jesus and the 12 disciples, the sun and the zodiac. the number of points of a dodecagon in a circle + the center. but it's the meaning that can change here and there, depending on tradition.

              exactly the point is that there are far too many traditions for the mere appearance of the number 13 to mean anything at all. It might very well be occult inspired, but we don't know. Just having it in your username doesn't mean a thing

               Shill harder noob. Obviously you know nothing about the occult traditions if you think 13 isn't significant. The significance of the user choosing that number is admittedly unknown, but to deny the occult use of 13 is just ignorant.

            I just noticed yesterday when researching Antony Kidman that Wikipedia mentions hardly anything about him, and nothing about the fact he died under suspicious circumstances after fleeing the country and his business as soon as they began investigating the claims he was a leader of a satanic child murder pedophile ring in Sydney. The MSM has totally covered that up too. The fact that he fled gives an incredible amount of credence to Fiona Barnett's stories. As an Aussie the claims of what she says about people like Richie Beneud, Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating are so earth shattering that I don't even fucking know...

            Okay, just did a google search for Jimmy Savile for another thread and the first link that pops up with Wikipedia. There's also a thumbnail on the right hand side that gives a summation of pertinent info. Here's exactly what is said:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Sir James Wilson Vincent "Jimmy" Savile, OBE, KCSG was an English DJ, television and radio personality, dance hall manager, and charity fundraiser. Wikipedia."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Note: not one mention he was a child molester! Not one! There might be mention of it farther down, but if you search, you don't see one iota of the scandal and the lives he ruined. I guess this more than proves the OP's point.

             This is so dumb.
Here's the end of the first paragraph on his wikipedia page
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              After his death, hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse were made against him, leading the police to believe that Savile had been a predatory sex offender[4]—possibly one of Britain's most prolific.[5][6][7][8] There had been allegations during his lifetime, but they were dismissed and accusers ignored or disbelieved; Savile took legal action against some accusers.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I suppose this page doesn't exist either
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile_sexual_abuse_scandal">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile_sexual_abuse_scandal

            </p>
            <p>
             Also it's wikipedia.  If want the first sentence to be changed go edit it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a suggested edit, add this to the first sentence
......who after his death was accused of hundreds of instances of child sexual abuse.

            You need to understand that there's innocent until guilty proven. Many people stick to it, that's one of the principles of our civilization.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no doubt that the New York Times and Washington Post articles were cover ups. Full of panic, false claims, and they came up early, which suggest they were ordered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now move to Jimmy Wales and Wikipedia. He's most likely sitting on a fence with this case. He probably believes us, but needs proof, otherwise
            <em>
             big fat lawsuit
            </em>
            is waiting. You go out and call him names? Give him the proof first.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at this, you write
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Here is a good article I found: 10 Facts About Wikipedia Founder That Will Shock The Hell Out Of You

           <p>
            Really?  This article says the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            """Did you know that Jimmy Wales was a porn king who sold online pornography before launching Wikipedia"""
           </p>
           <p>
            And that's an argument for you? GTFO! I have a high school female friend who
            <em>
             owns
            </em>
            a porn-producing company. OMG, how shocking. Smoking gun! Surely some people turned away from said friend, but I don't give a fuck. That's
            <em>
             not a crime
            </em>
            . That's not even morally dubious by today's standards.
           </p>
           <p>
            And by the way, why aren't you researching the real, but boring stuff, like the Podesta sketches? I've written another email analyzing what we know about them, and I have the feeling we have 80-90% of the sub-case done. Yet nobody's investigating this further. Instead, people post sensationalist shit like this. No cool, man.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS I Haven't read the rest the rest of your post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bottom line:
            <strong>
             This is what people call "crazy bullshit".
             <em>
              That's
             </em>
             the shit that gets us labeled "false news".

             That's a great idea, but the problem is that this web site isn't really a spotlight. Popular YouTubers are the only ones who can really put this out there to the masses.

              Part of the problem is some of the popular pizzagate youtubers are putting up false information in our videos. Not only does it discredit our investigation, but it gives fuel to the "fake news" narrative of the MSM. This video is really popular right now and is showcasing a document that was debunked on

               I think the problem is that as Pizzagate attracts more attention, there will be some people who will use its momentum as a way of making themselves more famous. And that means they will select their content based upon how many viewers they can get, instead of based on quality. The only solution to this problem that I can think of, is to debunk these videos in their comment section and to give them plenty of thumbs down.

                 I think that it is weighing on you, because you are passionate about this cause and that is a good thing. It probably won't be easy to organize a lot of people to downvote, but maybe if it's something that you keep at over time, it might begin to snowball. It would be really great for the credibility of this group, that we actually care about accuracy and are willing to challenge people who are exploiting the scandal for personal gains. A great place to start is this recent submission:

               We need to SHINE THE LIGHT on everyone who tries to cover this up.  We need to go after them by exposing who they are.  If they try to fight us on this we all hammer them with spotlights and that will discourage future attacks on us.  On the truth.  They fear the light, as all criminals do. And if we shine the light, they will fall.

               We should stage an all out information attack on the Wiki-pedos

               Should rename it Wikipedoa.

                The thing is they cornered the market on media. These idiots created Snopes. Snopes ridiculous non-objective, bought opinion is the first thing you see when you do searches on pretty much any hot topic. So Snopes writes a disinformation piece and then other media outlets/sites (like Wikipedia) use a non-authority as an authoritative opinion. It's ridiculous. It's like somebody's sister starting a medical school with no credentials and then awarding their sibling a to practice medicine.

                 Maybe schools have changed since I was there (got my degree like a decade ago... damn I feel old saying that) but teachers and profs did not allow us to use Wikipedia. If I looked at something on there and found a source, like a Pubmed journal or news article, I would just use that direct source. I remember a couple times being asked where I found the material from, lol. I would never consider actually putting down Wikipedia.org/bullshitessaysubject  as a source... Are students nowadays allowed to, or even encouraged, to use Wiki?

            Excellent research. This needs to be higher, have a comment. I'll try to look into some of these editors when I get a chance, and post my findings here if I come up with anything.

            The trail all leads back to the Military and Government it also leads out of the country ..work will be monumental . I think it best if I stay focused if anything of merit comes up , I will post here.

            Stuff I've done here
           </p>
           <pre><code>Created, recreated, or rewrote: Debtera, Liber Officium Spirituum, Livre des Esperitz, Magical Treatise of Solomon, this article about some conspiracy theorist garbage.
Rewrote: Arbatel de magia veterum, Book of Saint Cyprian, Idealism (Christian eschatology), Lesser Key of Solomon, Reuben Swinburne Clymer, Shemhamphorasch, Cassiel.
To do: Sariel, Zaphkiel, Zadkiel, Camael, Haniel, Sachiel, Jophiel (did once, but more sources now), Seven Archangels, The Solomonic Miscellany, an overhaul of List of Demons in the Ars Goetia, planned rewrites of Enochian magic and List of Enochian angels
Added big honkin' chart with names and stuff to the Decans article, plan on adding descriptions of images at some point.
Went through the articles that link to "LGBT issues and Voodoo" and changed it to "LGBT topics and Voodoo."
Worked with Dougweller in removing all mentions, uses, or links to or of [http://historyhuntersinternational.org/](http://historyhuntersinternational.org/), a blog with no evidence of credentials (if they are professors, why would they not want their name associated with that work in a more publically recognized journal?), that contains some crackpot ideas (Alexander the Great's existence should be doubted like Jesus?).
I replaced/removed all uses of The Dying God.com since it's a self-published source (and in a few cases, counter to most other sources).
