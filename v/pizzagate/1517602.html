            <p>
             Mr. Stibbe is a successful entrepreneur who has been actively investing and building businesses in
             <strong>
              Africa
             </strong>
             for the past 30 years, and a driving force behind the
             <strong>
              Impact model for investment in developing markets
             </strong>
             . His vision and leadership have led to the initiation, implementation and successful completion of
             <strong>
              large-scale projects throughout Africa
             </strong>
             , each of which has aimed to achieve tangible
             <strong>
              humanitarian
             </strong>
             objectives and
             <strong>
              financial and business returns
             </strong>
             . His professional endeavors have spanned a wide range of sectors, including

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            the construction of rural and urban communities, 
agriculture and agro-industrial projects, 
the creation of aviation and air-traffic control systems, 
large-scale educational ventures, 
healthcare, 
technology, 
clean-energy and water-related businesses.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a result, Mr. Stibbe’s successes have resulted in real and marked improvements in the quality of life for large populations.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1985, Mr. Stibbe created an Israeli start-up firm which he managed and grew to become a multi-national, emerging-market focused ECP enterprise employing thousands of people, and then in 2011 led it to a successful exit.  Building on his decades of experience, in 2011 Mr. Stibbe founded Vital Capital Fund, an
             <strong>
              Impact Investment private equity fund
             </strong>
             aimed at demonstrating that large scale investments made responsibly and for impact achieve measurable improvements in people’s lives while generating strong investor returns. Today, in addition to serving on Vital’s Investment Committee, Mr. Stibbe is

            It doesn't offhand look like any group to be concerned about food security for people but more like a group to discuss possible new hedge funds built around the Hillary topples George Webb has been describing.  A tremendous collection of power and money across many areas.

            What is their interest in a CF's Safe Place for Children?

           <p>
            Does this board would offer a means of conferring on new investments arising from CF "topples"?  Does it have anything to do with children?  With food security or food control?

            If they've set these up anything at all like their offshore accounts, then there's no way you could ever get a clean trace - by Foundation only... so you look for corruption in the AFFILIATES, child trafficking THERE...

            that may be what they mean by "follow the children", "follow the money"... the children flow TO, and then FROM, these orphanges... and the "patronage" flows direct to the Clintons, whom (up until now at least) provided diplomatic cover.
