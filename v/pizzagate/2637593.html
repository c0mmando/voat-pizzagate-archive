<p>I\'m not sure why this has been downvoted so heavily (not that I care on a personal level). I haven\'t seen any arguments that the main point (see title) of this post is in error. Certainly my earlier post was, when I claimed that we didn\'t invent the term pizzagate, but the fact that a well-respected (to the uninitiated masses) publication outright lied, and based her claim (the definition of &quot;pizzagate&quot; had 100% agreement by all of us, that Hillary Clinton ran a child sex slave ring out of the basement of Comet Pizza) on supposed comments made by anonymous users of the internet (I have yet to see any of these comments) is a most serious issue. </p>
<p>I suppose the origins of the term is not as important as the fact that the framework of it, and the narrative surrounding it, is completely bogus.

<p>Thanks for your input and feedback <a href="https://voat.co/user/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> <a href="https://voat.co/user/MeatballPizza">@MeatballPizza</a> <a href="https://voat.co/user/septimasexta">@septimasexta</a> </p>

<p>I posted this earlier today: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2637487">GET IT STRAIGHT: We Never Called it &quot;Pizzagate&quot; </a></p>
<p>I soon found out that the term &quot;pizzagate&quot; may have come from Reddit, from a thread on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TheDonald">r/TheDonald</a>, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2637487/13323318">thanks to</a> <a href="https://voat.co/user/MeatballPizza">@MeatballPizza</a></p>
<p>I then found my old post where I tried to find the origin of the definition. Here it is again:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1753236">The Biggest Pizzagate FAKE NEWS being promulgated by alt media; fake definition of &quot;pizzagate&quot; originated with the New York Times\' Cecilia Kang</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Pizzagaters believe that] Hillary Clinton and her top aides were running a child-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizza parlor&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The false narrative was created by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html">New York Times\' Cecilia Kang, November 21. 2016</a> where she characterized the pizzagate theory as such, apparently based solely on messages supposedly posted to James\' Instagram feed. &quot;All of them&quot; said Comet was the base of a child abuse ring &quot;led by&quot; Hillary Clinton and Podesta. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within hours, menacing messages like “we’re on to you” began appearing in his Instagram feed. In the ensuing days, hundreds of death threats — one read “I will kill you personally” — started arriving via texts, Facebook and Twitter. All of them alleged something that made Mr. Alefantis’s jaw drop: that Comet Ping Pong was the home base of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief, John D. Podesta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his recent charade, Alex Jones posits himself as the voice of the pizzagate investigation, taking responsibility for &quot;creating the false narrative&quot; <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8CNE7SVAAAfnzA.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8CNE7SVAAAfnzA.jpg</a></p>
<p>In his well-covered video, Alex said \'we all ran over to Comet, looking into this innocent pizza place, instead of looking at the real perps [Weiner, Epstein, etc]\'.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am asking the crowd here whether my observations of our pizzagate investigation are correct. What I have observed is a large group of serious, intelligent, caring people of all age groups and from all backgrounds, looking into any obvious (and many not at all obvious) leads that have come from the Podesta leaked emails, and from mainstream media (such as the Silsby/Clinton/33 children evidence).</p>
<p>I have NOT observed any serious bias towards Alefantis in lieu of other leads, like the ones Alex Jones <a href="https://youtu.be/EbXbtt25jGg?t=9m20s">and now Mike Cernovich</a> \'advise\' we focus on. </p>
<p>People who are running with the false, MSM-derived narrative which defines pizzagate as a belief that Hillary ran a sex slave ring out of the basement of Comet Pizza, are doing so in error and in defiance of the facts.</p>
<p>At the time of her article, I was unable to find anything to back up Cecilia Kang\'s assertion that our group believed what she claimed. I had read virtually every pizzagate-related blog post, every thread on the various subs, and had my ear to the ground on other forums up to that point, and her definition of our movement was completely novel to me. NO WHERE was our group claiming this shit. </p>
<p>We <em>did</em> ask obvious questions that were related to <em>anything</em> that came up in those emails, and though James\' Instagram provided a lot of fodder for our investigation to be sure, but we did not <em>focus</em> on Comet as Alex and others suggest. </p>
<p>Claims that we have focused on Comet, ignoring other leads and locations, that we were led astray, that we believe something crazy about Comet\'s basement &amp; Hillary... <strong>are all fake news</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyone promulgating these claims and not correcting them (<em>perhaps tweeting <a href="https://voat.co/user/ceciliakang">@ceciliakang</a> with requests for some kind of reliable source for her article... did she even see the Insta messages? did she make sure they were from real people? did she look on other forums as well, to gauge the opinions of pizzagaters?</em>), is on the wrong side of this thing and doing this investigation a great disservice.</p>
<p>The actual origin of pizzagate is being virtually erased by allowing the NYT, and alt media icons, to create fake news and effectively smear us in the process.</p>
<p>We need to get back to our roots. Look at what they are trying to hide, and <em>go there</em>. </p>
<p>I also think we should make a lot of noise about this Fake News from the NYT/AlexJones so that it cannot continue, and so that the public is made aware simultaneously of what they are <em>not</em> saying, made aware of what pizzagate really is. <strong>How do WE define pizzagate?</strong></p>
<p>The media, and now alt media aren\'t addressing the emails, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8CXuj_UwAAkCvg.jpg">the use of code</a>, the donations to Comet by Soros and Clinton, <s>Alefantis calling babies &quot;hotards&quot;</s>, Alefantis threatening Ryan\'s life, Alefantis saying he doesn\'t like children at all, yet is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1480742">taking a baby to &quot;the farm&quot;</a>, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8CYMYQV4AAWw7N.jpg">calling his friends &quot;chickenlovers&quot;</a></p>
<hr />
<p>On December 10th, in the spirit of \'hiding in plain site\', the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html?_r=0">printed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the span of a few weeks, a false rumor that Hillary Clinton

into a wild conspiracy theory that they were running a
child-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizza parlor.</p>

            I think you're doing a fantastic job of explaining why pizzagate doesn't make any sense to outsiders and why journalists have such a hard time explaining it.  Can you come up with a one or two sentence description that explains how a group of people went from from John Podesta's email are stolen to child sex trafficking?  One would that make sense to a rational human being?

            Because this doesn't cut it.

            Do expect people to understand what you are talking about?  How have you convinced yourself all that added up to something.  Also there are several things that are flat out false.
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth is Pizzagate starts with a group of folks who hate Hillary Clinton and have done so for years and years before the Podesta emails came out.  You're basically kidding yourself if you think this starts anywhere else.  Reporters and regular public read through John Podesta's emails.  There's pretty much nothing shocking about them.  Except a cult of people on Reddit's theDonald who all hated Hillary Clinton tried to make them look sinister and for some people they were successful. TheDonald was not an ordinary group of Trump voters,  they were a cult.  If you dissented from anything you got banned.  They portrayed Trump as their God Emperor. They portrayed Hillary Clinton as the Devil incarnate and they were dishonest about it. You are repeating several of the basic dishonesties that formed the start of pizzagate.

           <p>
            You have zero proof any code was used in John Podesta's email. There's plenty of proof that the code list that was claimed was completely false. This alone sinks Pizzagate.  And this by itself is why pizzagate was debunked.

           <p>
            I'm sorry, but this is a fail. This was a claim by people who had no idea what the documents they were looking at.  There were no donations whatsoever to Comet.  There were expenses.  If Hilary Clinton's campaign buys pens, they had to declare that.  If they pay a business to make up a bunch of signs they have to declare that.   Comet Ping Pong is a business it doesn't take donations.  The expenses you are looking at are people buying pizza.  If you had pizza delivered to the office or went out and had a business meeting over dinner at Comet, you had to declare it.  This is simply false.   Also being connected to Soros and Clinton are not evidence you are part of child sex ring.....this is a good example of the deep prejudice at the heart of this project.  Fun Fact.  James Alefantis had never met Hillary Clinton.  He was friends with the Podestas but not connected to her.  He knew people who knew her, but he did not.

           <p>
            A.  How do you know who Alefantis was called a hotard or what he had in mind when he did it?
           </p>
           <p>
            B.  How do you think this is evidence of child trafficking?  It appears to be joke on Instagram between friends? Even if it's in poor taste or ou·tré or even flat out sick, how do you jump from jokes between the small group of people following his public Instagram to child trafficking?   There's no connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think a lot of what ended up being pizzagate is just a culture clash.  People being suprised by the a way an irony-drenched, artsy crowd talks.

            Or this.  These just seem like you have already decided the guy is a child molester and then are looking for references to children.

           <p>
            This is one of the few genuine references to pedophiles, but even to go from this to child sex trafficking is just a massive, massive leap, especially as it appears to be a joke.  The way straight guys might make jokes about their friends being a "homo' or a 'fudgepacker."  It doesn't make it real.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you are have is a giant string of things that don't show what you believe them to, and some being obviously false.  Each piece doesn't lead to child sex trafficking and the chain of them together doesn't lead to child sex trafficking.

            , there's a great article linked in our sidebar on the origins of PG, written by the guy who started the Pizzagate subreddit. It's well documented. He picked the name, if I recall correctly. I think he started the separate sub to prevent T_D from getting shut down by Reddit on our account.

             It's true that he (pizzathrowaway777, I think his name was) picked the name, and because of that we've been stuck with it ever since. However, he didn't invent the name, and I'm not completely sure who did. As I commented on the other thread, it may have been the "Pizzagate2016" Instagram user, who commented on the JimmyComet IG before it was hidden from public view.

              The only pre-Podesta pizzagate reference I've seen documented to the term "pizzagate" was, interestingly, from Trump, when he and Sarah Palin got reamed by the MSM for eating NY pizza with a fork. Trump called it "pizzagate".

               If we're talking about pre-Podesta pizzagates, there was a British soccer scandal called Pizzagate a few years before, but I'm not sure why it was called that. The fact that there were two things previously called pizzagate would have been a good reason to pick another name for the Podesta/Comet matter.

            Hillary actually blamed "Pizzagate" as one of the reasons she lost in her autobio about the election.   So we may be talking 3 or 4 Supreme Court picks decided by this little 'conspiracy theory'!

            There was also a very active 4chan discussion of the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails and John Podesta's email.  In fact, one night I remember seeing a post there where Podesta's actual password was mentioned as he hadn't bothered to change it EVER AFTER THE LEAKS.

            You think these folks are brilliant.  Go watch the documentary on WEINER and you'll see they're not.
           </p>
           <p>
            4chan took the Instagram posts and made a number of memes on them.   Ditto the pizza-related posts.   4chan and The_Donald were acting parallel in getting out word.  Again, all this grew out of the Spirit Cooking discussion.   Once you see it within the context of child sacrifice and Satan worshipping, none of it seems impossible.

            The Alefantis odd Instagram posts (kill rooms, babies with money, jokes about auctioning babies, the odd bands that played at Comet Pizza, his being listed as a 'most powerful' person in D.C., and visiting the White House) fueled it.   A "leak by leak" analysis on The_Donald is where I first saw the odd "pizza related hankerchief" email questioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any history of 'Pizzagate' should include "Spirit Cooking."    That was the first discussion of Podesta and odd occult practices.  Those odd images of the 'performance art' Satanic ceremony had gone on for a couple weeks.   Podesta was seen as part of that.   The odd artwork of his brother was also being discussed.  Then the "pizza" emails were highlighted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The MSM immediately branded and 'debunked' everything as a conspiracy theory - without ever showing or discussing the odd Instagram photos and posts.

IT ALL STARTED WITH THE WIKILEAKS CLINTON / PODESTA EMAIL DUMPS
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the Chans or Reddit noticed emails between Uma and Hillary regarding the Laura Silsby affair in Haiti. They were surprised that she was aware of Silsby's "ministry" before Haiti. Of course Silsby had been convicted of child trafficking in Haiti. The Clintons were instrumental in getting her out of jail. Researching this led to other connections and references in the emails, including Comet Pizza and owner James Alefantis. The inclusion of the FBI pedo symbols in the wikileaks dump led to more discoveries. The odd pizza references from Podesta and friends as well as a fundraiser held at Comet Pizza drew the investigator's attention. Early access to Alefantis' public Instagrams as well as friends' comments really opened the door into a non-mainstream culture. It was discovered that Alefantis was listed as 49th most powerful in DC by an established magazine. This seemed very odd, so Alefantis' connections were examined which led to David Brock and even Lynn Rothschild, and of course Hillary Clinton and John Podesta via the fundraising circuit. The Alefantis Instagram photos referred to a "kill room" and showed perhaps unregistered building modifications on Alefantis property which included what appeared to be a tunnel of some sort and many other creepy images including lots of children. The more researchers dug, the darker it got. To sum it up, it was a more ORGANIC discovery made by numbers of random researchers, who didn't necessarily know each other, nor were they formally organized. Different groups emphasized different areas of research at the beginning. Most initially knew nothing about child trafficking or pedo culture. Knowledge increased over time. And yes, Jimmy Comet does own a basement. It is in his Buck's Fishing and Camping restaurant a few doors down from Comet Ping Pong. Both restaurants have two stories - Buck's has a basement and the main floor restaurant. Comet has the main floor restaurant and a second story above. How it is utilized, no one knows for sure. Later, a researcher claimed to have hacked Comet's website and found cp on it. He allegedly reported his findings to the DC police and received a written receipt acknowledging this. A few days later, actor Maddison Welch shows up at Comet and allegedly shot the computer tower, although there were no direct witnesses. Many researchers believed the incident to be a FF. Early on, the MSM tried to discredit researchers as more of their findings leaked out to the masses. I do not think they coined the term Pizzagate. I think it just became know as that by researchers as the information regarding the pizza code words grew. Of course the MSM had to call it something, in order to discredit the research, so the name Pizzagate was used. Personally, I think the name has helped our cause because it generates curiosity and people would seek out info on it. It also helps to expose the very real use of food terms by pedo culture and disrupts their covert operations. Still not sure about the pizza connection?

             Thanks for the link. It was good to read the article. It is interesting that she was particularly interested in "debunking" (although she never did) the "walnut sauce" email. I figured the author of the email would be important to look into. It was Jim Steyer. Here's an article about him and "his billionaire little brother" Tom written about a year before the "Walnut Sauce" email.....
            </p>
            <p>
             Jim was pals with Hillary Clinton: “He’s a force of nature,” said Evan Marwell, who has worked with Jim on connecting schools to the internet. “He’s got an incredible network and he uses that network.”
            </p>
            <p>
             "Jim Steyer made many of those connections while teaching political science classes at Stanford over the past 25 years.
His former students include New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Steyer also taught Chelsea Clinton and can’t stop raving about her. She was a “star student,” he said, impressing him so much that he hired her as a teaching assistant and research aide.
Steyer was close with the Clintons long before Chelsea arrived on campus. He met Hillary Clinton 25 years ago, he said, through her work for the Children’s Defense Fund. He raves about her, too."
            </p>
            <p>
             Jim Steyer also works with children:
"The biggest potential asset Jim Steyer brings to partnership is his link to the grassroots. Nearly a million parents and 145,000 teachers subscribe to ratings services he runs to assess the quality of children’s TV programs, video games and educational apps."
"Jim Steyer sees them as an untapped political force. And he intends to mobilize them. “Kids deserve a voice as powerful as the NRA is for gun owners, as powerful as the AARP is for seniors,” he said, “and we are going to deliver that.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Jim Steyer’s interests are wider than his brother’s; he has focused on education, technology, poverty and children’s privacy."
