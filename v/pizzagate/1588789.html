<p>Below the Google-translated text of aforementioned article. The translation is bad, of course, but I am sure you get the gist:</p>
<p><strong>Pedo sex in Hindukush – German Army looks away</strong></p>
<p>The lies with which politicians and journalists cover the issue of Afghanistan begin with the word Hindukush. The statement that there is peace and freedom to be defended there is scarcely to be surpassed in unscrupulousness anyway. The fact that &quot;Hindu&quot; stands for Hindus (the third-largest religion in the world) does not have to be explained for a long time. And &quot;kusch&quot; is the German version of the Persian word kosh, which is translated as &quot;killing&quot; or &quot;expelling&quot;. Hinduism, therefore, stands on the Islamic side of the mountain massif from Afghanistan to Iran as a symbol of the place where the followers of Hinduism are gladly expelled or killed.</p>
<p>Bloody tits</p>
<p>Since the arrival of Western soldiers in Afghanistan in 2001, there has also been a German arrangement with regard to the adherents of the Afghan Hindu killing doctrine, according to which the provincials must be respected and also be looked away and not attacked by the widespread rape of small boys. It says that the NATO troops must know that it is customary in the country to rape young boys. Have you ever heard a word in our lead media?</p>
<p>Studies confirm, by the way, that many Afghans find it self-evident to have sex with small boys. All this takes place quite openly. Such contacts are made at night festivals known as &quot;Knabenspiel&quot; (“boys play”, called the &quot;Bacha Bazi&quot;). Since the German Bundestag approved the deployment of German soldiers in Afghanistan in December 2001, pedophile journalists and politicians are being rallied to join the &quot;delegations&quot; in the country where child rape is part of the cultural leisure time.</p>
<p>Since 2008, there are also serious reports from the United Nations, according to which Bacha Bazi is experiencing a new flowering in the sectors controlled by the German Army in northern Afghanistan. The boys must slip into girls\' dresses and dance for the Afghan men. They are then raped by them. Bacha Bazi is a very natural thing to the North Afghan culture.</p>
<p>The small raped boys are also sold by the men. They are more ancient Islamic</p>
<p>Tradition a kind of war booty and completely without rights. They belong to the one who robbed the boys of a family. In the evening the men then abuse the children. According to a website that reported on these practices after a visit to the site: &quot;Later in the night, when no one dances, the boys are often passed on to close friends for sexual favors. It is not uncommon for the boys to have a new owner at the end of the evening, as they are also sold and sold at such parties. Here is certainly the limit for enlightened multicultural tolerance. No doubt, this is sex slavery in its worst form: with children.</p>
<p>The distinction between homosexuality and pedophilia, which is so important in the West, is irrelevant here in Baglan. &quot;There are several Afghan-German internet forums, which openly talk about this perverse child sex in the Afghan homeland. This has been known for a long time, but does not seem to interest anybody. It happens around the locations of German soldiers in northern Afghanistan. But the latter must look away - just like the drug trade. Otherwise, they could become the target of Afghan fighters more often. (...)</p>
<p>Politician is looking for fresh meat</p>
<p>German politics are closing their eyes when it comes to Bacha Bazi. Just why? Why on the one hand do you fight children\'s pornography in the Internet in Germany, but on the other hand you look away in hardcore children\'s rape in a country where German soldiers are stationed? So what is Afghanistan really about? The answer is quite simple and plausible: pedophile German politicians were the first to burn German soldiers in Afghanistan and to get to know the evening national custom at close range. A German politician who, on the margins of his regular military visit to Afghanistan, participated in the culturally widespread abuse of small boys, was filmed and extorted from Western intelligence circles. He had regularly traveled with Bacha Bazi to Afghanistan with two journalists, heavily subsidized by the German taxpayer. When he died a few years ago, he was accused in all the media, although politics and the media knew exactly what the man\'s shadow was.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the risk for foreigners who want to participate in such child sex parties in Afghanistan, however, incalculable high - the visit of such an event can be fatal. Since 2016, the Taliban has been using such Bacha-Bazi children (or sex-child slaves) to infiltrate the Afghan army and foreign forces. When the French news agency AFP reported in June 2016 that in the Central Afghan province of Urusgan, each of the 370 official checkpoints between one and four Bacha-Bazi children were intercrossed for fast sex, and more and more of these children from the Taliban, in order to bring bombs and explosives to the proximity of foreign soldiers, as in Berlin\'s government, it was as if they were all new.</p>
<p>In the end, the question arises for the average reader why Afghanistan is one of the most popular destinations outside Europe for German top politicians and journalists. Between 40 and 60 times a year, delegations with state secretaries, ministers and deputies visit the country. Many of them do not go there, because it is so peaceful in Afghanistan or where you have important business to discuss. No, many of them are looking for child sex, and there is a directive to traveling media representatives to completely eliminate this particular topic. The New York Times did not. At the end of 2015, she reported that US soldiers were not allowed to intervene when they witnessed the rape of small boys. German media made it headlines like &quot;US military should have tolerated misuse&quot;. Not a German journalist dared to report that this abuse is commonplace, even though German delegations travel to the country. This is not only disgusting, but also mendacious.</p>

              Curious, indeed. Generally, these guys get knocked off because of the last few things that were said/written/done (their masters' had enough). Since this was pizzagate related, for me, this suggest to keep digging. The amount of mystery surrounding these deaths are telling. In a lot of ways, one doesn't know that one is on the right path until one notices attempts at getting one

            It's old tech too. Church commission in 1975: CIA shows off heart attack gun.  An aigun that shoots an ice dart laced with a few mgs (not sure about the dose, could even be micrograms) of TTX.  Low dose = breathing problems/heart palpitations, high dose = heart attack.  The poison binds to your nerves and interrupts the electrical action causing the heart to misfire.

            I didn't have the chance to read shoosh's comment before it was deleted, but since it seems to have been about the Iraq war, I'd like to share something about that. About a month or so before 9/11, I read an article on the London "Times" website about how numerous foreign intelligence services had warned the U.S. that they had picked up information that Al Qaeda was planning to fly planes into buildings. According to the article, some terrorist cells were thought to be already in the U.S., taking flight lessons. A flight instructor from a school in Florida was quoted. Apparently, the White House had tightened security in April because it expected some kind of attack, but when an attack didn't happen, security was loosened again. At the time, I considered posting the article on Usenet, but I didn't, because I thought it might be seen as fear-mongering. I found it interesting that no one in the U.S. media was talking about it, considering that it was published in one of the world's major newspapers.
           </p>
           <p>
            About a month later, the 9/11 attacks happened, and I was suspicious about how the Bush administration immediately started talking about Iraq and Saddam Hussain, when the article had stated that all of the intelligence agencies had warned Bush about Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. I wish I had thought to immediately retrieve that article, but I waited until years later to look for it, and by that time, the "Times" website was behind a paywall. I searched for pre-9/11 articles that mentioned Al Qaeda and planes, but couldn't find the one I was looking for. It occurred to me then that perhaps someone in the Blair government asked or told the "Times" to remove the article from its website because that article would likely contradict the "bad intelligence" claim, and Blair was one of the only world leaders to support the Iraq war.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I last visited the "Times" website, I didn't even see a Search field. Is the Search function available only to subscribers? I doubt that the article is still available online. To find it, I would probably have to go to the university library and browse through their microfilm.

            I deleted it,  cause I don't want to detract from good piints. My mind immediately goes  to  connect-the-dot picture that went into action.  Mostly because I question the same intel that claimed Russia was  wikeaks hackers.  Same intel group - same war- different name - different place.

            It may possibly be that this Mr Ulfkotte was murdered either way may he rest in peace for fighting the good fight!

            In this article from RT News it states that U.S. Troops need to turn the other way as it relates to children being raped by Afghan officials. Quote:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “At night we can hear them [Afghan boys]  screaming, but we’re not allowed to do anything about it,” Lance Corporal Gregory Buckley Jr. reportedly told his father Gregory Buckley Sr before being killed in 2012.

            Quote from this RT.com article
            <a href="http://archive.is/OruO1">
             US Troops told to ignore Afghan Soldiers abusing boys
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            LC Gregory Buckley was told by his father to bring this info to his superiors
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Buckley Sr said he told his son to tell his commanders about these incidents.  “My son said that his officers told him to look the other way because it’s their culture,” he told NYT.

            LOOK THE OTHER WAY???? FUCK YOU US Militaryy
           </p>
           <p>
            But... I guess it is
            <em>
             "Their Culture"
            </em>
            <a href="http://archive.is/RdetE">

           <p>
            So part of what our military was doing over there was removing one form of opression and evil i.e. Taliban and replacing the authorities with these fucks who are pedofiles and obviusly not good people
            <em>
             "its their culture"

            Also one last thing I found in comment section of the RT.com article and it seems pizza related:
           </p>
           <p>
            In the comment section of the RT article I linked there is a post by a Sod98 that caught my attention.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             They are trying to proof that pizzas to scream when thrown in the oven.

             Here are a few more articles about the Afghan situation. Interestingly, the Taliban didn't practice bacha bazi--only the warlords armed and trained by the U.S. did that.

            Timing is suspicious indeed; the first Friday the 13th of the New Year. Although I don't know

             Someone mentioned the date of his death is a very important - or the most important? - date for satanists (or whatever we call them). Don't know more about that but have a source I could ask. Why do you think the location would matter? Tried to research it, but to no avail.

              Date, time, and location are all very important details to a large portion of dark occultists (Satanists, Luciferians, Sabbataean-Frankists, etc.), especially if they are the ones behind the murder or whatever. Originally I wanted to know the location because of the technical aspect: time zone and exact time in case he died at 12:30 am or something -- usually these dark occultists are
              <strong>
               <em>
                very
               </em>
              </strong>
              particular about these details and generally wouldn't allow there to be any confusion as to the date. As I understand it, both Satanists' and Communists' high holiday (holy-day) is
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walpurgis_Night">
               Walpurgisnacht or Walpurgis Night
              </a>
              . Of course, this wiki does it no justice. This rabbit hole is huge on it's own as it is a date shared by many. With special focus on the solstices and equinoxes. Ritual murders and the like are treated as sacrifices and as such treated in very high regard whether they are worshipping a deity (Luciferian) or the concept (Satanism -- and then there's what the Frankists believe which gets more confusing because it runs parallel) of which there are

               distinct differences
              </a>
              ... coming from an ex-satanist (or still is?). In any case, knowing about gematria and the importance of

              (and how it's tossed around right in front of us) is essential to Pizzagate, in my opinon.

               I tried to find out where he died - or at least where he lived or where he was buried. To no avail. The newspaper where he said he lived (but probably didn't) writes this:
              </p>
              <p>
               "On his homepage, Ulfkotte states that his current place of residence is Rottenburg. Another point was that he kept his place of residence secret because he had received death threats. The German magazine Spiegel said Ulfkotte and his family lived on an autark place in a lake surrounded by a high fence and guarded by a flock of geese; Only the priest and the mayor are said to know where that is. The attempts of the "Rottenburger Post" to come into contact with Udo Ulfkotte at the end of 2016 remained unanswered."

            I wish I had the money to make a memorial for the heroes who died looking in to pedo cults/trafficking rings. Fallen Protectors memorial or something. Plus it would help people see how many have died for  trying to expose pedos, and help keep their investigations alive.

              Which is what NAZIs did to all their opponents, oh the irony.  It's really bad here, free speech is extremely limited, people are conditioned on what to say because they are harassed if they speak freely and don't hold the party line.

              Yes. HRC-ites like to throw names around. Same thing is happening in the U.S. ... and really around the world. We need to get justice back.

            TPTB are not shy about killing people...and being heart-attacked is one of their documented methods.  But I will play devil's advocate, the younger you are when you have a heart attack, the more likely you are to die.  It is because of collateral circulation...the older people who have blockages in their arteries have had time to develop collateral circulation, which is basically a detour around the blockage.
           </p>

            My grandfather died at 59 of a heart attack...my mother is a registered nurse and was there when he collapsed, and began CPR immediately.  But he was basically dead when he hit the floor.  So, there's the alternate view...if his coroner dies of arsenic poisoning shortly after, then you know it was a hit.

              Some people think Slobodan Milosevic's heart attack was caused by poisoning (possibly with rifampicin, a leprosy drug). There were a number of contradictory stories going around shortly after he died. First, it was reported that he was a suspected suicide (I think the article mentioned suffocation or hanging). Then it was reported that he died of a heart attack, and there were traces of rifampicin in his blood. He had previously said he thought he was being poisoned. Some articles claimed that he poisoned himself in an attempt to be sent to Russia for medical treatment. Then the next version of the story was that there was no rifampicin in his blood, and the heart attack wasn't drug-induced. I think NATO or the CIA most likely poisoned him.

              I can't link to the Irish  Max Spiers last interview on my phone, bur you can find it.  He had a past drug problem but claimed to be in recovery. He went to Poland (verification of the exact country as I can't fact check that now)  to do an interview about his recent alleged big discovery
             </p>
             <p>
              His last video  he's trying to give an interview and answer questions but he starts to slurr his speech.  It sounds like a woman is laughing while talking to him, telling him to open his mouth,  and he progressively slurrs and becomes tired in the middle of the interview.  The interviewer is relentlessly asking questions.  It's a trrrible thing to listen to because it sounds like he's being drugged. You can hear the sound of him being massaged.   He left a message for his mom that if he dies investigate.   He died in a way that didn't sound like a normal death.   I don't know what message he was delivering.

              I think so...but there was that 70's-ish CIA congressional testimony about the heart attack gun.

               Interesting.  Trying to find a non-conspiracy source for that so I can convince people who think I'm an idiot.

               Here's something from cia.gov from '64 that mentions Soviets using heart attack for assassination:

              Agreed it is suspicious considering his position.  There are so many it is crazy...Loretta Fuddy was another one that interested me because some of it was caught on camera.

                BTW, Tom Clancy was another suspicious one that happened in proximity of the time of Breitbart.  Not heart attack though...he was apparently healthy and then got deathly ill and died a few days later.  Suspicious because of his intelligence contacts.

                No.....just an OG birther, which is just as frustrating as being an OG Pizzagater....for now, anyways.  My gut tells me big stuff is coming.

                Another really sad suspicious death is Britney Murphy (she was so hot and talented) and her husband...they were obviously poisoned somehow.  Who and why has me baffled.

                 I thought the MKULTRA programming 'sex kitten' could have been named after her. I'm starting to think a lot of these young stars have been gotten at somehow. I had always assumed it about Disney kids and that, but it seems like most celebs are being used politically, and they are either unbelievably stupid and hypocritical, or they've been coached/groomed since youth

                  George Webb talked about that very thing in one of his recent videos...can't remember which one, but it was within the last 10 days or so.  It's too crazy to believe...but 2016/17 are shaping up to be that kind of year.

                  Alex Jones is now the most honest/prescient journalist on the planet, Hillary passed out and was chucked into a van like a side of beef, Pres. Trump talked about his dick size in a primary debate, Diane Feinstein has been outed as a CIA employee....you get the idea.....can't wait for the Antartica reveal as well.
