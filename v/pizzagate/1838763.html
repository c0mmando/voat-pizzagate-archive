            Regrettably there were wild speculations at the outset some going so far as to suggest that Hillary eats babies which certainly did not advance the cause. The evidence for trafficking at or around CPP remains weak perhaps even nonexistent. But there is one thing that is irrefutable and that is the "pedo-subculture" embraced by Alefantis and his crowd and to a lesser extent satanism. Perhaps that is the tactic to employ to make Pizzagate acceptable. Impress upon everybody what a pedo subculture is, how pervasive it is in DC, the correlation of a pedo subculture with pedo events. Then let folks draw there own inferences as to who is doing it and who is not.

            They use bots to retract back to a previous edit almost immediately.. cant win. Same happens for vaccine related pages.. There is nothing you can do short of making alternative wikis that are more factual and accurate.

            This might be a silly idea, but what if we created a sticky here on this thread (or make a new thread with this particular purpose) and solicit content ideas from within
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            with which to edit the Wikipedia article? Specifically, what about working in some of Alefantis’ photos or
            <em>
             especially
            </em>
            excerpts from wikileaks? That’s
            <strong>
             hard evidence
            </strong>
            that
            <strong>
             actually exists
            </strong>
            . Perhaps create a section explaining
            <em>
             why in the world
            </em>
            anyone would
            <em>
             ever
            </em>
            believe the theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short: add in wikileaks emails and actual justifications for the theory to the Wikipedia article.

             Here's a good review of Gamergate:

            </p>
            <p>
             Here is another:
             <a href="https://aaronpabon.wordpress.com/2015/05/16/39/">
              https://aaronpabon.wordpress.com/2015/05/16/39/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Both of them miss that there was another media collusion effort called #WeLoveGameDevs six days before the Gamers Are Dead articles.
             <a href="https://archive.is/mZCbD">

            <p>
             and this doesn't get into the connections to DARPA, CIA, Common Core, Clinton Foundation, and just about every conspiracy theory on the web. People have linked it to 9/11 and Watergate by following enough branches. It is one deep rabbit hole.

            It has been dismssed - never debunked. Podesta, nor Alifantis are yet to address any of the facts. Hell, Alifantis is still spinning the narrative of an inncocent little pizza parlor owner being harrasses by alt-right Trump supporters.

             It's prebunked.  Because it never was a coherent theory and it never backed up its claims, or it backed them up with only suspicion and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is still today zero evidence that John Podesta spoke in code in his emails.  There is zero evidence for the claims that using the words cheese, walnut, sauce, pasta are incriminating.

            <p>
             Here's the key sentence in the wikileaks entry.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The theory, which went viral, claimed that John Podesta's emails, which were leaked by WikiLeaks, contained coded messages referring to human trafficking and connecting a number of restaurants in the United States and members of the Democratic Party with a fabricated child-sex ring.

                Just look at Podesta, then look at Alifantis - then look at the emails. Pizza 'for' an hour??? Do you really need more evidence. I give you one, Andrew Brietbarts tweet on 2011, outing Podesta as a major child trafficker. He died shortly after. 
More evidence - Check out Podesta's art work. Then archive CCP artwork. This is a child murdering cult - not 99%, 100%, absolute certainty. No buts bo ifs. They just hacked Macron's emails - same stuff! They are blaming on Russia again! See the pattern? It's global.

                 GTFO, you have no evidence of a single child being harmed let alone certainty this is a child murdering cult.  That's completely in your head.

                 And of course, the Russians were the ones who hacked Macron's emails, they didn't even try to hide it this time, specifically APT 28 who are GRU affiliated.

                  Examine the Dutreux case and Saville. The world is run by child murderers. Every institution has been compromised. Police chiefs, judges, 'detectives' , CIA (Finders)  FBI are running the show. (FBI founder J.E.Hoover was a cross dressing homosexual) Should I take your word (don't know who the hell you are) or should I take word of Ted Gunderson? What many of us have suspected turned out to be true. I don't like when children are being tortured and murdered. National Security advisor Michael Flynn was removed because of he knew too much. It's not a question of who is involved but a question of who is not involved. 
We have precedent, Saville, Haute la Garenne, Just recently Casa Pia - UN ambassador was senteced to 18 years, Dennis Hasterd, Jeffrey Epstein - both convicted pedophiles. Tony Podesta is friends with Hasterd and he is photographed with that American Psycho Ping Pong guy. Since Trump took office there have been over 4000 arrests - nothing in the media. Former VIP if Dyncorp was arrested. Media is also run by pedophiles (groomed for the job). Jacke Tappers wife listed Comet Ping Pong as her favorite restaurant - WTF! Then we have that Spirit Cooking with that demented Marina Abramovic - who happens to rub shoulders with every mega celebrity. 
Depraved world.

                  They said exactly the same thing about Dutreux and Jimmy Saville case.

                  'The danger with the use of circumstantial evidence is that of logical gaps; subjective, inferential links of low probability or of insufficient degree' 
        People vs Cleague
        22.NY.2d 363 (1968)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Laura Silsby is a convicted, certified child trafficker - Daily Mail 2010. She was arrested in Haiti trying to smuggle 33 children (real evidence) out of the Friends Of The Orphans, the very orphanage run by the Maccobies - Max Mcobby represented Alifantis - owner of CPP in the $850 000 blackmail case. Silsby was bailed out by a Jorge Pierlo, a notorious child trafficker wanted in 5 countries. Clintons were the initiators of the bail out - Daily Mail 2010. Silsby (now Gayler) works for the Amber Alert - psychopaths have wicked sense of humour. 
       People had been convicted of murders for a considerably less! 
        This 'circumstantial' evidence(s) ranks inferrential link of very high probability that warrants an investigation - and I will repeat 
INVESTIGATION. There has been no investigation just as there was no investigation of Mark Dutreux when later Operation Othello was exposed as a cover up - as was Jimmy Saville and Ted Heath case (30 victims came forward and still no outcome) It is based on these 'circumstantial' evidence and the total lack of initiative by the authorities that has led the citizen journalists to conclude that a global murderous pedophile cult has infiltrated top tiers of of virtually every institution - just as told by late FBI chief Ted Gunderson.

                   Are you high?  You presented a mish-mosh.  It's not even coherent.  You may also want to look at what Silsby was convicted of.

                   The children Silsby was dealing with were not in orphanages.  In fact, there were not orphans. She went around to two poor towns in Haiti and told parents should could provide a better life for their children in an Orphanage she was trying to start.  We know exactly where are 33 children were from 20 were from Calebasse and 13 were from EL Citron.  EDIT:  El Citron is a neighborhood of Port Au Prince

                   Friends of the Orphans is not an orphanage in Haiti.  It's a fundraising group in United States .  The group that runs the orphanages it raises funds for is Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos or NPH.  Friends of the Orphans is now NPHUSA.   NPH does have facilities in Haiti.  None are in Calebasse and El Citron.

                   There is no evidence whatsoever that Hillary or Bill Clinton had ever heard of Laura Silsby before she was arrested.

                  <p>
                   You claim Silsby was bailed out by Jorge Aníbal Torres Puello (not Pierlo) except he was exposed months before her trial.  And he was the one who initiated contact.  There's no evidence Silsby knew this guy before he contacted her church in Idaho. This article is from February

                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    Mr. Puello, whom Salvadoran police believe fled the country, was a fugitive when he enmeshed himself late last month in the case of the 10 church members from the United States.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Two days after they were arrested on Jan. 29 while attempting to take 33 children across the border from Haiti into the Dominican Republic, Mr. Puello called up an Idaho church where five of the 10 Americans attend, offering pro bono legal services. Two relatives called him back and accepted, and Mr. Puello then began acting as the group’s lawyer, even though he lacked a law degree. Since his background has emerged, some of the detainees have sought to distance themselves from the man.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    My clients have never met Mr. Puello and know nothing about him,” said Caleb Stegall, the district attorney of Jefferson County, Kansas, who is representing Drew Culberth, Paul Thompson, Silas Thompson and Steve McMullin. “As far as my clients are concerned, Mr. Puello never spoke on their behalf and as far as I am concerned, Mr. Puello has no involvement in this case now on behalf of my clients.”
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Hiram Sasser, who is representing Jim Allen, said his client never authorized Mr. Puello to represent him, either.

                  <p>
                   This from Feb 24 seems to indicate Puello was a con man.

                   <p>
                    So far, there is no indication that Mr. Torres knew any of the Americans before they were detained by Haitian authorities on Jan. 29. Instead, it appears that on Jan. 31 Mr. Torres called the Idaho church that five of the 10 missionaries attended and, using the name Jorge Puello, offered his legal services pro bono.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Relatives of some of the detainees took him up on his offer, apparently not knowing with whom they were dealing. He ended up receiving tens of thousands of dollars, a small amount of which he said Tuesday he intended to return to the families. “It’s in the bank,” he said. “The problem is, I can’t show up in a bank and say, ‘Here I am.’ ”

                   He served a year in prison for bank fraud after trying to deposit a stolen check using someone else's name.  Guess where the idea that Laura Silsby got kids from an orphanage Friends of the Orphans?  The conman Jorge Puello.  He said this on American TV, not knowing how Silsby actually got her kids and not knowing the AP would be able to find and interview the families of these children.

                    Please check the post above.  The summary has this wrong.
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>
                     Folger is the daughter of Michael Maccoby, who coaches leaders of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos, or NPH, a large organization that runs orphanages all over the world. His son, Max Maccoby, is on the Boards of Directors of an NPH orphanage called Friends of the Orphans, which is one of 760 orphanages operating in Haiti, and happens to be the orphanage from which Silsby was caught trafficking children.

                   <p>
                    The summary has two things wrong.
It has the relationship between Friends of the Orphans and NPH backwards.  NPH runs orphanages directly.  Friends of the Orphans which is now NPHUSA is just a fundraising arm.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Silsby never took any children from any ophange, NPH or not.  She got kids directly from their families.  See the nbcnews article above.   The AP investigated and found exactly where she got the kids from, 20 were from the town of Calebasse and 13 Citron neighborhood of Port Au Prince.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    NPH has no facilities in either of these places.

            Have a look at the entire edit history for that article it's been pure diohrea since it went live and it's been updated with non facts over and over. I came to the conclusion that Jimmy Wales or some other senior party was completely owned some months ago, I knew it was biased and imperfect but shit that revision history is telling. 0 tolerance for the anti pedo movement apparently.

            Is there a mainstream article that mentions the FOIA finding that the DC Police (lied and) actually did not conduct any investigation?
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes it's easier to add something, and this would be one of those times. Yes, it will stand in opposition to what they've already got in the article, but that's their problem to deal with. It will look silly to have both these statements in the article, which is a good point to make, and probably the only one you could make since you need support from a mainstream article. I wonder if there is any way to use Ben Swann's report as the needed source? Has any MSM covered it? Even to make fun of him?
           </p>
           <p>
            Even a tweet from a well known figure like Mike Flynn Jr could work. The only thing is, if they've been 'discredited' in media, that will be included right after their statement. You know how it works.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is false to think that Wikipedia is there to present the facts, they don't even pretend to anymore. so just don't waste too much energy hoping or trying. I gave them 3 years of my life, literally cried over it. I don't want to see anyone else go through that.

               To be honest, i don't think they're going to let anything be changed on that article, even by an old-timer. But they are in the habit of reverting all new editor's changes to anything even remotely controversial. Sorry about that. Your post here and changes on WP may have raised some awareness though, and maybe an established editor will pop up and give the article a go. Someone needs to do an RfC on the removal of the NYT bit, for starters. (See talk page for more)

            What you need for Wikipedia is a source they accept as a reliable source. Unfortunately their current guidance is biased towards the liberal media. Efforts might be needed first in the higher level (editing the guides) to bring balance to that bias. In my opinion those efforts would be good regarding the whole Wikipedia project.
           </p>
           <p>
            The easiest way might be to join the talk page discussion on pizzagate, explaining what's wrong, showing some support for the claims with well reasoned opinions and gather support of other users to join the discussion too. Enough of editors agreeing on something might work there.

            Just a warning: There are also compromized editors eager to debunk those discussions, similar to for example shill here. Have a second thought if that is worth the effort, or could you maybe achieve something else similarly effective using your time in other projects. Everything pushing the awareness is good work.

             I've had a few years of experience on Wikipedia and left because there is no hope. The best idea is to expose them for what they are, a propaganda site, a mouthpiece for the powers that be. The best way to expose them is to catch their editors, the ones allowed to control the articles in question, abusing the rules.
            </p>
            <p>
             We already have that case. Go to the talk page of Pizzagate article. Look at the final 2 sections. You will see a game being played. Now it's true that WP won't allow InQuisitor articles, as anon mentions above. BUT the game being played is that the experienced editor toys with the one trying to challenge him, and removed some very important, oft-mentioned detail that came from the New York Times. THAT is against the rules and, for someone really familiar with WP rules (not me), this is an opportunity to actually have that editor reprimanded and likely banned from the article. However, in my experience, what will happen is that all his buddies will come to the discussion of his behaviour, and trash the opposing editor, talk up their friend, defend him in every way possible, and maybe even threaten the admins looking at the case, in case any of them aren't already shilling. There are very few admins who are willing to stick their neck out when the tide is against them. They just stay quiet, and 'buddy admins' will show up, and make the case for their friend, no matter how many rules have been broken.
            </p>
            <p>
             I even took evidence of this type of thing to the co-founder, Jimmy Wales, and he didn't care to stop it. He's in on it. That's why i gave up. It's corrupt from the top on down, and there is NO room for straight up truth tellers. It's much worse than the US govt. There is little compunction to be moral. They are anonymous and don't have to face the public.

               Dispute Resolution is a joke. We want something that will have lots of eyes on it, to embarrass or shame those doing wrong. DR is like a little closet that no one looks in, and it has no teeth. I would think NPOV noticeboard, with the removal of details from NYT might be a good first step. My experience is more with getting content to stick, rather than with editor behaviour, but if i was more well versed in that aspect, i'd be able to suggest a noticeboard for the BS they pulled on the talk page.

                 It absolutely does. And I don't blame you for leaving. you did everything right. Wikipedia takes good people who follow the rules, and unceremoniously beats them and spits them out, whilst others look on and cheer. That place ate me alive.

              Wikipedia is crap.  Even articles on inconsequential topics like entertainment are maintained but little cliques and changes aren't allowed, even if the original information was wrong, even with credible sources.  It says whateverthefuck they want it to say and that's the end of it.

               Seriously. I think it's better to not even try to fix it - let them make the place into a total joke, as they have done, so that no one uses the site anymore. Let them kill themselves as CNN has done.

              Isn't Jimmy Wales the one that edited his own wiki entry "downplaying the sexual nature of some of his former company's products."  LOL wikipedia is a SJW circlejerk, just compare the entries for Mike Cernovitch (or any other right leaning personality).

            I am not that savvy w/ Wikipedia so need help if possible. I am also targeting the following 'categories' for removal. Eventually I will want to see 'conspiracy theory' removed - I don't have as much of an issue with this, because it is a conspiracy theory, even if true. And am picking my battles:

             [[Day-care sex-abuse hysteria]]

            <li>
             [[Fake news in the United States]]

            <li>
             [[2016 United States election interference by Russia]]

            <li>

             Even looking at the list of 'related articles' solidifies the idea i have that Wikipedia is an Orwellian wet dream.
