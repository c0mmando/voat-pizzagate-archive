<p>Kirk Cameron bailed and went full Jesus. Sounds like a few other celebs who got the fuck out and found god. Kirk was on set of Growing Pains with known pedo Brian Peck. He was also photographed by known pedo &amp; child pornographer, <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/6hFrD5K.jpg">Bob Villard</a>.</p>
<p>The irony is I always thought Kirk was the crazy one for becoming some kind of weird super-Christian, back when I was young and first heard about it. Like who would bail on hollywood and become some kind of weird jesus-fag like that? Now I get it.</p>

            Would explain why it took Leo so damn long to win an oscar bc we all know he deserved one a long time ago.  Kirk Cameron also called the head of the studio while on GP and accused  one of the executive Producers of being a child pornagrapher- and years later the guy was convicted of child porn.  Kirk for real was woke.

            Wow. I've seen the "Connect the peDots" before but never put 2 and 2 together to think that Leo could be blackmailing his way to the top. And this explains his bizarre NWO agenda as well. Incredibly sad that a person's life could end up this way - all the fame and money but nothing but emptiness inside. Good for Cameron for walking away. That takes character.

            sad that is....  :( 
And I think it's very plausible he got molested in the pedowood-abyss. He's got that typical biography of a "pedowood kid".

            But I always liked Leo DiCaprio and still think he's a good actor. Think
            <em>
             Gilbert Grape
            </em>
            or
            <em>
             Jim Carroll

            . Good Movies. And he was  "eye candy"  for the target group of teenage girls... so I do not think he needed much blackmailing to get those roles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we have any complaints that he turned from a groomed victim into a molester? Or that he actually  "likes kids"...?

            That clip of Leo and Peck was vomit worthy. It was very lingering, intimate touching.... Not normal.  No wonder Leo had all the bad luck with the Brazilian model who left him.

            That pickle boy sketch with Brian Peck in the second video. "He likes to hurt and tease pickles."
           </p>
           <p>
            Then we have Rick and Morty's Pickle Rick episode. Is this a codeword for Hollywood paedos?

             Speaking of white rabbits, look at the image at diCaprio's feet.

              Yes I see it.  Also that pic was staged by the way the chair is lying on the floor and his foot on it.  It was planned that his foot would point at the two white bunny rabbits.  Another message to those that know.

            Kirk Cameron should man-up and blow the whistle, because we know Leo probably never will.

             I mean he actually did while on Growing Pains and has been slandered ever since.  Kirk really was the first whistle blower. I don't know how old you are but I grew up watching that show and it was a big deal when he started accusing people.

             Its not manning up telling your victim hood and expecting a prosecution after decades like Christina Blasey Ford. Cameron might be able to remember more than Ford could but who knows. Another thing is the media. The evil MSM wouldn't care one bit about Kirk Cameron's decades old molestation accusations unless it took down a conservative judge.
