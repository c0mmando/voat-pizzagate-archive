<p><strong>Lyrics</strong>:</p>
<p>Comet<br />
Will make your children scream<br />
Comet <br />
Don\'t buy the ping pong thing<br />
Comet<br />
You\'ll gag and vomit<br />
So go to comet<br />
And stomp it<br />
Today  
</p>
<p>Imagine rumor had it<br />
I was touching kids<br />
How long before the badges<br />
Would come kicking in my lid<br />
What kind of holy Magic<br />
Would excuse the things I did<br />
Or the emails that I blasted<br />
With code words known to fibs<br />
Would you look at all my static<br />
And just as quick forgive<br />
If I proudly wasn\'t Catholic <br />
Or some other silly rib<br />
Would you finally call it tragic<br />
If I didn\'t conveniently live<br />
In a city where the standards<br />
Say the guilty should be hid<br />
Those voted into cabinets<br />
More than like to slip<br />
Their bone that\'s beyond plastic<br />
A fleshy colored stick<br />
While it always rains on Travis<br />
The umbr-ella\'s grip<br />
Comes only in left handed<br />
The right is turning tricks<br />
Their methods concidered classic<br />
But the Internet still lifts<br />
Their outreach to the planet<br />
It\'s all in the documents<br />
For if this leaves you feeling stagnant<br />
It\'s because you must admit<br />
Kids are like power magnet<br />
Attractive only to the sick  
</p>
<p>But back to the top<br />
To the question I asked<br />
Would death by cop<br />
Touch someone half black<br />
As quick as the kettle drops<br />
The card when called that<br />
Burning the crops<br />
While destroying the facts<br />
Would metaphors prop<br />
Up pics of the past<br />
Showing the lop-<br />
Sided love of first class<br />
The government mop<br />
That Cleans up when the glass<br />
Of milk finally flops<br />
And though only filled half<br />
Way it\'s a chop<br />
To the back of the calf<br />
That hobbles the hop<br />
Of those who laugh last<br />
Connecting the dots<br />
Would you actually ask<br />
Why do Yagers say gots<br />
When they\'re supposed to say has<br />
Who\'s tying the knots<br />
What\'s holding us back<br />
How come the have-nots <br />
Seem to have Heather Flack<br />
If my wings call the shots<br />
It\'s time turtles attack<br />
Where do Shredders stop<br />
When the pizza\'s a trap  
</p>
<p>Why aren\'t we required<br />
To research a crime<br />
When those who conspired<br />
Are pros in the lime<br />
Light and their tires<br />
All covered in grime<br />
Are cleaned then admired<br />
Once there\'s been enough time<br />
For the best jewish writers<br />
To deliver a dime<br />
Then the blame goes to fires<br />
Or a maybe pipelines<br />
Or desiease, your desire<br />
Is played by the nine<br />
or ten-o-clock liars<br />
Working for fines<br />
Reading the wire<br />
They lurk in the Pines<br />
The hurts undercover<br />
But see between lines<br />
Podesta and brother<br />
Have the Clinton\'s behind<br />
They\'re no curse after mother<br />
It\'s children they find<br />
Who\'s bread to be wonder<br />
Who\'s Blood tastes like wine<br />
Let no man put asunder<br />
Try to redefine<br />
My word coming under<br />
These damaging rhymes<br />
And since Lightning and thunder<br />
Are nothing devine<br />
Comet can\'t plunder<br />
When the stars aren\'t aligned

            I know not specifically related to PG.  But lots of subliminal placating of what's happening now. Although video is 2 years old. Lots of pizza. NO BIG DEAL flashes on screen again and again. Pee wee Herman shutting the curtains. All from the illuminati princess Katy Perry.
