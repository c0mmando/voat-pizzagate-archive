            Both sides are fucked, any of you that had any faith in partisan politics is hopelessly uninformed, as if there really was a good guy/bad guy scenario, when you really look at the entire psy-op unfortunately history isn't going to look down on the intelligence of the past 7 or so generations too favorably. You continue to place blind faith in an idiot that showed you point blank who he was right from the beginning, and you still welcomed him with open arms, only because of the false promises every one of these predators have perpetrated on the American people for decades. I don't know how anyone could draw a more proper 'rough draft' of an 'anti-christ' type figure than that.

            Roy Cohn was the lawyer for the top Mafia families of New York and Canada.
           </p>
           <p>
            Roy Cohn got Trump linked to key people.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Cohn was a good friend of Craig Spence and together with top CIA and Army men, as well as politicians and businessmen, he once threw his birthday party at Spence's house.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Spence was later investigated for running a CIA-sanctioned homosexual and pedophile entrapment ring at his house with operations going straight up to the White House...
           </p>
           <p>
            "Cohn 'ran the the little boys' with the purpose of blackmailing high officials...
           </p>
           <p>
            "According to a 1954 news report, Cohn and his aide David Schine had met up with Spanish members of an international underground Nazi network while on a spy-hunting trip in Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Some of the leading members of this network, according to the newspaper, were Col. Otto Skorzeny, Hjalmar Schacht and Werner Naumann."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Cohn was a board member of the notorious Permindex firm.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This company brought together an international group of shady intelligence-connected men ...Board members had connections to the CIA, FBI, and Mossad, not to mention the mafia."
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump's close friend Roger Stone worked with Roy Cohn.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I was introduced to Trump by Roy Cohn', says Roger Stone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stone remains a "Trump confidante."
           </p>
           <p>
            Donald Trump has done business with the Bayrock Group, which has been associated with the 'CIA-linked' Gulen movement, and which has been associated with Tevfik Arif, who was arrested in 2010 Turkey as a suspected organizer of an international ring involving young girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Trump bought 40 Wall Street (The Trump Building) for a steal, because it formerly belonged to CIA asset Ferdinand Marcos, and his assets were frozen."
           </p>
           <p>
            "And through the Council for National Policy, it seems to include the Vatican sex rings as well...
           </p>
           <p>
            "I was also surprised to find Arik and Bayrock connected to Fethullah Gulen, who I started researching after the Boston Marathon bombing because of his connection to Graham Fuller."
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawyer Roy Cohn had as his clients Donald Trump, John Gotti, Tony Salerno, and the Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cohn advised presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cohn 'ran the CIA's child abuse rings'
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Glassner (above) arranged the deal that gave the lease of the World Trade Center to the Larry Silverstein Group.[7]
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Glassner, formerly of AIPAC, is now Donald Trump's top political planner
           </p>
           <p>
            Fifty days before 9/11, Larry Silverstein's Silverstein Properties and Frank Lowy's Westfield America secured a 99-year lease on World Trade Center Buildings One, Two, Four and Five. Silverstein already owned Building Seven.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silverstein and Westfield America insured the WTC complex for $3.55 billion, but after the attacks of September 11 lodged a claim for $7.1 billion on the premise that each plane collision constituted a separate act of terrorism, doubling the payout.
           </p>
           <p>
            About $5.4 billion went into the pockets of Lowy and Silverstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Atlantic City, Trump bought a property, at twice its market value, from Salvatore Testa, of the Mafia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump Plaza was built on that site.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mafia companies helped to build Trump Plaza.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Mafia controlled the bartenders union, which represented Trump's workers in Atlantic City, according to George Anastasia's book, 'Blood and Honor.'
           </p>
           <p>
            In New York City, several of Trump's buildings were built by S&amp;A Concrete Co., a concern partly owned by the Mafia's Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump and Salerno were both represented by the attorney Roy Cohn.
           </p>
           <p>
            On at least one occasion Trump and Salerno "met in Cohn's apartment".
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeffrey Epstein's Nadia learnt to fly at the same Mossad-linked airfield as the Hebrew-speaking Mohamed Atta, the one he flies into every weekend for his 'weekend whitehouse ' mar-a-lago.

             "In an interview with former NYPD detective James Rothstein, this author discovered that such operations do exist and go far back into America’s secret history. Rothstein is no conspiracy theorist. He is a legend in American law enforcement and speaks from experience. Furthermore, he gave me two notable examples from his time as a detective. Rothstein had an opportunity to have a sit-down with infamous McCarthy committee counsel Roy Cohn. During this sit-down, Cohn admitted to Rothstein that he was part of a rather elaborate sexual blackmail operation that compromised politicians with child prostitutes (Rothstein, no pagination). Cohn told Rothstein that this operation was being carried out as part of the anticommunist crusade of the time (no pagination)."

            In the late 1990s, Virginia Roberts was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a $9-per-hour locker room attendant at Mar-A-Lago (at 15 yrs. old - Florida legal working age is 16). (Groomed and culled from Mar-a-Lago by Trumps lesbian/hebophile friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who implicitly works for Jeffrey Epstein). Roberts' father also worked at Mar-A-Lago, which is located about 3 miles away from Epstein's estate, as a maintenance manager.

            TRUMP, MOSSAD, PLAZA HOTEL
           </p>
           <p>
            The Plaza Hotel is the site of room 233, 'where Roy Cohn held child abuse orgies in order to blackmail elites.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump bought the Plaza Hotel in 1988.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trumps mentor/handler was Roy Cohn.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI Director J edgar Hoover is alleged to have been witnessed dressed up drag with two young boys at the Plaza Hotel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could it have been at Roy Cohn's Room 233?

            Well. let's just say Trump hasn't been all that honest about Epstein. 
Here's a quote from 2002 New York Magazine- 
''I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy... he's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social life.''

             He said that after kicking Epstein out of his mansion for hitting on young girls. I think he was being polite at the time. Still disturbing.

               I'm not sure what your problem is. Just google "Trump kicked epstein out":
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=trump+kicked+epstein+out">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               He kicked him out in 1999.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then google when Trump said that Trump likes young girls:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=trump+says+epstein+likes+young">
                http://lmgtfy.com/?q=trump+says+epstein+likes+young
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               The latter article is published 2002.
              </p>
              <p>
               Keep in mind that Trump's name is in the black book, his name is circled, and also Epstein witnesses say that he flew with Epstein.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then ask yourself: if Trump was smart enough to defeat the CIA, mainstream media, academia, polls, and Clinton machine, do you think he was smart enough to avoid fucking an underage girl on camera for a Mossad blackmail operation at a mysterious Jewish billionaire's mansion?
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe.

                 Who knows? Right now, we don't know if Sessions plans a massive #pizzagate/Clinton Foundation prosecution, or if it will disappear like the Boys Town scandal. We just don't know.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I didn't make any claims about Trump being a good guy or a bad guy. I said that Trump made his comment about Epstein (likes young girls) after he kicked Epstein out of Mar a Lago for hitting on underage girls. That is true. I was asked for sources, I gave sources. Everything I said is consistent. Nobody knows what Trump will actually do.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We do know, however, that Trump signed an executive order about human trafficking right after Sessions was sworn in. We know that Kellyanne tweets about child trafficking. We know that human trafficking is important to Ivanka. We know that Trump has promised major revelations about Obama hacking him in the next two weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But we also know that half of Trump's foreign affairs picks are globalists with CFR links. We know that Trump fired Flynn. We know that Trump has not fired Comey or McCabe.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That's about all we know for sure.

                  So maybe Trump is playing both sides. Perhaps, for all we know the Acosta pick is one where you keep your friends close but your enemies closer? I mean Acosta must seriously have the goods on Epstein and friends. Did not defend the guy blindly for that plea deal that's for sure. Here's to hoping that's the case, but i'm certainly not holding my breath.

                   I personally think that if nothing happens, it is probably because the investigation would be impossible to contain, and once it was revealed to the public, there would be war. Just like FBIanon said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I do agree that some Trump picks are "keep your friends closer" choices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It's also not clear how much Trump really knows. For example, Comey and McCabe could easily keep him in the dark about things. Trump has legendary street smarts, but I think he's not an expert on the CIA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We'll have to wait and see what happens.

              I'm talking about the fact that he recently stated during his election run that he barely knew the guy. Again, that's normal considering they tied him to the Katie Johnson rape and pedophilia claim involving Epstein.

               Epstein REGULARLY hung out at the mar-a-lago until he allegedly hit on a members daughter they couldn't cover up and was asked to permanently leave. This behavior had been commonplace among the filthy rich on palm beach, the entire area is an elitist mk-alter laden nightmare. Virginia Roberts was EMPLOYED there underage, of course the Donald knew.

                So is he compromised? If he drags them down, by the same token, will they try to do the same to him? Know what I mean? so who's left that can investigate and blow this wide open? Sessions? the FBI? DOJ?

                 THE TWO NWOs

                <p>
                 The key to understanding the globalists’ strategy in implementing the New World Order is to understand that there are actually two NWOs: a Western-fronted decoy New World Order and a BRICS-fronted real New World Order. Once you understand how and why the globalists created them and played them against each other, all of the confusing information floating about the mainstream and alternative media will start making sense.

                <p>
                 BlackHats, like the patsy clans meant to bring renewed hate to jews, again, like the rockefellers and rothchilds, although seemingly in control, are ruled by the  WhiteHats, the old bloodline families of the papacy and the catholic church. The same playbook is being run on the Us as prewar Germany, subvert the society for 20 years (70 for bigger projects) through education, science, entertainment, environment, then clear them out wholesale, use the degradation as the excuse for the cleanup. The black hats have only been ALLOWED to thrive for a reason, so that when it's time to roll out the real slavery is when the 'good guy's' ask  to tag and bag you just to 'make sure' you ain't one of the former. Get ready for the new day!

                  Watch, eastern 'orthodoxy' is going to start challenging western religious ideals, especially those of the charismatics and advising 'prosperity' evangelists like Paula white and dominionists like teddy 'kennedy killer' Cruz.

                  Jews will be demonized as opportunists again just as they had been led by the lubavitchers so that the innocent exodus of real religious jews can be used as the 1/3rd sacrifice of their own  by the Clinton(godesss Isis) created Isis(terrorists) in meggido, giving the necessary (alchemical) emotional (magickal;kabbalah) impetus for the creation of the one world government and religious center in Israel to the god baal.

                   Solo, listen to me. 90% of voat users are probably lost in what you are saying. I understand you, you want people to know the mechanics of how the wall and the wrecking ball came to be, but you got to understand that most people just want to see the wrecking ball destroy the wall bud.
