<p>CDAN published a blind item about a comedian and an A+ lister who partied with some underage girls back 1990, one of whom ODed and died.   Enty, the site owner/insider, is a sharp dude and has a solid track records for these blind items being real, and the community over at CDAN is also sharp as hell.  They immediately named Kinison and Bill as the possible subjects.  
</p>
<p>Read it here:  <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/todays-blind-items-sex-drugs-death.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/todays-blind-items-sex-drugs-death.html</a></p>
<p>TL;DR  Allegedly Sam and Bill (then Governer, not very well-known outside Arkansas) partied with the teens and one OD\'d.  Bill supposedly pulled strings, had the girl dumped somewhere, and the girl\'s death was dismissed as just an OD, and her friend was sent packing.   Sam girlfriend Malika allegedly tried to blackmail Bill, and according to the blind item Sam was drugged while Malika was repeatedly raped as a punishment/warning. </p>
<p>Now ALL of this next part is a matter of record, and it so happens to jive with the blind item.  Malika did indeed go through this and it\'s easy enough to find online.  One night Sam, who had been sober for 88 days, passes out from what was blamed on a relapse.  Malika was held captive and repeatedly raped.  The dude named Unway Carter was caught on the scene.  First trial deadlocked, then there was supposed to be a retrial but I can\'t find any information about what happened after that.  <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-07/local/me-3738_1_kinison-s-girlfriend">http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-07/local/me-3738_1_kinison-s-girlfriend</a>  If any brilliant minds wanna dig and find out that would be coolio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bill\'s star was rising and within a couple of years he was ready for a giant step in his career, but some old business needed to be cleaned up, allegedly.  The other teen girl &quot;died from an OD&quot; cough.  But Sam and Malika were still out and about.  So the boyfriend of the teen girl was told that Sam and Malika were responsible for her death.  
</p>
<p>Sam Kinison was killed when a truck driven by a drunk 17 year old struck him head on.  The accounts of what happened are really strange and varied, but he did die at the scene.  Malika survived with a concussion.</p>
<p>All of this is crazy isn\'t it?</p>
<p><strong>Here\'s the kicker and here\'s where I need your help.</strong></p>
<p>Sam\'s Last Recorded Performance was released as an album in 2016. ** It was recorded just a few days before his death.**</p>
<p>Why am I interested?  Check out the set list and tell me you don\'t get chills.  <strong>This is from 1992, Bill wasn\'t even President.</strong></p>

<p>Sam Kinison had a foul mouth so the recordings are probably NSFW, but he was biting when it came to politics.  I\'m really curious what that set was all about.  Anyone up for finding and transcribing it?</p>

            Not everyhing on CDAN is true. They've had to at times make up satire just to give the impression of he site being tabloid.  Nicolas Cage was revealed in a blind that copied the plot of 8mm, a movie he starred in.  I think this is one of those fake blinds.  Sam has no pics of him with Clinton. None. He has never talked about him in his stand up, ever (to my knowledge).  A kid who just happened to find the Kinisons, the people he thinks killed his GF on a highway is unprobable.  Sam's wife detailed he slowed down to 15mph before the impact.  It could still be true but it's not that solid

            The reveal hasn't been published yet, but the commenters have correctly identified Sam Kinison as the comedian who got killed to cover up the murder.

           <p>
            People keep dancing around W. Clinton as the second guy, who actually killed the schoolgirl by O.D.'ing her on drugs.

             What most of them don't know (because they don't read Voat!) is that in his Arkasas governor days Bill Clinton was well known for "coke &amp; kids" parties, and an investigative journalist even got signed statements about them:

             If we back up to the 1980s and 1990s, during Bill Clinton's governorship and presidency, a curious book was published in 1997 by a journalist from England, that has possibly the most exhaustive documentation ever compiled on Bill Clinton: including his activities with underage schoolgirls!

            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Cambridge-educated Ambrose Evans-Pritchard (gotta love those English names) built a career in journalism over the decades writing for The Economist and then The Spectator in the UK, then in 1991 he joined The Telegraph, and was assigned to Washington as a correspondent.
            </em>
            <em>
             Evan-Pritchard is one of those journalists who likes to ask around and dig into documentation. Economics is his beat, and while in Washington he of course started digging into the financial scandals of the day, including Whitewater, the original Clinton scam.

             While in Arkansas he also started unearthing
             <strong>
              explosive information, including coke use and underage girls. He actually took statements from witnesses who had been present at these "coke &amp; kids" parties
             </strong>
             .
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             There was no way to publish this even in The Telegraph but he kept researching and building his database. Then in 1997 he was recalled to London and has since moved up the ladder to become The Telegraph's International Business Editor:

            <em>
             Anyways, once he was safely out of the United States, he published his information in the book:

             I heard about that book years ago, thanks for reminding me about it!   I also remember hearing a rumor that Bill's heart problems and health problems were caused in part by cocaine use, and there have been lots of stories that the whole white house staff used cocaine while on the job.

            Also remember that Kinison was a monster in his own right. How about this factoid where Corey Feldman's life intersects with Kinison's:
           </p>
           <p>
            '
            <em>
             The boys’ lives became so deranged that when Feldman’s father kicked him out of the house, the only person Feldman had to turn to was Burnham, and he rationalized it because “he was the only person in my immediate circle who wasn’t molesting me.”
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Feldman’s cocaine use, which began when he once found his mother’s stash, found him snorting an eight ball — an eighth of an ounce — every two days, a habit helped along by his new friendship with comedy party monster Sam Kinison. Together, the two smoked bales of weed in Feldman’s trailer, and were “having regular coke-off challenges, daring each other to see who can stay up the longest, who can do the most rails.”

             I'd never read that story before about Feldman, thanks for the link.  It's clear Kinison was no angel, considering he's the one that picked up the underage girls to start with.  Sicks fucks, the lot.

            In response to everyone thinking that Bohemian Grove defs = politician, you are wrong. The Bohemian Grove was started by some very prominent artists, and to this day is attended by, artists, politicians, and business people. Also, this description "Later, that person would become an A+ list celebrity and to this day remains so." doesn't describe a president very well IMHO. it seems like an actor or something to me, they have more staying power than presidents (are any other than Obama and Trump A-List?).
           </p>
           <p>
            All of the following are from "the south" since that's where Kinison's tour was during the incident, and the future A-Lister was only famous in his own town, thus, the A-Lister is likely to be from the South if he was to have access to the connections that disposed of the body. Could be Clooney, he works with Tarantino and becomes batman 5-6 years after the 91 Bohemian Grove meeting, or Depp because he partied very hard in the 21 jump st. days 87-90, after 91 he stars or directs in his next 10 movies, also he is a friend of Hunter S Thompson likely user of adrenochrome (mentioned in the 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Depp's character) and alleged creator of elite child porn (I believe this was brought up during the Franklin Credit scandal). So not Bill in my opinion.

           </p>
           <p>
            "i'm just curious. is anyone following the democratic campaign?
bill clinton. yeah, now there's a cool fuckin' guy. why doesn't
he just campaign like this?" (kinison holds mic at his crotch
and speaks as clinton) 'okay, i didn't know that was hanging out
there...excuse me ladies...i sure hope i didn't scare any of the young female voters over down in front there. i know it's got a great big old razorback arkansas handle on it there....'. but get your mind off fuckin' pussy clinton. the guy just looks like he's thinkin' about pussy all the time. i just think he should be more concerned about america's problems than always thinking about pussy.....'i'm justa good ol boy, i'm on the good ol' boy ticket, you know um......'. he'll be to busy fuckin' to do anything in the white house."

              That was one of the nicknames used about him.
             </p>
             <p>
              But in this case, he knew Bill Clinton intimately, having partied with him in a wild scene with two underage girls, and having watched him womanize on other occasions.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I wonder if the schoolgirl's death turned him against Clinton. He was pretty raw and brutal about Clinton, and maybe Bill Clinton's elite handlers saw that as a developing problem for their goals, so had Kinison killed.

               In the transcript you posted, it looks like he developed the habit of including Clinton the sex creep in his act.  This might have been Kinison's last recorded performance but it sure wasn't the first time he used the Clinton bit.  So yeah I think you're right.  He was hinting in his act he knew some nasty stuff about Bill and he was killed right in the middle of touring that particular act.

            The (((trust fund kid))) who hit &amp; killed Sam Kinison got off scott-free by a (((judge))) because of "affluenza".  Many of the rich's kids get let off with that being the reason. The claim is they're too rich to know right from wrong.

            Sam Kinison's Last Recorded Performance is available on Amazon for $9.49 (
            <a href="https://www.amazon">
             https://www.amazon

            .com/Last-Recorded-Performance-Explicit/dp/B06XDZDBFJ).  NOTE - Amazon is a banned domain here so pull the "dotcom" fragment one space to the left (right next to "amazon") in the link above.  I also noticed that Kinison's last album can also be downloaded from the usual places (Google Play, iTunes, etc.)  Interestingly, I noticed on the producer's website (
            <a href="http://www.comedydynamics.com/sam-kinisons-last-recorded-performance/">
             http://www.comedydynamics.com/sam-kinisons-last-recorded-performance/)
            </a>
            ) that Comedy Dynamics, the production company, also produced some of Louis C.K's crap.  What a tangled web we weave.  Makes me think we ought to look into Comedy Dynamics more in corporate databases (to see who owns them), etc., etc.

            What about Bob Sagat? When he was roasted, gilbert Gottfried made a joke about him burying a dead girl, and he was real popular in the 90s.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was also connected with dave coulier who was on nickelodeon when it launched, then left, as well as allegations that coulier was Alanis Morrissette's statuatory rapist.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the problem with pizzagate, when you are trying to find a specific pedophile rapist celebratory, a million more come out of the woodwork.

            Also here's Bill Clinton on Johnny Carson's show in 1988.  This was after he gave the nominating speech at the 1988 convention.

             That's the terminology that CDAN uses.  Politicians are called celebrities as a rule there.  All people in blind items get the ranking of A list  list etc.  Not just actors.

              That's true, however Bohemian Groves is conservative politically, browsing the list of members on Wikipedia I see Richard Nixon, Caspar Weinberger and Newt Ginrich as the political names that stand out.  Remember Clinton was seen a hippie usurper back in the day.   I don't really see the fit there.
             </p>
             <p>
              If a young politician was being discussed it seems like one of the Bush sons would be a more likely fit as several Bush Admin members were members. They might not fit the other parts of the description.
             </p>
             <p>
              (I don't beleive the CDAN article, either way, but it seems like a wierd way to describe Clinton.)

              no it doesn't actually. bohemian grove was started by some very prominent artists, and to this day is attended by, artists, politicians, and business people. Also, this description "Later, that person would become an A+ list celebrity and to this day remains so." doesn't describe a president very well IMHO. it seems like an actor or something to me.

              All of the following are from "the south" since that's where Kinison's tour was during the incident, and the future A-Lister was only famous in his own town, thus, the A-Lister must be from the South if he was to have access to the connections that disposed of the body. Could be Clooney, he works with Tarantino and becomes batman 5-6 years after the 91 Bohemian Grove meeting, or Depp because he partied very hard in the 21 jump st. days 87-90, after 91 he stars or directs in his next 10 movies, also he is a friend of Hunter S Thompson likely user of adrenochrome (mentioned in the 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Depp's character) and alleged creator of elite child porn (I believe this was brought up during the Franklin Credit scandal).

            There's all sorts of child abuse and rape allegations, even murder by some of the most famous people in Hollywood. The blog has been going on since 1995 the beginning of the modern internet.  Most of it is about infidelity and drugs but once in awhile RDJ and his friends post about some sick stuff however the last 3 months have been the darkest time in CDAN history.  Geffen, Singer, Ratner, Usher, Henley, Woods, Spacey (sick sick sick stuff!).

             Always struck me as odd especially nowadays.   Have you ever seen the very early video of him doing impressions of actors?  His face actually morphs and CHANGES with every impression.  It’s really freaky and makes me think he was under some sort of mind control.  Well, I guess they all are.  Plus his GF committed suicide and nobody knows why.  He gave her a bunch of STDs as well.   Gross.

              Yes, he use to be weird and just not funny to me.  Now he seems possessed or something.  I see so many young people on YT posting vid after vid of him being so woke or ascended.  It's actually scary for me to see that.  They have no discernment what so ever.  Beyonce is another one I think that is demon possessed.

               Beyoncé is for sure you can actually see how demonic she looks in the Super Bowl vids.  And yes, it’s sickening isn’t it, how people blindly worship these celebrities.   I fear for future generations tbh

            So if Enty has the dirt, the question is-- who told Enty? They might have proof. Also, what happened to the widow, Malika Souiri? And then there's this-- apparently Kinison got his best friend's wife pregnant and either knew or didn't know the girl was his child:

             Wow.  What a story.  I can't even get it all into my head.  Do I believe it?  You betcha. Why?  Look at all the crazy things we delve into on here.  Look at the Seth Rich case.  Look at Molly Macauley and JFK and RFK, who would believe that.  They have never Really been solved, although many have their own thoughts.  Def could be Bill C  but I really don't know much about Kinison.  Don't really like comedians that use fowl language to an extreme.  But after reading the similarities, I agree it could be him AND them.  They are both wild and evidently pretty risky as far as with women and getting into some really bad stuff.  But Bill is in a class by himself when it comes to misusing and abusing women, that is for sure.  Some of the remarks about politics are hysterical. Some  People still don't know its the elites against us, not Democrats and Republicans.  Hopefully they read most of the write up because there was some Real Pilling in there.  Thanks for your article.

             If you listen to AJ Benza's Fame is a Bitch podcast, he's either writing as Enty, or reading what Enty wrote. Not sure which, but they cover a lot of the same things, using the same phrases.

              Interesting. I vaguely remember he had some sort of TMZ-like show back in the day. I think it only ran a few years, but now that you say it, Benza being Enty could explain some things. I haven't read CDAN on a regular basis for the last few years, after the site went to hell and the writing changed dramatically I lost interest. I figured the original writer sold it and agreed to come back for occasional posts. Maybe I'll check out his podcast.
