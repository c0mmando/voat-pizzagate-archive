<p>Eric Eoin Marques, a US-born 28-year-old living in Dublin, Ireland, is accused of being the chief architect behind Freedom Hosting, responsible for hosting child porn on 550 servers throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Freedom Hosting is also accused of providing services for money-laundering operations, fraud fronts, and child abuse discussion boards with names like Lolita City and PedoEmpire, according to The Independent</p>
<p>“My suspicion is he was trying to look for a place to reside to make it the most difficult to be extradited to the US,” Donahue said, as quoted by the Irish Independent. </p>
<p>“He was looking the engage in financial transactions with another hosting company in Russia.” </p>
<p>Hackers from the Anonymous collective levied a distributed-denial-of-service attack against Freedom Hosting in 2011.</p>
<p>Normally advocates of privacy and freedom online, Anonymous asserted that it determined Freedom Hosting hosted 95 per cent of the child porn web pages on the Tor network.</p>
<p>Donahue said Thursday that Freedom Hosting facilitated at least 100 sites, each with thousands of users, and Marques himself was a frequent visitor. </p>
