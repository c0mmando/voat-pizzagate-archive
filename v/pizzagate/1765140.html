            I do not think they are that capable, they're not smart enough to enact something so sinister... Too many people would protest, there's a point where you have no choice but to fight back you know, people aren't that stupid

            This thought had occurred to me a decade ago when I watched Zeitgeist. I remembered thinking how they might engineer a scenario where public will actually demand totalitarian measures! People must be vigilliant! They in fact start to use microchipped children to track where they end up and expose the traffickers in the act - use the system against them, expose them, then cause revolution, change the govenment then discard the system.

            I am glad you brought this up. I too have thought about this but many years ago. I am a mother/grandmother and I have always believed that they are looking for a way to get us to accept this. I actually had a talk with one of my kids and asked if they would put a chip in their children to track them if anything happened and they said YES! I was horrified. I talked to them about why it was a bad idea... Total Recall the movie is a great example of why you don't want the chip. But who is to say that we are not already chipped so to speak, they have chipped our cars, phones and computers as well as other items. so they do have track of us. and if they make the Bitcoin the monetary standard and get rid of physical dollars etc then we are officially doomed. The chip is the last thing they have and I feel they will start chipping babies as soon as they re  born. I have also wondered if vaccines are another way to chip us... just a thought.

            Iluminati New World Order is in trouble, they overplayed their hand in the Middle East, they couldn't finish off Syria. The Globalists (Satanists) had a small window of time, after the collapse of the USSR, to complete their project. The thinking was, with the fall of the soviet Union. They had their shot. The USA (Freemason, Illuminati forward base) was the lone superpower. We saw their 911 and rush to capture all of the ME oil. However they did not count on the resurgence of Christian Russia. The Illuminati once defeated Russia with the 1917 Jewish Bolshevik Revolution, 60 million Christian Russians were murdered. flash forward to 2014, sanctions against Russia for the Ukraine situation instigated by the Clinton State Department. Russia never "invaded" Ukraine. Back to Syria, Russia bailed out Syria   against the Illuminati agresion, which has caused all kinds of new, unforeseen alliances the Illuminati never foresaw: (Russian, Syrian, Iranian), (Russian, China) etcetera.The Jew World Order has fucked themselves, the entire world is dropping the $ currency, the petro $ is on it's way out. to top it off, the whole fucking world knows about their Satanic, pedophile, Masonic 3000 year old scheme, it's fucking over!!!

             You know the history. Spot on. Their global pefo network was their global currency. With their 9-11 Masonic stunt they have exposed themselves and with all this fake news narrative it is clear that they know they are finished. You see, according to J.Edgar Griffin you don't need 100% of the public to wake up to cause change in mass consciousness, not even 80%, all you need is a critical % which is around 30%, and this is becomming a reality. Paradigm shift is happening!

            You may be right, but people have been saying that the next year is the year we get chipped like cattle ever since the technology was adopted for tracking pets as that was considered a trial for human use.

            We will probably see more and more of this type usage -

            In any case, with the prevalence of cell phones, they already have a great opportunity for surveillance since that potentially gives them audio and visual access in addition to knowing your location. Granted the cell phone is not physically implanted in you, but for some people it might as well be, and you can yank out the battery. It is still funny to hear people complain about RFID human tracking and then find out they are sharing their geolocation data with google among others.
