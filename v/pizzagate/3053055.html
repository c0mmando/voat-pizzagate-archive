            This post is also pertinent to today's news as the catholic church seems to be going through a purge of pedophiles........kind of late and questionable whether they are acting now because they want to or have to...... The mafia is also under scrutiny.....which is also important in trafficking children .

            This is another example that shows the ineptitue of pizzagaters in thinking critically. The problem with child abuse in the catholic church is real and cases have been widespread. But if pizzagaters will tackle the subject, they will add their conspiracy delusions to it and end up with things like this:
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So even if there's a problem worth looking into, or even if all those obviously fake FBI Anons would be real, the pizzagaters would be the worst people for the job of investigating stuff because of their lack of critical thinking skills and tendency to buy into conspiracy delusion.

            , you're going to need to provide more than close-cropped, out-of-context screenshots to support the claim that these images depict sodomy and child rape to satisfy Rule 2 -- Empiricism. Each image needs to be shown in it's actual primary-sourced location, with whatever relevant information is available about it -- where it is, what saint is depicted, who the architect was, who commissioned the work etc.. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This is the worst kind of fake news reporting tactic, and it's not acceptable for research threads on this forum. It makes a mockery of all the serious, well-sourced work done by others, and of the community that set up the submission rules to prevent it.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, you need to explain that in Latin America, where the pope is from, it is a Christmas tradition for families to bring the infant from their home Nativity creche to the priest for a blessing on Christmas Vigil. That typically involves the priest or bishop kissing the Baby Jesus statue.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll also need to mention that annointing (laying on of hands on the head of a kneeling supplicant) accompanied by holy oil (chrism) is a central part of both the Sacrament of Healing and of Confirmation -- a tradition instituted by the Apostles during Biblical times, and continued to this day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Leaving this kind of information out is deceptive and dishonest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Claiming these postures depict child rape rather than the traditional holy rites they've always been used for is going to require actual evidence, not merely salacious claims coupled with out of context pictures.

            A lot of places around the world had phallus worshippers.

            I'm more concerned about the modern statues showing children with monks. Those are disturbing.

             Thanks, that's interesting. I always thought it was maybe to be seen in a Celtic tradition of fertility godesses.

             God sacrificed Himself willingly for us because He loved us. It was His own idea, not man's, not Satan's. Before evil existed, God knew. Let's not get it twisted. There is goodness and purity in Christ and His Plan, regardless of Satan (and man) working to pervert perception of His message during these last days.
            </p>
            <p>
             Folks, repentance is the only thing that can save us. We're frogs in pots of water and the heat has slowly been rising for years. Now it's boiling but we refuse to jump out. America, the world, needs to wake up and turn back to purity and morality, and to do that we need to humble ourselves collectively before God. And I hope those of you here that are Christian pray fervently for this.

              No, the bible is a justification for evil.

             <p>
              You guys know nothing about spiritual warfare. You don't help the victims, you just pray for them. Just what these beasts want. No action.
             </p>

              Learn the root cause of this that the bible omitted to tell you!

              Then we can remove these predators from our society with practical actions like brain scans.

             <p>
              Prayer and repentance doesn't change a thing. But knowledge and actions does.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your not helping the situation. Go find a gangstalking victim that is being destroyed by this and help them. Something no church does. Because Christians are completely useless in spiritual warfare.
             </p>
             <p>
              When people see how blind and useless Christians have been on this horrific abuse it will end 95% of churches. You didn't help a single one. Not even your own brethren got help or even believed by you. That's why I'm no longer a Christian. The churches are happy to play dumb when these sadistic games are used to destroy people.
             </p>
             <p>
              I now know of another family targeted in this way from the same church. All it would take to end our abuse and get our lives back would be support from our churches. But it never comes because virtue signalling and playing church is more important than fighting the real evil or saving people from psychopaths.
             </p>
             <p>
              Go speak to your pastor and ask why none of the churches help victims of narcissistic abuse, gangstalking or satanic ritual abuse!
             </p>
             <p>
              I doubt you or your pastor care. go help these victims or forget speaking about god and redemption. It's all bs if you just pray!

              The truth is most of us are sane but we need to understand the ones that are not! Because if we don't they will manipulate us to their benefit.
             </p>
             <p>
              The sane are people that have empathy, can use the frontal lobes of their brains. The insane are mostly made up of people that have destroyed their conscience and their frontal lobes as a consequence! See image.

              Those that do this become either narcissistic, psychotic or pedophiles. The people that think they are gods and tell the rest of us what god demands of us!
             </p>
             <p>
              They are evil. The religious ones become satanists or lucifarians. But they all use the same narcissistic abuse playbook.

              This is almost identical to satanic ritual abuse.

            I had seen those statues before in the first ink but grouped together they are much more powerful.  God God how awful all that stuff is.  I saw  a drawing at least 5 years ago of two saints that were married (2 men)  in the 15th century.  Can't find it now.  The joke has been on us.

             Catholic priests used to be able to marry also.....but celibacy came out as a  means to keep all of their property and not share it with wives.

             What do you mean by 'they were married'? The Church certainly didn't approve of gay marriages in the 15th century.

              That's what we have been told.  But I saw it.  Wish I could remember their names.  Darn.  They did a lot of things then we were never told.  Things were changed and  now they want them changed back in favor of the gay priests etc. Next thing the gay priests will be adopting Children with their gay husbands.  I know that sounds far out but nothing would amaze me anymore.  Yes, there are also archived records of priests married to young girls.  I know this to be true.  Someone told me they were married to the priest that abused her. Wedding ring and all. They are and have been doing things for centuries I believe in secret.

                One of the inherent problems with early Christian attitudes to sex was the concept of'brotherly love', the pairing of monks in 'spiritual marriage' as eulogised by the 12th Century, Abbot (later Saint) Ælred of Rievaulx in Yorkshire, whose spiritual and close relationship with a monk called Simon slightly pre-dated the famous heterosexual liaison of Abelard and Eloïse and harked back to the "marriage of true minds": the Sacred Union of two holy males in Brotherly Love ('philadelphia') practised by uninstitutionalised early Christian monks in the Middle East and, later, in Ireland. (See Boswell, John: THE MARRIAGE OF LIKENESS - SAME-SEX UNIONS IN PRE-MODERN EUROPE, HarperCollins 1996)

                Chapter four, "Views of the New Religion", looks at the influence of early Christianity on relationships. Noting that the faith encouraged asceticism and celibacy, he discusses the devalued role of marriage in Christian society, and the increased popularity of asexual marriage. He moves on to look at the evidence for same-sex "paired saints" in early Christianity, such as Nearchos and Polyeuct, Ruth and Naomi, and Serge and Bacchus, arguing that these couples were perhaps romantically involved.[6] The fifth chapter, "The Development of Nuptial Offices" opens by explaining that the early Christian Church was uninterested in marriage ceremonies, which were largely left secular; he notes that the Western Church only declared marriage a sacrament and developed canonical laws to regulate ceremonies at the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. He then discusses Barberini 336, a circa 8th century Greek liturgical manuscript containing four ceremonies for sacramental union, one of which is between two men. Discussing this and similar recorded ceremonies, Boswell questions what they represent, if they reflect homosexuality, and ponders if these are "marriage" ceremonies, in doing so rejecting the idea that they represent ceremonies of adoption or "spiritual fraternity".[7] The sixth chapter, "Comparisons of Same-Sex and Heterosexual Ceremonies of Union" looks at these ceremonies, and their varying similarities and differences.[8]

               <p>
                The picture of Serge and Bacchus is similar to the one  I saw but not the same.  I believe they are examples of the "paired saints" which was a form of secret same sex unions.
