            Yes they are getting way too sloppy now, good! Because they are so desperate to try cover up their sick ways they are making major mistakes and its so funny to see people pick them apart straight away, not even an hour later he was already named as an actor with a profile. Thank you to everyone for your tireless work but WE WILL NOT STOP until this sickening shit is stopped and with all this attention something is going to pop up that will 100% confirm everything, even though its pretty fuckin obvious already. Everyone who is supporting this, thank you, these children deserve our help!
