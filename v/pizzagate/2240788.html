            There are a couple of Enty/Crazy Days and Nights items that would expose the organized pedophilia in Hollywood and in the current atmosphere they have a good change of popular acceptance. Enty is definitely an ally.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a strange operation, though. "Enty" is short for entertainment lawyer. The blind items are given without naming names. (Perhaps a way to avoid legal issues? Yet often he names names later on.) Readers guess on the names in the comments. When they come to a consensus, show/movie dates and names all line up, there's sort of a frisson of proof, although everything still rests on Enty's initial allegations.

            For those who are too lazy to click the link, here is the full blind item:
           </p>
           <p>
            "For the past month, I keep hearing that these two women, who were each at one point A listers were going to come forward and tell their story. They can tell it a lot better than me. One of them even knows the details of how this became one of the largest child porn rings in the world. Back when this show first aired, people were just starting to buy VCR's. Those are machines which play videos in cassette form. Yeah, a cassette was - never mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first A lister basically made her career from the show. All of you know her. I mean all of you. Although she credits her career to the show, she also credits her years of hard core drug abuse and her sex addiction and trouble with intimacy and commitment to the show. You tell me how you would be if at the age of 9 or 10 you were being offered drugs by producers and then while you were almost passed out from the drugs, being molested and raped by those same men. Oh, and a great percentage of other times they would take the boys you were starring with and make them have sex with you or the producers would be getting naked with the boys.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if they kept telling you how great you were and then sent you all over the world to promote the show? Did I say promote as in talking about the show? No, they sent her all over the world to have sex with guys interested in child porn in other countries who wanted to start their own versions of the show.
           </p>
           <p>
            When she got to be in her teens they pushed her out of the show and she ended up being molested by a different group of producers in a different corner of the entertainment world. She says she was first molested at 9 or 10 and that she did not have consensual sex until she was almost 20.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our second A lister was A list for much longer. ALL of you know her. She was kind of a replacement for out first victim. She was also about ten when she started on the show and started being molested and assaulted on an almost daily basis. She blames her trust issues and intimacy issues on the experience. She also says it is one of the reasons she ever refused to get naked or topless for a movie. It triggers her to see any kind of camera when she is topless or naked. That is the only way they would film her when she was a kid. She has never really relished being in the public eye but always said she would work enough to never have to work again and she has pretty much done that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The owners of these companies were incredibly smart sexual predators. They were constantly changing the name of the holding company. They would transfer ownership of the companies through other studios. They knew which producers and politicians loved child porn and would send them the videos. These guys started doing child porn and then realized if they started a television show or pretended they were starting a show they could have more access to kids. The way things worked, they made a few episodes of the show just to show people so they could get more kids. It was not until they met another child porn lover who was also a producer that saw the show that they sold it.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of these producers is still working today in the same kind of environment. For decades he has been doing what he does to children and tweens. The thing is though, none of his shows have really ever produced stars the level of the two mentioned here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, one time about a decade ago, the second of our two victims in this blind was making noises about going public. One of the foreign child porn producers she had met one of her "exchange tours" arranged for her to make a record. Although it was released here, it was only a moderate success. In the country overseas though it sold millions of copies making her a huge star in that country. The company spent millions on advertising to ensure the sales and that deal has kept her quiet until now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am really hoping they step forward because it will create the avalanche necessary to get all the other victims from that show and the ones since to step forward and bring this group down."

            The Enty crew has sat on a LOT of info like this over the years. If this momentum continues of perverts and pedos being outed, I'm hopeful that CDAN will start naming names, dates, and places because they won't be as concerned about lawsuits as they once were.
