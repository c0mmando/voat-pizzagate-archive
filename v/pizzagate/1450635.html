<p>Instead, I\'ve started looking into Dan Roberge who commented on Alefantis\' photo. Another user posted this link to a photo he found with a creepy guy on Roberge\'s Insta: <a href="http://archive.is/D39g2">http://archive.is/D39g2</a></p>
<p>I did some research and this guy\'s name is Septime Webre. Webre was artistic director of the Washington Ballet for the past 17 years before stepping down to take up a role at the S&amp;R Foundation. I went to Septime\'s Instagram, searched his following/followers list: him and James Alefantis follow each other.</p>
<p>From the comments on Alefantis\' Insta photo of the three men, Roberge commented \'who are these guys?\' Alefantis quickly replied, &quot;You know&quot;, and &quot;We\'ll wait for you.&quot; This either means Alefantis was saying Roberge actually does know these two guys, or more likely he was saying he doesn\'t actually know them, but instead their intentions.</p>
<p>What relationship do Septime Webre and James Alefantis share? As Alefantis commented on the photo, &quot;you know&quot;, implying that Roberge knew the exact reason why those guys were meeting Lynch, does this implicate the two men in the photo (one already probably confirmed to be Ian Pope)? **</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I\'m an Australian who\'s been following this for a few days and just wanted to let you guys know there are people like myself from all over the world who believe in your cause and want to see these sick fucks taken down. </p>
<p>I was browsing through an album of screenshots taken of pictures from James Alefantis\' Instagram, and I instantly recognised one of the guys in the photos: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OYrExq0.png">http://i.imgur.com/OYrExq0.png</a></p>
<p>This could already be common knowledge, but I thought I\'d throw it out there just in case. Midway through this year, an Australian man was arrested in a police sting after travelling to LA to have sex with a six-year-old boy. Here is the link to the article on this case: <a href="http://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/crime/melbourne-paedophile-and-rugby-player-michael-quinns-us-sentencing-delayed/news-story/bb3501bf59f34f5190f86de628638be9">http://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/crime/melbourne-paedophile-and-rugby-player-michael-quinns-us-sentencing-delayed/news-story/bb3501bf59f34f5190f86de628638be9</a></p>
<p>I believe the person on the right in the photo with Alefantis is Michael Quinn. Not only does this person look identical to the picture of Quinn that appears half way down the news article, he\'s even wearing rugby shorts in the photo. Quinn was travelling in America with an Australian rugby tour at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p>While the screenshot of the photo from Instagram says 97 weeks ago, this could potentially mean that Quinn\'s arrest wasn\'t the first time he travelled to America to participate in child sex. What does everyone think?</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Fixed link</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Sorry guys, I was mistaken - the guy in the middle is not Alefantis but his close friend Christopher Lynch, owner of L\'enfant Cafe.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: For those not convinced the man on the right of Alefantis\' photo isn\'t Michael Quinn, here\'s a side by side comparison of their faces: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0cJzktk.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/0cJzktk.jpg</a></p>
<p>EDIT 4: People have tracked down the logo on the footy shorts and found it belongs to the Washington Irish FC. Here is a team photo of their squad in 2015: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rC1fDrn.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/rC1fDrn.jpg</a></p>
<p>The guy on the left of the Instagram photo can be found second from the far right in the front row, and another user has commented saying he thinks the guy on the right of the Instagram photo (who we believe is Quinn) can be found 13th from the right in the team photo. It sure does look like him, however I\'ve made another picture comparing the beard shapes of Quinn, the questionable guy in the Instagram photo and the guy in the team picture. Quinn and the mysterious guy share the same beard shape (sort of M shape), while the rugby player has a W shaped beard. Pic here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xO5XAEU.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/xO5XAEU.jpg</a></p>
<p>EDIT 5: There\'s a very good chance this could be a dead end, as people have found the mysterious man on the right of the photo could be Ian Pope, a Washington Irish rugby player. Here\'s the comparison here: <a href="https://anonm.gr/?a39f.jpg">https://anonm.gr/?a39f.jpg</a></p>',

            I have theorized that Septime Webre is the person paying the role of "Pedo Perv" opposite Majestic Ape in the Heavy Breathing video I No Luv -

            He looks quite similar but I'd like other opinions.  From other pics on the internet, it appears they are quite close.

            Not all posters are fucking retards.  Just a lot of them.  I tried explaining that shouting things like "I found proof of a devil cult and clinton eats babies!" in all caps is not going to get us any exposure and will get us made fun of.  Explained that the best way to get the story out is to focus on undeniable FACTS (like Podesta traveling with Hastert for one example). I got downvoted by retards.
You get an updoot.

            Edit: it could also be intentional shilling to discredit us.  or retarded spasmatics.  Probably a combination of the two tbh.

            Did you guys look into L'enfant Cafe owned by Alefantis friend Christopher Lynch? Definitely some sick shit going on over there. I don't know how to link pictures but go to Instagram and look up L'enfant Cafe &amp; Bar and you'll see pictures of disgusting men crossdressing.

             Wow! Great find. Has Alefantis openly said there is no basement in Comet Ping Pong? Can you provide a source? If so, is there a way to confirm if that picture is taken at Comet Ping Pong?

              Ok, actually I made the mistake of using someone else's summary of this video where these dudes show up to Comet Ping Pong and interview Alefantis:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKTiUaloDDA">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKTiUaloDDA
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              After actually watching the video, it appears Septime's picture was probably taken in the public ping-pong room or the "kid's party room" (sheesh). Alefantis instagram shows construction in a "basement-like" area...but it very well could have been one of these two rooms after seeing the rough decor.
             </p>
             <p>
              I, for one, am not convinced of Satanic Ritual Abuse or pedo parties happening at Comet Ping Pong specifically. I think the whole search for tunnels and pedo symbolism in barely connected places is getting far removed from the original investigation into the CF. That being said, this "measly" restarauntuer has a bizarre amount of elite friends who love his shitty pizza place and is definitely into some strange subculture shit.

              Comet Ping Pong is in DC. The Washington Irish FC is a rugby team in DC. The Washington Irish FC logo is on the shorts of the guys in the photo on Comet's Instagram. The two guys in the photo are in team pics for the Washington Irish FC, and neither are Michael Quinn, convicted pedophile from Australia. The OP was wrong and this lead needs to be dropped and forgotten.

            But I've seen other stories that James Alefantis means "I love kids" and he changed his name to that as a joke.  Not true.  Needs to be debunked.

             I have read his name is James Achilles?  I think someone needs to really dig about his actual identity?  He is being portrayed by the media (NYT, Wash City Paper, WAPO) as the nice joe sixpack "pizza" shop guy?  Is this, i.e. Alefantis, being hidden in plain sight?

            As it seems it's pretty clear this is not Michael Quinn, I've started looking into the
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/danroberge">
             @danroberge
            </a>
            who commented on Alefantis' photo. Another user posted this link to a photo he found with a creepy guy on Roberge's Insta:
            <a href="http://archive.is/D39g2">
             http://archive.is/D39g2
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I did some research and this guy's name is Septime Webre. Webre was artistic director of the Washington Ballet for the past 17 years before stepping down to take up a role at the S&amp;R Foundation. I went to Septime's Instagram, searched his following/followers list: him and James Alefantis follow each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the comments on Alefantis' Insta photo of the three men, Roberge commented 'who are these guys?' Alefantis quickly replied, "You know", and "We'll wait for you." This either means Alefantis was saying Roberge actually does know these two guys, or more likely he was saying he doesn't actually know
            <em>
             them
            </em>
            , but instead their intentions.
           </p>
           <p>
            What relationship do Septime Webre and James Alefantis share? As Alefantis commented on the photo, "you know", implying that Roberge knew the exact reason why those guys were meeting Lynch, does this implicate the two men in the photo (one already probably confirmed to be Ian Pope)?

             it was debunked. Black beard vs Ginger beard. The bearded guy in the photo JimmyComet was commenting on is more than likely an American rugby player by the name of Pope.

            The football field shown in his FB cover photo is from New Zealand (Mt. Egmont in the background), so I assumed it was where he comes from. Thanks for the correction.

            Just wanted to comment on this. That's very true. I bet there are also a lot of people like me who aren't native English speakers. So please, friends, go easy with the acronyms, abbreviations, pseudonyms, etc. Be as precise as you can when you give infos.

"Walter called Quinn’s desire to attend a pedophile party where people could pay to rape children “absolutely disgusting,” “ghastly” and “despicable.”" So he was looking for a party where people could pay to rape children (all plural).

            This says, "Quinn and his Chargers teammates," so it seems it might not be him, def not the team. However, it does make that picture even more WTF considering the dude in the middle who loves kids.

            People have tracked down the logo on the footy shorts and found it belongs to the Washington Irish FC. Here is a team photo of their squad in 2015:
            <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rC1fDrn.jpg">
             http://i.imgur.com/rC1fDrn.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The guy on the left of the Instagram photo can be found second from the far right in the front row, and another user has commented saying he thinks the guy on the right of the Instagram photo (who we believe is Quinn) can be found 13th from the right in the team photo. It sure does look like him, however I've made another picture comparing the beard shapes of Quinn, the questionable guy in the Instagram photo and the guy in the team picture. Quinn and the mysterious guy share the same beard shape (sort of M shape), while the rugby player has a W shaped beard.

             I don't see anyone that I'd be more than 50/50 on as being the other guy.

             Still, need to find out what date the team (Melborune Chargers) flew into the United States and see if we can track Quinn's movements.

            I don't think the guy on the right is Quinn: (1) his cheekbones are higher, while Quinn has a saggy face and (2) he's a ginger or, at least, has a reddy-brown beard. However, I just found some information that would support the idea that the guys wearing football shorts in this photo are Australian. Alefantis tells Dan Roberge that 'he knows' who these guys are. Roberge describes himself on his Instagram page as an "Australian Artist with The Washington Ballet and Consultant, Creative and Movement Director in Washington D.C. and beyond." It seems that Alefantis knew that Roberge had either met them or knew of them because of the Australian connection. Regardless of whether they are Australian or not, Roberge probably met them at L'Enfant. Here is a photo of Roberge at L'Enfant taken by Alefantis:

             That's a good point.   Roberge is a ballet guy, gay, but nothing strange on his Instagram that I saw.  Just a gay dude doing his thing.  He could have known them because of where they were from.   The shorts though - Quinn could have gotten a pair of shorts for his 'costume party' attire from the non-bearded guy.

               Sure seems to be the wrong guy.

              <p>
               One big clue it's NOT him is the lack of attacks on 4chan when this was posted there.  The shills left it completely alone as if they knew it was leading nowhere.

            I'd just like to say, bad ass find. Would love to know where he was going in LA and what he was doing in DC when he visited. Like how does this Aussie know these pervs in DC? Mutual friends? Online buddies? Common interests?....
           </p>
           <p>
            And also if the FBI did a sting w this perv than they have all the links to these pervs already.

            Great work identifying it! Not sure what that means for this evidence though. Here is a photo taken off the website of their full squad in 2015:

           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the man on the left in the photo with Christopher Lynch is the guy second from the right in the far right in the front row. Can't seem to find a match for the guy we believe is Michael Quinn, though.

             The guy in the right of the l'efant photo is likely the guy on the bottom row approx 13 over from the right.

             I'm disappointed this wasn't  the Aussie, but I think that's both of them.

              While the guy you're talking about does look like the guy in the L'enfant photo, I don't think that's him. Here's another picture I made of Michael Quinn, the unknown guy in the Instagram photo and the rugby player from the Washington Irish FC:
              <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xO5XAEU.jpg">
               http://i.imgur.com/xO5XAEU.jpg
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look at the shape of the beards, Quinn and the guy in the middle's beard has sort of the same shape (an M shape), while the rugby player on the right is more in the shape of a W.

               Hair color with the Washington Irish guy is an exact match, seems like it could just be a different beard growth. Same triangular nose, Quinn's seems to dip more in the middle while the Instagram and Wash Irish guy's go straight across. Also, Quinn's hairline seems more receded.
              </p>
              <p>
               Need better pics of the Wash Irish guy. But the fact that the other guy in the pic is definitely on Wash Irish, and they're wearing Wash Irish shorts, makes me think they are probably both locals.
              </p>
              <p>
               edit: Quinn has a longer, straighter nose with more dip at the bottom. Guy in Instagram looks like his nose might be broken to the right (his right, not ours).

                The 3 side by side make it clear the guy on the far right is a much, much closer match than the Aussie.  It makes sense 2 guys on the same team are out together.  Lets forget the Aussie talk and give a pat on the back for a mystery solved.

              It does indeed appear that it's probably the guy, given the shorts and another guy on the team that fits.

            L'enfant Cafe &amp; Bar is an interesting place. From the website
            <a href="http://www.lenfantcafe.com/">
             http://www.lenfantcafe.com/
            </a>
            , "L’ENFANT HIMSELF WAS NOT CUT OUT FOR THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.
Born in Paris, Pierre L’Enfant joined the American colonists during the American Revolution to re-design and strengthen American forts. General George Washington liked his work so much that after the war he asked L’Enfant to plan the capital city for the new country.
The many open spaces, plazas, and parks we beltway residents enjoy can be attributed to the genius of the L’Enfant plan. Conceived to celebrate greatness and heroes, his plan brings our city continued grandeur through its continuing ability to add new monuments and memorials
Sadly, French geniuses often score poorly in the “plays nicely with others” department.  L’Enfant was no exception. President Washington’s administration made requests of L’Enfant to submit updates to his plan, which were summarily ignored stating he would communicate only with the President.  L’Enfant continued to ignore the committee, and was summarily fired… and unpaid for his services.
Being stiffed by the government only intensified Pierre’s already charming disposition. As years passed, his greatest talent was for getting fired from other jobs. Who could blame him, considering a newborn nation stole his capital city genius without so much as a kiss on the cheek. He died broke, interred in an unmarked grave.
But genius sometimes prevails. President McKinley discovered L’Enfant’s grave in 1901, dug him up, set his coffin in state in the Capitol Building, then buried him with full military honors. His final resting place on a hill in Arlington Cemetery offers a beautiful view of the city he designed, but was never paid.
Today L’Enfant café-bar is a social and gastronomic homage to the brilliant, the tempermental, and the French in all of us.  When you visit, remember that it’s never too late for a great come-back."

            That might be Washington Irish logo on rugby shorts, but pretty sure they're not a "gay rugby team" like the Melbourne Chargers. The instagram pic doesn't necessarily paint a very manly picture. It looks like something from a gay club.

            Here's something:
           </p>
           <p>
            It began in April when an agent accessed a social networking site with online groups who "expressed their sexual interest in children" and found a post from "Mick" who stated he was travelling from Australia to LA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mick, who US authorities say has been identified as Mr Quinn, allegedly told the undercover agent he was "looking for sex with children" and while "he liked both boys and girls, his favourite were boys, aged 5-10".
           </p>
           <p>
            "Would love to share one with you mate," Mr Quinn allegedly wrote.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr Quinn also allegedly stated he was "a bit nervous" and suggested they "party" with drugs before.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The only reason why I'd want to party is to know you're not cops," he allegedly told the undercover agent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Special agent Kelly Kottas, group supervisor of the HSI-led task force, said Mr Quinn was stunned when authorities burst into the room and told him he was under arrest.
           </p>
           <p>
            "He was shocked and very nervous," Agent Kottas said.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            So is THAT group online how he wound up at Comet in the first place?   Or ... coincidence?

            Alefantis IS NOT IN THIS PIC.  I want broken open too...but ppl making THE SAME mistakes over and over is muddying the waters. It's clear...Alefantis is not one of these 3 ppl. He posted/commented on the pic...BUT HE'S NOT IN IT...STOP.  takes just a little effort to get things right.

             It's Christopher Lynch, and the picture's on Alefantis' Instagram = they are friends. Still a good lead (a breakthrough I would say). It's a global, collective effort.

             Sorry for the confusion, I've edited the original post to say it's in fact Christopher Lynch, owner of the L'enfant Cafe. The fact that Alefantis posted a picture of his close friend with a now-convicted paedophile says enough to me.

            Quinn snuck away to the LA beachside hotel without his friends knowing and was arrested when he handed $US260 ($340) to an undercover agent posing as a pimp.    (Lure was: SIX YEAR OLD BOY HE WAS PLANNING TO RAPE)

            Why does everyone keep calling the guy in the middle Alefantis???? It's clearly a totally different guy, looks absolutely nothing like James Alefantis. Can we please stop this?

             See post below from "llm2016".  May I ask.......are you shilling here?  Believe me, I understand the need to maintain journalistic integrity and not make comparisons to James Alefantis that are fabricated.  However, multiple users on this thread have pointed out that while the photo of the 'man in the middle' looks similar to Alefantis, it is not James Alefantis, but one of his good friends.  I find your use of emotion in defense of Alefantis to be unnerving.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I ask:  Who are you?  Why are you on this thread?

             Dear god thank you. I've been literally yelling at videos that have that pic and claim its him in the middle bc it's clearly NOT. Things like that cannot happen in YouTube videos bc it's so easily refutable and to the non red pilled masses is a visual link to say "see, these people are nuts."

             It's Christopher Lynch, and the picture's on Alefantis' Instagram = they are friends. Still a good lead. It's a global, collective effort.

                 I realize that. But they aren't going to write "come bang kids here" on the door (actually I'd almost not put it passed them). I was wondering what the front is.

            Quinn has a gap in his front teeth, guy on left has no gap..guy on right MAYBE but area around eyes is all wrong. Also that's not "jimmy" in the middle.

            EDIT: Scrolled further down to other photos...could be.

             I wonder if the police will investigate  Quinn's electronic communication to provide further potential links.    Let's hope.   Anybody know who's in charge of this investigation?

              Exactly, this guy came all the way from Australia and knew right where to go! So they are all in communication with each other which we know but it could be direct. What the fuck is wrong with these people.

            I did not have time to check to see if the team was in the USA around the middle of January.

            I don't know when that original screen grab was taking of the Insta photo. I added a week to make it 98 weeks.
Puts it around the middle of January.

            Need to see if the team was around the East coast for a game that time. Or if off season he could have traveled to the DC area on his own.

            Great friends this guy keeps... Makes it easier to paint a picture of his character (if his own Instagram wasn't enough)

             From instagram we know that the picture was taken in DC around January 2015. From the news articles we know that Michael Quinn was arrested in LA during May 2016. So if the Instagram picture does show Michael Quinn with Alefantis in DC, this was taken during a different trip than the one he was on when he was arrested. I wonder if he took yearly rugby trips to US? I'm going to look more into this.

             Excellent catch.  While not perfect, this certainly seems conclusive.
            </p>
            <p>
             It connects Alefantis to a known pedophile.   #Rugby, how would he know that?  Wow.
            </p>
            <p>
             Excellent, excellent work.  This is exactly what this forum needs instead of this satanic crap connecting Clinton to aliens.

              Why is this subverse not even high up on vout? I found this while researching, " Vista Maria," mentioned in FBI operation cross country, that is connected to Ireland Good Shepherd cases.)))) This subverse came up on my web search and is a great find by all of you. Many upvoats , but I never saw high up on voat, at least not for very long. Seems to happen a lot with good puzzle finds of this case, esp when connected to abroad factors or USA public health care/ welfare systems. )))??)))
             </p>
             <p>
              It "seems," as if Alefontitus is one of the "routings" from Vista and Boystown refugees, oversea orphans, some USA local children; and routing is very established in the survivor book, "Let Haiti Live." Pg: 215 a states VA area and NY after initial systemic routingnof refugees. Boystown is mentioned, all over the book and "sponsor families, and " group homes."
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet, appears, Akefintitus is working more with the nuns Npo organization, as caucasion children seem to be the Dc area preference. Many of the children and babies in his photos have a European, UK look. Many of his friends and travel, like what you all found in this subverse are also UK, European, Australian people and networking, socializing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe that is why Alefintitus went to Whitehouse five times, on dates coinciding with trafficking events; so as to get updated or given info of where to gather the next batches of European children?/

              Agree.    I emailed the owner of the SubVoat and asked him to STICKY!    It's that big, IMHO.   Now they can't say "Nobody has ever been arrested or charged or..."
              <br/>
              Nope.   One of these guys is right here and he was busted.

               Absolutely.  This is the best piece of evidence that has been found so far.  A KNOW, ARRESTED, and soon convicted pedophile in Alefantis's instagram.  This thread needs to become a major focus area.  Who is the guy on the left?  Who took the photo.  That's the next questions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Forget the flip stuff.  Wont happen.  We've got what we need... for the FIRST TIME ALEFANTIS HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO A KNOWN PEDOPHILE.

                 Someone said it's a 'different guy, look at the eyebrows' on another thread where I brought this up.  Sure as heck looks like same guy to me.
                </li>
                <li>
                 The Daily Mail story mentions he traveled to or was to travel to New York to have sex with kids.   Need to put him in D.C.
                </li>
                <li>
                 He had a public defender in Los Angeles.   Likely lacked the money to hire one as for those charges it'd be lots.
                </li>
                <li>
                 He might cooperate and testify against other men he partied with in this way if he did so in the U.S.

               </ol>

                  The stuff you use online is crap.   You'd need a law enforcement type with real deal stuff to tell and even that would be a probability.   Feds would have the records.

            <p>
             May 19th 2016 Michael Quinn's team landed in LA on Qantas flight 93. They began the trip with a stay at a Hollywood Hills home.
            </p>
            <p>
             May 21st 2016,  &gt;Quinn caught an Uber to a hotel where he planned to meet with "like-minded men" and a six-year-old boy.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In the hotel room, the Cartoon Network was playing on the TV and Toy Story-themed cupcakes were available to eat.
Mr Quinn, according to US authorities, also had $US260 ($A360) in his pocket.
The money was to allegedly pay for the sex he planned to have with the six-year-old, who was yet to be presented by a pimp.
Mr Quinn had also allegedly brought a camera, film and a monopod to support the camera
Mr Quinn was the target of a meticulous operation by undercover agents from ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              It began in April when an agent accessed a social networking site with online groups who "expressed their sexual interest in children" and found a post from "Mick" who stated he was travelling from Australia to LA.
Mick, who US authorities say has been identified as Mr Quinn, allegedly told the undercover agent he was "looking for sex with children" and while "he liked both boys and girls, his favourite were boys, aged 5-10".
"Would love to share one with you mate," Mr Quinn allegedly wrote.
             </p>

                Yes, sorry. I spoke too soon. If that's not the same guy it's a very strange doppleganger. Strange only bc we're looking into pedos and suddenly there's two rugby player of all things that look alike and one is arrested for trying to rape a 6 yr old boy and the other is in a pic on a sickos IG.

             Excellent catch. While not perfect, this certainly seems conclusive.

             It connects Alefantis to a known pedophile. #Rugby, how would he know that? Wow.

             Excellent, excellent work. This is exactly what this forum needs instead of this satanic crap connecting Clinton to aliens.

              Look at the Jimmy Saville case. Was he brought down on satanism/occult charges or pedo charges? There's the answer to this debate about whether or not to make satanism the primary focus.

               Unfortunately, he really wasn't brought down, at least not within his lifetime. If there's life beyond the grave, he probably had a good chuckle over how the complicit prosecution services failed us and enabled him.

               Nobody is arguing that satanism should be the primary focus. We're merely stating that there is evidence of occultism with these people and rings, and it's worth including it as part of the investigation. I don't understand why there are people so vocal about squashing this discussion. I noticed the same trend on Reddit. A few people would come in and submit one post after another trying to convince people not to talk about satanism. This behavior is very suspicious in my opinion, and it only makes me want to explore the occult aspect even more if brigades of people think it is so important to ignore

                Agree. I'm suspicious of anyone who's trying to tell others what they can and can't do instead of simply doing what they prefer.

              Except the Satanic stuff is just as real as the pedophilia stuff and they directly tie together. Who gets to decide that's it's important to expose one thing and not the other?

                I thought that was odd and the pictures at Comet Ping Pong of red drawn people in two rows with one red person on top of a small figure with a handkerchief under it is a big concern. 
I would agree above comment is another person trying to encourage the focus off the most important element

                 I know I'm replying to a comment that's weeks old now, but... that disturbing artwork you describe is Kim Noble's.  It has some similarity to at least one poster for a band which performed at CPP, but it was not in CPP.

               Agreed. People really need to get off their high horse about what they personally find the most important.

               I'm agnostic but find the satanism angle extremely compelling. These people do practice some sort of occult magic. Whether it works or not I don't really have much say, but I believe they think it works, and I believe it's the fabric holding these people together. I personally feel like the pedo angle is just one of the many tentacles of this greater satanic occult Illuminati thing.

                Exactly.  There is nothing illegal about being a satanist.  And quite honestly if we want to convince the general public we must focus on the most simple and believable issues.  Regardless of truth.  Truth is perception.  Anyone in marketing can tell you this and let's not fool ourselves this needs to be SOLD as a theory.  The satanic shit will be discovered and brought to light in due course but it is foolish to push that narrative as a starting point  if you want to Bend the ear of the general public.
                <br/>
                Now ask yourselves... are we about getting results or not?  Because if not then by all means start every thread with all caps and Satan references.

                Ok, he knows an artist, so what?  Is there any evidence of satanic bla bla?  No.  A pedo to pedo connection makes sense.  Find real evidence of satanic rituals, then start a thread.  This is why you get dismissed as wild theories.

                 Wow, you obviously haven't done much research into other cases of pedophile rings and ritual abuse. Occult practices are a common denominator across many of these stories. I understand if you want to omit satanic references when introducing this to new people, but don't try to bully the investigators and tell them that something should be ignored, especially when there are valid reasons for pursuing it.

                  Please go on: What are those "valid reasons" for pursuing it? Btw, you can stop accusing people on VOAT.COM/V/PIZZAGATE of not doing their research. That's the only reason they're here...doing research. We've all read about the other cases of pedo rings and guess what...none of them got convicted because of satanism or occult ritual abuse.

               Without spirit cooking this wouldn't have gotten the attention in the first place.  Not sure where alien stuff came from but like it or not the satanic part IS a relevant and necessary piece to this.  None of us made that part up it was them! THESE ANIMALS mascarading around as regular people sent the emails about spirit cooking, and posted pictures of blood on their bodies, and performed "art" including drinking blood, urine, semen, and other human liquids or at the very least collected their work.  Theses elitists ALONE connect themselves to the occult and satanism with spoons full of blood(fake or not really doesn't make much of a difference to me) in their mouths.  Hillary Clinton was the one who had some of these musicians who spirit cooked with Marina Abramovic performing at her speeches when she ran for president.  Leaving that part out would make us as bad as MSM picking and choosing which pieces to report and investigate.

                Not even sure why Satanism is legal. Sacrificing animals should be illegal and fall under animal abuse. If the animal right groups, esp on Facebook that do daily animal rescue knew about this; they would be livid and loudly advocating. They are a loud group in the USA and worldwide, and would be smart to inform them and get them on board, for they sure make a lot of noise, fast.

                Operation Cross Country interviews state girls are sent to Vista Maria or CP's. Vista Maria is Good Shepherd and is connected to Ireland cases. Easy to find a lot on web searches, for USA and worldwide locations, stories, connections to CP's, public healthcare, and us- aid. Many us- aid emails on Wikileaks, including Clinton and Podesta.

                Two refugee/ deportee survivors, wrote a book, " Let Haiti Live." Boystown in South Florida and all over the USA is mentioned in the book many times, including the S. FL.location as one of the first places to route minor refugee boys. A dentist is mentioned that is even hired to check the teeth for age. Krones and Broward Jail are where non minor males sent; or aslum ones to Guatima, then routed to Australia, Venezual, Guatoma.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pg 215 in the book, mentions children sent to VA and NYC, and "sponsor families."
               </p>
               <p>
                This is clearly systemic with routing, to organize where ones are sent in a process. Krones on Facebook has a lot of refugees on it, complaining. The book, stares that even if ones have relatives, immediate family in the USA, still routed, separated and not allowed in person contact, very limited phone contact that also messes up there foia court cases as cannot contact their attorneys as needed.
               </p>
               <p>
                Some attorneys post on Krone, Fb that might be able to share more info if contacted.
               </p>
               <p>
                Motels are also on state fed contracts with public health care, used more to first route all ages of females, and the book states deplorable conditions, not allowed outside and federal cases that have occurred that Bush and others have ignored the court outcomes and created bills to surpass the court orders.

                Connections to ever expanded Boys town and Ireland Good Shepard nuns is huge, as are the profits, fundings, mass USA and worldwide locations, programs, hospitals, group homes, sponsor families, schools, medical research, corp connections and more.

                A simple web search shows Flanagan is number #47 or #48 on top Npo charity profit, and that is Boys Town. Also, Boystown gold silver IRA and coins, and many web pages of the so called licensed "sellers," of the Boystown gold/ silver IRA and coins.

                As there are strong movements to put Satanism in school and after school programs and coloring booklets, be good to make more parents aware. One mom is trying to and has a blog and petition that is based in FL. Fl, Alaska, NYc are mentioned a lot on the web as a string movement to put Satanism in schools. Alaska had a govt ritual recently, and NYC 42 nd area, just built that Satanic monument. A lot of people just do not know about Satanism, so do not teach their kids, streetsmarts about it.

                Yet, there are some blogs that list all the cps crimes that have gone to court that involve severe violent satanic crimes with both elite and the populace, since the 1980s. There are thousands of cases listed. I posted that link around two months ago, on Vout.

                Exactly. Let's not fall into the MSM trap of pushing a narrative. Put all the information out there and let people make up their own minds.

                 Why would that be counter productive? Ideas and products don't just "take off" and become popular without carefully constructing the messaging around them. People will more readily share content that is framed in ideas they're already familiar with (pedo and cp) as opposed to satanism/occult stuff. Soccer moms don't want that on their FB or IG feeds.

                  Wrong approach. It's not a line of products that have to be sold and compromised for an extra shekel.

                  You present the truth, the way you see it, and make sure it's as informative and clear as possible - you don't
                  <em>

                   True, it's not a line of products. However, you're mistaken in the idea that strategically controlling and shaping the narrative of pizzagate will somehow compromise the truth. Far from it. If the narrative is not controlled by the researchers, then someone else will do it...that's for sure. We have limited resources. Let's focus them on the areas that will generate the most potential legal action. Satanism is not illegal. Occult magic is not actually real and is also not illegal. The abuse is real, the pictures are real, so researchers, imho, should focus there. That's all. Cheers.

                    These kinds of movements only work as a thousand-headed, ever changing, hydra (think Anonymous or Gamergate). You can't co-opt a group without leadership. You can't lead it astray if they're already moving in all directions.

                     And the evidence for that claim is Anon and Gamergate? But Anon has official media channels to distribute their highly targeted, carefully constructed messaging. The only way Gamergate is similar in any way to this current pizzagate investigation is that it also had no leader or centralized mouthpiece.

                     Bro, have you even read any of the info on JTRIG? There are a number of highly effective strategies to control the narrative, disrupt investigations, and derail discussion in disorganized online forums just like this one. Forum sliding is one of them.

                     Here's my final comment and I'll let you have the last word since I've already made my point several times. Satanism/occult is part of this, yes, BUT
                     <strong>
                      we have limited resources
                     </strong>
                     . We should focus our resources on the angles/leads that will produce the most actionable evidence. Satanism is not illegal. Occult is not illegal. Therefore, we should focus on the actual illegal activities like pedophilia and cp. Cheers and good luck.
