<p>This movie showed it  The movie is about a group of conspiracy theorists breaking into the &quot;Tarsus Club&quot; Elite meeting that happens every year.  The Tarsus Club is full of elites from politicians and celebrities and CEO\'s and executives. The main character breaks in to get the truth. Instead he finds himself hunted after doing so, The elite make him wear a bull mask (remember how it\'s said the elite dressed the children up as animals?) and hunt him down in the Forrest.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaron finishes the initiation ritual only to be given a bull mask instead of a raven mask. The members then chase him through the woods. Although his hidden camera continues to record as the members catch Aaron and appear to attack him with knives, it does not show his ultimate fate.&quot;</p>

            I created this burner account to specifically share this information please do with it as you please:
           </p>
           <p>
            Steve Aoki is a pedophile, or at least knows about #pizzagate. This is the only picture on his personal instagram account and his company "pizzaoki" Instagram page that has the hashtag #pizzagate. Please explore for yourself. And guess what? The picture features the WB show "Smallville" nasty woman that was indicted last year for her role in the sex cult NXIVM for alleged sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit forced labor and other nasty stuff. This is more than just mere coincidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could not Archive.today Aoki's Instagram page directly. The following links are the actual/archive.today links for websites that can mirror instagram pages.

            I would take a screen shot of Aoki's Instagram page before anything is done with this information and he has the chance to take it down directly. Please do with this information as you please. This is my attempt to help get the word out and I will be spreading the information around online as well and to various news agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the first hint I have personally found that gives any credible information linking Steve Aoki to #pizzagate. I also believe I might be the first one to have noticed Aoki's link to #pizzagate. It would be awesome if this information could be shared with the various Chans. I am unfamiliar with them.

            This is also the theme of Stephen King's novel
            <em>
             The Running Man
            </em>
            written under his Richard Bachman pseudonym, which was made into

            Even earlier, in 1924, writer Richard Connell published the short story
            <em>
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game">
              The Most Dangerous Game

             Collier's
            </em>
            , about a guy who falls off a boat and swims ashore on a Caribbean island where he finds himself being hunted by aristocrats. That was made into a movie in 1932 on the set of
            <em>
             King Kong

            I was a bit disappointed at the ending of this movie. While there was a lot of truth told, it ended with the elite having set up the initiation &amp; hunting party as one big joke in order to scare the 2 guys for crashing their “party”. The elite laughed it off while the conspiracy theorist moved off grid &amp; went into solitude. I felt it was making fun of conspiracy theorists.

             I think that is pretty much the point of all Hollywood depictions of this thing -- a laugh for them, while convincing the sheep it's all wild fiction.

            looks like they used a sickle sword to cut the rope (jewish). also, does it seem weird that the hunger games was almost normalizing/glorifying this sort of sport? i mean, never mind that the government forces kids to kill each other in a game, let's all pick teams and start supporting our favorite warriors... seems like we've gone from repulsed to somehow tolerant of this idea. predictive programming is a motherfucker

             Weird i was just watching that and trying to figure out what deceptive message they were sending out in the film. Something i noticed was the mockingjay hand symbol looks like a mix between the nazi salute and also an "M" shape with their fingers so they are saluting with an "M" symbol. We know about their following moloch so this was noticeable to me. Inadvertently the viewers would be cheering for the side that throws up M signals throughout the movie.
