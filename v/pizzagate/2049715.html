             does sound like exaggerates and some parts of her story in my opinion are fabricated. However I find it strange that so many things I've come across independently with my research match up with her SRA story. Privately I told all my family and friends she was not to be believed when they asked me until recently when I came across the 6th point on this list. If she is a shill, then she's mixing truth with fantasy to detract from something that's really going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             If I was her and I did see DUMBs and 3000 KM long underground railways, I wouldn't fucken talk about them because they would detract from the main story I am trying to get out about the child abuse. As for the part about Holseworthy army base, in my own life experience I met someone who left the field of genetics who he got a masters degree in because he had witnesses some very unnatural tinkering, and I don't just mean GMO. Governments do have a history of doing this stuff in America.
            </p>
            <p>
             1) OTO Gnostic Catholic Mass mandates orgies, child rape, blood drinking and has the same colour scheme as her stories
2) OTO has been linked to having brood mothers making sex toys for other OTO members. I think she was saying that before Peaches Geldof got killed for naming two real life OTO child fuck cult brood mothers
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oJlvnbNegk">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oJlvnbNegk
             </a>
             I think I'm being harassed by a real life one in Australia
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2045737/10097965">

             </a>
             3) I grew up near boystown in Engadine that was shutdown for being a pedo cult. What she says lines up with my local knowledge from a childhood - stuff you don't read in the papers.
4) The court cases involving OTO and religious vilification in Australia my key area of research shows massive government complicity. I'm sitting on more stuff linking the OTO to bestiality websites and the Temple of Set, and they jail people for saying they are Satanists. Seriously. Have you seen how they got charity status - and how the government hosts OTO documents talking about "Master of the Hermit Traid XI" who's rituals include killing real little boys and girls:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2029702">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2029702
             </a>
             5) I've seen massive over one million dollar grants go to all OTO operatives linked to the court cases showing massive government corruption and complicity in relation to the OTO. If you defend the OTO in academia money flows in - even for stuff you are not qualified for. E.g. Douglas Ezzy who argued in case law when Alister Crowley writes about child sacrifice it should be interpreted as masturbation. Alister Crowley didn't write the book of the law accoriding to the OTO, he was just like Mohammed in the Cave Challening for the demon Aiwass, and the other book he referred to wasn't written by automatic hand. See the end of this thread:
             <a href="http://8ch.net/pol/res/10297068.html#10370468">
              http://8ch.net/pol/res/10297068.html#10370468
             </a>
             Even the US members of the OTO (ex) know's the Australian branch of the OTO is world famous for fucking kids.
6) I was laughing at her thinking
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/FionaBarnett">
              @FionaBarnett
             </a>
             was fucken nuts talking about a pedo cult in Bond University. Then I found Bond University operative Diana K Night defending the OTO for the ACT Human Rights Commission and I doxxed her. See the sources for the Jim Fetzer interview on the pizzagate lik above.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't accept all that she says. I just find it damn odds so much she is saying matched up with my independent research that is more grounded.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not saying you are wrong, because all the comments I tried to put on her blog you can see here were not published. She's willfully ignoring my research because maybe it is more grounded and based on case law - governents/OTO own data that makes people go WTF is going on here. She may be acting just like this shill piece video this thread is linking to. All I'm saying is half of what she is saying is true and the OTO really is a child sex cult.

             can you come here and explain yourself or have you been threatened with Lawsuits by the OTO hence you are only allowed to run around telling your SRA stories but you don't want to any substantive research to back up your cliams - because you like it just being SRA survivor stories only - and you don't want to expose the Australian government's complicity working with the OTO.

               Here's the details on Jeff kenett - kind of a rant but you get the idea some crazy shit is going on with all the people named in the Riena Micheleson OTO pedo dossier being extorted by Garry Burns and the OTO's own lawyers for $$$ It's damn odd.

               His own barrister USED TO WORK FOR PIAC &amp; GARRY BURNS - so she was working against her own former clients when working with Jeff Kennett. Then she goes to get a job back with PIAC spending Jeff Kennett's charties (not his money fraud) money when PIAC and Beyond blue partner on some crazy mental health legal assistance sceme worth millions headed up by the very same barrister a month later.

               Would you give a contract to an outfit that were saying you want all gay people to die (that's what Garry was saying about Jeff Kennett) because he critized Ken Campagnolo a gay pedophile who is confirmed to be a pedophile in case law running a child fuck house. Ken Campagnolo is praised in Oxford Univeristy Press texbooks but that's another story. Ask me for the links if you wanna know more.

Everyone upvoted the CNN Freedom Projected praised convicted human trafficker one, and something my wife came across gave me #1 - faggot pedo's going to orphanages in Vietnam linked to a rothchild mansion children's party elfia.com

               Shills are real. Limited hangouts maybe so too. I just spotted one with some bitch defending the OTO and trying to manage John Sunol the boy guy with brain damage (see my first comment to you).

                 I was actually trolling someone who was on gab.ai just the other day who seemed like PAssio's greatest fan. I like your attitudes. I think we are two of a kind in a straight man to man way :) I am guilty of sharing one of his videos on pizzagate until I researched him more and said WTF.

               I've been contacted by one of her insiders / OTO researchers called "Steve" &lt;surname redacted&gt; who gave me the main clue about the facebook.com/policeglbti being founded by proven OTO operative Dr Gregory John Tillet. That guy has run off now but he had solid intel including all the OTO's ASIC / Tax records I got leaked.
              </p>
              <p>
               He was also talking about Gorden Myers. Don't get me wrong, being outside Australia I can risk coming in contact with more shills only to have them turn on you and do hitpieces. I'm exposing shills everywhere too. If people are genuine (this guy I thought wasn't at first - and if the authorities follow through against him like they are against John Sunol he is real) because if you expose OTO child sex case law normalization with gay judges ruling in case law children must love being fucked by their gay parents or they are homophobic hate criminals and how dare they speak up on their abuse when they grow up (e.g. Robert Oscar Lopez).
              </p>
              <p>
               Right now just tonight I had a youtube celebrity dickhead troll my channel. See my comments here:

              <p>
               Regardless of Fiona what do you think about my research about the OTO getting tax exempt status by a corrupt judgment the judge lied in case law about as exposed here:
              </p>
              <p>
               Riena Micheleson who's buddy with Fiona - her research is so solid it's not funny. Garry Burns and the pro-bono lawyers for the OTO PIAC.asn.au/PILCH/Justiceconnect.org.au have shaken down and extorted cash from 3 of the pedophiles named in the legg/devine dossier she wrote that got that couple jailed. Jeff Kennett / Eddie McGuire must be pedos if they will kiss Garry Burns ring. Jeff Kennett is diverting funds from his charities money to PIAC only a MONTH after they sued him for disrespecting a COURT CONFIRMED PEDOPHILE "Ken Campagnolo" - see his most recent case in austlii.edu.au - the judge all but said he ran an open after school kiddy fuck house. Garry Burns demanded Jeff Kennett give money to twenty10.org.au gay child prostitute rent boy dorm near the "wall" that fiona is always talking about, before the charges were mysteriously dropped (PIAC never gives up normally and appeals and appeals and appeals - they even fought for the right of gay dads to storm in to church buildings and demand free christian supplied gay babies in the case of OW &amp; OV vs Wesley City Mission - 8 years of appeals until a gay politician had to change the law and make a religious exemption pushed by a gay politician because it was giving the LGBTI movement bad press as exposed here;

               See how I'm not disagreeing with you. You got me Fiona is sensational and she wakes people up to what is real - but her story has some holes in it or is too sensational.
              </p>
              <p>
               She talks about the Wood Royal Commission being corrupt. I found the leader of the Gay Lobby Christopher Puplick trying to shut it down because he was defending gay child fucker boylover Robert "Dolly" Dunn saying he was innocent until proven guilty. And to investigate one gay pedophile is to investigate the whole gay community in a witch hunt - therefore all gay pedophiles must be free to roam and rape little boys or you are a homophobic to oppose it. Justice wood was named as a gay pedophlie IN LEAKED DOCUMENTS FROM THE ROYAL COMMISSION - source of the leak must have been the commission itself or the transcription agency because these interviews are not given to the interviewee or the tape.

               The guy who ran the gay judge child fuck bar in Kings Cross was just arrested yesterday in yet another international drug bust. Justice James Wood was named as one of the pedophiles. Someone with a conscious is released this document. I called the NGO parties to this document and they confirmed it's authentic.

              <p>
               Look at what is happening to John Sunol being sued by OTO child fuck cult operative Garry Burns, OTO child fuck cult founded speical gay police, and OTO child fuck cult Leader David Bottrill directly all at the same time - just like this guy.

                 p.s. i can't upload to youtube becaue i'll only loose my channel due to censorship and we need the most popular video to stay there for legal reasons. It's a crime to link to my youtube channel on your blog AND NOTHING ELSE. see "abclpugspedos" on austlii.edu.au or www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au where a gay judge ruled in case law the child must love the anal rape they got in a house of gay parents - and is a hate criminal for not enjoying his boysex. Luke McKee is guilty of linking to Robert Oscar Lopez's PhD's (main evidence in the USA Supreme Court Gay Marriage case OBAMA FAG PED was against) paper "same sex marriage is child abuse" , and John Sunol is guilty of linking to Luke McKee's youtube channel that linked to the boy who grew up who didn't enjoy is child rape and his a hate criminal.

                 If you complain about this the OTO founded faggot sex cops that do cyber crimes to protect pedophiles will prosecute you for the same alleged cyber crimes they do. See how the OTO founded  gay child fuck police aka facebook.com/policeglbti ran my father out of Australia just like they ran his son out here:

                 Video showing how the special gay child sex police ran me out of the country featuring my dad. My dad was targeted because he made this video supporting his son and lost his tenure at university for hating pedo police trying to give visas to illegal immigrants etc etc
My dad was found guilty of disrespecting those who fuck babies whilst he was in Vietnam by an Australian court just like John Sunol. I've posted links to his case law here:
