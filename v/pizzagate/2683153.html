<blockquote>
<p>Businessman killed with family in seaplane crash \'<strong>leaves £41m to Oxfam</strong>\'</p>
<p>Richard Cousins, head of the catering company Compass, who died near Sydney on New Year’s Eve, had planned to leave the majority of his wealth in trust for his two sons, but they also died in the crash along with Cousins’ fiancée Emma Bowden and her 11-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>A clause in Cousins’ will said that in the event he and his sons were all killed together Oxfam should become the main beneficiary of his estate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite an <strong>unlikley</strong> event, that his whole family were tragically killed in this crash at the beginning of 2018, in a plane that had already been involved in a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f012667c-f13a-11e7-b220-857e26d1aca4">fatal crash</a>. Quite a <strong>lucky</strong> event for Oxfam since they have been having funding issues - more on that below</p>
<p>The cause of the Cousins\' crash has not been released, not that I can find it anyway. Mr Cousins was due to step down as chief boss from the company Compass, which are a UK global Catering Company, the biggest in the world. They supply schools, armies, hospitals, prisons, caterers and more - see <a href="https://www.compass-group.co.uk/meet-the-family/foodservice/">here</a>. And they seem to supply them everywhere.</p>
<p>Focus on <a href="https://www.compass-group.co.uk/meet-the-family/offshore-remote/">ESS - Eurest Support Services</a>, a Compass sub group which give the impression they provide food to oil rig workers etc but key thing to note is they provide food to -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>remote camps</strong> where thousands of workers spend significant periods of time away from their friends and family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remote camps like in Liberia where Compass/ESS <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2949017/Compass-settles-UN-bribery-cases-for-40m.html">bribed millions</a> to secure their catering deals there. They were then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_Group#Criticisms_of_Compass_Group">sued millions</a> for this illegal behaviour. They\'re also the group involved in the horsemeat scandal (if anyone from the UK remembers). Another link <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/oct/16/money.internationalnews">here</a> about the bribery to get into Liberia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compass had led an illegal conspiracy to rig the award of UN contracts worth in excess of $350m (£188m) to provide food rations to peacekeeping forces around the world that &quot;corrupted the United Nations and defrauded the UN\'s member states&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why Liberia?
Why would an already successful, global company use such illegal risky behaviour using £1m bribes, fraud and coercion to secure contracts exclusivley for Liberia?
Could it be becuase Liberia is a <strong>source</strong> and destination for human trafficking and is an easy place to smuggle children out of as explained <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258806.htm">here</a>. Note especially some of the recommendations -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict government officials complicit in trafficking offenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why the link to Oxfam?
Oxfam has shown us that when remote camps are set up in places like Haiti, child exploitation occurs. This story barely made the news in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14514905">2011 </a>when it was \'discovered\' and investiagted by Oxfam however a month after Mr Cousin\'s death in 2018, the media for some reason went crazy running the story as a huge scandal, overlooking the fact it happened years ago - only flutters of the timelines were mentioned. This was headline primetime news in the UK for weeks at the beginning of this year and I always found it strange like it was a deliberate rehashed story for some reason.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43112200">Here </a>is  good overview of the media frenzy by the BBC -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oxfam, one of the UK\'s biggest charities, has dominated the headlines in recent weeks following allegations its staff hired prostitutes while working overseas.</p>
<p>Since then, the story has continued to develop, with the Charity Commission launching a statutory inquiry - the most serious action it can take.</p>
<p>Oxfam - which has nearly 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries - denies any cover-up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact there did appear to be no cover up by Oxfam as they say, they investigated at the time, they released their findings to the press (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14514905">see again</a>) -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The charity says it uncovered the accusations in 2011 and immediately launched an internal investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cover up so to speak appears to be that the media simply did NOT adequately cover this at the time. THEY didn\'t make it into a scandal so it didn\'t become one. And then years later suddenly it was. </p>
<p>Not long after QAnon started posting and Pizzagate was showing no signs of slowing...</p>
<p>The UK government swiftly decided to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/16/oxfam-government-funding-cut-off-after-haiti-scandal">withdraw </a>funding from Oxfam which would be around £31.7million based on last years funding -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>£31.7m in taxpayer funding in 2016/17</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time, celebs linked to Oxfam withdrew their association, which would also cut Oxfam a loss. People began to boycott their charity shops and cancelled their charity payment subscriptions, stopped donating books and clothes etc. Add that to the £31.7m and we are getting closer to what would seem to be around the £41m loss that they\'ve conveniently now had donated. By Compass\' deceased CEO.</p>
<p>At this point its important to point out there is nothing to link Mr Cousins to any wrong doing - he took over Compass after the scandals of bribery in Liberia. It makes me wonder though, what did he find out while working there? How deep did their corruption go? Why did he write Oxfam into his will? He did have other family, fiance etc but his millions were to go to his sons or if both sons died at the same time as him, ALL to Oxfam. Isn\'t this a bit strange to give ALL his fortune to Oxfam? Hasn\'t it worked out quite well for Oxfam that they have effectivley now suffered no financial loss over the \'scandal\' from 2011 that was only made a scandal in 2018, after Mr Cousins\' death?</p>
<p>Is Oxfam taking some sort of damage limatation to satisfy some of the pizzagaters, who are investigating these crimes in Haiti etc? Its almost like they and the media are saying \'oh look yes they were bad, now look away\' and keep people from finding out the real truths. </p>
<p>Is a food service company a good way to get \'workers\' on the ground in countries chosen for these purposes, knowing full well what we know about the workers of Oxfam in Haiti, should we be surprised if this company is another front for networking trafficking as they have the money and the power to ensure they have their workers based in easily exploited countries when they want to be? Like what Oxfam did with Haiti.</p>
<p>Compass\' strange obsession with securing contracts in Liberia may turn out to not be child trafficking related but I can\'t rule out that something corrupt is going on here with all of these facts.</p>',

              Just very impressed with your research.  I Was also wondering if 'the swamp' were checking rich peoples Wills to see who has the provision to leave all their monies to charities, IF their whole family is wiped out - but then you have linked so many other possibilities of implications connecting his company, the 'innocent card' looks unlikely now.   👍🏻
This is all I posted: 
*What do you think? Business man Cousins was killed in a plane crash with his fiancee Emma Bowden, pilot Gareth Morgan, 2 sons Will and Edward Cousins and 11-year-old Heather Bowden-Page.
              <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/01/australian-police-name-british-family-killed-seaplane-crash/">

              </a>
              He was a Head of Compass, a catering giant company, brings to mind 'Q' saying look out for CEOs Heads of companies, to either die mysteriously, commit suicide or resign. Conveniently ALL of his family had to die to make his inheritance of £41,000,000 legally go to OXFAM Charity, the same charity that was ‘recovering’ from the sexual abuse charges in Haiti and elsewhere which were exposed recently.

              </strong>
              <br/>
              This is rather handy, I wonder if a lot of the money for the trafficking going on in Haiti is being seized and confiscated since Pres.Trump signed a Bill last Feb (I think) to enable seizure of assets and halt monies being used for people trafficking. I realise that this does not say or prove it is anything to do with trafficking at the moment, but the fact such a substantial amount of his money is going the charity that the top man resigned for sexual misconduct/exploitation needs looking into more.

            Great analysis. Being a Q devotee I appreciated Vindicators contribution as well. One of Epsteins girls in an affidavit described the fear of AIDS  by Epstein and his buddies so they only procured virgins. Might that be a universal standard for trafficking children. As for Obamas portrait, this artist always left his calling card in a painting. A single sperm which is located on Obamas left temple disquised as a blood vessel but with an obvious head and tail.

             Amazing thank you so much, lots more to look in to :-) its late so this is off the top of my head but chemicals can also be transferred through food re Qs comms about mass extinction. I will look into more who exactly the food supplies in Liberia were going to. Article said UN peacekeepers but wasn't clear if was for their consumption or distribution.

              Yeah, back in 2014 I was trading biotech stocks and saw some interesting stuff where people made a lot of money on the Ebola outbreak -- tyvek suits, masks, body bags and any pharma company working on Ebola vax research. Millions made overnight. It looked fishy as hell at the time, because suddenly Ebola in the USA!!!! Then Poof! gone. It made me look into Liberia, where I learned it was a former American colony. Dafuq? Never knew there was such a thing. Ever heard U.S. Blacks founded a colony in Africa? I never heard that, and I got bussed to a "desegregated" inner city school in second grade and had the lovely experience of being the only white kid in the entire grade while the teacher was showing
              <em>
               Roots

              on TV.

               It is too suspect. I found this link regarding Liberia and sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers. The same peacekeepers Compass provided food supplies to. Read the links down the side. I dont have time to go through them all just now but mentiones problems with child trafficking and an under-reporting of it all.

               I recall all too clearly how the American media ultra tunnel visioned onto the supposed Ebola crisis Exactly when the u.s. started bombing Syria . They'd literally fill up the entire CNN webpage etc with Ebola news, and the humanitarian crisis and messed up bombing in Syria wasn't mentioned at.all. I tried to tell people  not to worry about Ebola cuz this was always the tactic they used, and that it was all b.s., but most people wouldn't listen
