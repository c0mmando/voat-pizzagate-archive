<p>A couple accused of training children to carry out mass shootings at an &quot;extremist Muslim&quot; compound in the New Mexico desert singled out an Atlanta hospital as one target before police arrested them, according to court documents filed Friday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Taos County, citing interviews with the 11 children found at the compound earlier this month, claimed in the filing that Jany Leveille wanted to &quot;confront \'corrupt\' institutions or individuals ... and reveal the \'truth\' to these corrupt institutions or individuals.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the prosecutors, one of the children said Leveille &quot;specifically&quot; mentioned Grady Hospital as a &quot;corrupt&quot; institution. They added that Leveille &quot;expressed her displeasure with Grady Hospital ... due to treatment she and her mother received there.&quot;</p>
<p>The filing also said investigators recovered a 10-page, handwritten document entitled &quot;Phases of a Terrorist Attack&quot; from the New Mexico compound. The document includes &quot;instructions for the one-time terrorist,&quot; but it was not clear if a specific target was mentioned.</p>
<p>Authorities also said Leveille and her partner, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, &quot;would laugh and joke about dying in Jihad.&quot;</p>
<p>Prosecutors also outlined allegations that Wahhaj and his 3-year-old son, Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, left Georgia without taking medications the boy needed to treat severe health problems, including seizures that stemmed from a lack of oxygen and blood flow at birth.</p>
<p>The affidavit alleged that Leveille and Wahhaj witnessed the boy\'s seizures and knew he had a diagnosed seizure disorder but apparently gave him no medication and took no action to seek proper medical care.</p>
<p>Prosecutors quoted an extensive account of the child\'s death as written in a journal entry they attributed to Leveille, indicating that Abdul-ghani died in late December 2017 as the exhausted boy\'s heartbeat faded in and out during a religious ritual accompanied by a reading of the Koran and aimed at casting out demonic spirits.</p>
<p>The boy\'s remains were found Aug. 6 inside an underground tunnel at the compound.</p>
<p>The prosecutors filed the document as part of their appeal of a district judge\'s order that could allow at least three of the five adult defendants in the case to be released on house arrest with ankle monitors.</p>
<p>Judge Sarah Backus said the previous evidence provided by prosecutors was troubling but did not indicate any clear threat to public safety from the defendants, who have no criminal records. On Friday, prosecutors said that their new evidence proved Leveille &quot;and possibly others of the defendants may suffer from dangerous delusions ... [and] ... have history of endangering the welfare of children.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to charges of child neglect against her, Leveille also is being held on accusations by federal immigration authorities that she overstayed her non-immigrant visitor visa after arriving 20 years ago in the United States from her native Haiti. She was returned Thursday to Taos from a federal holding facility in Texas.</p>

            They'll sticky anything with the letter q but a camp where children were being trained to conduct shootings by a guy who kidnapped a kid from her mother and crossed state lines and is then, along with the rest of his group,  allowed to post bail while the fbi destroyed the crime scene is considered propaganda and flared for relevancy. lol

             There have been other people commenting about how the FBI must have known about all of this.  There has to be some kind of coverup.  When sites were calling it possible trafficking, they still did not come forward with any report. The judge that refused to grant the rightful owners of the compound the right to exchange properties, well  she is another one.  The fact that that boy has passed away since last Dec. is very strange and the FBI just sitting on that info knowing he was brought across state lines from Georgia to New Mexico.  Give me a break, they did not know the relation of the boy's father to that famous NY Imam.  SMH.

               There is a lot going on here too.  Did you hear anything about how they were planning to shoot up this hospital?  I would imagine that would be Huge News.  Nope.  But now since there is news coming out about what the kids are saying, I am hoping that someone has taken over this case that is not under control.  Possibly the FBI were watching LE in NM knowing they were compromised, and now are taking over since they saw they fumbled the whole case by missing the date.  How obvious can this get that they did that on purpose.  Duh.

             EDIT: This is Pizzagate Related in that the FBI has seemed to be covering this whole case up for some reason even when it was reported as a possible Child Trafficking Case. They had been watching this compound for weeks before discovered and they had to know that Wahhaj was the son of the Imam Wahhaj of NY who testified in the trial of the World Trade Bomber. Also now we find they have filled in the tunnels found on this compound. The FBI also did not who face at the press report which the Sheriff attended. Some of these things are covered in this article
            </p>
            <p>
             And moderator doesnt see the connection here.  I suspect he is new and does not understand or
He is simply being difficult.

              They Always fill in the tunnels.  Bulldozed and filled in tunnels in AZ.  Eyewitnesses living there came forward telling their stories on other SS platforms some even had photos!  Sadly, many who claim to believe this evil goes on still tried to refute and turned a blind eye.

             I am updating on the case.  At first we started covering it because there were 11 children involved and a 3 yr. old missing boy.  The FBI was also involved.  Many people here have posted articles regarding these people and their children.  I am not the first.

            I'm still just baffled by this. Why did they destroy evidence there, &amp; also, didn't they pour cement down into the tunnel??!? The more we read, the more it seems that the web of lies grows, sprinkled with some half-truths here &amp; there. And who's this other three-year-old??!?? Whose son is this??

              Never got your comments.  Hmm.  Yes, it is insane  So why did they do it?  I guess we won't get answers from our FBI govt. agency. They don't work for us.

             The 3 yr. old was the son of Wahhaj  and he basically just let him die.  Also the FBI dragged their feet they knew for mos. the 3 yr. old was missing.  They also refused to attend the press report with the sheriff.  There is so much that is wrong with this whole case.  You are right.  So many questions and web of lies.  But that's how it goes with Seth Rich John Ashe  Mollie Tibbetts Mollie McCauley, the list is endless.

              Ok, so there wasn't an additional three-year-old found? (Aside from Wahhaj's son) Maybe I misread.
The media is so full of cabal puppets that you don't know what to believe anymore!!
All these accounts of precious children that are discarded like old food is heart-wrenching! It's been going on forever. When will enough be enough?? ;(  I pray for all the many innocent lives taken. These monsters have no idea of God's wrath apparently..

               Yes, Sadly there was a three year old's body found on the compound. They said it would take weeks for the cornoner's results, due to his being dead since Dec.2017.  The 11 children were taken into custody and were questioned and sent to child protective services.  Yes, this is horrible.  He used some kind of  religious trickery to rid him of evil.  Without medicine and this process, I am sure it contributed heavily to his death.  Yes, it is so hard to understand how a father can have so little respect for his own son.  He was not perfect, and some parents just can't handle it.  Wrong and sad, but true.  I cant help think what that little boy must have thought.  What did I do? :(
