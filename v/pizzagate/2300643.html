            I've been reading CDAN for years, and frankly, I'm shocked that he is still not only able to continue putting out his blind items, but to really step up the attack on the sexual harassers and pedophiles in Hollywood. There is no doubt that he is or will be under intense pressure/threats to stop what he's doing, so hopefully he can stay alive long enough to help bust this thing wide open.

             I remember when he came out with the starlets going to the Mid East story years back. It sounded nutty but possible. Then Himmmm and those claims. Hollywood is seriously fucked up.

             When I was little, I did some child modelling. Nothing bad, just modeled outfits for small mail order catalogs and some outfits for sewing pattern packages. I wanted to do more but my mother always said no. I have asked her if any of the people we worked with were creeps and she said they were not. She said she wouldn't let me do anymore than what I was doing because that is where the creeps were. I have been able to track down some of the other girls I remember working with and we all turned out ok but we all stayed with small jobs. Shit we were so lucky to not have shit parents.

              you are VERY LUCKY and BLESSED to have wonderful parents. I have a few friends who model and I can't even repeat stuff they've told me about creepos. Not just the agents, managers, clients etc but fellow models who came from violent + abusive homes who are into the same dark shit we've been reading about on Voat. Its ALL TRUE. ALL OF IT. EVERYTHING YOU READ HERE IS TRUE.

               Good God.  I am sorry you have to read this stuff everyday all day and still have to see it happening in front of your eyes.  I am lucky yes, though my Dad had and still has his moments of being somewhat of an ogre.  Was and is not easy on my Mom.  But yes, as a whole I had a good upbringing and boy were they strict!   I believe it is all true.  All of it.

            "stay away from the prejudice racist bashing. " Excellent tips...the racist bashing hurt the Patriots who stood up for the Hammonds and Bundys ..protecting their ranches from govt. takeover...... The cause was just but the rhetoric was often disgusting..No matter how much you hate the libs , just remember you turn people off by attack.If we unite, we won't need a revolution..

             LMAO ITS Jews who control the media outlets who incessantly accuse you of racism you DIPSHIT.  So in effect their being Jewish is a shield, since even drawing attention to that fact is racist (the idea that they all collude to support their common interest --divide and conquer -- is dismissed outright of course LOL).  Jesus Christ you people are dumb.

              The truth of what you're saying Donkey, doesn't make it any more effective. "It's the Jews" is not going to convince anyone that needs convincing. It does, however, occupy potentially uncontrolled opposition in pointless jousting when they could be deploying their abilities in more damaging ways.

               You are desperate for literally anything besides ITS THE JEWS because you KNOW ALL CONSPIRACIES LEAD TO THE JEWS and that the gentiles WILL slaughter you in the streets when they discover what you've done.  As they absolutely should.

                Not Jewish myself, Donkey. Your obsessive projection on the topic, however, is a good indicator that you are.
               </p>
               <p>
                It reminds me strongly of PGisStupid's behavior patterns. I accidentally doxxed him by banning his new alts facetiously as "Rob Robertson frustrated pedo spam" and he denied it and then suddenly quit posting. The obsessive harping on pizzagate being dumb is so similar to your obsessive, enraged harping on Jews/Jewishness.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's fine by me, though. You can't help your heritage and it's better you vent here than on your family members.

Btw, the Jewish person that gave me that Sandwich invited me over to help Light Her Menorah.  I brought Christmas Cookies over and we had Lots of Fun.  Happy Hanukkah To All!

                       LOL only a total pedo sits on a metro for 20 minutes trying to think of anti-woman comments for Voat Pizzagate forums.

             Thanks for the link.  I am in the middle of going through this.  I already have thoughts.  Does Blake have a touch of autism?  He also may have a little bit of a mental health problem that stems from his Mother.  There also seems to be a very advantageous opportunity for his father and brother to make a lot of money here, possibly his brother after losing 1M.  Just some preliminary thoughts.

              holy jesus. This murder happened next door to Viper Room and we all know about that place. Carm, ALL directors have minor to major autism. It's what gives them that 'hyper-intelligence' that most normal people don't have. They also don't understand boundaries and often operate above the law.

              I will read more about this and post back.

            You guys ready for some really shocking news? The Hollywood Reporter ran a feature on Blake Leibel and the murder of his girlfriend. She was scalped and completely devoid of blood. The pineal gland! Adrenochrome! But the really shocking news is the comments section! Pro MAGA! In the Hollywood Reporter! Tinseltowns bible! Peeps are woke AF!

             I'm so glad you mentioned this. I pinged that story in another post hoping someone would run with it. Im no good at submissions nor do I have the time to right now. But I was thinking of the blood drinking angle. Didn't even consider the adrenochrome. I really wish some of you awesome voaters would pick it up. It was like a little bread crumb dropped right in the middle of drudge one day. Then quietly disappeared.

            I'm happy to see that they're getting traction on the CDAN website now for all the anti-pedo blinds and reveals, which didn't used to be the case. Good timing that they reverted back to the old style format of the site because many of us left in frustration after they updated the site to something unusable.

             Yeah, okay I agree but hopefully in the context you get my point. People from all kinds of backgrounds and all different political views are outraged that this(pedophilia) goes on! That rich politicians and celebrities take part in this and have gotten away with it for so long. The spin from libtards and others is that WE, the people looking into it, are all a bunch of KKK uneducated scum. It just ain't so

                   Thanks, I figured people who haven't figured it out yet wouldn't take my word for it that you're a fat lazy cunt housewife with nothing to do all day.  I suggest you take to hitting the bottle early, then the swimming pool.  LOL wait you did have a drinking problem right?  Did jeebus save you?  Do you think Jews are your brothers in Christ, and that's why you are so hopelessly naive?  NOPE it's cuz you're a woman, and one of the more retarded ones.  If your IQ is above 75 I will EAT MY HAT

               Has he not also threatened rape of me or

               as well.  If I remember correctly he has threatened me and her.  He has made some kind of threat towards me not in comments to me per say, but in commenting about me, for he hates me to the core. I don't give a Rat's Behind by the way, I have developed a Thick Skin but if he ever finds out who any of us are, I believe we will def feel threatened and will have to buy Security.  He is that much of a Real Threat. So I don't know why Voat would want that to happen, the real assault or murder of one of us would def Hit the News.  We would for sure make sure one of our members assault or death make the MSM, papers, etc. Very Bad for Voat.

                I've developed thick skin as well. Especially with him. He's mean to everyone and he's just getting worse. He doesn't even filter anymore. He's always telling me to kill myself. That shouldn't be allowed. There are a couple of us that think he is showing the Equineluvr side more now that he made new profiles and Equine isn't around. It makes sense because Equineluvr hates you and me, specifically, with a passion. I just wish he would be banned for good!

                 I want him to be banned for all the lies he tells, for that is what reaches new members and may cloud their belief.  I am now at the point though, where I believe that if he found out where you or I live, that he would not stop at taking out his aggression on us.  At this point he is Violating Stalker Laws.  I may be wrong but he has made Violent Threats.  I don't understand why he should not at least be in a  Warning Status.

                  They can't ban him for lies because of free speech. But, they should ban him for saying people should be raped, telling us to kill ourselves, etc... That shouldn't be tolerated.

                   If he is not Violating Rules, then Rules Need To Be Changed!  We must Push Hard to make changes.  We have a lot of shills on here, but he is not only a shill, He is a Serious Threat.  He really Violates Stalking Laws, imo.  What does it take for LE to charge a Citizen with Stalking?  That should be considered here.

               I have been told I cannot ban someone for threats unless they are threats that demonstrate real life plausibility. In other words, there's got to be evidence he knows where you live in real life as well. Otherwise, this is just empty words, which Voat protects if they occur in Comments.

                - thank for your response. So Voat would rather wait until something happens before taking action? Voat will have some serious liability as multiple requests have been made to ban this individual threatening to "bash my head in".

                I'm sure the attorneys would have a field day with that.

                 Not quite what I said. Requiring evidence someone has doxxed you and the threat is therefore potentially more than hot air is not the same as "waiting until something happens."

                 If  you're not a LARPFAGGOT like you project that anyone who disagrees with you is, then share with the class about that trip you took. The one in which you claim you were on the security footage.

                 Unlike you, I'm not the self loathing type. Unlike you I'm true to myself AND well liked both in IRL and here. Sounds to me like its you that needs to look inward and realize you're a disgusting piece of shit.

              You are full of shit. You delete threads that have direct connection with pedogate. You guys deleted my thread about the Catholic church in Canda raping torturing and murdering the indigenous peoples. The documentary is powerful and you gutys ripped it off in seconds every time and then banned me. Don't act like you have personal integrity. How are the kids?

            Good to feel your excitement and enthusiasm, more power to you. Channel flipping a couple hours ago, I came across some talk on Fox News, about Planned Parenthood selling fetal body parts. Some truth doors are being opened wider, and I have hope, at least at this moment.

            Which blinds has 'plot' been posting on? Can't seem to find him. Also, yeah, I think what's going on at CDCN is a lot bigger than peeps realize, even here. Hollywood is the greatest weapon US gov ever created, not that I do not love the medium, just what Look Out's  done with it.

             Dave McGowan's books are the best I have ever read on how our govt. runs hollywood,  and the music industry , Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon, Laurel Canyon..........Programmed to Kill for an understanding of serial killers...the govt. looks for mentally ill violent kids and grooms them..if this seems fantastic, remember g bush as gov. of Texas only pardoned one person. A particularly vicious serial killer.

              Thank you for mentioning Laurel Canyon.  What a Red Pill that was for me.  Yes, why do you think there are so many Missing Children from Poor Hoods?  They already have PTSD from the lives they have lived so are Perfect Material for the CIA to pull them Off the Streets.  God this is So Horrid.

             My sense is the same. I have been seriously considering stickying these. They're so nebulous, though, and not interactive from a research standpoint. I would sticky a roundup thread summarizing the most important pedo-related ones, and highlighting which have turned out to be true and which are still pending and need further research.
            </p>
            <p>
             The big problem I see is that the Hollywood pedos don't show off on social media like the DC pedos did, making it easy for us to research and document.

            I am going to Upvoat You, but you must include a link with your post and also say how it is connected to pizzagate.  You will be deleted otherwise.  Thanks for posting.  I love CDAN.
