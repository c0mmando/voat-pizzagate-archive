            Judge Moore needs to come to the table with more than denial. This just keeps getting deeper. I appreciate his denials, and they could be true, but the weight of the accusations does have some influence. OTOH: This could all be a carefully crafted hit job. Timing is so very suspect. I'm troubled by this, for several reasons.

              I remember Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Rather well.

              I remember all the way back to Richard Nixon, and now I wonder: was all this related to Nixon an elaborate hit? Sure, he supplied the bad behavior, but Clinton got away with much worse. As did LBJ, both Bushes, and so on.

              The establishment doesn't like iconoclasts. I don't know about the conspiracy issues, but this keeps happening on a much too regular basis.  The only reason they have not yet been able to do it to Trump is the little matter of 63 million votes and several billion dollars in wealth

              There's more details on his Twitter page. People are finding all kinds of inconsistencies. Allegedly, CNN's photo of the yearbook shows Roy Moore's signature started in blue ink and finished in black. Very sloppy fake. Reminds me of  Obama's birth certificate. : )

                If you look at other examples of Roy's signature, he actually signs his first name "Royl" with what looks like an "l" at the end:

                 So the signature is totally off!!!! The R is crazily not the same either! Not a trace of resemblance. Either another Roy wrote that message and that bitch tacked on the message about the Old Hickory to tie it to him, or the whole message is fake. I'm thinking it might be an old message that's been amended.

                  That's what it looks like to me, too. I suspect the original note was probably written by a woman teacher,  since men don't

                   usually
                  </em>

                   It'd be a good time for that original signer to speak up. Course it's thirty years and whoever it is might not be here to say it's their writing.

                     The only hope is that if it was a teacher, she wrote similar notes. Usually teachers did to save time thinking things up. But that script is slanting way to the right, and Moore's signature? Not so much. Then we have the add on of Hickory ... back to slanting!!!!

                      Good catch on the slant. Standard feminine script from post-WWII era, seems to me. The date and "Olde Hickory" is circa 1980 high school girl print.

                       And evidently, in the press conference, the accuser says, "RAY" not "ROY". Allred corrects her.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       One other thing, if you listen to the press conference, where the accuser reads her statement, she states that her boyfriend was supposed to pick her up, but didn't. It's why she accepted the ride with "Ray" (heheehe). Anyway, after he morphed into the Incredible Hulk and started groping her that she tried to open "MY CAR DOOR". Yes, she says "MY" as in ownership. Now why would she make that possessive? It wasn't "HER" car door, it was "RAY'S" car door. Plus, this was alleged to have happened one month before she turned sixteen so it couldn't have been 'HER" car door since she wasn't able to drive.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I'm thinking she's using any incident that happened in fabricating this one and getting confused. The heifer doesn't look too bright.

                         She says she received it around Christmas. I'm not even questioning that part, but you really give your yearbook to somebody who tried to rape you two months earlier? Not plausible. (She claims the incident happened one month before her 16th birthday and that the yearbook came one month after her 16th birthday which was in November). And her stepson has called her out to be a liar:

                    here.
                   </a>

                  <p>
                   The yearbook note is old-fashioned script. Reminds me very much of my mother's handwriting. The numerals are small and precise, unlike the date under Roy Moore's alleged signature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The script of the note is very typical of 1940's-1950's ---flowing, even, graceful capitals, small, well-formed lower case letters. However, the comma after "Love" does not match the size of the script. It's large and awkwardly placed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The signature is not the same script as the note and is not the same as samples of Roy Moore's signature found elsewhere on the internet. It's crude and ill-formed without the more sophisticated elements of Moore's real signature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The numbers of the date are fat and ugly, compared to the "1977" in the note above. The 7's in "12-22-77" even have loops on them which the 7's in the "1977" above don't have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'm also very troubled by the "D.A." which is also in an ugly print. Notice the "D" which has the same oval configuration as the "O" in Olde. Also notice the hideous lower-case "e" in "Olde". I've seen this primitive, childish font millions of times used by high school girls in the 70's and 80's.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Furthermore, notice that "Olde Hickory House" is in print, a mix of upper and lower case letters, which is a sign of a poorly educated person. The note was in cursive, but this is in print.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This is not the print of a man of Judge Moore's education and culture.

            She cried with no tears.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anybody noticed that this is an entirely different story and there''s no pattern?

            First, he molests a 14-year-old by having her manually arouse him, but he doesn't touch her. 
Next, three women say he asked them out as teens. 
One of those women said she dated him when she was seventeen and that he kissed her twice in the three months they went out. The other women agree that it was only hugging that occurred. 
Now we have someone saying he's locking doors, ripping her clothes off, all to get her to perform oral sex. Note: witness tried to cry, but there were no tears.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know. We have a man portrayed as a pedophile that dated a seventeen-year for three months and kissed her twice. Then we have the two molestation stories that aren't even close in details because the fourteen-year-old wasn't attacked.
           </p>

            Opinion? If Moore is innocent, he better put all his evidence out before the public. Even the video or recording where the bribe occurred. He also should sue WaPo immediately and not wait until another narrative is released.

             Yeah, her eyes were red, but I didn't see any actual tears.  It looked like she was daubing at nothing, and she seemed like she was reading a story someone else wrote and faking the emotions.  Why would she have to read from a script if she was recalling a memory? She could have put something in her eyes to irritate them.

              And I was thinking about the story ... picturing what happened in the car as she described it. (1) She said he locked the door. Then she says she either fell out or was pushed out?!!!! I thought the door was locked? She said he reached over her to lock the door. What? He tried to push her through the window? Through the crack in the door? (2) She said he squeezed her by her throat until she was choking and pushed her head down? WTF? How was that accomplished? The only way you'd choke is he grabbed the front of her throat which wouldn't work because you'd have to clamp around the front of the throat and pull her head down. Did she mean the back of her neck? The back of her neck is not a throat, dear idiot who falls or is pushed through locked doors (must be tiny!) And if he was pushing on the back of her neck, she wouldn't be choking because that's not her throat. (3) He was choking her by grabbing "her throat" and trying to pull her shirt off? How does that work? If you had your hand around someone's throat, the shirt wouldn't come off because your arm's in the way.

              I would love to have one of the indie journalists try to recreate what she states to show how ludicrous this is.

               Maybe, but there's been a lot of shady stuff about these accusations (not least of which being the timing) that smells strongly of an orchestrated smear campaign to steal a senate seat from a pro-Trump senator.  Again, not saying she's lying, but just because she appears to possibly be crying doesn't necessarily mean she is.  It's still "he said/she said."

            It was apparent from Moore's odd answers on Sean Hannity's show that he expected other women to come forward.

             Here's what the Alabama papers are reporting.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Gadsden locals say Moore's predatory behavior at mall, restaurants not a secret....
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
and yet people who lived in Etowah County during that time have said Moore's flirting with and dating much younger women and girls was no secret.
            </p>
            <p>
             "These stories have been going around this town for 30 years," said Blake Usry, who grew up in the area and lives in Gadsden. "Nobody could believe they hadn't come out yet."
            </p>
            <p>
             Usry, a traveling nurse, said he knew several of the girls that Moore tried to flirt with.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It's not a big secret in this town about Roy Moore," he said. "That's why it's sort of frustrating to watch" the public disbelieve the women who have come forward, he said.

            Moore was banned from the mall.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This past weekend, I spoke or messaged with more than a dozen people—including a major political figure in the state—who told me that they had heard, over the years, that Moore had been banned from the mall because he repeatedly badgered teen-age girls. Some say that they heard this at the time, others in the years since. These people include five members of the local legal community, two cops who worked in the town, several people who hung out at the mall in the early eighties, and a number of former mall employees.

              if he knew he did something wrong and the consequences of his actions were as big as they are, don't you think he could have told us a convincing lie about the accusations being false? ie, how democrats are all very good at telling lies even when its obvious they are lying (hillary). To me it seems like he was being honest and didn't want to lie but knew he made a mistake, probably he dated a 17 year old or something similar, but not anything close to rape/assult.

               Yeah, that's where I can't go all in w/ the rape stuff either, I understand the dating of (older) teenagers (of course surely he knew that would come back to bite him).
