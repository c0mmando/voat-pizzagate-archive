<p>So I was on a /pol thread from today, on the Seth Rich / Wikileaks revelations.</p>
<p>An anon there said &quot;I\'m not FBI Anon, but close.&quot; He/she then posted some extremely interesting comments regarding John Podesta and the people this anon alleges murdered Seth Rich.</p>
<p>The thread was being shilled hard with &quot;go to sleep&quot; messages / suggestions.</p>
<p>I\'ve transcribed the most important q &amp; a\'s here for us Voaters - </p>

<p>Comment by anon - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>this will be my only post on this subject, because the leaks are starting to come out.</p>
<p><strong>John Podesta uses SEIU people to do his dirty work</strong>. I am not FBI anon but close.</p>
<p>Jennifer Palmieri had Seth murdered, but Robby Mook and John Podesta found out about it and had Jennifer consult with Hillary and Huma and they all decided it was best to silence Seth.</p>
<p>Once the deed was done, Palmieri and Mook started pushing the &quot;robbery&quot; narrative and the cops in DC went along with it. <strong>The DC police chief is complicit and covering up for them. He is also a pedophile.</strong></p>
<p>If you\'d like to connect dots, look into SEIU people in DC that night, Jennifer Palmieri\'s strange &quot;Tweets&quot;, and Robby Mooks insistence that it is Russia.</p>
<p><strong>If the right people are informed in the right order, Palmieri, Mook, Podesta, Abedin and the Clinton Machine (phillippe also) will fall.</strong> Weiner is going to get immunity it looks like. SEIU murdered Seth Rich, connected to Podesta and Palmieri.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q. Do you have any data that you can give us, anon? We would love more help. Please give or tell more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. what do you want to know? it\'s hard to tell what\'s out there and what I\'ve seen /heard in my duties</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q. Do you think this information will get out?
What\'s going to happen when it does?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. it\'s been out there. That\'s why the DNC hired their own people to represent the family, they could cover up anything that popped up and keep an eye on the family in case they asked too many questions.</p>
<p><strong>Palmieri and Mook along with Podesta and Tanden are having people killed. I have no idea why Sessions is sitting on his hands.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q. DC fag here - SEIU shills are fucking all over the streets on weekends, they go after tourists as well in Georgetown 
fuck those guys</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. <strong>The older SEIU guys do the real DIRTY work</strong>, the younger ones are just useful idiots to recruit people for riots. I\'m here for another 20 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Comment included this photo - <a href="https://imgtc.com/lDkzpBU">https://imgtc.com/lDkzpBU</a> - who is this???)</p>
<p>Q. do you have any details on podesta/huma that isn\'t commonly known?</p>
<p>Anon posted this image of JP &amp; Robby Mook (note JP\'s red string Kabbalah bracelet) - <a href="https://imgtc.com/PrzfIo0">https://imgtc.com/PrzfIo0</a> then comments - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. he\'s friends with the entire clinton cabinet and even hangs out at comet ping pong</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q. Going through JP twitter but found nothing on the day Rich was killed, also couple of days before and after. What time frame should we look into?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. Image - Podesta bus - <a href="https://imgtc.com/1PEA5AG">https://imgtc.com/1PEA5AG</a>  there you go... look into SEIU hangouts around where Seth was murdered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment - 
he\'s nobody
don\'t worry about him
go to sleep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. <strong>ya think you\'re hot shit, dontcha?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q. do you have any details on podesta/huma that isn\'t commonly known?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. yeah Tony and Johnn Podesta\'s mother <strong>bought over 25 child slaves</strong> who were used and abused by the Podesta bros and their friends, then dumped/sold/killed. Their insanity goes WAY back. </p>
<p><strong>The mother procured kids for Bill while Podesta worked for him</strong>, which is how he got so high up so fast. As for Huma... I mean where would someone start? It\'s all out there. Huma</p>
<p>A. <strong>he\'s also missing his top teeth so sometimes he puts in sharp teeth and uses them to bite children. Pictures and videos exist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q. Anon, this sounds way over the top. It\'s too over the top for anyone to believe without super solid evidence, like they had on John Wayne Gacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. <strong>there\'s info sprinkled out there, and DC pedos all called her mama podesta</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anon also posted this photo of Podesta and Steven Colbert, bff
<a href="https://imgtc.com/fcCkHw2">https://imgtc.com/fcCkHw2</a></p>
<p>Q. please give us some more info. are they part of a cult? how did they get started on this crazy fucked up shit?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. The cult they\'re in is some sort of <strong>Thelemic</strong> bullshit. <strong>Ordo Templi Orientis</strong>, or some <strong>even darker derivative</strong>. Largely based on <strong>Kabballah</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>I don\'t know if this anon is legit or not, however they seemed sane at least. Some questions about their comments come to mind -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why post the photo of the bus? When was this photo sent in relation to the date of Seth Rich\' murder?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are the names on the bus photo relevant? Are they connected to  SEIU?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what about the people allegedly implicated in SR\'s murder? (First post)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what\'s out there on Mama Podesta?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what about these alleged false teeth photos and videos? Could this be what is on Weiner\'s laptop?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what of the mention AGAIN of The PG gang and Thelema? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why did Anon post &quot;ya think you\'re hot shit, dontcha?&quot; ??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who are the 3 people in the photo from the comment mentioning the older guys of SEIU &quot;doing the REAL dirty work&quot;? </p>
</li>
</ul>

           So I was on a /pol thread from today, on the Seth Rich / Wikileaks revelations.

          <p>
           An anon there said "I'm not FBI Anon, but close." He/she then posted some extremely interesting comments regarding John Podesta and the people this anon alleges murdered Seth Rich.
          </p>
          <p>
           The thread was being shilled hard with "go to sleep" messages / suggestions.

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            this will be my only post on this subject, because the leaks are starting to come out.

            <strong>
             John Podesta uses SEIU people to do his dirty work
            </strong>
            . I am not FBI anon but close.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Once the deed was done, Palmieri and Mook started pushing the "robbery" narrative and the cops in DC went along with it.
            <strong>
             The DC police chief is complicit and covering up for them. He is also a pedophile.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            If you'd like to connect dots, look into SEIU people in DC that night, Jennifer Palmieri's strange "Tweets", and Robby Mooks insistence that it is Russia.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             If the right people are informed in the right order, Palmieri, Mook, Podesta, Abedin and the Clinton Machine (phillippe also) will fall.

            Weiner is going to get immunity it looks like. SEIU murdered Seth Rich, connected to Podesta and Palmieri.

            I have my theory about the Duponts.  Inbreeding. They are all so focused on themselves they think breeding with the lower classes is disgusting and I also think their are pedophiles in the mix as well.  Maybe not all but some.  I have no respect for the well heeled.

            I found this the oddest interview last June when Seth died: Plus months later and pizzagate has emerged, what the hell is the interview doing in a DISNEY STUDIO, and why is the mom holding a NEW PANDA (cumpanda?, its obviously not HIS bear, like the Maddie McCann cuddle cat, it looks brand new and I am sure they would not use this in a video related to a grown man anyway?). Things we were not aware of prior to pizzagate, is it a message to pizzagate whistleblowers?

            (archive.is could not save playback for this video) - His parents at the time, seem sort of emotionless? After the death of their son they seemed passionless in finding out who killed their son, OR they were PAID OFF! Maybe they are Killary Supporters, even to the detriment of their son. AND it looks like his 'brother' is smirking all the way through this short interview, that they even had to zoom the camera to cut him out of the picture. This is all extremely ODD!  Extra:

            What a fantastic post, thank you for this, going to look into some of the points see any further info.  Keep up the good work!!   BTW re Comey &amp; memos:This is all DISTRACTION to take the PUBLIC EYES OFF WIKILEAKS Seth Rich again! EXACTLY LIKE THE  Comey: 'I have more emails on Hillary Clinton" just a week before elections, then: 'OH THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE', when Wikileaks released IMPORTANT NEWS LAST TIME. Plus they DO NOT CARE HOW STUPID THEY LOOK AS LONG AS THEY GET THE ATTENTION OFF ANY NEW REVELATIONS OF CORRUPTION! in my opinion.
Comey new he was going when President Trump got in, and was planning this RUBBISH all along for the day he was ousted!

             Thank you Trisha for your encouragement and support, and yes, I'm with you there on Comey being a distraction. Absolutely. Anything they have they'll use i believe, if not they'll create something.

            , be careful. Be paranoid. Cover your tracks. Let someone you trust know where you're going, what you're doing. Create your own deadman switches-- they don't have to be elaborate. For instance, I have friends scattered around the country who have flash drives of mine in their safety deposit boxes. If something, anything happens to me-- no matter the circumstances, they're going to blast that shit out into the world. Do something like that if you start gathering evidence.

            When Seth Rich was murdered (July 2016) the police chief of DC was Cathy Lynn Lanier (female).  OP refers to the police chief as "he".  The current police chief is male, but was not appointed chief of police until August 2016.  Timelines don't seem to add up.

             Interesting point and great find. So the current chief took over just 4 weeks after the "robbery". I wonder if there's any information out there on why Cathy Lynn Lanier was replaced?

            I read this thread when it was live. Mindblowing stuff.  Thanks for posting.  The detail that blew me away was the part about Podesta wearing false sharpened teeth when he engages in torture of children.

           <p>
            <em>
             Podesta has more of a snake's head with the beady eyes and flicking tongue although he looks a lot like someone who has no teeth. Toothless people flick their tongue like that when they talk. But, maybe it's just a lying thing considering these two are both lying donkeys...

             So good that you're digging on this subject, wouldn't it be great if we could find a real quote or something from a journalist who knows for example? This one you found is interesting. Was it in a forum? Could you post a link for prosperity? Thanks for looking into the 'denture' lead for us!

             Yes, exactly. I was wondering about the signifigance of the insider Anon posting it in that thread. The info he gave was imo cherry picked and very well thought out. As someone here mentioned, was this his way of telling us that it is indeed JP in the video? And, possibly, his way of letting the shills know he knew these were JP shills?  Food for thought.  Why chose to post this phrase?

             Yes. They definitely add to his sinister smile. His large incisors I've noticed before this, and if unnatural, it appears that he doesn't have a very good denture designer. Unless they're designed this way on purpose?

              I sure wouldn't put it past him to have somehow created these 'natural looking vampire teeth'. People comment that they never see him smile with his teeth showing - he tries to hide his fangs, either from embarrassment, or because he feels guilty. I keep thinking about how their religion likes to hide things in plain sight. So to have this kind of evil adornment right in the front of your face must be a real turn on for him and other evil people.

               I'm with you on this 100%. As you say, they like to flaunt their preferences. Michael Aquino comes to mind here with his eyebrows styled in Baphomet horns, Marina Abramovic with her witchy and Whore of Babylon image.... JP with his teeth. He's not short of cash, so surely if he was embarrassed he could easily get those incisors pulled and replaced with a couple of porcelain implants. It seems there's more going on, as you mention.

            ! This is all so very interesting. I wonder if there is a way to tell if Podesta really doesn't have upper teeth. That would help prove the legitimacy of the insider Anon. Also the Mama Podesta "child slave adoption" claims are very interesting. This could open up an entire new can of worms...

             Thank you, YYM. And yes, it seems people will be looking into JP's teeth now. Hopefully something is found. The slave adoption claims are incredible too. So many leads to research here.

            I can't believe we can not find anything about these 25 people adopted by mama Podesta. This should be a top priority. I always assumed the 25 adopted people were the pedo brothers friends that were always over for dinner and Satan worship shit. Finding out who these 25 are could create leads that could break the case. Hell I'll take just one name

             I believe he's posting his personal photos, but may be wrong. If you've time to look at the original thread and his comments, you'll maybe get this feeling too. May be why they're not appearing anywhere else.

               posted a verrrry interesting find about the t-shirt this lady is wearing in this thread, it connects her to a child trafficking org. Maybe you could take a look at that comment. It seems important. Thanks Trisha and GG !

            Precisely this.

           <p>
            What is Kabbalah but
            <em>
             ancient technology?
            </em>
            The fuckin' soul-drinkers are the only ones using it at the moment, and that tends to skeeze people out a bit.  Shouldn't, though.  Magick is real, my friends.  You have seen it with your own eyes.  You are
            <em>
             doing it
            </em>
            every moment of every day, without even trying.  We, as human beings, can grab hold of the same tools the vampires are using, and we can use them to do
            <em>
             incredible shit
            </em>
            .  We can remake the world, without the vampires in it.

              Kabbalah, like all other magical systems (like, for example, the Tarot), offers a symbolic map of the subconsciousness, or rather, a blueprint that can be used to explore the subconsciousness. And if you start exploring your subconsciousness methodically, dilligently and courageously, you will discover that the deeper you dare go, the more you will find that you "share" the deeper layers of your subconsciousness with other people, other beings, animals, plants, the rest of creation, and, indeed, God.
             </p>
             <p>
              This journey can be a harrowing one, because the more you discover your "connectedness" with creation, the less "you" remains. You will discover that the narcissistic illusion of Self, also known as the ego, is nothing but a highly subjective and localized here/now interpretation of this universal consciousness. You don't exist. You are God, experiencing Himself subjectively, because His existence is just as big of a tantalizing riddle to Him as our existence is to us. To people who think highly and fondly of themselves, this is a very unwelcome realization indeed.
             </p>
             <p>
              The map the Kabbalah has to offer is considered to be very detailed and precise. The Kabbalah shows how creation is dualistic, symmetrical and recursive, how creation is governed by the laws of change and how these laws operate similarly on levels of creation. This knowledge can then be used to pick apart your illusion of reality; to work out how your experience of reality is cooked up by your brain and your nervous system, and how it is constantly affected by your own thoughts, beliefs and convictions. Then you will find how this illusion of reality functions on a larger scale; how consensus reality is created and experienced by large groups of people.
             </p>
             <p>
              And by learning and experiencing how it all fits together and how it all functions, you can then try and develop strategies by which to succesfully "alter" the experience of reality, using the Kabbalah as a kind of toolbox. That is what magic is all about: making a conscious and methodical effort to willfully change your experience of reality. Magic is basically the Science and Art of the Free Will. Because we all have free will, but we hardly ever use it.

            the teeth makes sense. if he is a sadistic paedophile which i think we all agree he just may be judging from the joy he takes in killing pigs in cold blood then biting must be one of his paraphilias -  Odaxelagnia is a paraphilia involving sexual arousal through biting. the 25 children his mother purchased for john and tony's enjoyment makes sense too i couldnt figure out why they would foster so many children and none of those foster children have come forward. this is what happens when a woman enables paedophiles. children get hurt.

            The sculpture is of a man, definitely not any "alma mater", let alone Columbia's. Have you ever been there? If so you would not have misidentified it so.

           <p>
            Here is the alma mater statue in front of Columbia's Lowe Library (which is not used as a library anymore either):

               It appears from the mayor's photos that it was taken in Columbus.  So I wanted to check with you as you seemed sure it was taken in DC.

                (b) In NotFBIAnon's photo Ms. Jones is wearing a blue shirt with the word "Columbus" and the logo "SWC" on it. This and her bracelet suggest she is a VIP at the Stonewall Columbus Pride Festival 2016.

               <p>
                (c) The man in the pink shirt is Columbus mayor Andrew Ginther. He can be identified from a photo in a slide show of the Columbus pride Parade in which he is wearing the same shirt:

                I have never been to Columbus, but that woman is definitely the same one, and it is most certainly not in NYC, as someone on the older post said. The older post also showed the DC parade route and I checked it on Google maps in DC.

                The photos in the Columbus article do not show much background.

                   Now on the dig for Andrew Ginther, mayor of Columbus and the pink shirted man in the threesome photo. May be he's connected with SEIU, 32BJ &amp; Donna Brazille ?

                      I will have a look.
Thanks for telling me about it. 
I wonder that there is still so much on Seth Rich that is not pizzagate related, but is on the the front page of VOAT pizzagate anyway--even stuff like 'Hannity might get fired'--it's hardly what I would call research.Thanks again.

            Not sure if this story from the Washington Post has been circulated or not, but its from 2007 and talks about Mama Podestas Pasta Cooking for elite democratic senators.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/11/AR2007031101494.html">
             http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/11/AR2007031101494.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "You almost had to see it," Senator Leahy said. "[mama podesta] would have members of Congress, Cabinet officers, people in high public office and a neighbor just dropping by, and she was holding court. She was the center."
           </p>
           <p>
            If mama podesta was pimping out her 25 adopted children, then this article sure does make sense at why congressmen, cabinet officers, and high public officials where always dropping by for some pasta.

             That would explain a lot of iconography in Tony Podesta's collection.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Serbian connection with Biljana Djurdjevic (who did the series that depicts groups of children in what looks like the DC Underground). Before this series, she painted her pool/tiled scenes with rectangular tiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Were these painted from memory of the artist (a little girl from Kosovo in 1993)? Djurdjevic is from a region that had its childen pillaged by the plane load destined for America during the war. Yet, she got a guest teacher spot for 2 years at a prestigious art school (Parsons in NYC) despite not even having a Wikipedia entry to her name.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other possibility would be that this series was painted from souvenir photos by her patrons (Podestas) who had full access to the tunnels (access which has been maintained by one or more people related to Pizzagate since the Clinton presidency).
            </p>
            <p>
             If this was a TV show or a movie, the police would be all over this case... But it's not, so all these sus activties are excused away as normal privileges of the wealthy and connected.
            </p>
            <p>
             P.S.: I personally think that Mama Podesta befirended a lot of young DCites and hosted Salons which is what DC socialites do to gather gossip.

              as far as those tiles go, it has been pointed out often before that coincidentally, they match exactly to almost exactly the tiles in the stairwells and underground train area under CPP.

                 The food court (abandoned Pizza Express) food court section has green tiles. Accent tiles are low to the ground, I did not see patterns created with these tiles unlike what is seen in the painting of the strung up boy (which also features the black cables).

                <li>
                 In the series, there is a painting that features a bench. This bench is anchored into the wall, it has no legs supporting it. This is the exact kind of seating which is seen in the DC Underground.

                 Some of the reports on size say that the tunnel extends 30,000 feet from Dupont Circle up Connecticut Ave towards the corner of Nebraska in N.W. Washington D.C.

                This is about how it was being used in the 1990's, not really about who manages it today, although that yields a lot of modern #pizzagate connections (because pizzagate is everything LOL)

                At this time I have tons of screenshots as this was my initial interest into the case. But I do not have the talent to make a sleek video expose like those Youtubers :)

                 Awesome! Thank you for this! Your info is amazing, and the Dupont Tunnels really should be re-visited imo. What do you think?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Have you archived and posted all your screenshots at all? If not, I could help you to? To see them all in a post alongside Biljana Djurdjevic's paintings of similar would be incredible, if there's not one already here.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm on a slow connection so can't access the videos atm, but have saved your post for later. Maybe they show the similarities.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you have time, would you be interested in creating a mega-thread about the tunnels at all? I could also help if required. It would be a case of gathering all the research available, archiving it all and putting it together in a report / thread. Let me know what you think ?

                  The thing with tunnels is that there are a gazillion tunnels in Washington D.C. but the MSM did a good job of making people think that one would be crazy gun toting moron to believe in underground tunnels in D.C. :)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Yeah, I would love to collaborate on a megathread and video. I have gigabytes of historical info on pizzagate so the problem is mostly finding the files on my archived and encrypted backups. But I am also on deadline right now.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I can't archive the videos. I would love to have the video files from art collectives about the underground. I include in this the crongressional transport system which is still in operation today. I would like to find out if there is print material available at the library of congress about this. Also the White House has a section on tunnels so it's interesting what kind of transparency the Obama admin was looking to expand by comparing published info with what we suspect, or what is abandoned and kept secret.

            I don't believe those are Kabbalah "red strings" in the image...they look more like event bracelets.
I'm NOT saying that they aren't Kabbalists at all. I'm just going off the image provided above:

            .  It's from 2014 midterm but it is eye opening that over 140mil was given to a list that included the "CLINTON FOUNDATION" I also saw "MEDIA MATTERS " as well. Worth a look-see!

              Yeppers, It seems also in reading the 4 page conference and the speakers (names) attending, this whole agenda reeks.  I just got through reading
              <a href="https://medium.com/deepconnections/media-as-a-shaping-agent-of-society-wherefore-art-thou-treacherous-62b4c3f843d6">
               "Deep Connections, wherefore-art-thou Treacherous"
              </a>
              Which everyone of us "SHOULD" take a look at... It spells out just what all of us as citizens and especially researchers are encountering and as I truly believe that "To be FOR-WARNED is to be "FOR-ARMED" Wish there was some way to make it a sub, but I know the PC mod control would kick it to the curb.

               Thanks for this MysticMa. Do you mean make a post / thread with the info? If you connect it to PG (possible now thorough this post), it would stick. You could say, NotFBIAnon has leaked information that SEIU and John Podesta were involved in the death of Seth Rich, this relates to Pizzagate as a possible direct lead.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would love to see what you've mentioned above as a thread. It seems very important,

            You know for the heck of it I looked up where the SEIU HQ is in DC and it is right next to the Dupont Circle which means right near those tunnels too.  Seth was at Lou's City Bar and said he was going to the Wonderland Bar but they said he never showed up.

            SWC supports community-based initiatives that address 
trafficking in women and children.  In 2004, SWC funded a 
number of initiatives: an ongoing action-research by the 
Comite de recherece-action sur le trafic sexuel des femmes au Quebec on the realities of sex trafficking of women and 
children to develop policies and programs, and to support the victims; an environmental scan and recommendations for action on trafficking by local groups in Alberta; a project by the Philippine Women Center of British Columbia that examined the linkages among health, immigration, labor, equality, and human rights policies through the experience of prostituted and trafficked Filipino women; the completion of a two-year project by the Canadian Council for Refugees to develop awareness among refugee-serving organizations, women's groups, labor organizations, police, academics and policy-makers as a first step to encouraging collaborative community action to protect trafficked women and girls and to eradicate forced labor.

            Found this little jewel.  It sounds like a must-see documentary.  Anybody want to look for it? Article dated 1/24/16.

              ‘Weiner’: Hillary Clinton Advisor Philippe Reines Is the Puppet Master in Explosive Documentary
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The all-access documentary, screening at Sundance, chronicles Anthony Weiner’s disastrous 2013 campaign for mayor of New York—warts and all.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the film contains precious few direct references to Hillary Clinton, there are some Clinton-related sequences in the latter part of the film that may catch GOP spin doctors’ eyes.When the wheels begin to fall off of Weiner’s 2013 mayoral campaign in the wake of yet another sexting scandal (full frontal this time, ugh), Abedin is captured—through a series of surreptitious phone calls—taking orders from Hillary Clinton’s right-hand man (and ex-deputy assistant secretary of state), Philippe Reines.

           </p>
           <p>
            It likely will be somewhere on this parade route.

            This photo was taken at the 2016 Pride Parade.  The red headed woman has on a "2016 Pride VIP" bracelet.  And some other kind of bracelet pass.  There is a band standing behind her...was this some kind of concert event too?
           </p>
           <p>
            First, identify the location.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, find out what event is occurring in the background. What does the bracelet passes entitle her to? This will further narrow down your search.
           </p>
           <p>
            Third, go to your social media, and upload the pic and see if there are any suggested tags (facial recognition software embedded in FB and such).
           </p>
           <p>
            Fourth, go to the Washington Life or other DC Style magazines or websites, and search back issues for photos taken for that event.  If these folks are nameable, then somebody has tagged their name with their picture. These folks haven't been hiding.  But they might now. And they will start locking down their media.  So time is of the essence.

            Hello, just wanted to answer one of the questions OP asked at the end of the post: "ya think you're hot shit, don't ya?" can be heard in the Fatherhood video. It seems Anon is subtly confirming it's indeed JP in the video, and perhaps suggesting that it's his people out on 4chan trying to silence whistleblowers with the creepy "go to sleep" threats. 
Hope this helps. Thanks for posting OP.

             i dont care what anybody says.... that is definately john podesta in the fatherhood video.... he can spin as much propaganda as he likes on social media to refute it but i know what his voice sounds like and thats him and torturing children is part of his m.o. it all makes sense. not that anything will ever be done about it though

              For your own safety, if you don't already know how to do it, you need to learn how to cast a circle
              <em>
               right now
              </em>
              .  If you can hear his voice in your head, your mind is like a computer server with open ports, and you need to firewall that shit
              <em>
               stat
              </em>
              if you'd prefer him not to come back.  Some of their magick can propagate via the spoken word, like a mental virus; so I would strongly encourage you to get some AV going.  A circle will help with that.
             </p>
             <p>
              This doesn't need to be anything fancy.  You don't even really need to put much stock in it.  As long as some small part of you believes that it will work, then it'll work.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look up a basic circle ritual for the details, but in brief, what you're going to do is sweep clean a room in your house where you won't be disturbed, then purify the area with a ring of salt, a ring of water droplets flicked from the blade of a knife, a ring of smoke from some incense, and a ring of fire from a red candle. Then you're going to call four beneficent entities from whatever religion or tradition suits you (the prayer of calling will be in the source material), and ask Them to stand guard at the four cardinal points.  After you've done that, you're going to sit in the middle of the circle and meditate for about 15-20 minutes.  After that, you're going to release the four Guardians, ground the energy from the circle (again, look up a ritual for the details), and you're going to sweep away the ring of salt.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're going to do this every day for at least a week.  Once you've hardened your mental defenses, it will be more difficult for the
              <em>
               akhkharu
              </em>
              to use the Voice on you.

               Actually, free will is always in operation.  you don't need a circle or special words, or to even do it frequently.  All of the helps and reinforces, but is not per se necessary.   Just firmly think or say, NO ONE HAS ACCESS to me, my brain, body or soul.  In any way.  I am an independant being and I say NO to any trespess. - stuff like that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Spiritual law is such that no one may trespass when uninvited.  Fear and terror can open the mental and spiritual/soul doors of the innocent, naive, mislead, confused, curious, etc
              </p>
              <p>
               1) This is why for example in the Alefantis film "Chapel Perilous", the "salesman/devil" has to ultimately get the hapless homeowner to give his permission for him to come inside, stay and make his seduction presentation.   It is what almost the whole film is about - overcoming the objections of the free will.
               <br/>
               2) This is what giving warnings or presenting consequences beforehand that is sometimes discussed in relation to the Illuminati is about - if the society or the individual accepts what is declared, entrained or asserted, then the Illuminati can do as they please (for example - "we are going to kill millions of you, to save the earth's ecology, and you can't escape."  Uh, no you are not, that's not our fate, and we are going to fight you and win, and still make sure the earth is clean.)
               <br/>
               3).  Same is true with a Oiuja board - yes I have had occassion to try one out.  As soon as you just say aloud, "this session is going to be ONLY for the highest good for all concerned, NOTHING NEGATIVE may operate here on me or anyone else and everyone here agrees with this" and voila!  you never have one of those weird incidents where the thing flys around and spooks everybody.  I once new a girl that bragged about how crazy the Oiuja board went with her every time.  I said ok, but I have to say my statement before we do it.  I did and the thing just sat there.  I could tell she was actually a little freaked out that nothing was happening at all.  Ha.   Moral of the story - God gives every one of us the ability to stop mental and spiritual trespass, whether you believe in him or not.  Use it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not giving permission and stopping possession or any overstepping of boundaries is easy, but one has to believe they can stop it with their will.  And calling on the aid of a preferred deity is usefull too.  You don't have to be a Christian to call on the aid of Jesus or God.  If you are agnostic or athiest but believe there is something like a soul, or spirit, then call on your guides to help you, or take a chance and call on angels.   If you truly can't find faith in anything that is not directly provable in terms of spirit or soul, then you are a hardcore materialist and I still say believe in your own inviolable free will and good luck.

                  Actually this is where we can all unify I have been saying it for 20 years. String theory shows that thoughts are indeed energy which is mass which is concrete which comes from the Ethereal world into the material world. What, with the planck length and potentially 33 dimensions, no doubt about the power of thoughts. Light is "information" and small quantas of it....but, particle physics has been greatly enhanced by the discovery of the Higgs bozon,   Which again keeps general relativity in place, i.e. including string theory, which again proves that we are all connected and the world is expensive and abundant and positive leads to positive, which is why  our revolution needs to be a nonviolent one. Otherwise we become the monsters we are hunting. Einstein science without religion is lame but religion without science is blind!

                  That's because most folk have a mistaken impression of what magick actually is.  They think it's all parlor tricks and love charms and whatnot.
                  <em>
                   No, nigga
                  </em>
                  .  This is for real.  This shit can
                  <em>
                   kill you
                  </em>
                  , very easily--or worse--if you don't know what you're doing.

                   One of the best books I ever read - google "The Magic of Zen"  Inez Stein on amazon, this forum doesn't allow amazon links.  It is not about magical practices of zen wizards or being zen when doing magic tricks.  it is also not just about practicing zen, the author has a full understanding of magick.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It basically talks about the underlying principles of magick and how they are very similar to zen teachings - calm mind, focused will, right actions, manifestation.  I believe that eventualy you get to where you realize rituals and objects are ultimately about focusing and bolstering the mind and will.  Some level of that can be usefull, but all that OTO stuff just starts to look more like OCD (obsessive compulsive) ha ha.  You can do everything without the stuff and pomp and circumstance, practicing the open hand way.  Prayer as is practiced in Christianity can be quite similar as well.

             I read somewhere the reason the shills tell them to go to sleep, go to bed, etc., is suggestive comments that suddenly makes the autists sleepy and tired and start yawning,etc. Of course, doesn't seem to deter the 4chan autists for staying up all night.

             It is like a joke to them.  Like when Jimmy Saville was around all of those kids.  The people "in the know" must have found that quite amusing.  It is funny to them to see how stupid people are.

              Well it won't be funny when all this blows up and their covers are blown.  Especially the ones with the Title of Sir. There must be a list.  Cliff Richards, Paul McCartney, Elton John, Tom Jones, Mick Jagger, Sean Connery, Bono, Jimmy Saville, etc.  David Bowie turned it down as I remember.

             ... when that shit started hitting on a really deep Reddits/Chans back in November... seeing it come in nearly-live stream, was really fucking creepy.
            </p>
            <p>
             I remember on at least 2 occasions, it came in super frequently and then the OP just stopped everything without warning (I think one was the steganography image files ((the one with the owl/flag... the ancient order symbols in the images?)) and the other was around the CPP PW protected pages). Feels so much like a paranoia/psyop technique, but, could you imagine???
            </p>
            <p>
             Stumbling onto something really ground breaking and watching your posts get flooded with "Go to sleep, you are getting tired, this is a waste of your time"... and then someone kicks in your fucking door and you just get disappeared? That would be a great movie. If the main character got out, but told the entire story of these leaks through the film narrative.

              , were those the actual words, "go to sleep" AND "you're getting tired," etc... wow! Because think about it, who says that in retaliation to anything when you're pissed or whatever!?? No one says "go to sleep, you're tired." Definite psyops.

                I remember making a post about NASA announcing there's 87 bajillion new inhabitle planets or something ridiculous like that and it got blatantly shilled out of existence. Not sure if you remember everyone here suggesting that they'll drop some "newly discovered planets" and other space discovery stuff to distract from pizzagate, and they did it right on cue. But not only did it receive instant downvotes and over the top comments like "Oh c'mon, you're making us all look insane!" and "Mods, delete this! This is so ridiculous it's insanity!", but it was swiftly deleted by the mods.

                I read it earlier this morning and when I finally got the the part where the person talks about sleep it became so obvious because it wasn't just once but several times and the person posting would even say that he was tired. Just anything to use the words tired and sleepy. Talk about NLP, wow!
               </p>
               <p>
                The funny part is I began to yawn and I was like "ok, am I really tired or is it working on me too???" Lol

             Kabballah has been discussed here on Voat, in YouTube videos, and on other forums.

            <p>
             The Kabbalah info does not make this "Anon" legit.

              The info about Mama Podesta and 25 child slaves completely de-legitimizes it in my opinion. That was a reference to an article about how she cooked for many Dems during elections ...

            Great Post.  Thanks.  The link with Podesta and Brock is actually Podesta and Steven Colbert possibly another Pedo.  Why do you think Podesta helped bank roll Colbert's sister's campaign in SC.  Yes could be a Pedo. Pretty cozy aren't they?

              :-)  It has occurred to me that Podesta may be his handler.  It is just a suspicion of mine.  Colbert is slimy, in my book.  I liked him for a short while, and then it seemed like his brain was playing backwards.

             I've found important information including but not limited to property owned by Podestas that I am trying like hell to connect them to JP, TP &amp; their Mom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Property, companies (in names of other Podestas) are ideal places to hide kids, money launder, etc. Many of the properties are farming/agriculture land...others are worth $$$.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's amazing that when you search an average person, you get parents names, siblings, other possible relatives, but NADA w/ these other Podestas. It's as if they just changed their last names to Podesta &amp; assumed identities of sons &amp; daughters of Mary...
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone have any idea how to bridge that information gap??

              None. I worked for a government contractor and had a clean profile on the internet. Others may have some idea, but when they use the term "scrubbed" they fucking mean it.

              IMHO, I don't think they are all gone...there are A LOT of Podestas out there that have a TREMENDOUS amount of property (commercial &amp; residential), businesses &amp; money!
             </p>
             <p>
              As I stated elsewhere in this post, I have hit a DEAD END trying to tie them to JP, TP or their Mom (Mary).
             </p>
             <p>
              HOWEVER, I would bet everything I own that most, if not all were adopted by Mary (w/ Podesta last name) &amp; are tied into this (as Pedos themselves &amp; $ laundering).
             </p>
             <p>
              These properties (many agriculture &amp; farm land w/ unlimited places to hide kids) are abundant, million $ properties all over west/mid US (didn't focus on East Coast @ all).
             </p>
             <p>
              They run sketchy businesses that could easily be fronts for $ laundering &amp; these Podestas are VERY well off!
             </p>
             <p>
              It wouldn't surprise me at all if John &amp;/or Tony are funneling monies to these 'siblings' which is easy to do for these POS crooks!
             </p>
             <p>
              Connecting these brothers/sisters would be a YUGE nail in the Podestas criminal coffin! I just wish I knew someone or had $ to run background checks on these other Podestas.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are 8 Podestas in particular, + 6 spouses, that if we could run background checks, it would be AMAZING! To start out, even if we could run background checks on 2 - 4, that could be the string that, if pulled, would expose A LOT!
             </p>
             <p>
              If someone has ability/funds to run full background checks, let me know....Thanks!

              When this info came out a while ago someone said they found out the 25 people adopted were adults, which is actually even a little more weird, they had some sources like an article from around that time.  Now days there is so much disinfo I don't know what's the facts here.

             Interesting. If there are actual adoption records (though I doubt it) then if there are not death certificates for them (and probably not) then it's possible they could be reported as missing persons. That might generate some interest among the masses.

              Dude... brilliant. Names, background checks, etc. I wish it was a little easier to dig into stuff like this. If true, how would these 25 brothers/sisters go completely off the grid for decades when related to such a powerful duo?

               My guess is that they were never on the grid to begin with. As in, imported like produce from another country and/or bought from mothers who didn't want them and preferred cash over their own baby. We know they like them especially young so it wouldn't raise eyebrows if they kept the kids out of view as much as possible and if anyone asked questions, they could have claimed the kids were being home schooled. They were probably dead before they even reached junior high. No death certificates because no doctor or authority would have been alerted that the kids were murdered. But for investigative purposes, that could be a good thing as there won't be an official explanation of death. The trick will be to prove the children existed in the first place (especially since they probably didn't have birth certificates) and with descriptions as well as solid eye witness testimony. Add to the challenge is all the years since the time this occurred. However, it can be done. And even if a conclusive case isn't built, collecting enough circumstantial evidence to establish the opposite of reasonable doubt might be enough to shine some light into the dark places.

                 Exactly. Personal recollections would be an excellent start. Preferably, in person interviews to put the witnesses at ease. I'd start with neighbors. Lots of old families in the areas surrounding Chicago. Houses sometimes pass from one generation to the next, so the stories of the Podestas may have as well. If Grandma has passed on, the kids might remember the stories she told of "those wild Podestas and their 25 kids" or whatever. Also, that's a lot of kids to feed. I don't know what neighborhood they were in, but a lot of them still have little corner grocery stores. Maybe the owners or their kids remember when the Podesta crew used to come in shopping. People generally want to help, so a witness might offer several other names to contact, and each of those might recommend several more. Pretty soon, you have a wide net cast.

                  Get this! I found out that Podesta worked at a now non-existent college that's only 5 mins from where I live! I've posted this before but a few years ago there were a series of teenage suicides by train. The town is very old money. And someone said that Epstein was spotted at the train station a few years ago. A small world!!
