            Things are much darker with Polanski. His wife, pregnant Sharon Tate was murdered in a ritual sacrifice by the Manson Family. Was Polanski in on it?!!!

            Brett Ratner and Chris Tucker also worked with Polanski, Tennis player Serena Williams and Brett Ratner were a couple, Charlie Sheen was said to be part of their social circle, Serena Williams broke up with Brett Rather on facebook and hooks up with the reddit co-founder...later reddit website censors pizzagate... Armenian middleeast German Co-founder of Reddit &amp; Serena Williams are a couple. Spacey/Ratner/Weinstein Polanski, Woody Allen etc have abused people, raped people, it seems some were minors, under age or even children...Ratner has worked directly with Polanski, all these people are connected with world business and global political elites, Serena Williams and Ratner are also elites themselves.

            A woman named Diana Jenkins. Doubt you know her, but she's the Rosetta Stone of every scandal and perversion from Hwood all over the globe. She's an Uber-wealthy divorcee whose hubby ran UK's Barclay's bank - and she ran the Arab investors for the bank! She's been running a high class call girl/party-girl ring for Arabs, Wall Street, DC, Royals, and Hollywood elites. She's also a MAJOR philanthropist, arts supporter, political donor, and social hostess to EVERYONE....she is said to be a abuse 'groomer'. Her and Hayden have hung out on yachts in Cannes in the past. Those are often pictures of some large sized bruises on Jenkins. this group....Ties to the Island with Kevin Spacey and Soros elites?

            Q: How was it working with Roman Polanski, and how did you get him?

            Chris Tucker: It was a lot of fun! I knew of him from a few of his movies and I knew he was a legend. You could tell he had a great sense of comedy.
           </p>
           <p>
            BR: Roman became a friend of mine. When Paul Thomas Anderson did Boogie Nights, I was envious of him because he was hanging out with Stanley Kubrick and all these big directors and I was like, “One day I’ll hang out with big important movie directors,” and Roman was one of the first people who called me when he saw Rush Hour. He saw it in France and said, “Let’s meet,” and I said, “But I made the contemporary Beverly Hills Cop!” And he said, “I love the movie!” and he told me what a fan he was, how he loved Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, and how well-made the movie was. Directors aren’t snobs. It’s the critics [gestures at me] — I’m not pointing at you
           </p>
           <p>
            Chris Tucker and Brett Ratner are two of the driving forces behind the Rush Hour series, one of the most commercially successful action-movie franchises in history. Before Rush Hour solidified his superstar status, Tucker established himself as a popular stand-up and a credible dramatic actor with scene-stealing supporting roles in the Hughes brothers' noir-hued crime drama Dead Presidents and Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown.

            He left an indelible mark on stoner culture as a wisecracking pothead in F. Gary Gray's 1995 cult classic Friday before hooking up with Ratner for the first time with 1997's Money Talks.

            Brett Ratner To Attempt To Learn 'The Polanski Speed-Seduction Method' On 'Rush Hour 3' Set

            Perhaps feeling that he's gleaned all the horndogging wisdom longtime mentor and occasional make-out coach Robert Evans has to offer him, preternaturally hacky Rush Hour fauxteur Brett Ratner has now invited a Hollywood legend whose hot-tub-hosted appetites were even more outsized than those of his beloved teacher to work with him on the latest installment of his signature franchise. Today's Variety reports that fugitive director Roman Polanski has been written into Rush Hour 3, currently shooting in Paris, and will play the part of a policeman who will try to interfere with stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker's efforts to bicker with one another while crashing a variety of comically undersized French automobiles. Var explains how Ratner recruited Polanski for the role:

           <p>
            Director Brett Ratner told Daily Variety that he persuaded Polanski to appear after a chance encounter while in pre-production in Paris. He expressed particular affection for Polanski's stint as an actor and director in 1976's "The Tenant" and the notion of directors such as Orson Welles, Sydney Pollack, Spike Jonze and Albert Brooks working as thesps.

            "Roman is my favorite director and my favorite actor, so I asked Jeff Nathanson to write him into the movie," he added.

            While Polanski may initially enjoy the attention during his stay on Ratner's set, we suspect he'll quickly tire of the director's repeated and transparent attempts to steal the kind of seduction techniques so unfailingly effective that they necessitate a lifetime exit from the country in which they're practiced. After the tenth instance of Ratner prematurely calling "Cut!" in the middle of a scene to pull aside his actor to ask him, "Yeah, that's a keeper. So tell me again: Do the Quaaludes or the Champagne come first? I can never keep that part straight," Polanski might start to feel a little used. Rush Hour 3
