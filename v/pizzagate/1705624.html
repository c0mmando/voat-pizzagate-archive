            For someone appointed to stop sexual abuse, there sure it a lot of failed attempts in his past. 
Wikipedia
William Lacy Swing (born September 11, 1934 in Lexington, North Carolina) is the Director General of the International Organization for Migration. He is a diplomat and former United States Ambassador, and United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Under Secretary General.
           </p>
           <p>
            International Organization for Migration[edit]
In June 2008 Swing was elected Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).[3] In early 2017, UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres appointed him to the 9-member High-Level Task Force to Improve the United Nations Approach for Preventing and Addressing Sexual Abuse.[4]

            Check out this article about the UN sex peacekeeper scandal (which he led and directed all facets) according to wikipedia. He was supposed to resign over it but never did as he was pressured to stay. Was re-elected in 2013 for 5 year term.

            Dear Madam Counselor, dear Cheryl,

           <p>
            Upon the occasion of the Secretary's departure from the Department, may I once again ask you kindly to send the
message below to the Secretary.
           </p>
           <p>
            In doing so, I should also like to express my warm appreciation to you for your own personal support of me and

            "Dear Madam Secretary,
           </p>
           <p>
            As you prepare to conclude your mandate, I would like to express my profound gratitude to you for your
leadership at a critical juncture in our nation's history. You have made all of us in the Foreign Service, past and present,
           </p>
           <p>
            extremely proud.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a parochial note, I should like to thank you for your support of me personally in my capacity as Director General
of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in particular your endorsement of me for a second term of office
           </p>
           <p>
            at 10M. I was deeply honored to see you on several occasions during your mandate, e.g., at the Summit of the Americas
in Trinidad and Tobago and, more recently, in Cartagena, Colombia. It was a singular honor and privilege to be asked to
           </p>
           <p>
            be part of your FAPB Working Group on Benghazi.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of us were very concerned for you and your well-being during you recent hospitalization, and, subsequently,
greatly relieved that you were able, soon thereafter, to resume your duties. We are all grateful to you for the invitation
           </p>
           <p>
            to the Working Luncheon for the FAPB in the Ben Franklin Room on 3 January and very much missed you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Congratulations on your tremendous accomplishments over these past years and for all you have done for our
country abroad. We all owe you an enormous debt of gratitude. I join an entire throng of others in wishing you God's
           </p>
           <p>
            richest blessings for the future.
