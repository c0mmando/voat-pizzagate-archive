             “State played this card close to its chest,” the judge complained.
            </p>
            <p>
             “At best, State’s attempts to pass-off its deficient search as legally adequate during settlement negotiations was negligence born out of incompetence. At worst, career employees in the State and Justice Departments colluded to scuttle public scrutiny of Clinton, skirt FOIA and hoodwink this court.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Lamberth, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, also faulted the Trump administration for failing to clear up the mess and instead pressing on with a nothing-to-see-here approach.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The current Justice Department made things worse,” the judge said, referring to an October hearing in which he initially flatly accused Justice lawyers of lying, then retreated a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The president of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton, said he hoped that Lamberth’s ruling would make President Donald Trump’s appointees at the Justice Department change course in the litigation and take a more cooperative approach.

            Well, kudos to the judge. Brave man.

             You bet, I love Tom Fitton and JW. These people who never give up are the hope for our future. So, I gotta love Sean Hannity too. He has been relentless on this. He gets criticized for it, but he’s really great for hanging on to unresolved incidents that get shoved aside by msm, by repeating the
             <strong>
              details
             </strong>
             over and over and over again. He does a lot to keep
             <s>
              old
             </s>
             unresolved news current.

            <p>
             I won’t hold my breath, but I hope to see the day HRC and her cohorts pays for their crimes, including the Benghazi murders.

              Benghazi, yeah we need to see the truth about that one. Dirty biz for sure.  The pulled the wool over the eyes of the American People on that one.   Trying to blame it on some video.  If John 
Q Public knew all of it, well I think there would be riots.  Or maybe they would be totally tranced by their Netflix.
