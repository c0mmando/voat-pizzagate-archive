            The entire Hollywood is run by the Greedy, arrogant, ignorant people, generally of the Jewish religion.  Look at all the movies produced by Weinstein alone, Spielberg, the list goes on.  And, the movies are devoid of any substance.  Mediocrity at its finest, Hollywood is.  The degenerate fucktards have made hollywood actors and "musicians" our idols.  People are now worshipping at the altar of mediocrity that is Hollywood.
