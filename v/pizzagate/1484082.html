<p>The pizza scene in Hollywood is generally tied into the debauched swinger culture that exists there. Blowing the lid off of a few swinger clubs might help us gain some headway.

VIP parties (think the stuff I\'ve occasionally heard that Milo dude and stars who claim they were molested mention)</p>

<p>Elijah Wood and others have talked about being molested as kids by powerful Hollywood figures. IMDB should be helpful for graphing out the studios they worked at and who was in charge/in contact with them and when.</p>

            The entire Hollywood is run by the Greedy, arrogant, ignorant people, generally of the Jewish religion.  Look at all the movies produced by Weinstein alone, Spielberg, the list goes on.  And, the movies are devoid of any substance.  Mediocrity at its finest, Hollywood is.  The degenerate fucktards have made hollywood actors and "musicians" our idols.  People are now worshipping at the altar of mediocrity that is Hollywood.
