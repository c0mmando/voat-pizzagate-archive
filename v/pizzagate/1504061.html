            Scopolamine. Matthew Pauly  "The Murder of Time: Making and Unmasking a Sleeper"
            <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/matthew-pauly/murder-of-time-making-and-unmasking-a-sleeper/ebook/product-22508625.html">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Traditional Voodoo employed Scopolamine. 
 When a person was found to be very disruptive to the community perhaps a rapist or murderer, the medicine man of the community would dose them with Scopolamine, specifically a dust of the driedplant, which can be easily blown into someone’s face for immediate effect as it lands on the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, mouth and throat. The victim would immediately lose all free will power.  Their breathing would become shallow and infrequent causing them to lose consciousness and appear dead. They would be placed in a coffin and buried in front of family and friends. In the early morning hours the coffin would be dug up and the living person inside would be sent off to another island, given a daily dose of Scopolamine and kept as a slave until their death.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was the first time I had been dosed by an aerosol fog of anything.  I would later learn that NASA had developed an aerosol of Scopolamine in 2013 “for medical purposes.” I would argue they developed a chemical weapon for no good reason. 
The intolerable risk of criminals spraying an aerosol into an innocent person’s face and them mind-controlling them to things against their interests had been ignored allto provide an alternate dosing technique for the limited medical uses of this deadly Nightshade family drug.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since this was only a year after NASA announced its new product, I was likely a Guinea Pig tester for the US Military on the outdoor effectiveness of Scopolamine fog delivery. Would it work?  Or would it kill the subject?
I had just said “Thanks” to Mitch and accidentally inhaled a bit of the fog. I literally could not breathe, almost as if my diaphragm was anesthetised.  I could feel consciousness slipping.  I knew I had only seconds before I was unconscious.  I turned and jogged south towards the most public piece of grass nearby which was in front of Montgomery Apartments.  Time slowed down.Jumping the real hedge in front of Montgomery Apartments was not an option as my legs were so heavy and the hedge was tall.  I reached the public sidewalk and skirted this hedge to the public grass on the other west side where I collapsed face-down. I had covered the twenty-foot distance without taking a breath since my first inhale of the aerosol.  I fell unconscious.
