<p><strong>The ACCIDENTon July 26 in UTAH Involving an IDAHO reserve police officer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A reserve officer with the Rigby, Idaho Police Department</strong> is in critical but stable condition at the <strong>University of Utah burn unit</strong> following a fiery crash in Utah on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>William Gray, 43, was hauling sand in a semi-truck on U.S. Highway 89/91 in Wellsville, Utah</strong>, when a man fleeing from a Utah Highway Patrol trooper crashed into him.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Lee Perry said the trooper attempted to stop a Chevy Silverado being driven by Brigham City, Utah, resident Marcos Torres, 26, around 1:30 p.m.</strong> ...
 “We’re all shaken and upset by what’s happened,” <strong>Rigby Police Chief Sam Tower</strong> told East Idaho News.com on Friday. <strong>“He’s one of those guys that if you met him, you’d wonder why this had to happen. He’s a big teddy bear, and we’re worried about him.”</strong></p>
<p>Gray joined the Rigby Police Department as a volunteer reserve officer five years ago. <strong>He is a full-time truck driver</strong> who loved serving the city, according to Tower
.
“We just want him to get better. He’s like a member of our family, and he’ll always have a home with us,” Tower said. (Note: From a pic on ‘explosive crash’  link , he has a wife(?) named April.). <a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2017/07/rigby-police-officer-critical-condition-explosive-crash/">https://www.eastidahonews.com/2017/07/rigby-police-officer-critical-condition-explosive-crash/</a> (JULY)</p>

<p><strong>The EXCUSES, APOLOGIES, and  INVESTIGATION (and some suspiciously weird wording)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>RIGBY — On July 26 of this year, one of our reserve officers, William Gray, was the victim in a horrific accident in northern Utah while working his full-time job as a truck driver. 
The suspect in this incident was fleeing from Utah State Highway Patrol, when he crossed into oncoming traffic and collided head on with Gray’s truck, severely injuring Gray and killing himself. <strong>Officer Gray was flown to the University of Utah’s burn unit where he remains under their watchful, professional, and competent care.</strong> 
<strong>Within the first hours of Officer Gray being admitted into the burn unit, an incident occurred</strong> between hospital staff and an officer from an agency in Utah who was assisting with the investigation. 
.<strong>The Rigby Police Department was not aware of this incident until Aug. 31, 2017</strong>
. 
“It is important to remember that <strong>Officer Gray is the victim in this horrible event, and that at no time was he under any suspicion of wrongdoing.</strong>

<p>Salt Lake City police say an <strong>officer seen on video dragging a screaming nurse from a hospital and handcuffing her will be put on paid administrative leave</strong> after prosecutors called for a criminal investigation.
Police Chief Mike Brown said in a statement Friday that his <strong>department will comply with the investigation into Detective Jeff Payne</strong>. He arrested nurse Alex Wubbels after she refused to allow blood to be drawn from an unconscious victim, in line with hospital policy.
Salt Lake County\'s Unified Police Department will run the criminal probe into Payne\'s actions on July 26, which got widespread attention after Wubbels and her lawyers released the dramatic video Thursday. <a href="http://www.wbay.com/content/news/The-Latest-Police-apologize-after-officer-handcuffs-nurse-442483093.html">http://www.wbay.com/content/news/The-Latest-Police-apologize-after-officer-handcuffs-nurse-442483093.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Some CONTEXT  with respect to LOCATION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rigby, Idaho, where Gray resides and was a reserve officer, is about 170 miles north, 2 1/2 hours, from Wellsville, Idaho, the site of the accident.</p>
<p>Wellsville, Utah is about around 73 miles north of Salt Lake City, which is where the University of Utah Hospital Burn Center is where Officer Gray was taken.</p>

<p><strong>The Corruption and Politics in Rigby , Jefferson County Idaho</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Whatever the outcome on March 10th, Jefferson County politics are not likely to simmer down any time soon</strong>.  Sheriff Olsen is facing an upcoming trial and it is unclear what else the grand jury might do.  Further, the advocacy groups in Jefferson County assert that other officials also deserve scrutiny.  Bruce Baxter of the Restoring Integrity Project told Local News 8 television, when Sheriff Olsen was indicted, that “there are much, much bigger issues in Jefferson County, and a lot more people involved, in our opinion.”So, expect Jefferson County internal politics to continue to generate considerable heat in 2015 and, perhaps, beyond. <a href="http://idahopoliticsweekly.com/politics/88-political-turmoil-in-jefferson-county">http://idahopoliticsweekly.com/politics/88-political-turmoil-in-jefferson-county</a></p>
<p>JEFFERSON COUNTY, Idaho - <strong>A proposal by Commissioner Brian Farnsworth that would have put Sheriff Blair Olsen on administrative leave has been rejected.
Olsen is facing three felony counts of misusing public money, and Farnsworth argued the sheriff should be placed on paid leave until his court trial is concluded.</strong>
Farnsworth voted in favor of the proposal and Commissioner Scott Hancock voted against it. Commissioner Jerald Raymond was not in attendance. <a href="http://www.localnews8.com/news/kifi-top-story/jefferson-sheriff-wont-go-on-administrative-leave_20160825055508944/58232115">http://www.localnews8.com/news/kifi-top-story/jefferson-sheriff-wont-go-on-administrative-leave_20160825055508944/58232115</a>  
</p>
<p><strong>The Rigby City Council has terminated its police chief.In a 6-0 vote Thursday night the Rigby City Council voted to dismiss Rigby Police Chief Keith Hammon from his duties.</strong> “The Rigby City Council maintains control of the Rigby Police Department with the assistance of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office,” Rigby Mayor Jason Richardson told EastIdahoNews.com. “The same level of service will be provided to the city of Rigby during this transition to a new chief.”  <a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2016/08/rigby-police-chief-fired/">https://www.eastidahonews.com/2016/08/rigby-police-chief-fired/</a>
Rigby officials have big plans for the little city in 2017.
<strong>The city of about 4,000 people faced controversy in late 2015 and into 2016 as leaders debated whether to dissolve its Police Department. But that appears to be behind it with the hiring of a new Police Chief.</strong> Now Rigby officials are focused on improvement in 2017.
Mayor Jason Richardson said Police Chief Sam Tower has quickly adapted to his job and already filled an empty patrol officer position since taking over in October.
“Although the Police Department still uses a majority of city funds, we have made the decision to keep the department and look forward to an active and beneficial community-centered police force,” Richardson said in an email.
Tower said the city has embraced him and his officers. He said he is coordinating with city officials on numerous projects this year.  <a href="http://www.postregister.com/articles/featured-news-daily-email/2017/02/03/rigby-officials-anticipating-eclipse-improvement">http://www.postregister.com/articles/featured-news-daily-email/2017/02/03/rigby-officials-anticipating-eclipse-improvement</a></p>

            <strong>
             Officer Gray was flown to the University of Utah’s burn unit where he remains under their watchful, professional, and competent care.
            </strong>
            <strong>
             Within the first hours of Officer Gray being admitted into the burn unit, an incident occurred
            </strong>
            between hospital staff and an officer from an agency in Utah who was assisting with the investigation. 
.
            <strong>
             The Rigby Police Department was not aware of this incident until Aug. 31, 2017
            </strong>
            . 
“It is important to remember that
            <strong>
             Officer Gray is the victim in this horrible event, and that at no time was he under any suspicion of wrongdoing.

            Salt Lake City police say an
            <strong>
             officer seen on video dragging a screaming nurse from a hospital and handcuffing her will be put on paid administrative leave
            </strong>
            after prosecutors called for a criminal investigation.
Police Chief Mike Brown said in a statement Friday that his
            <strong>
             department will comply with the investigation into Detective Jeff Payne
            </strong>
            . He arrested nurse Alex Wubbels after she refused to allow blood to be drawn from an unconscious victim, in line with hospital policy.
Salt Lake County's Unified Police Department will run the criminal probe into Payne's actions on July 26, which got widespread attention after Wubbels and her lawyers released the dramatic video Thursday.

            .  Sheriff Olsen is facing an upcoming trial and it is unclear what else the grand jury might do.  Further, the advocacy groups in Jefferson County assert that other officials also deserve scrutiny.  Bruce Baxter of the Restoring Integrity Project told Local News 8 television, when Sheriff Olsen was indicted, that “there are much, much bigger issues in Jefferson County, and a lot more people involved, in our opinion.”So, expect Jefferson County internal politics to continue to generate considerable heat in 2015 and, perhaps, beyond.

            <strong>
             A proposal by Commissioner Brian Farnsworth that would have put Sheriff Blair Olsen on administrative leave has been rejected.
Olsen is facing three felony counts of misusing public money, and Farnsworth argued the sheriff should be placed on paid leave until his court trial is concluded.
            </strong>
            Farnsworth voted in favor of the proposal and Commissioner Scott Hancock voted against it. Commissioner Jerald Raymond was not in attendance.

            “The Rigby City Council maintains control of the Rigby Police Department with the assistance of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office,” Rigby Mayor Jason Richardson told EastIdahoNews.com. “The same level of service will be provided to the city of Rigby during this transition to a new chief.”

            Rigby officials have big plans for the little city in 2017.
            <strong>
             The city of about 4,000 people faced controversy in late 2015 and into 2016 as leaders debated whether to dissolve its Police Department. But that appears to be behind it with the hiring of a new Police Chief.
            </strong>
            Now Rigby officials are focused on improvement in 2017.
Mayor Jason Richardson said Police Chief Sam Tower has quickly adapted to his job and already filled an empty patrol officer position since taking over in October.
“Although the Police Department still uses a majority of city funds, we have made the decision to keep the department and look forward to an active and beneficial community-centered police force,” Richardson said in an email.
Tower said the city has embraced him and his officers. He said he is coordinating with city officials on numerous projects this year.

            <p>
             (Reuters) - A Utah police detective accused of assaulting and unlawfully arresting a nurse after she refused to let him take a blood sample from an unconscious patient without a warrant was fired on Tuesday from his second job as a part-time ambulance driver.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jeff Payne was terminated from his job at Gold Cross Ambulance service over comments he made while taking nurse Alex Wubbels into custody on July 26 which were captured on his body camera, Gold Cross president Mike Moffitt told Reuters.
            </p>
            <p>
             The comments suggested that Payne would bring transients to University of Utah Hospital, where Wubbels worked, while transporting "good" patients to another facility, Moffitt said.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Those remarks are just not reflective of our company's philosophy and the service we provide and because of that behavior we felt we had to separate ways," Moffitt said. "His comments reflected poorly on the company and violated several company policies."
            </p>
            <p>
             Reuters was not able to contact representatives for Payne, who has been placed on administrative leave by the Salt Lake City Police Department over the incident, which made headlines when Wubbels' lawyers released the body camera footage.
            </p>
            <p>
             The footage shows Payne roughly handcuffing Wubbels and shoving her into an unmarked squad car after she refused to let him draw blood from an unconscious man, who had been badly injured when he crashed at the end of a police chase.

            He was fired from his part-time medic job.  He definitely should have known hospital policy!   Still on leave (and under review) from police force.

            Hey, just saw on my local news that the Policeman that attacked that Nurse has been fired.  They did not go into too much of the accident, only that he was fired and that it was an infringement on a patient's rights.  Who figured that would happen.  I am shocked.

             Definitely something strange about the way the Rigby Police Chief/Dept gushed over William Gray after his accident.  It did remind me of the crap DWS/DNC said about Seth Rich, as though she really cared!  This may not be the same, but something sure seems out of place here.

             Elizabeth Smart.  I never trusted her father.  I am convinced he was involved and those two people are sitting in jail as many do to protect the filthy rich pedos.  He left a window open.  Sure.

RIGBY — A reserve officer with the Rigby Police Department is in critical but stable condition at the University of Utah burn unit following a fiery crash in Utah on Wednesday.

            William Gray, 43, was hauling sand in a semi-truck on U.S. Highway 89/91 in Wellsville, Utah, when a man fleeing from a Utah Highway Patrol trooper crashed into him.

            Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Lee Perry said the trooper attempted to stop a Chevy Silverado being driven by Brigham City, Utah, resident Marcos Torres, 26, around 1:30 p.m.

Torres fled, crossed into oncoming traffic and hit the semi Gray was driving head-on, Perry said in a Utah Highway Patrol news release.

            The impact caused an explosion that ignited both trucks. Torres was pronounced dead at the scene, and Gray was able to get out of the truck on his own, even though he was on fire.

            Gray was taken to Logan Regional Hospital by ambulance and later flown to the University of Utah.

            “We’re all shaken and upset by what’s happened,” Rigby Police Chief Sam Tower told EastIdahoNews.com on Friday. “He’s one of those guys that if you met him, you’d wonder why this had to happen. He’s a big teddy bear, and we’re worried about him.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Gray joined the Rigby Police Department as a volunteer reserve officer five years ago. He is a full-time truck driver who loved serving the city, according to Tower.

            “We just want him to get better. He’s like a member of our family, and he’ll always have a home with us,” Tower said.

            A GoFundMe account has been set up for Gray and his wife to cover work and travel expenses. Click here to visit the page.

            Tremendous  post- I got  involved when  I saw  the  video  of the  nurse  being  assaulted  for  doing  her  job-You  can  call Alex Wubbels at the University  Hospital/ask for  Burn  Unit @ 801 581 2121 and express  your  support-if the  police  can do such a crime to a  nurse  in  front of  your dying daughters, sons mothers  and daughters then the  world has  truly gone  to  hell
Thje  Mayor  of  SLC also apologized  to Wubbels and  promised to  support her-you can  call  her  and  thank  her 801 535 7704
