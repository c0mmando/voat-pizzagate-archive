<p>BREAKING: TRUMP JUST ORDERED GOWDY AND CHAFFETZ BACK ON CLINTON CASE TO “GO AFTER EVERYTHING”

Gowdy Is On His Way There Now!
You are sure to recall that during the presidential election, there was a lot of talk about Hillary Clinton and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. This is a committee that is designed to go after government officials that have broken the law. Notably, Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz reside on this board, and are well-known for their vicious work during the Clinton case.</p>
<p>The case? Hillary put the entire nation in jeopardy with her decision to use a private email server, delete thousands and thousands of emails despite being told not to, and involved the State Department in several pay to play schemes through her Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>In other words, she is someone that should be spending her time in a jail cell. Several people were concerned that her case would be dropped moving into the New Year. However those fears have now vanished.</p>
<p>Jason Chaffetz is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and has just announced that President Donald Trump instructed him and the Committee to pursue every available avenue they deem appropriate. Trump has made it clear that putting the safety of the American people at risk like Hillary did is well deserving of punishment.</p>
<p>rsz_hillary-angry-face-ap-image-640x480
Hillary Is About To Get Bad News
Chaffetz said that the conversation between President Trump and himself took place after the 2017 GOP retreat in Philadelphia. This was also his second time ever speaking with the president in person.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The Utah Republican spoke to the committee saying, “He came up to me and said, ‘you do a great job. You do a great job,’ which of course I agreed with. Then he said, ‘listen, I understand that I am the President. You have a job to do. You do oversight. Don’t slow down. You go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.’”</p>
<p>President Trump made it clear during the debates that he was going to appoint a special prosecutor in the case against Hillary Clinton. Newsflash: that time has now come.</p>
<p>Chaffetz continued, “If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight of the government and the function that we fulfill, you’d be pretty inspiring, and it was inspiring to me. For him to convey the message, ‘don’t slow down, do your job, there’s a lot to get after with the government,’ I think that’s a good message.”</p>

<p>Again, this is just adding to the fact that Hillary is going to face some serious battles with the House Oversight Committee. Chaffetz has already said that he will continue to investigate her use of a primary email server while in charge of the State Department.</p>
<p>“Just because there was a political election doesn’t mean it goes away.” He also called the classified emails that surfaced on the server “the largest breach of security in the history of the State Department.”</p>
<p>If you couple that with all the WikiLeaks emails that had come out during the days leading up to the election, you can clearly see that Hillary was using this to gain a political advantage. A lot of people that were donating to her Foundation did so because she had promised some sort of political favor.</p>
<p>Again, she put the security of the country at risk because of her decision to use a private server. Not only did she do that, but she actively tried to say that it wasn’t a big deal as other people had done that, like Colin Powell.</p>
<p>No, Powell used a personal email account that was used for unclassified materials, like lunch runs or anything related to that. Hillary actively put the safety and security of the country at risk because of her decision, and she should suffer the consequences for it.</p>

<p>Hillary Did The Crime, Now She’ll Do The Time
Actions have consequences, and putting the safety of the nation at risk is a pretty big action. Therefore, it requires a big consequence. The other thing to realize is that there is no way that Hillary can be saved. There were fears that former President Barack Obama would have pardoned Hillary over this. Now that he is out of office, there is no way that she can be saved. We’re finally going to see justice!</p>
<p>Also, one of Hillary and Bill Clinton’s global foundations was shut down mere months after she lost the election. That is just further proof that she was using it as a way to get political favors. Now that she isn’t in office, how can she promise those favors?</p>
<p>Not to mention that Hillary’s other foundation is still being investigated by the FBI in several different states. There is a lot going on for the former Secretary of State, and absolutely none of them are any good for her. I wouldn’t be surprised if the FBI placed charges against her for her “charity.”</p>
<p>Share this article to show that President Trump has just given Chaffetz the ability to go after what he wants. That means that Hillary Clinton is finally finished and justice will prevail. Trump did say that he was going to restore law and order to the country. Going after someone that put the nation in danger is a good way to start.</p>',

            As an Aussie, I really shouldnt give a shit about US Politics but as avowed hater of the Left and in particular that crooked bitch Clinton, I have come to admire and love Trump for what he is doing sticking it to MSM and making our fool of a Prime Minister look ever stupider that he really is. However as much as I admire Trump these guys Chaffetz and Gowdy are simply superb! What a team. I have been watching hours of the dynamic duo on youtube. These guys deserve their own reality show. They are ruthless, lightening quick and take no prisoners. Almost wish I was American just so I could vote for them.

            HRC going to trial for crimes and possibly going to jail...fine, but Bill, that motherfucker won't make it to the end of the year. He is starting to look emaciated, his body decomposing while he's still somewhat alive.

            I want to believe that you're right about this but I fear that the people involved in the pizzagate aspect are powerful enough to have even the president eliminated if they truly feel threatened. The very fact that the sickening elefantis visited the WH FIVE times and met with Obama on two of those occasions suggests that this goes to the very highest levels. I mean, how the hell does some guy who runs a pizza shop get to visit the WH five times, twice meeting with the leader of the most powerful country on earth?
It will not surprise me if hillary is sacrificed but I will be shocked if it goes beyond that. She is no longer useful and threatening to blackmail won't work when they will simply do away with her if she tries and she knows it.
Time will tell but I'm not holding my breath..

             This isn't about pussy hats, HRC did not invent these CF and trafficking crimes, there is a whole cabal involved and MSM covering it up.  Women in pussy hats want equality and justice for good reason as a separate issue. The whole country has been deluded by NYT, WaPo, google, fb, all the media. When the trafficking evidence comes out and is unrefutable, I believe that the pussy hat wearers will be horrified. Moreover, there are clearly crooks in both parties.

               I think the a a core level most people want the same thing. The cia/foreign policy/imperialism bullshit drives a fear of foreign nations that scares the right and the lack of investment in education healthcare criminal justice and social wellbeing drives the left, if the bigger issue of government corruption which perpetuates all of these issues is attacked, it would close the gap wedging the parties apart. I think that was the appeal of Bernie who addressed the banking corruption which appeals to everyone.  I don't feel that I am expressing this well, but I hope you understand what I mean.

                we all just need to get together on 1) destroying innocents is wrong, and 2) lying about it is worse.

                we all need to get together on the difference between right and wrong.  there is absolute truth in this world, and not destroying innocents is one of those truths.

                 The politics are so intertwined which is how we got here. There was a post by a young campaigner talking about how they basically abused (mentally, emotioinally and overworked) the young staff &amp; volunteers to weed out the moral and upright from those who could be corrupted and promoted Her story is in pgwhatever about a month ago.

              Lol those pussy hat people are intellectually indefensible. But yeah if we can manage to prove it they will be mortified. More than likely though they will just claim trump is a Nazi trying to take over country with false charges.

               Listen, the pussy hatters are not the enemy. Do you really think that they want children raped and sacrificed in satanic rituals?? These people are mothers, grandmothers, sisters and daughters. They don't believe anyone could be so fucking evil, so what they are hearing is that Trump is a megalomaniac who is hellbent on destroying the world. They think world war 3 is coming. They forget the debates that HRC voted for Iraq and that T was giving her shit about it. I mention this and it is complete denial. Very Frustrating!!!  Its people who were against Iraq at the time, so clearly the MSM is gaining ground. Pizzagate is getting scrubbed and Trump is nominating people who they think are going to destroy their world. They are afraid of losing healthcare, women's rights and safetynet programs in a very troubling economic time.  I am hoping that the people Trump is nominating are only going to destroy the elites world.
              </p>

               Trump could very quickly win their support, and displace this fear, by pushing a pay equality and womens health agenda.

              There are too few liberals willing to listen to this story. The ones I know about have all told me they believe it is fake news. Then they LOL and mock me and say that they have to go to their Planned Parenthood rally now.

               There are libs on here. I am liberal in the classic way. I voted for Perot, Nader, Obama, and Trump. Guess that's considered liberatarian or independent now. Your lib friends not listening are just showing how strong the msm brainwashing is. They probably didn't question 9/11 or the wars either.

                Yeah I know there are, but the ones who are still supporting Hillary and calling this all fake news are the ones I'm referring to. Maybe they will change their tune after she is indicted with a number of others, but somehow, I doubt that. I voted for Al Gore. I used to be what I called a pro-life Democrat. I have since realized that such a thing does not exist. It takes a lot to change a person and open their eyes.

               That's funny. They are panicking because they think Trump is Hitler revisited. I've noticed that the same people who used to argue against the CIA put blinders on and are falling for the MSM fake news. Maybe they know of pedo crimes and are in denial, maybe have something to hide. But anyone who was a Bernie supporter (most liberals) will be or should be bullshit about HRC's theft of the primary. And, I know a lot of conservatives who would have voted for Bernie over the pack of republicans that ran. This country wanted an outsider at any cost but MSM is driving the megalomaniac train through everyone's brain. The information needed for critical thinking has been scrubbed from everywhere and partially even here.

            Trump knows it's "pretty bad" for Hillary. I think he sort of hinted or let it slip out at the end of his first WH interview when they asked him about prosecuting Hillary. Trump said he wouldn't pursue it himself, but he would let the investigators do their thing. It wasn't up to him. Makes me pretty hopeful she will be locked up. Considering he isn't letting go of any of his promises as they hoped, I'm sure Hillary's associates are scattering.

            The title is a bit misleading, Trump didn't tell them to get on the Clinton case. They were talking about it earlier, that the election doesn't change anything:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Chaffetz has already said that he will continue to investigate her use of a primary email server while in charge of the State Department.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Just because there was a political election doesn’t mean it goes away.” He also called the classified emails that surfaced on the server “the largest breach of security in the history of the State Department.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The original video where Chaffetz just said that Trump said they're doing a great job, and that they can pursue any case that they want to:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, great news. As long as Trump makes sure that DOJ etc play along with the oversight committee.

             This.

            <p>
             I can't count the number of times I've read complaints in the comments section of videos showing Chaffetz, Gowdy, et.al. ripping someone a new one about how it's all talk and no action. Now that we've got what is sure to be a cooperative DOJ with Sessions leading the way, I think we're going to see a lot more actual justice. #LegitimatelyHopeful
