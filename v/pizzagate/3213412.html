            Cianci Tries To Be All, “Oh Yeah Portland? Well We Can Have A Pointless Gay Mayor Scandal Too, You Know.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday on his radio show whimsical coot Buddy Cianci claimed that mayor David Cicilline misappropriated city funds in order to give two strippers a ride (heh, heh) from Boston.  But an investigation proves that really it’s kind of way more complicated than that!
           </p>
           <p>
            Turns out Scott Birchall, who does work for Allens Avenue club Trixx, allegedly arranged for a Boston cop to escort the two strippers, who took pictures of the journey through the Ted Williams tunnel and wrote about it on their blog, a post which has since (I guess) been taken down. (NSFW)  Birchall claims that he only took the couple (who go by Jordan and Aden Jaric but also for some reason refer to themselves as Brangelina) from Logan to Tremont Street, and that the pair wasn’t escorted to Providence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Channel 10 reported on the story last night, in that Channel 10 way that’s all like “sex offender!” “live sex act!” “sex offender registry!”, which is completely unnecessary, not particularly related to the story, and mildly offensive.  The video’s here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately David has had the video scrubbed as most high powered elites are want to do.  Looks like he is involved in some perverted hanky panky that may link us to why he has sponsored the PERVERTED Equality Act of 2019

            This is all sick and rooted in satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what the war is about. Satanism. This is what is driving socialism and the rest. There was a war on our children that started long ago. It was well-orchestrated and targeted them through sexual abuse. In fracturing psyches, you had dysfunctional adults that turned to ... yes, satanism for acceptance and to work out anger.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm patiently waiting for enough CCP points to post something that has been ignored by the media. I hope to at least get it out there for people to do with as they please. But it proves that Satanism is being left out of the conversation. Not by us, but by the mainstream press that are now propagandists. Their job? Shield the huge underground Satanists perpetrating this ruination of society for their own sick ends. They use vulnerabilities to establish a foothold and manufacture blackmail that is then used to keep people in line. We are the only ones that talk about SRA. We are the ones that keep going back to this underpinning .... this scum .... while the rest of the "authorities" deny this problem and call it an assault on religious freedom and labeling it "HYSTERIA." It is not hysteria. Kindergarten children do not get sexually transmitted diseases from hysteria. And in the case of the alleged molestation at schools like the Presidio Day Care, the children perfectly described the ritual abuse ... even detailing the costumes/masks that were worn. How would children know that? How would they know that's what is used?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's symbols like that that should have given away what was going on. But in labeling it "hysteria", the scum effectively covered up what was going on.

               The greatest lie the devil told was that he doesn't exist.  So many now believe that he doesn't.  My Irish friend of all people, from Ireland one of the most Catholic countries, told me she does not believe in the devil.  I was so floored my mouth dropped open.  I of course told her I did.  I used to just clamp up when people said this, but now I declare my belief.  I told her that is why there is so much evil in the world now.  She of course espoused the usual, that because of the internet we just hear more of it.  UGH.  So now we can have idiots blame God for what is happening.  Another one said if God is real, then why does he let such horror happen?  See?  They don't say why does the devil let the evil happen.  Of course, because he has convinced them he doesn't exist.  Thank You so much for posting this.  UpVoat! and one for you too my friend

                Yes, this.
               </p>
               <p>
                God is always blamed, and The Devil always gets off scot-free. Even though people have made human sacrifices to him from the beginning, they still deny his existence. And, even though The Devil is mentioned in the Bible. Why did the Good Book mention him if he doesn't exist? To throw us all off the truth? Or to tell us the truth?
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes, it's more irrationality. But it's amazing to me that people that believe in Christ and read the Bible would not believe The Devil is alive and well. And that he has a huge following. But it's just more gaslighting. Yes, there were times in history where these devil worshippers were weeded out of society and it was almost always good intentions gone horribly wrong. But my favorite comeback to denial through the use of why does God permit such things is to ask, why do you allow your children to do wrong?
               </p>
               <p>
                They usually deny they do, but when confronted the usual rhetoric doesn't work. Somehow the message gets through because when their son or daughter first hit the dog to aggressively or threw a tantrum and broke a favorite object, they didn't unleash a bolt of lightning and smote the child dead. The instead patiently explained how wrong what they did was and to behave. Any good parent would do this. Only a monster would unleash a terrible, horrible punishment for a transgression of the law of right and wrong. And we are imperfect and do this. Why? Because we follow our role model and creator -- God. It's what He does. We all know what it's like when we're presented a lesson in life. They're hard to take, but we get it. And if we don't? It's a little bit of a harder pill to swallow the next. But even if we don't behave, we get chance after chance after chance, just like what happens with God and His children. But why would He do that? Because sometimes there's a David Berkowitz. And if people would actually read the Bible and not letting Satanists interpret it, it clearly states that Jesus came to separate. It means that not everyone is a member of His flock. Again, if they're not a member of His flock, whose flock are they a member of?
               </p>
               <p>
                It's another indication that The Devil does exist, and the only way to really separate is to go through the process of giving chances ... being lenient with lessons interspersed. Yes, we all suffer from some of these heinous crimes, but The Lord's eye is on the final outcome which is the gathering of His Children. And to this end, we have free will. Free will to choose either good or evil. What an amazing concept! And, yet, some deny God's presence precisely because we are given a choice even to who we ultimately want to follow.
               </p>
               <p>
                As to what is going on in the world and our negating this cabal ... this network of terror, I believe a lot of it is assuming everyone is like we are. It's why it's so hard to accept that the nice young man down the block rapes children. We don't want to believe it. But that's another choice. And once you accept that not everyone has the same intentions in their heart as you, well, then it becomes easier to believe, but harder to bear because it is the truth.

                Thanks for reading my reply and responding. I truly appreciate it. Bless you and your fight for truth and honor and God. Yes, God. We can't ever let the opposition deny Him out of existence, too.

                 Well said.  I have questioned many times why things happen the way they do.  But yes, people make choices and God does not take that gun or car from them before they take a life.  It is up to them to not drink or to lay down that weapon.

                  The other thing these others are forgetting is that our time here is not forever. The Bible clearly speaks of a heaven and hell. So this is a temporary time in a temporary place that the humble and meek will one day inherit. Because it is temporary is another reason for God not taking action. It is not our souls in jeopardy, and our actions here determine our fate. OUR behavior, not God's. So people may think they're getting away with things, but you reap what you sow.

                   I so believe in Heaven and Hell.  I know where my husband is, for he was one of the kindest to walk this earth.  Those that do not believe, they will suffer for their actions.  Now that I am older I realize more how short our time is.  Yes, I too believe we reap what we sow.

            BRISTOL RHODE IS. WAS THE SEAT OF SLAVE TRADING FROM AFTER 1812 TO AFTER 1865.
Slave trader James deWolf ran the town and was the chief employer for his slave triangle trade empire.
He was outed in 2009 by ancestor Katrina Brown. She made a video about his dark deeds called TRACES OF THE TRADE. She also authorized family research for the book JAMES DeWOLF AND THE RHODE ISLAND SLAVE TRADE.
           </p>
           <p>
            "A grandmother's confession alerted Browne at an early age to the family's infernal legacy. She does research. From 1769 to 1820, DeWolf ships sailed to the coast of Ghana to trade rum and other goods for slaves who were then sold in the New World or brought to family sugar plantations in Cuba. The sugar was then transported back to Bristol to make more rum in family distilleries. They had shrewdly put together what today would be described as a vertically integrated corporation.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it wasn't just the DeWolfs. The entire town of Bristol, the historic heart of the trade, was involved. This film forever buries the myth of Southern guilt. Slavery was legal for 200 years in the North and the North dominated the trade. As a political favor, none other than President Jefferson appointed an in-law to head the Bristol customs office so the DeWolfs could continue the trade long after its abolition. Can you imagine a more depressing historical fact than that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Browne wrote to 200 descendents, inviting them to join her on a journey to trace this legacy. Nine members did. Starting with the grand mansions, warehouses, company records, artifacts and a slave gravesite in Rhode Island, the group flies to Ghana to tour slave forts with their nearly impenetrable dungeons. They move on to Cuba, where they discover the ruins of a DeWolf plantation building."

              I've been researching the history of the Dutch and East India companies and the bloodlines involved for several years. This is the root of the modern global empire. The economic foundation was/is slavery and drugs (opium). I believe James deWolf was linked with this group. The Northern triangle trade families managed to escape the repercussions of the Civil War. Currently, the MSM still protects them. DeWolf's slave trading father was quite possibly a descendant of the Sephardi diaspora that fled Spain in 1492. Many went to Holland, South America, the West Indies, and British America.
