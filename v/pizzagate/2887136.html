            Hey, can someone help me? I don't have enough points to make a post on vote yet, but I've got some info re: a CP Snuff ring that I need advice on how to handle:
           </p>
           <p>
            Hey guys,
           </p>
           <p>
            Been following this pizzagate thing since the jump. Never bothered to make an account here, but I've recently come across some very disturbing information that I don't know what to do with.
           </p>
           <p>
            A while back, poking around the internet, I kept coming across comments/rumors about a certain production company in the southwest of America that was said to produce child snuff pornography. What was baffling to me is that there were people naming names, yet it still seemed to be a sort of urban legend. I made a post about it on another form. I got a few private replies from people saying it was true, but without saying much more than that. One person told me they'd tell me their personal story about it, but never did.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a few days ago, this person sent me a video they made, detailing their personal experience with this company/people involved with this operation. I just watched it. I don't know what to do, because it sounds like this person's life is in danger. I want to help this person get their story out, but I don't want to further endanger them.
           </p>
           <p>
            It doesn't sound like the police can be trusted. From some cursory research, it's more than likely they're complicit. This person says that they've reached out to every governmental agency in the state they can think of, and nothing has been done. All of us on here know the people involved in these things reach high-levels, and I'm personally distrustful of just about every governmental organization when child-abuse is involved. We know that CP didn't become a billion-dollar industry from broke bois are purchasing the videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I'm in a bit of a bind. This is one of those things where I feel like I'm complicit in allowing evil to flourish/exist if I don't try to do something, but I also don't know what to do. Does anyone know of a trust-worthy organization that I can reach out to or put this person in touch with? Was thinking about e-mailing Timothy Holmseth and seeing if he could do something, as he's been pretty fearless in putting pedos on blast. We're talking about hardcore criminals that have the Hells Angels on their bankroll here, so I want to approach this with the upmost caution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
(also trying to be vague here as I know pedos lurk this board, and I don't know who knows, etc.)

             Wow this is a dilemma.  I honestly am at the point where I don't think anyone is trustful anymore.  This is a problem.  I think the only thing you can do in this case is make crap loads of videos and send them to 100's of truthers and I mean so many that it is overwhelming.  Bc if you trust one or two of the wrong people you are screwed but if enough people get the word then there is a protection there but you have to put the info out there so far and so wide that it can't be silenced. That being said you have to get your witness in a safe place under an alias where noone knows and I mean noones knows where they are even you.  This has to be done  very carefully.  You have to set up a signal with a code that can not be compromised to get in touch when the time is right.  This will take money and planning. That being said stop talking about it on the internet and to anyone until you do it. And when you drop the videos do it from a anon computer that cannot be tracked to you from an email that is not under your name.  there are emails they say that dont' track you research that.  Maybe in your best interest to 8 channel this info. Just my thoughts.
