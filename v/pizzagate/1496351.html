<p>Two questions: 
1. Is the quoted statement above true about both the files posted on DC Leaks as well as Wikileaks? Or just the DC Leaks files?
2. Are there any other differences between what was posted on DC Leaks and Wikileaks?</p>

            The counter argument is once they knew leaks were imminent they could give the data to anyone to leak side by side... so as to pick an opponent/blame if you will. Guccifer could possibly be a chosen fall guy, who knows?  Their server was compromised/leaked in several mediums.
