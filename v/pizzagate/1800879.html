<p>I used this throwaway account to post this b/c I didn\'t want pedo-shills in full force downvoating my Good Account that I use to downvoat their sorry asses</p>
<p>So, I went down the wrong rabbit hole, I found that twitter was suspending accounts that were 
politically aligned w/ Trump but not accounts that were legit debating whether the age of consent should be lowered to 13 , I was apprehensive about posting the twitter accounts but they made it public domain so here ya go www.twitter.com/steiner_ernst , THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT DEPRAVED ACTS w/ children and acting like loved ones protecting a child’s innocence and physical/emotional well being is a crime b/c it stops love. Follow friends of friends if ya must but GEEZE they are out in the open about this shit on twitter, not some weird backwoods chatroom but TWITTER, this is too public for comfort but it does give us the opportunity to see what messages they have been spreading to try and garnish support for pedophilia rights.</p>

I only scrolled through like 1 month of his timeline and looked at a few of his RTs, I didn’t encounter CP but it is dangerous too b/c we learned Twitter loves pedophiles, nice conscience ya got there Jack!  I think it’s important we hijack these hashtags and EXPOSE what motives really lie behind it, these demons are wearing the mask of the victim while they destroy children’s lives </p>

            I wonder what the LGBTQ community thinks about pedophiles latching on to their LGBTQ rainbow identity. If I was gay, I'd be pissed about this visual association.

             I am afraid the whole "anti-discrimination" agenda stems from the same forces. Since all these are artificially created "movements" the inclusion of Pedophiles will result in no public rejection.
The destruction of traditional values is at the core of the globalist satanic elite because only people with roots reject the evil transformation.
