<p>This post  goes hand in hand with the other stuff I\'ve been posting strange codes about sex photos on regular old merchandise for sale at Alibaba com and 
now it\'s an avalanche

This is related! 
I hope you soon let me show my other post on how exact ly I found the code in Google search engine.... 
ABove at top is the tweet that is now archived for it\'s long strange code that reads who finds what finders hide with a picture if a baby.</p>
<p>Its the tweet that had people talking about the code that was on it that when put thru quip quip translator read : WHO FINDS WHAT THE FINDERS HIDE, that\' was only stranger on a black and white of a man and baby on a couch.
<a href="https://ibb.co/mo3PRb">https://ibb.co/mo3PRb</a></p>
<p>The finders have been linked to the weird online videos of Disney characters and Spiderman being abusive, for kids, by the comments found below the videos to the above tweet 
BY 
the same gibberish. 
AND
 by other stuff like the sexual and physical abuse in the videos, needles in the videos and in Finders information .
Other people have called out the same code in the COMMENTS on the in- appropriate childrens videos on YouTube.. So much so there are search options about it, but I won\'t mention the name</p>
<p>AN ANONYMOUS POST
said this about why this code could actually be plausibly in use as people were claiming it was not plausible , there was an argument people really care about these songs and bands where the gibberish was also found :</p>
<p>Anonymous Sat 03 Jun 2017 19:09:47 No.19100651
it makes zero sense that these videos are a promotional ARG. the \'bands\' involved are less bands and just personal projects made in a shitty program like guitar pro. They\'ve existed for years and do zero self-promotion</p>
<p>A caesar cipher would be sufficient to make a public statement while preventing anyone from being able to find it via search (either google or government looking for &quot;key words and phrases&quot;). Just like the youtube videos - they were unlisted but not private. Whoever is posting this stuff wants it accessible, just not easily
&quot;</p>
<p>I have been trying to post about finding the same code, and how I came accross it but I can\'t post that one for some reason.... Anyway without giving you the code like I did in the last one.... It\'s in your Google search engine. If you mess with it and take words from the phrase you have and put it thru quip quip, you will see how it\'s done.

            The Finders do the CIA's bidding in a outsourced, not traceable back to them way. In the '60's they drove hearse like vans with covered windows.  They are able to locate and abduct adults and children particularly  with great speed and skill.  They can appear without warning, to reinforce training for MK purposes on your ass as necessary.  It happened regularly to me, about every six months as a child.  The Finders are so gross and smelly, you can't believe what hit you.  Usually were from Florida.

             Hi thats sounds so scary. I can't get the post to stay up. Nothing stays up on this...my post was about finding that code in Google search engine...and now I've found it in Facebook...whoever pioneered this garble called the ceaser cipher (?) Has taught everyone else by now wether it was findes I don't know. Seems like it cause of that clue  who finds what the finders hide. Anyway...maybe I'm doing something technically wrong in posting but I doubt. Anyway look at this. The garbage language is in the system as a way to get child porn one reason at least

            I have said that I am not good at this tech stuff or understanding it.   I do understand that these people are dangerous and do not want to be outed or discovered, so thank you for posting at your risk.  This is serious business and  it needs to be stopped.  This is like an Underground Bus. operating in Plain Site.  Again, they are getting away with their nasty operation through YT and Google.  Parents Spread This Far and Wide.
