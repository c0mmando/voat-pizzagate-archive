            These are the symbols of ancient Egyptian Mythology of the god of the dead Osiris.  Osiris married Isis, his own sister who gave to birth to Horos (first known person with the incest mark of Cain (coloboma, eye of Horos) which is seen to them as a supernatural sign.
           </p>
           <p>
            Osiris is then killed by his family and divided into 14 parts placed in the Nile River with fish. The Ritual was about findng the parts to put Osiris together again. They were able to find 13 but not his penis. The story goes Osiris penis was finally found and the family ate his penis as a resurrection practice.

            Aleister Crowley was interested in all things occult and was cast out of Italy by Musollini because his crimes were so egregious. Involved children and pedophile child sex,sex orgies, beastislity. He was initiated into a very powerful secret society where he became the black magician. He traveled to Egypt where he practiced black majick in the Egyptian pyrimiads. He also visited the ancient ruins and museum where he saw a statue of Horos. He learned of the ancient mythology including practice of sodomy as opening the "third eye"
           </p>
           <p>
            He developed the religion of Thelma writing the Book of the Law from this. He began calling himself the beast &amp; 666 . He was also an unknown British MI5 Intelligence officer.
           </p>
           <p>
            He combined sex Majik with Black Majiick into a program where you could control someones mind. At this time he was working with Sigmund Freud who used these techniques in NAZI camps. Next they moved onto experimentiong on children with MI5 and CIA. Next step create DID kids into supersodiers, super spies.
           </p>
