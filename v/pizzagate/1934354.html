            , I don't know if MF mentioned it to you, but the right place to post this is in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            . One of our submission rules is that posts about the moderation/administration of
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            go in their own sub.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">

            I have yet to see a post that was wrongfully deleted in my judgment by any of the moderators.  Now I haven't seen every post that has been deleted but let's assume for a moment that what I have seen is a represeative sampling. If that's the case, then Milleniel Falcon and others are properly doing their job.  Actually there are many questionable posts that were permitted to survive. Its a terrible feeling to have a work product be rejected just like it's a terrible feeling to be engaged in a sport and lose. And it's a terrible feeling to lose a case in court. But that's life and these losses have to be accepted. Everyone who has complained about a post being rejected has had other posts that remained. So I really don't understand the complaints, just learn from them and do a better job next time. And also accept that different moderators are going to have different standards.  Didn't we all have school teachers we loved to hate  because they were strict?  Good manners and good sportsmanship will always win out in the end.

            This one is trying to distract us by bringing up MF. Don't fall for it. Ignore it.
