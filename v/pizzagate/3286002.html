<p><strong>brief comparement analysis from a laymen:</strong></p>
<p>The spiral\'s both are the same \'lenght\'</p>
<p>They \'spin\' in the same direction.</p>
<p>They are both BLUE.</p>
<p>They are virtually identical when you strip away down to just a basic drawing of a spiral.</p>
<p>Blizzard transposes the spiral onto every single aspect of the game: the menus, every single cardback within the game (its a trading card game), any button that is in the form of a circle has the spiral on it - <strong>yet nowhere in the game of hearthstone or anywhere on the internet can you find an explanation for what the spiral represents</strong> - if not just to blizzard.  It\'s quite obvious why, to us Qanons and PG investigators, what it represents. Right?</p>
<p>The most pressed button of the entire game is the &quot;hero power&quot; button, and once it\'s been used on the players turn (extremely common action), what replaces the now used hero power logo? A SPIRAL. Exactly the same damn spiral as used in the FBI documents.</p>
<p>edit: cleaned up links</p>
<p>For anyone reading all these detractor comments trying to simply use a wave of the hand to dismiss the symbology involved as &quot;just a spiral gais&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;Their symbolism will be their downfall&quot; - Q</p>

            After seeing the various comments stack up in this submission, and the lack of support for this game being a way to groom kids, I am giving this an "Accuracy in Question" flair to reflect the doubt of the community.

            what the fuck does a sun altar have to do with anything regarding good?

           <p>
            Sun altar for human sacrifice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Add in the pedo symbol in the middle, kid sacrifices.

            Some pretty gross symbology.

            the problem i have with this post is; aside from that spiral - there's absolutely nothing else pedo about that game. I've played it a fair bit, and during the period in which i was made hyper aware of pizzagate pedo symbolism and pedo-normalisation tropes we see in other globalist media - and its all absent from Hearthstone

            <p>
             The light in this context = lucifer, as the entire game is evil, there are no redeeming qualities representing good... its all devils and demons and monsters.  Celebrating evil/luciferianism... They are currently running an "E.V.I.L" theme, with Luciferian (think vatican?) purple. Do you see anything good here? I don't. Tell me I'm wrong........ all this beside the main symbol for HS being an actual pedo spiral...

              Uther comes from Uther Pendragon. The father of King Arthur. Who sent his warriors off on the holiest of quests to find the holy grail. When people find the holy grail it is usually characterised by being surrounded by holy light

                  You need help.  Seriously,  if the swirl in and of itself is all that triggers you,  and the game play in no way sexualises children  or perverts gender norms - and it doesn't - you've bought into this too far

                   It's ALL negative crap and its being pushed on kids, all of this on top of this ominous swirl that has been tied, via a Federal Bureau of Investigation official document to known pedophile code.

                   Just because blizzard happens to be a large corporation does not exempt them from these possibilities.  Look at ROXY ... Giant company, has the little girl lover logo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Same for Blizzard, huge company, has the Little Boy Lover swirl/spiral.

                    WoW even has a character class'Demon Hunter'

                   <p>

            The main thing I see is the owl in a weird place, ALL american family where house stores have the owl "minerva" in the stores. Most places use those plastic owls used to "scare crows" but it will be  in a strange place. roller auction in denver has one behind the building but on the ground. search for owl art boulder colorado you will find some art found at the city parks... their art... Everywhere... look for the owl.

            What the fuck does teleporting have to do with swirls.
           </p>
           <p>
            the swirl has been identified as a symbol utilized by PEDOPHILES.
           </p>
           <p>
            Blizzard has plastered a swirl EXTREMELY SIMILAR to the SWIRL THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED HAVING BEEN/BEING USED BY PEDOPHILES as SECRET CODE for their pedo tendencies, all over the game entitled HEARTHSTONE.
           </p>
           <p>
            It happens to also be present in Wow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not a single person has presented
            <strong>
             any evidence that the swirl in the blizzard usage context represents something innocuous.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "oh its just a swirl" is a ridiculously flawed argument.
           </p>
           <p>
            Counter the evidence I've already provided in the OP, or... SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP.

             funny, you got a huge answer from me about just that, and all you can do is shout "IT'S A SWIRL" bring some sauce or sit down. If you even bothered to read my post, you would have seen that I encouraged research and more evidence. Offered a thought answer to how the game came about. Yes the swirl is a pedo symbol, but you can't just say a common symbol means everyone using it is a pedo and that's their intent. If anyone is a shill it's you telling people to go on wild goose chases without real evidence other than a swirl. Making a post that barely meets the rules of pizzagate make it seem even more so. If you want to be a valuable researcher than bring some more evidence to the table and have real conversations with people.

              What the fuck does teleporting have to do with swirls.
             </p>
             <p>
              the swirl has been identified as a symbol utilized by PEDOPHILES.
             </p>
             <p>
              Blizzard has plastered a swirl EXTREMELY SIMILAR to the SWIRL THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED HAVING BEEN/BEING USED BY PEDOPHILES as SECRET CODE for their pedo tendencies, all over the game entitled HEARTHSTONE.
             </p>
             <p>
              It happens to also be present in Wow.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not a single person has presented any evidence that the swirl in the blizzard usage context represents something innocuous.
             </p>
             <p>
              "oh its just a swirl" is a ridiculously flawed argument.
             </p>
             <p>
              Counter the evidence I've already provided in the OP, or... SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP.

               Portals have been used in fantasy settings for a very long time. Most portals, when represented, swirl.  Your evidence was countered with a reasonable explanation, but you are too blind to see that, and too dumb to counter point it. If you had any care about pizzagate at all you would cut the shit attitude and have a real conversation about it instead of screaming like a 5 year old who wants ice cream. I brought evidence, even gave you more that you missed because you did't do any real research. The only masonry here is the brick wall you will hit trying to argue like a child.

                Explain why there is a symbol extremely similar to the outed pedo spiral plastered all over hearthstone.
               </p>
               <p>
                It represents "portals" in your eyes?
               </p>
               <p>
                So you are implying hearthstone is about portals? Like the main theme of hearthstone is portals?
               </p>
               <p>
                It is NOT, having played the game over the years myself.  It has absolutely sweet fuckall to do with portals.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's a trading card game.  They utilize this symbol subliminally and plaster it all over the game.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not a pedophile and/or luciferian so I cannot go into their deeper intents for the use of this symbol, and thank god for that.
               </p>
               <p>
                But I can see with my eyes that's its the same spiral as the LITTLE BOY LOVER logo/symbol as outed by the FBI.
               </p>
               <p>
                Logical thinking.

                 If you actually played the game, than you would know the lore behind it, here let me spell it out for you. IT IS BASED OFF A PORTAL THAT TAKES YOU TO THE HEARTHSTONE WHERE YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME CALLED HEARTHSTONE.  THE ORIGINAL ITEM IN WOW HAD THE PURPOSE OF TELEPORTING YOU TO THE HEARTHSTONE, WHICH IS A GATHERING PLACE FOR ADVENTURES TO CONGREGATE AND RELAX SUCH AS PLAY GAMES. Stop reaching and coming with some sauce other than it looks the same. If Blizzard is so evil, show it with more than "oh a swirl", they have made a lot of popular games, you should be able to provide something else easily if it's true. However you want to just yell that it's a swirl and not look at any context of the game you claim to know. Pizzagate is about investigating and you are about as good at investigating as a low IQ mongoloid if you think just a swirl is enough, BRING THE SAUCE.

                   You have obviously never played a lot of video games. If you actually read my posts, and actually cared at all, you would have realized that the ONLY thing I'm calling you out on is not bringing real sources, only the picture of their logo. No real context, all I'm saying is prove it so people can see an investigate. Right now you are doing nothing constructive to help pizzagate in any way shape or form other than distracting people. Your behavior is that of a shill, that is why people are calling you out.

                     Where did I deny it? I asked you to bring more sauce since all you provided was a picture. If someone showed you besta pizza's logo, before you knew anything, what would you have thought? You wouldn't have thought of anything. I never said it wasn't worth looking into, all I offered a reasonable reason for them to use what they did. Get off your high horse and do some more research if you think it's true and stop trying to argue. Be constructive, not destructive if you care about this. When someone offers a counter point, talk like a grown up, not like a redditor. For example here more sauce that they used a blue portal all over.

                     Hmmmmmm......I wonder how you could draw those to look kinda like a hieroglyph. Just because it looks like a pedo symbol doesn't always mean it is. Not all the people on pizzagate are going to know a lot about blizzard and their games either, so you need to bring more sources and evidence than 2 pictures of a symbol. Put in your post about the colors and the E.V.I.L. and how it connects. It took you throwing a temper tantrum and calling people shills just to get you to come with anything else at all.

                       You should have provided evidence like this on top of what you put so that people could see more in my opinion. Laying out a 1/2 thought out post makes you look like a shill and isn't going to get the point across well to others. This is a place for research and trying to find the truth, arguing when someone brings a counter point and calling them names it's helping people get work done.

            The reason this is an argument is one existed WAY before the other was even conceptualized. In World of Warcraft they made the item hearthstone. This item teleports you to a Inn, or too the hearthstone of that Inn, as a better description. This item was one of 1000's of items in the game. They swirl is to represent a portal that teleports you there. Hearthstone's idea was a game the heros of WOW played in their off time in Inn's. In WOW you can find NPC's sitting and playing the game in front of the hearthstones in the game. The idea of the game is almost identical to the WOW TCG that came out, so they couldn't have the same name. Since the concept of the game is that you are playing as the heroes of WOW they had to come up with a name fitting for a fantasy world. Since a Hearthstone in the game is what you would use to go to the Inn and "relax for the night" it was a natural idea to call this game hearthstone, they than used the already used symbol in the game to create a recognizable logo for the game. Marketing 101. Since the games were years apart and not thought up together it is hard to say that the "swirl" was planned all a long for hearthstone's logo since the game wasn't even thought up yet. There needs to be more dots than "it's a swirl it must be pedo" when you look at the whole picture. They are not the same "length" at all. One has a rotation of 540 degrees and one has 810 degrees, not saying they aren't close, but that's not the same. The "spin" is just a coin toss, there's only 2 directions. I really think this is reaching for something that just isn't there without more proof.

            Before you call me a shill, understand I'm an avid Pizzagate follower. I've done research for people on this forum even though I don't comment much, and believe it to not be a hoax. This is just my 2 cents being both a follower of pizzagate and a long time blizzard game player. I'm just trying to see this from the natural progression of what an internal marketing team would come up with and how it was thought up. It's entirely possible that it was intended to be a pedo symbol but this evidence does not prove anything to me with the knowledge of their games that I have. I encourage there to be more research on it as I would like to know more, please see me as the devil's advocate and not as a denier.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do believe you missed a piece of important info about the in game wow item as well, which may connect more dots. There is a "replacement" hearthstone in WOW. It's actually called "the inn keepers daughter" it looks just like the hearthstone but when you use it a dwarf female follows you around for a minute or so. Link to the item
            <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=64488/the-innkeepers-daughter">
             https://www.wowhead.com/item=64488/the-innkeepers-daughter
            </a>
            . My personal opinion is some programmer thought it would be funny but it could mean something I guess. This item was released around the same time as hearthstone itself and could be relevant.
           </p>
           <p>
            It should also be noted that in Hearhstone you can not talk to your opponent at all unless they are on your friends list. I would imagine any grooming going on is in online communities outside of the game, that are based around the game. Discord servers, forums, etc.

             "They swirl is to represent a portal that teleports you there."
            </p>
            <p>
             WHY A SWIRL?
            </p>
            <p>
             REFER TO THE FBI DOCUMENTS.
            </p>
            <p>
             WHY A SWIRL?
            </p>
            <p>
             WHY THEY CHOSE THAT SWIRL?
            </p>

             It meant nothing to us 5 years ago either, but THE MORE YOU KNOW, right?

            <p>

              This is how shills work. They call all spirals pedo symbols so that the triangles have no meaning any more. Then they cult program that anyone critical of their bullshit is a shill. 
Besta Pizza used a pedo symbol and has since deleted it.
Blizzard is not luciferian, nor does it use a pedo symbol.

               "All spirals are pedophiles, case closed."
              </p>
              <p>
               So, big tough internet guy, what does the spiral represent if not the pedo symbol from the FBI DECLASSIFIED docs (meaning they used to be classified and hidden away).  During the time the spiral logo was not known to the general public as being used by pedophiles, the pedophiles went ahead and employed this spiral logo everywhere, to push their bullshit subliminally.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, now thanks to Donald Trump, this document from back in 2007 is all of a sudden relevant in 2016 and forward.
              </p>
              <p>
               Weird how that works?
              </p>
              <p>
               So now the spiral logo isn't just an innocuous "oh it must be fer teleportationz" symbol.  It has a meaning for the Luciferians.
              </p>
              <p>
               Blizzard ent. games are FULL of demons and occult crap.

               It's all really just logical, and yes, good investigative journalism IMHO.

             the other thing to note, is very, very, very few people are aware there is such a thing as "the pedo spiral" and that is a very, very common design element and was for a long time before it was adopted to have a new meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what's the liklihood a full on triangle spiral is actually used to indicate pedophilia in any way.  Still pretty low.

            Just took a look.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI symbol is a triangle, the HS one is a circle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Admittedtly, symbology isn’t my thing, but what I can say is that context is everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, swirls are more likely to be innocent within the context of polynesian culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don’t know what to think in this case, so I’m staying neutral on this matter.

             As reported by GloucestershireLive, police forces in England and Wales have provided details linking Blizzard's popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft and child pornography. Based on their report, as of 2016, there had been a total of 68 recorded crimes attributed to these sexual offenders and one of the most recent incidents involved a 10-year-old girl being "groomed" via IMVU. Due to the alarming incidents, NSPCC urges developers to provide greater regulation of the industry and help mitigate these issues

            <p>
             Some die young @ 20, others live centuries, interspecies relationships are a part of game lore, thus the structure of the game allows for a "15 year old" adult to marry a "60 year old" adult

              Different maturation rates is actually a pretty common thing in medieval fantasy stories. It is also true in nature as well as some species grow and mature at different rates.
             </p>
             <p>
              This also includes Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons (directly inspired by LOTR) BTW.
             </p>
             <p>
              Refer to the concept of “Chronological Age” vs “Biological Age” and it will make sense.

               I understand it's a staple of "fantasy" but if children are exposed to it early, and without parental guidance, it creates a huge opportunity for pedo grooming

                Lord of the Rings I believe was innocent. Then again, elves are basically humans with pointy ears.

              It's not even the same spiral listed on the FBI list of pedo symbols.  This is not the spiral you're looking for.  Just stop.  You're making the rest of us who believe in pedogate/pizzagate look like the folks who see "a connection" in everything.

                 To be fair, there is a circular pedo spiral for the toddler fuckers. I have no problems to believe that Blizzard is a pedo company. I just need to see some proof first. Some random spiral in Heathstone doesn't proof anything.

                 The problem is that people are losing their shit if they see something that is even remotely related to pizzagate in their minds.
