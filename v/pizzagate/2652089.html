<p>Okay let\'s look into Ronan aka Satchel. Also did you know that Satchel is not the only one of his siblings to change his <a href="https://jezebel.com/all-mias-children-the-tangled-branches-of-the-farrow-1516793360">name</a> Thaddeus used to be Gabriel, Dylan has gone by the names Eliza and Malone, Kaeli is now known as Quincy, and Summer is called Daisy.</p>
<p>Ronan was the genius of the family. As a boy he attended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Talented_Youth">Center for Talented Youth</a> a school for gifted children fellow alumni include Co-Founder of Google Sergey Brin, Singer Lady Gaga and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>At age 11 he took college classes at Bard College. In his final years of school, he lived in the home of a professor near campus. After graduating at 16 became an intern for Richard Holbrooke on the presidential campaign of John Kerry. He was to young to rent an apartment so he slept on the couch at Diane Sawyer and Mike Nichols <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/ronan-farrow-hollywood-prince-who-torched-castle-1073405">home</a></p>
<p>In 2008 at age18 he went to Yale Law School. Between the years of  2001 to 2009, he was a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth and made many trips to Darfur. In 2009 he joined the Obama administration. In 2011, Farrow was appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as her Special Adviser for Global Youth Issue and worked at the State Department along with her. A couple of pics of him with Hillary. <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5u6x.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/5u6x.jpg</a>
<a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5u6z.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/5u6z.jpg</a></p>
<p>After leaving government, in 2012 Farrow began a Rhodes Scholarship at Magdalen College, Oxford. He then started a career in journalism. He hosted Ronan Farrow Daily on MSNBC in 2014-2015. After that &quot;Undercover with Ronan Farrow&quot; on NBC\'s Today. In Oct. of 2017 he famously wrote the piece in the New Yorker that would bring down Harvey Weinstein and start the #MeToo movement.</p>
<p>His boyfriend is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lovett">Jon Lovett</a> Jon also volunteered on the John Kerry campaign. In 2005 he was hired as a speech writer for then senator Hillary Clinton.  He then became a speechwriter for President Obama for three years. In 2012 he moved to California to become a screenwriter. After the 2016 election of Trump he joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crooked_Media">Crooked Media</a> It was founded  by Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor, all former top Barack Obama staffers.

<p>Here is everyone\'s favorite part.. <em>speculation mode</em> Okay this is what I think, these guys are your new generation of Anderson Cooper, James Alefantis and David Brock etc. I am in stronger in my belief that Ronan is MK Ultra and has been groomed since a child. I think this <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/05/richard-holbrooke-ronan-farrow-book-excerpt-218319">guy</a>was his handler.

            Thank you for your research on this post. Fantastic post. I have had my suspicions from the very beginning relating to his involvement, along with his mothers motives. As much as I am glad to see Harvey brought down, I felt much more was in play with this than we knew. It's not just a black and white picture as it's being portrayed.

              Did you know that Barack Obama's grandfather (his mother's father) was a CIA agent?

              Obama was a CIA asset himself, that much is known. How involved his mother and he were involved in CIA grooming (MK-Ultra and successor programs) is unknown.

            Ronan did  not need to be groomed or .subjected  to.MKUltra mind control to end  up where he is now.. He is part of the 50% of the population that favors Democrats, especially the Clintons and Obama  and  government  officials such as Strzok, Page, Comey, Brennan,  and  newsreporters such as Cooper Anderson, Rachel Maddow, etc. They can't all be MKUltra.  I t would not be surprising if his homosexuality was a factor in  choosing the other side.
           </p>
           <p>
            So who cares if he is ignoring pedo issues. He succeeded where no one else has in exposing sex abuse amongst  adults, first in the left wing film industry and now in the left wing  MSM. Shouldnt we be grateful for that?  Who knows, maybe pedophelia will be next especially since he has acquired credibility and an expose from him would have traction.
           </p>
           <p>
            On another note, the picture you discovered of him with Hillary as a young man has me 100% convinced he is Sinatra's  son when I previously thought he was a clone of his mother inasmuch I see no hint of Woody in him, thank god. I dont think his conception was revenge since Mia and Frank continued their relationship for decades per her own admissions. She would never abort a love child fathered by the love of her life.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am concerned about the increasing influence of the gay mafia. How in the world did 5% of the population become so visable and so powerful?  Support from  the 50% who are Democrats obviously and the blackmail that can be exerted  on  straight folks who stray.   And I suppose the "in your face"  pride tactics. Ronan is at least subdued in his private and professional life. Here's hoping that the scourge of pedophiles comes onto his radar screen in the very near future.

              i dont think woman belong in the home except where there is child rearing tk be done). But I agree that so many in the MeTwo movement  in  the.film industry are sluts. So if you can only work by having sex with the bosses, quit your ambition for fame and fortune and train to become a pilot (shortages) or an orthpedic surgeon (more workplace shortages).or an engineer shortages again). or a plumber (lots of shortages and the pay is good) .  You dont dven want to hera my opinion on Asia and Rose!

                :  I followed those two carefully after the Weinstein thing in an  effort to.understand how they were exploited and Asia pricked my interest again after Bourdoins' suicide. I even followed her instagram account which went thru some changes as the public began to scrutinize her. I dont know how this relates to Pizzagate but I sure would love to see them exposed. There is another gal with super fat lips whose name I can't recall and she is of the same ilk. .Just google their names and add the terms - nude photos-  and you will see more than what "images" alone would reveal.  Harvey is a pig but I don't think he treated his wife-to-be that way.  I think he felt that he had a chance to score with some of these women and obviously succeeded. And Im a  woman!  And an old one at that.  You didnt see that kind of vulgarness during the 1960s sexual revolution.

               you are smoking crack if you think there are many women intelligent enough to be surgeons or engineers; those careers have been not only opened but actively subsidized/pushed on them for 50+ years but THEY DONT WANT THEM because theyre too demanding of time and study.  and PLUMBER?? lmao get the fuck out of here with that
              </p>
              <p>
               a woman should be birthing and rearing at least 3 children, which is only possible by starting in the fertile years of 18-26 and will take 10-15 years, during and after which there are manifold community-based productive activities for them that are much more beneficial than competing with their own brothers and husbands in the labor market.
              </p>
              <p>
               thanks to women working, birth rates are on extinction-pace everywhere except black Africa.  part of the NWO plan.

               reevaluate your worldview to match reality: women CANNOT 'have it all' nor is it humanity's responsibility to give it to them.

                you are the one smoking crack. there are plenty of women flying jets, including fighter jets. And probably more female surgeons than female pilots. More females graduate high school.and college than males ( which should alarm us) . Our large metropolitan area has female plumbers playing the woman card with pink panel trucks.
               </p>
               <p>
                But you missed my point which is dont sing us a song about ruined movie careers especially at a young age because of men like Weinstein. Go out and get a real.job!

            He's part of the political gay mafia he will only report on powerful men who abuse women as part of their business he won't ever report on Kevin Spacey abusing young boys or Bryan Singer raping young boys or David Geffen or Dan Schneider. Ronan is strictly queer and he only wants to expose men like Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves it's obvious now.

            Pretty convincing evidence that Ronan is definitely not "one of us". So #metoo is Deep State damage control? Looks like Centre for Talented Youth is some kind of grooming school for future elite

              You can see that with the transgender and gender fluidity movements.  My own research corroborates the occultism that is behind this agenda:

            Ronan is Frank Sinatra's son and not Woody's.   Fairly obvious that's the case.   Likely his mother's revenge on Woody Allen as he was cheating on her (of and underage girls) during their marriage.   The underage girlfriend character in the film Manhattan was based on one of those side affairs Woody had.  Actual actress appeared in one of his films.
