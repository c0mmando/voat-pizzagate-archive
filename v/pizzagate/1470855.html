</p>
<p>We all share a certain innate feeling for what is right and what is wrong. Those of us who are not sociopaths anyway... And what has brought most of us here is that this is just too much. Many of us may have held back before, out of convenience or out of fear. Maybe because we thought it was futile but we can no longer consider that. And perhaps these sociopaths don\'t understand that. The fact that most of the establishment in our society is run by sociopaths has been obvious to anyone who has not been drinking the MSM cool aid. How could you send even one man to die based on a lie unless you were a sociopath? Young brave people who offer their lives to serve their country! Instead they end up killing innocent people and dying as pawns sacrificed in a game where some depraved sadistic scum argue over resources and territory. Maybe these sociopaths don\'t understand how much outrage we feel when you hurt children. When you RAPE CHILDREN! When you make SEXUAL &quot;JOKES&quot; about infants it is wrong! You may not see that but we do! When you put children in an enviroment with bands like &quot;SEX STAINS&quot;  and that disgusting Heavy Breathing&quot; or &quot;Majestic ape&quot; with some sick artwork on display something is wrong! If any restaurant in my neighbourhood that was marketing itself to children would post pornography on their instagram with pizzas covering the genitals leaving little to the imagination, something is off! Yet we are being told that we can not investigate this!? That it\'s dangerous?</p>
<p>I do not condone violence or threats to the safety of those that have come under scrutiny for these things, but we definitely expect some better answers than those blatant hit pieces screaming &quot;FAKE!&quot; in unison while omitting every legimitate reason that is causing millions of people worldwide to be extremely concerned about this case.</p>
<p>My life was turned upside down on the fifth anniversary of 9/11 when I saw a documentary about the attacks that some guy handed to me on the street and told me to watch. I would have laughed it off probably a few months earlier but I\'d just started realizing how grotesquely we were being lied to about the Iraq war that I thought... well? who knows? After watching it I was so shocked and so disgusted. How could they do such a thing? And... how could they do such a thing?! Both interpretations of the question were puzzling to me... How could they bo so evil? How would it even be possible? All this collusion for something so evil?!</p>
<p>And what had struck me as the most disturbing part was how obvious it was once you really started looking into it. I felt stupid haven\'t just believed the official story without thinking! Because I had been told it\'s what happened. But it wasn\'t just that. My parents had told me to trust the teachers who had told me to trust the school books who told me trust the news. And I know not to trust the ads but they all seem so happy and smiling so it all filters through in some ways.</p>
<p>I ended up going crazy with it. Everyone I knew had to know. I started handing out the CD\'s, calling news stations, putting out stickers and researching every day more and more. And in that traumatized paranoid mindset you\'re not sure what to believe. You enter this territory where no distinction that was there previously remains valid by default. This guy tells me AIDS is a conspiracy... hmm.. probably somehow then? Better watch this documentary. I don\'t know... that sounds pretty convincing but I\'m no doctor and I don\'t know how to double check a lot of these arguments. Better ask this acquaintance what he makes of it. Next I know he\'s telling people I said AIDS was a conspiracy! I don\'t know... I didn\'t really say that... I just asked if it made sense that in 3rd world countries AIDS was spreading 50/50 gender wise and something like 90/10 for males in the Western world. And if that is true that would mean somethings up. But now everybody is starting to think I just believe every crazy conspiracy I hear about and so they don\'t want to listen to me about 9/11!</p>
<p>At first I naively thought people just needed to see the facts. If anyone saw building 7 go down they would have to realize right away that we were being lied to. Amazingly in many cases it wasn\'t enough. People saw it go down in what was obviously a demolition assisted by something other than gravity... and they just shrugged their shoulders and thought... yeah? I don\'t know... must be some other explanation. And then they would regurgitate this insane anti-scientific horseshit that was being paraded around as &quot;debunk&quot; material.</p>
<p>So many people I cherished, loved and respected turned deaf dumb and blind for the most stupifying things. And not only were people not convinced. A lot of them were angry! Some of them made fun of me, laughed at me! And it was a new experience for me. I had done great in school and had beaten regional math competitions and was generally seen as very intelligent and now I was being laughed at for apparently being stupid. I was also playing in a band and was just generally very socially accepted but because of this some people were turning against me. </p>
<p>I know many of you have similar experiences. Maybe some of you are just getting to know this now. Others may have been there to live through the JFK assassination. When you start to research that you start to realize that things have been twisted for a looong time. Most of us had just been hypnotized. </p>
<p>I basically spent the next 11 years just focusing on this. I had a blog which was focused on all these kind of things and I spent most of my energy trying to convince the whole world that 9/11 was an inside job. I learned about the satanism and occult rituals, secret societies and all that stuff to. The federal reserve scam was always a big priority but with the satanism stuff I was never completely sure. I knew there was something to it but wasn\'t sure how significant that aspect of it was. Since it was a topic that was difficult to argue or prove I didn\'t really highlight that as much as other things.</p>
<p>It\'s been 4 years now since I stopped actively engaging myself in trying to convince everybody. I\'d had to sacrifice too much for too long. It had caused me anxiety and a level of depression and poverty even I had not had to deal with before. After these four years of basically de-toxing from news and world affairs I was so out of the loop I wasn\'t sure if I wanted Hillary or Trump to win the election. I was very cynical about the whole thing, I consciously avoided getting into it. I was hopeful for a while that Bernie might win as I had always seen him as one of the few voices of reason in that filthy arena but I wasn\'t hopeful he would win. When Hillary predictably robbed him I thought the choice was between an Illuminati queen or a right wing nut job. That was how the media were portraying it at least and I just wasn\'t paying attention...  
</p>
<p>I did stay up to watch the election and as I was watching it I did slowly start to route for Trump. Just seeing these pundits squirm was enough to make me think that maybe those voices I had heard that he was actually going to stamp out corruption and be a good force for the people were true. I\'m not saying I\'m fully there yet but at least I\'m much more hopeful that he might be and I realize I had been completely misled about most of the arguments he had been making. A lot of his speeches in full context actually sounded reasonable and on times even encouraging. But then I\'m always cynical and I think we will see pretty quickly when he takes office whether he is just another pick of the establishment or something different. </p>
<p>What is more encouraging at least, and a great relief to me is that now I don\'t buy into that horrific scenario where Hillary, a person who I have hated with a passion for most of my adult life (I researched the wars in Syria and Libya extensively) and some racist right wing nuts. Having browsed the_donald at reddit since the pizzagate discoveries that it is not the impression I get at all.. They are indeed not homophobes, sexists, racist or literally a collection of the next Hitlers. Today I am at least very grateful that Hillary lost since obviously Trump at least represents some type of hope for something different. And if it\'s different... can it really be worse than child trafficking pedophiles?</p>

            (continued)
Right now it seems that the brutal gang of people that has been causing all life on this planet so much misery for such a long time is in panic mode. The possibility remains that this is all a part of their plot but I sincerely doubt it. I think it is unreasonable to assume that they are that good at what they do. Yes, they have done it for a long time but so have other dictators. For starters, these lunatics were going for world domination. And that, unless our history books are too grossly inaccurate has never truly been accomplished. They were also going against everything that is decent and human. Doing a great job at it considering the task. And well, you can see why they might have thought that they were able to do it. Your ego will surely get inflated when you have the power to send armies across borders and bomb countries into submission. After you can get populations to follow your lead or fall for your lies. When you have used your methods of coercion, blackmail, subversion and infiltration to successfully expand the reach of your sick organization to include entire continents.
           </p>
           <p>
            New technologies arrive and they think they can just adapt to it and use it against us. But we can also use technology against them. The internet is the most powerful surveillance tool ever devised but it is also a means to circumvent the previously established means of propaganda. This window is still open even though it has been increasingly restricted and "filtered" in the recent years. Today they are getting desperate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have played my share of games and watched my share of sports. When people get desperate it is never a sign that they are comfortable or doing well. The reason I think that this is not a psy-op is because I don't believe they would want to or feel like they are ready to play the "censorship" card. Not all the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            They can't censor us completely and they know it. They can try but they also know every time they do 10 more people get suspicious. It's in our nature. What is it there that I am not allowed to see? Why are they telling me it's dangerous? What is it that is so crazy that all these lunatics are freaking out about it?
           </p>
           <p>
            So we just have to keep at it and if we are inventive and creative, which is also in our nature this will be a cakewalk. Remember, we already have millions of people on our side. This is already much bigger than the 9/11 truth movement ever was and it is just beginning. Most supporters of the president elect of the United States are aware of this scandal and are promoting it. That is absolutely huge! People will continue to push this and the more they censor it we'll come up with new ways to promote it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are my recommendation for counterint the impending censorship:
           </p>
           <p>
            1 - Don't leave reddit yet, it is still a battleground. Get an account elsewhere but stay there too. Visit subs that aren't directly related to this but maybe vaguely. Find a way to drag the topic into pizzagate territory. I don't recommend using the word pizzagate since it will get you automatic downvotes. Find something that is related to whatever people are talking about that relates to another thing you saw. Find a way to mention this weird case about this woman, Laura Silsby who was arrested in Haiti for trafficking children. Or whatever, you catch my drift. Don't give them any reason to ban you, say things that are proven and sentiments most people agree with. Which should not be too hard in this case.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              We don't need to win the argument - Right now there will be people resisting this information, it's ok to tease them but don't be too mean to them. They are still in a coma but they will get there. Get them to agree to some  parts of the argument. So... at least you agree that maybe the Podesta brothers could testify what they were allegedly doing in Portugal around the time Madeleine McCann disappeared? So at least you think Bill Clinton is a pervert for going on the Lolita Express 26 times? So maybe there is some child trafficking going on and even if it has nothing to do with the owner of Comet Ping Pong we should probably get some better answers about this? 3. Freedom of speech is a big thing to people. Remind them that we should all have a right to discuss a topic. Even if one person reacts to something by doing something illegal it should not make the thing he reacted to illegal. Most people who research pizzagate have no intention, need or desire to anything illegal. Most of us, or I would estimate all of us treasure our life and security and to go on any sort of rampage would just feel exremely illogical and suicidal. Stress the freedom of speech angle. Ask them if they want  to live in a world where only the mainstream media is allowed to deliver news and everything else is censored and deemed "russian propaganda" or "slanderous and hurtful" or whatever the label they would use. Do they not lie to us enough as it is? Are people really so afraid and brainwashed that they think they must give up one of this most fundamental freedom we have because "otherwise" the fascists will take over? You can not get much more absurd than that.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Do it live - Don't be afraid to engage people about this topic. Especially people you trust. If they start huphing fake news or alt-right or whatever just tell them that it's not like that and it has nothing to do with politics. Call your local radio station and talk about it. You probably won't get suicided for it. There are so many people looking at this. They are more worried about those in law enforcement that are honest and know about this stuff by now. They worry about the people in media who don't want to participate in the cover up. And us. They worry about us too but it's hard for them. And we have to make it as hard for them as possible. If you are reading this you are doing so at your free will. The fact that we have what freedom we have is because people have bravely fought in the past to preserve it. That also means you have the power to effect the outcome of this battle. Even in just a small way every little thing matters. And if you believe like some do, that pizzagate is a "psyop" designed to justify censorship than you must also believe that you are a powerless being. That everything you and all the other people investigating this can come up with will fail. Because we know they are up to some serious shit and we are basically on to them! And if it's a psyop they really are some twisted people because it literally involves millions of people believing they are pedophiles! Would you sanction this psy-op if you were a power player like John Podesta? I don't think you would.

            It really is that simple. Print facts and post them around your neighborhood. Bus stops, next to concert ads, places like that. People will read them. You can even print out some of the pictures. You can buy cheap stickers in many places. A marker does a job. A pencil even. One idea that was circulating was to mark bills with it. More stuff like that is what we can do. If there are trays in your cafeteria leave a few notes on random trays that people will pick up. I'm brainstorming basically. Do that too. If you do graffiti, do graffiti about this. If you make music, put it in your song.

            We must say, ok, if you intend to censor me, then you must. But know that you have censored me and let it be known that you have robbed me of the freedom of speech. Make sure you give no legitimate reason to do this. Like I said. People will stand up for freedom of speech. Anybody who is not going to really should just shut up. There is some way to go yet so I recommend being patient. I know there is urgency involved since there is the ongoing threat to the safety of children, but just by investigating this and exposing it we are making it harder for these people to continue committing their crimes.

            This turned out a bit long but I hope some of you can relate to how I'm feeling. I'm really truly hoping that this is the start of a much brighter world for all of us. Let's make sure we do our part.
