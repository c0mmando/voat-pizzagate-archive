<p>Anyway, Easter is coming up and I was wondering if anybody in the Toronto area would like to meet me and have a Bible study.  I understand if you\'re reticent, especially given the recent dox.  However I would still like to meet some like-minded people.  Nobody at my local church wants anything to do with this terrible news, but perhaps some of you who know this terrible news would like to hear some good news?</p>
<p>If you are interested, send me a private message.  I will give you an code phrase you can use to identify yourself to me and so you can know what to look for at the library.  The deadline is Friday the 14th at midnight.  I will send you your phrase by the next morning.  (Ooh!  Nifty-cool spy movie stuff!)  You can also say how you\'d like to be addressed.  I assume you\'d prefer not to be known by your online handle and I shall also assume you are giving me a fake name.  No photographs please.  Any other precautions I should take?</p>
<p>You don\'t have to be Christian to attend, but you do have to be respectful.  If you want to start your own meeting of Athiests, Jews, or Muslims or what-have-you you can go out on a limb and create your own event.  Please don\'t hijack this one.  I will ask disruptive people to leave.   If you do attend and are not Christian, expect to hear the gospel.  
</p>
<p>It is a library so there will be a few Bibles on hand, but you may want to bring your own.  Also, since it\'s a library, there\'s plenty of opportunity for research on topics concerning the big Pizzagate conspiracy, especially that which predates the internet.  We can also compare notes.</p>
<p>If you are not in the Toronto area, consider hosting your own event.

             No. I have just been reading the Bible. I'm not really attending any church as I worry about corruption of the message. It doesn't help that so many churches qualify as lukewarm or believe in such things as Islamophobia. 
Furthermore many churches have odd associations to the number 666 in my vicinity. One is Catholic and has a Jesus statue out front at number 670. (The statue is at number 666). An Anglican church I've been to has a sticker for an electrician out front with 666 very prominently displayed in the number.  It also contains a small chapel with masonic images. Another Anglican church has 666 in their own phone number. 
I don't know much about 7th day adventist churches.
My general caution is to watch out for churches that serve men more than God. How does 7th day stack up?
