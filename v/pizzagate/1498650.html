<p>The first one is #carisjames. She has allegedly been identified as belonging to scott cummings and cc woolman. Although there is no actual evidence  of this it seems nor that they are the parents. There are a couple of FB photos someone linked but it is hard to tell if it is the same girl. If there is actual current evidence of her, please let me know. </p>
<p>But even if we did know who she is, the big issue I have is the deafening silence from the parents! This girl\'s featured in many pics on Alefantes\' Instagram. Her photos have been shared online by maybe hundreds of thousands of people every hour of everyday for weeks on end &amp; she is still not properly identified &amp; her parents have not made any public statement.  
</p>
<p>Would u allow the vile associations and accusations attached to those pics being shared - a million times over - go on and on for 2 months without speaking up? (they could even do it anonymously and still very loudly).  
</p>
<p>Secondly, all of her pics have a weird suggestive edge to them. There are none u could say are normal. But look at this one. <a href="https://i.sli.mg/bI5Gux.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/bI5Gux.jpg</a></p>
<p>Is it her? It could be. At first it looks like a kid just playing a game, but when I saw that dark creep #werkinonmahnightcheese \'liking\' it,  I wondered if there could be something more significant to it. Am i being paranoid highlighting the fact that she is making an X with her hands? X being not only the most prolific letter across the occult board, but also the clear symbol of Osiris - who has come up in the Podesta emails.   
</p>
<p>If u want to look further into the X symbol, there is so much attached to it in both modern and ancient occult systems:  <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/codex_magica/codex_magica11.htmhttp://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/codex_magica/codex_magica11.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/codex_magica/codex_magica11.htmhttp://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/codex_magica/codex_magica11.htm</a></p>

            That picture also reminds of the "butterfly" symbol used in pedophilia.

            In general, the people in this circle don't seem to find any of this disturbing, but instead approve of it. Someone just posted about workers at Comet Ping Pong saying its key to success is the trust between the restaurant and customers and that they look out for each other. So the people in these circles are drawn together by similar beliefs and interests.

            I think you are right about finding her.  The parents?  Anyone who lets that vile scumbag Alefantis near their child has to be suspect.

            This reminds me of one of the many Sandy Hoax anomolies:  There was a photo posted of one of the victims, a girl named Allison Wyatt....  on news site, not a random blog.  Later the photo was found to be of another girl entirely, one who had no connection to the event.  Her name was Lily Gaubert.  Her mother wrote to the page and immediately demanded they take the picture down, she is alive, etc etc.  The whole psy-op was so badly executed,  it looked like they wanted to be caught.
