              Nice find! I was just going to say this citizens investigation isn't solely about pedophiles and child trafficking....it also includes human trafficking....  but this is a million times better.

            The pimps are Black. The girls are White. Same story everywhere. If you actually read what rappers are saying, it isn't just meaningless words. They are intentionally talking about prostitution and pimping of women and children (and every other evil) because that is what they are doing. It is planned and coordinated but on a scale which is massive. The best place to hide a secret is in plain view. They do it behind closed doors but tell you about it openly. Rap is intentionally hard to listen to for White people because it is meant to make them turn it off while other Blacks and minorities listen. The messages are in there. It is just so hard for us to listen that we switch it off.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same method was used by death metal. The music was intentionally horrible to listen to and the words hard to hear because they were talking about crimes against humanity and Satanism. It isn't "artistic expression". Some of them are doing it as art of course, but many aren't. Many artists and musicians are engaged in a silent communication which is discussing and almost celebrating their crimes.

            Pizzagate has opened my eyes to see the truth that was there all along.

             I'm so happy that someone has the guts to say this. I don't think people realize that to poorer less fortunate people, selling drugs, and pimping is the only way to get rich and survive.

             Stop turning your hatred for rap into a conspiracy theory. This is the dumbest post I've seen on this subverse. No, hip hop is not a scheme for black people to pimp out white girls. Some may be sick spirit cooking fucks like Jay-Z, but the majority of them just wanna make music because they love music. Not everything's some grand scheme. You can't just generalize an entire genre like that.

              Wow, you are completely ignorant. It's right in front of you and you can't even see it.

              I didn't say all of them. But there is many in rap (more than any other genre). The vast majority are innocent (literally). Most of them are there to hide the real evil ones. The music industry is run by sick fucks. Also, it's not just rap. You might have noticed I said.....
             </p>
             <p>
              I also mentioned Death Metal has the same problem. I wasn't saying that it was any genre in particular. It's many genres in the music industry and it is a small but significant percentage. It is because Satanism became the cool thing in the music industry in the 1980's. All the Record Producer Companies have Satanic heads. Crowley is their hero.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look at bands/artists like The Beatles, Madonna, Oingo Boingo, Sia, Led Zepplin, Kanye, Black Sabbath, Rihanna, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus - the all have Satanic or pedophilac imagery in their videos. Many of our most popular movies have pedo and Satanist symbology in them and you don't have the eyes to see it. Crowley is hugely influential in Hollywood, and the music industry. Most of the chart topping groups for the past 40 years have been Crowley style Satanists.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't need to prove to you Satanism is big in the Music Industry. It takes a small amount of research to see it and then you will see it everywhere. There is a huge subset of every genre which has Satanism in it today and sex trafficking/pedophilia is huge among Satanists. They aren't even trying to hide it. It's out there for anyone to notice.
             </p>
             <p>
              For example, to get on his label, Rick Ross literally rapes rappers to initiate them. The young rapper has to engage in homosexual activities to bind him into the group. It is part of controlling them.

               I'm not saying there's no shady satanic shit going on in the music industry. They're definitely is. But I'm positive things aren't as black and white as you think. You lump Kanye in there when he tried to speak out about this kind of shit. The dude released an album almost entirely about god last year, he risked his reputation to expose the lying MSM and Pizzagate and (((they))) hospitalized him for it. It's not an issue you should take one look at and decide to demonize people over.  We aren't the only good people in the world. Sometimes good people make it, and they stay that way. (See: Trump)

              It's not just Blacks. We all know White Pedophiles, Talmudic Jewish Pedophiles and Muslims are involved in this too. However, the prevalence of Black pimps isn't even in question by anyone. Pimps are a subculture of Black America. EVERYONE KNOWS AND ACCEPTS THAT FACT.
             </p>
             <p>
              This area of Detroit is known for the Pimping subculture there! Detroit and Chicago were the biggest havens for this type of prostitution starting in the 1980's. You must know absolutely nothing about African American Culture if you don't know that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Besides, I was making a comment about the music industry in general as evidenced by my reference about DEATH METAL - WHICH IS 99% WHITE! You fucking SJWs are always looking for shit to get upset about. Well, shut the fuck up. This is reality. Black men prostitute White girls. I don't care if it is racist to point that out.
             </p>
             <p>
              You missed the point of the post entirely and focused just on me being a racist. Well, so what? How does that help those poor White girls from being victimized by those immoral niggers?! You degenerate piece of shit!
             </p>

                Wouldn't it be better to just acknowledge the problem and deal with it head on with out the conversation degenerating into a discussion of White supremacy all the while these girls are being victimized? It's better to just say exactly what is happening.

                Look at all the White pedophiles. You don't have a problem with me saying that almost every White pedophile in the Washington area works in the government do you? I notice a trend of White pedophiles and government jobs. Are you going to call me out for my racism against White pedophiles? No you aren't. You fucking hypocrite. So when I say a group of degenerate Black men are victimizing White girls try to focus on the solution rather than one of the details or footnotes in the problem.

            Guys this action parallels Jericho in the bible... Save that we must sound a Megaphone and not a Horn..  Keep marching, keep spreading the word.  Tab over to twitter, facebook, etc and spread the fire... THE PUBLIC IS RECEPTICE TO PIZZAGATE WHEN AUTHORITIES ARE ARRESTING EN MASS!!!  To get the kingpins we need mass awareness of their crimes and now is time to sow the seeds of their culpability to the masses as many will wake up form it now!

            There are so many of these.  It must have been planned or coordinated , not just random.
