<p><em>DC\'s newest collective</em>, <strong><em>Captain 20s Children refuses to  identify its membership.</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>At the group\'s debut last Saturday night at Logan Circle\'s Transformer</em>, <strong><em>only the masked &quot;Majestic Ape&quot; stepped forward</em></strong> <em>to welcome visitors.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>The group\'s six other contributors refused to say who they were.</em></strong></p>
<p>... <strong><em>they\'ve engineered a secret society-cum-cult named for the afternoon TV emcee Captain 20</em></strong>.</p>
<p><em>They claim some members aren\'t aware they belong to the group.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You\'re not supposed to know,&quot; Magik says. &quot;You\'ll find out when you find out.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The group\'s one-room installation at Transformer, their &quot;</em><strong>recruitment center</strong><em>,&quot; mimics an after-school clubhouse.</em></p>
<p><em>They keep a groovy red light on in the &quot;</em><strong>recruitment center</strong><em>.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Their handbook encourages members to drink grape soda and ward off &quot;comas,&quot; the shut-down &quot;mental parasites&quot; lurking among them.</em></p>
<hr />

<p>All this Captain 20 business refers back to an old children\'s tv show from the 60\'s-80\'s:</p>

<p>&quot;Captain 20 was also involved with a series of prime time specials that were produced and promoted in cooperation with various school districts. These included... Monsters, Magic and Make Believe&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>But here\'s where it gets interesting:</p>
<p>On The Apes web site, there is a three page brochure called Baba\'s Mountain</p>

<p>This flyer, making reference to Captain 20, encourages children to get on a bus, escape the &quot;comas&quot;, and get away to &quot;Baba\'s Mountain&quot; for an all-night celebration on the last Saturday in October.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You have heard rumors of those gone missing: Adolescents, leaving their homes, wandering into the night and never being seen again. The melting of children into feed for the woodland animals. Please ignore these rumors - rumors created by your teachers, the local media, parental figures.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Who are the Comas? They are your parents.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>So, here we have The Apes, and Majestic Ape itself, attempting to lure children away at Halloween and <strong>telling them that their parents are the enemy</strong>.</p>
<p>And here we have <strong>Majestic Ape leading a secret society connected to all this, with a &quot;recruitment center&quot;</strong> -- at Alefantis\' gallery, Transformers DC  !!! Note that &quot;recruitment center&quot; is <em>their OWN verbiage</em>.</p>
<p>The same Majestic Ape who features in the following video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicUO0sz08c&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicUO0sz08c&amp;t=1s</a></p>
<p>Here are those images slowed down for you:</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/a/VCiauL">https://sli.mg/a/VCiauL</a></p>
<p>By the way, featured among these images are pictures of Sathya Sai Baba, who was accused of sexual abuse of children and youth. Hence the &quot;Baba\'s Mountain&quot; theme.</p>

<p>I would love to know if that brochure was distributed to children who attended the exhibit. I would be interested to know if any children were given links to the Apes web site or if they signed up with personal information to join the &quot;Club&quot;.</p>',

            Transformers needs to be looked at. I went on their website one night and found their past exibitions. The next night, gone. It's no longer searchable. I found an exhibit I looked into called Cult something or other with artists Zach Storm and Cheyenne Seely. "DARK ORGANICS" I think it was called. Zach Storm brought up a few artist interviews and some pics of his work but Cheyenne Steely doesn't seem to be out in the spotlight much. Through my usual people search portals it didn't seem that she had family. She went to college via an artist grant but I found her work rather simple and her description of it peculiar. I'll post the screenshot. It's just weird that their past exhibits are no longer searchable via the website.
