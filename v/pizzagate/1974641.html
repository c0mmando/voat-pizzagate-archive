<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/HennyPenny">@HennyPenny</a> noted that Kelsey Mulka works for the Institute of International Education. I was able to confirm that through this link: <a href="http://archive.is/GNbgQ">http://archive.is/GNbgQ</a></p>
<p>If you look at their Board of Trustees, you will see two pretty big names....Henry Kissinger and Mika\'s daddy Zbigniew Brzezinski. Also interesting is that Jeffrey was also a Trustee since 2001 according to his bloomberg bio: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=5939910&amp;privcapId=4251721">https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=5939910&amp;privcapId=4251721</a></p>
<p>This proves nothing of course, but just find the connection pretty interesting.</p>
<p>You guys should follow <a href="https://voat.co/user/realMattCouch">@realMattCouch</a> on twitter. This guy is on the ground investigating the Seth Rich case and is putting out some new and good info. They are headed out to D.C. in less than 48 hours to up their investigation and are doing live periscopes most of the day. Highly recommend following him if your interested in the Seth Rich case.</p>
<p>Matt had a periscope where his sources in D.C. had confirmed that Seth Rich and Mulka had been broken up for several weeks at the time of his murder. <a href="https://twitter.com/RealMattCouch/status/881284780867940352">https://twitter.com/RealMattCouch/status/881284780867940352</a></p>
<p>Matt didn\'t confirm a source as his source wanted anonymity for obvious reasons, but what adds extra light to his supposed theory is that Lee Stranahan, another truthseeker, had contacted Matt Couch when he saw his post about Mulka and Seth being broken up.He confirmed with Matt that he received a tip a few months ago by a DIFFERENT source who also confirmed they had been broken up. <a href="https://twitter.com/stranahan/status/881931979956121604">https://twitter.com/stranahan/status/881931979956121604</a></p>
<p>So here we have two different sources at different times, saying Mulka and Rich were no longer together for weeks prior to his death. Now, if true, this doesn\'t mean he wasn\'t still talking to her and fighting with her on the phone. But what\'s odd is why would his family and Mulka present herself as his girlfriend, when they had been broken up for weeks, Joel going so far as to say they were leading towards engagement? Its very possible Seth never told his parents about the break up, but what is Mulka\'s excuse for portraying herself to be hurt so bad she won\'t speak to investigators?</p>
<p>Add in the fact she has changed her story in saying she hung up thinking nothing was wrong and at another time saying she heard something and was alarmed. And it makes you wonder, should Mulka be investigated more? At what point is it necessary to move past the &quot;I\'m not answering questions, I\'m still mourning the loss&quot;. Could it be she is avoiding talking because she knows more than she is telling us?</p>
<p>If Mulka is so distraught at the loss of Seth, then why less than three weeks after his death is she out there throwing a &quot;Make your friends Squirm&quot; Birthday party? <a href="https://twitter.com/RealMattCouch/status/881658773907034112">https://twitter.com/RealMattCouch/status/881658773907034112</a>   I understand people mourn in different ways, but if she was broken up, changed her story on her boyfriends death, and is out partying less than three weeks after his cold blooded murder...then I just find it hard to believe this girl. Especially when she chooses a place of employment whose trustees include three D-bags in Kissinger, Brzezinski, and Epstein. </p>
<p>And I will leave you with this other tidbit found courtesy of Matt Couch....a pic of Lisa Kountoupes hanging out at the exact same place Mulka threw her little bday bash. <a href="http://archive.is/Yeumu">http://archive.is/Yeumu</a>  I imagine a place like this wouldn\'t have too huge of a base. Wouldn\'t doubt it if Mulka and Kountoupes have crossed paths there or even crazier...know each other. Oh how insane it would be for Seth Rich\'s ex-girlfriend, the one with the inconsistency in her story over Seths last moments of life, is actually friends with a woman whose husbands was quite possibly there at his last moments of life. Very ironic...don\'t ya think?</p>',

            Some questions before I begin to follow Matt Couch...
           </p>
           <p>
            Is Matt Couch a Jew?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is Matt Couch a Tranny/Gay?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is Matt Couch a Satanist?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is Matt Couch Military Intelligence?
           </p>
           <p>
            If those answers are no then I might think about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looks like he has Military friends on his "team" and wants money...

            I believe that George Webb's current theory is that both Eric Braverman and Seth Rich were somehow Mossad agents who were leakers, and the Guccifer stories were used as covers for these leaks. Seth Rich's murder was faked to make him disappear after he stole information for Hillary.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is where I get confused: Eric Braverman was leaking, but then he was rendered by the CIA/FBI/??? in NYC when the bombs went off.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think George Webb knew that they were both Mossad back when he deleted his first 50 videos talking about Mossad. He thought he gotten to close to the ultimate conclusion too fast.
           </p>
           <p>
            I find the whole thing confusing so if someone can do an explain-like-I'm-five, I would love that. I haven't been able to keep up with George and Jason since they started doing such long live streams.

             I believe Webb reads this forum and others like it to determine how he is going to draw out his "narrative".  He, and those of his ilk, are trying to target the grassroot researchers who partake in the authentic crowdsourced investigations.

             Yeah it will be fun to see what he does in D.C. I know he wants to talk to a few of the connected people like Capone and a few friends. He seems to be receiving lots of tips too. One of his sources, although unconfirmed, had given them a tip that Seth was Bound, beaten, subdued, and had markings on his wrists from something like cuffs. They confirmed he was shot 3-6 feet away, and also that two nearby ATMs had their cameras wiped clean. If this is all true, then the botched robbery theory goes out the window. You gotta be somewhat a skilled felon to wipe Video from an ATM clean and find and discard the shell casings after the firing, all within just a few minutes before the police arrived. This was planned...that is of course...if Matt's source is true.

              I heard somewhere that he was beaten up and all that too. That will be interesting. Does he believe that one theory could be that Seth Rich is still alive? Is his mind opened to that as a possibility?

               He was buried at Beth El Cemetery, as noted here:
               <a href="http://www.jewishomaha.org/jewish-press/2016/07/seth-conrad-rich/">

               </a>
               (towards the very end it mentions beth el cemetery off 84th and L St)
              </p>
              <p>
               This is the Beth El Cemetery site, which shows near 84th and L St.

              <p>
               Here is the cemetery search on their site:

              </p>
              <p>
               If you search for Seth Rich or Conrad Rich or even just Seth...nothing pulls up at all.  Which makes you wonder...why not? His father was a chairman at the church previously, perhaps he pulled some strings to keep his son's info private to avoid any attention from the public. If so, then nothing crazy there. But maybe he isn't listed because he isn't there...that would add a whole lot more confusion to the already perplexed case.

               He has mentioned his sources have all pretty much said they know he died, but of course thats all speculation until a death certificate can be shown. But he isn't entirely shut off from the possibility that he is alive. I believe he died too, just from what I have researched, but the one thing that still rubs me the wrong way, and is one of the few reasons I think theres a possibility he's alive is that he is not listed in the cemetery records for the synagogue he was buried at.

            Great post, OP!
           </p>
           <p>
            As I've been saying on here for MONTHS,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Seth Rich is not DEAD sans a Death Certificate and an Autopsy Report.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              He is likely MOSSAD and is back in ISis-amenRA-ELohim.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Kelsey's "grief" was entirely faked; I posted a video of her "crying" that was downright LAUGHABLE!!'
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeKg_h0dCp8&amp;t=1276s">
             Seth Rich "Murder"
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't forget that
            <strong>
             <strong>
              AS A BOY, SETH RICH HAD A "HORSEPLAY" PHOTO TAKEN WITH BILLIONAIRE WARREN BUFFETT.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            There are definitely some connections there.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Marc Rich (Reich)?
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            AGAIN, SETH RICH IS NOT OFFICIALLY DEAD.  Which is why I haven't wasted one millisecond researching his "murder" (and I am a seasoned investigator of murders).

            Re: Seth and Kelsey, I kept saying they were broken up and kept getting pushback on this point. The thing is if they were broken up, then his roommate saying that Seth had walked home from his girlfriend's really puts a new spin on thing because it would point at another girl that hasn't been spoken about. Unless his roommate was an asshole and didn't know what he was talking about.

            I did see some of Matt Couch's tweets. What put me off was his working with George Webb. Instant invalidation.

            <p>
             The guy has put up so much good info and is bringing lots of light to the case...just because he had a talk with George Webb doesn't mean everything he says going forward is not valid. But there ain't anything wrong with questioning the guy either.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also isn't working with Webb, as he has his own investigative team. I think they may have done a periscope and is having lunch with webb. I wouldn't necessarily call that working with him. He is also meeting with Lee Stranahan who is pretty credible, so I wouldn't write off Matt Couch just yet.

              Unfortunately, part of establishing cred is who you associate iwith. I'm doing the same thing ithe Cernovich and his alliance with AJ. I'm like WTF? I haven't written off Cernovich, but it is mighty peculiar that he'd choose to align himself with AJ.

              I heard him talk about PizzaGate and how ludicrous it was, but this was around new year. Has he changed his mind?

             Where did you see that he walked home from the girlfriends by the roommate? I thought he talked on the phone with her during his walk home from 2 to 4 am, and that she was in Michigan at the time.

              The thing is, IF he was indeed broken up with Kelsey, then why did his parents stick with that narrative? So many bizarre twists to that story.

               this is the same article, so its not clear where he was walking from. I would imagine the father and the girlfriend talked to eachother in the aftermath of his shooting.  Other accounts I read the girlfriend claimed to be in Michigan that night so maybe the roommate didn't know that? Roommate doesn't seem to suggest they were broken up though. Maybe Seth had keys and went there even though she was not home, to water plants or something?  It seems like it would be easy to establish exactly where Kelsy was whether they were broke up or not; so its weird that there is no consensus. And how would the roommate know this if Seth was dying on the street. Did they talk that night? We need the phone records!
              </p>
              <p>
               But if they were broke up, why? Seems like one of those on again off again relationships. could it have anything to do with him being the leaker and was she brought in to help take him out? All of it is strange.

                You completely missed my point. I mean, entirely ... here is the point I was making. And if you don't get it this time, no, I won't explain it again. This is what I was trying to say:

                IF Seth and Kelsey were broken up then the roommate could be referring to ANOTHER GIRL THAT SETH WAS DATING.

                 no, I got that point. Sorry, I understood you at the time, but its clear that Seth was on the phone with Kelsey. Nobody debates or refutes that detail, so he was still talking with Kelsey even if he had someone new in the works as you suggest.  Have you heard anything about how is Seth connected to Claudia Kash  who texted about the polling duplicity? I tried to dig into that and it seems to be an alias for a woman now currently in Europe.

                  Yes, but the phone conversation doesn't have anything to do with where he was walking from. And it doesn't have anything to do with why he was so drunk. I think that's the main thing I'd like to know ... whether his bloodwork shows anything other than alcohol.

                  No, I did not look into Claudia Kash. Don't know anything about her.

                   I know. Its completely aggravating. I suspect there are a lot of people who know exactly what happened to Seth Rich, and they aren't saying a thing.

                   Claudia Kash seems to be a journalist  located in Europe, there are variations of her name connected to some instagram type accounts. It was a couple months ago that I looked.  Nothing  else I could find from her referenced Seth Rich or DNC, I was thinking she could have been a girlfriend, but her picture history has a different guy who looks nothing like Seth. How she figures into things is another big huge question mark.

                    It may also be disinfo. Not saying it is, but why hasn't she surface before? I'm hoping at least the reports the Profiling Project is successful. Find out the name of the hospital, see the ballistics report, et. Start with the facts that have been being obscured.

                     I just looked to see if there was any new stuff on her. she was the one who posted the explanation that Seth discovered fake polling places (her reason for suspecting his murder, that he was going to expose this). Her alias or real name is Claudia Klava.

                     It would be so much easier to find the killer if the family would release the Death cert and hospital records, I can only speculate why they do not.  :(

            I stopped believing Seth Rich was murdered after his brother laughed through the interview after Seth's death. It was completely ridiculous and reminded me of the Sandy Hook parent who laughed all the way up to the microphone to talk to the press...........about his daughter being killed with an assault rifle.

             Seth RIch is a jew, so no surprise that he's faking his death. He was probably in legal hot water of some kind, probably for raping children, as the jewish 'holy book" openly condones. It's time to kill this subhuman inbred dog shit, every single one of them.

               The Jew bashing seems like a shill strategy to derail legitimate questions. Zionist Jews are definitely worth looking into, but to try and smear the entire Jewish population is just ridiculous.

             Yeah that was pretty odd behavior. This whole thing is just all over the place. Parents, girlfriend, Capone all changing stories..brother laughing while talking about his brothers murder. Add in all the other stuff being withheld by the police and it really makes this a pretty damn interesting case.

              the police changed their story too. First they said that officers in the vicinity heard the shots and responded. Later they amended the report to claim that officers responded to a report from ShotSpotter technology.

            We really need access to his phone records and confirm the long 2-4 am phone call. Everything about Seth Rich's death is weird and every new bit just raises more and more questions. Kelsy working with that triumverate can/could be a coincidence only because her networking circle was all DNC/cia in the first place, but certainly it doesn't look good. Maybe that's why she is staying quiet. Maybe she knows something and doesn't want to end up dead too.
