            Have to thank you for this post.. because I found another one where we discussed Cartagena and in the comments section I linked back to our friend in DC :

            I believe we may have some more  pieces to the trafficking network puzzle which includes the John of God and Wisconsin posts:

             <p>
              Update:  I just googled South America and yachting to get:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               South America Luxury Yachting Guide | Northrop &amp; Johnson -
               <a href="https://www.northropandjohnson.com/our-company/superyacht-brokers-history.htm">
                https://www.northropandjohnson.com/our-company/superyacht-brokers-history.htm
               </a>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I don't know them but the names Northrop and Johnson certainly jump out.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then I checked of there is a connection with C2C.. from their Linkedin page:
              <a href="https://www">
               https://www
              </a>
              . linkedin.com/company/c2c-inc/about/
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               C2C is a known entity to the major management companies such as Fraser, YCO, IYC, Edmiston, Watkins, Dohle, Northrop Johnson, Burgess, Camper Nicholsons and more.  Our clients are typically over 300 gross tons and include some of the largest yachts in the world up to 10,000 gross tons.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              So, I'd say, that may be another place to look.

              It's complicated... but I can say for now have a look at the St. Thomas Yacht Club which is intimately connected with Epstein and a business that he has that I haven't yet seen reported on and also look at the exclusive New York Yacht Club.  Need to explain more in a post.

             <p>
              Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen (About this soundlisten (help·info); née Albrecht, 8 October 1958) is a German politician serving as Minister of Defence since 2013.
             </p>
             <p>
              She is married to Heiko von der Leyen, a professor of medicine, the CEO of a medical engineering company and a member of the von der Leyen family, an aristocratic family noted as silk industrialists.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ursula von der Leyen was brought up in Belgium and speaks both German and French at a native level, as well as English.. In 1977, she began studying economics at the University of Göttingen, later[when?] transferring to Münster and then the London School of Economics[when?]. While studying in London in 1978, she used the pseudonym "Rose Ladson", because she was seen as a potential target for West German left-wing terrorism.[11] and "Röschen" ("Rosie") has been her nickname since childhood.[12] In 1980, she switched to studying medicine and enrolled at the Hanover Medical School, where she graduated in 1987 after seven years and acquired her medical license.
             </p>
             <p>
              From 1988 to 1992, she worked as an assistant physician at the Women's Clinic of the Hanover Medical School. Upon completing her postgraduate studies, she graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1991. From 1992 to 1996, following the birth of twins, she became a housewife in Stanford, California, while her husband was a faculty member of Stanford University.  From 1998 to 2002, she became a faculty member at the
              <strong>
               Department of Epidemiology, Social Medicine and Health System Research at the Hanover Medical School, where in 2001, she earned a Master's degree in Public Health.
              </strong>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I find it very interesting that a background in Epidemiology and Public Health prepares one for the role of Minister of Defense.

               According to Google, Global Foundries is owned by Mubadala Investment Co.
Then I found this article

                linking Mubadala to Rothschild &amp; Co
               </strong>
               . It doesn't seem to involve semiconductors, so how it all connects, or if it even does, I don't know.

                The Patrons of the Arts in the Vatican Museums is a group of people dedicated to preserving the vast and unique collection of art housed in the Vatican Museums. The patrons have been in existence since 1982 when a major exhibition from the Vatican went to the United States: New York, Chicago and San Francisco. At that time some interested people began to help us with the restoration of works that left the Vatican for that exhibition. Since then the number of patrons has continued to grow.

                Tracking Iraqi Fraud and Corruption
               </p>
               <p>
                One day, not so long ago, the US State Department handpicked Texas-based DynCorp for an $800-million contract to train over 100,000 Iraqi police officers, a top-priority project of the Bush administration’s effort to stabilize the war-torn country and strengthen the fragile civilian government there. But State Department wanted a contractor with strong ties in Iraq, so DynCorp obligingly teamed up in 2004 with a company known as Corporate Bank Financial Service, a Washington-based business better known as The Sandi Group.
               </p>
               <p>
                After the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003, Sandi immediately opened shop in Iraq where he took control of major Baghdad hotels, a newspaper, and several banks. The one-time Kurdish resistance fighter also recruited an armed private security force with a payroll of 7,500, laid plans for establishing an Iraqi airline, and positioned himself for US-administered contracts in the reconstruction effort. Those contracts included dozens with DynCorp for construction projects, leases on posh hotels, security, logistics and other support services as needed.
               </p>
               <p>
                “Could You Determine Any Value Added?”
               </p>
               <p>
                All the while, The Sandi Group kept a low profile in Washington until its affiliate, Corporate Bank, was singled out in a February 7 Congressional hearing for its controversial handling of a multimillion-dollar DynCorp contract to build an Iraqi police training camp in Baghdad near parade grounds of Adnan Palace, a once luxurious domed castle used by Saddam Hussein’s family.
               </p>
               <p>
                Two weeks after receiving the $55.1-million DynCorp contract in August 15, 2004, Sandi’s Corporate Bank hired an Italian company, Cogim SpA, for $47.1 million to do all the work in the contract, which included providing 1,048 living trailers and building an Olympic-sized swimming pool. On paper, the deal had the look of an effortless $8-million profit for Sandi at the US taxpayers expense -- just for being the middleman and flipping the contract to Cogim.
