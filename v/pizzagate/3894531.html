            Was anyone aware that DC police said they didn't think the gunman was related to Pizzagate? Some bluetick guy tweeted the quoted statement I think. I just saw it for the first time the other day and I can't even remember it. I'm such an idiot.

             The 8-pointed star has a deep history in Sumerian and Catholic traditions, and was famously used as the symbol for the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights of the Temple of Solomon, or the Knights Templar.

            First I've heard of either of these medieval Crusader orders using a star. I've only ever seen crosses associated with them. I'll give you our 24 Hours Grace flair, so you can add sources. Thanks.

             I’d consider the pointed star more of a side note rather than the meat of the thread (the forgery evidence proving false flag) in all honesty.

              Me, too. Unfortunately, if I leave this up, then ES/Nomo will come here with a sock puppet and push similarly unsourced ancient history about one of his pet peeves, and then whine about dishonest modding. We have to be consistent.

            Sorry, I'm not personally convinced by this. The star symbolism? Sure, you could be right, I can't say what intention is behind there.

           <p>
            But the photoshop? No, I've spent too many years doing that to know that those "squares" are an artifact of jaded, old jpeg compression. I don't know how much detail you want to hear before labelling me a shill, but simply put:

            - Notice how the items on the back of the truck also align themselves in squares, vertically fixed to the image, i.e, flat? And the shirt on his left shoulder? That's digital compression; there is pixellation and squaring on
            <em>
             every
            </em>
            edge of contrasting colours in the pic. That's how computers decrease the filesize for storage, by "blending" the edges and losing informating, without affecting basic, visible colours of the photo for the human eye. The resolution of the star is no different from the rest of the image, if you compare it with the grass and corners of the truck, so pretty much anything with hard shades. You can't tell resolution from an "error level analysis", you can usually just tell from looking. Same for the proportion of the symbol, it looks consistent to me in every iteration. Unfortuanely every one of these pictures is incredibly low quality and low res, so there's not much to go on. If there were signs of "blurring", smudging or cloning, preferrably in hi-def pictures, like in those of Ghislaine Maxwell, you'd have absolute proof.

            But either way it doesn't matter, it's what the star means that's important. Whether they are put there or actually worn, we know Welch had some dodgy connections so it's not a stretch to say he wore this symbol with intent on Knights Templar.

              Yes it was.  Most folks don't realize that the rifle wasn't chambered in 5.56.  It was chambered for 9mm, making a penetrating shot with enough kinetic energy left, after penetrating a door (likely solid core, not hollow door), to penetrate the metal PC tower case and the hard drive.  All in all a "lucky" shot, but highly improbable.

               I find baffling that you talk about bullet calibers and kinetic energy, yet you never bothered to fact check the "bullet hit the hard drive" story, that is not only baseless, but demonstrably false.

                 Haven't seen me around before? I find that hard to believe. Anyway it's irrelevant. You should focus at not being completely oblivious and so easily manipulated that you could hold a demonstrably false belief like the hard drive thing for years now.

                  Yeah, you've been trolling for a long time.  No, the bullet didn't hit a hard drive. Blanks in the gun (safety first!).  Someone snatched the hard drive in the "confusion" which contained the kiddie porn and CPP's operational details on it and got it out of CPP.  MPD got DDOT to change the cameras prior to the incident.  The control for all the cameras is located on the 4th floor of 55 M St SE.  EMW's father did hard time for pedo in OH.  Grandfather started a movie production biz called Forever Young Productions which is still an active corporation in the state of NC today. Any questions?
