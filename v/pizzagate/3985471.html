<blockquote>
<p>Goldbelly is a curated online marketplace for regional and artisanal foods crafted by local food purveyors throughout the United States....Founded as \'Goldbely\' by Joe Ariel, the company began its operation from a townhouse in Noe Valley in San Francisco with a four-person team of Ariel, Trevor Stow, Vanessa Torrivilla and Joel Gillman.[5][6][7][8] The site accepted into Y-Combinator in 2013.[9] Time Magazine named Goldbelly one of the 50 Best Websites of 2013.[10] In 2013, Goldbelly closed on $3 million seed funding led by Intel Capital.</p>
<p>In 2017 the company moved its headquarters from San Francisco to New York City.[13] In October 2018, the company changed their name from Goldbely (with one L) to Goldbelly (with two Ls), raised $20 million in Series B funding led by Enlightened Hospitality Investments, the fund formed by Danny Meyer\'s Union Square Hospitality Group, and had <strong>Danny Meyer</strong> join the company\'s advisory board.</p>

             Barry Sherman was Chairman and CEO of Apotex, a Canadian pharm corp. I was curious of whether they did any 'humanitarian' work overseas, and, lo and behold…..In September 2014, in response to the spread of the chikungunya virus in Haiti, Apotex worked with the humanitarian organization Direct Relief to donate more than $2.2 million in medical aid to the country.

               How To Be The Best Lover - A Guide for Teenage Boys
              </strong>
              ' is the first book that dares to tell teenage boys the deep truth about lovemaking and teenage sexuality. For young men who are coming of age, 'How To Be The Best Lover' is an important threshold in their rites of passage. Going beyond the sex talk, 'Best Lover' fills in the gulf between what I call the birds and the bees or 'Sex 101' books and the adult technique manuals. 'Best Lover' introduces teenagers to the heart of relationships - not shying away from telling them about oral sex or making love while at the same time introducing them to the complexities and responsibilities involved when you open yourself up to another person on this level.

'First Love' shows teenagers all of the different ways you can make the transition from being a virgin to entering into their sexuality, that it is definitely a big deal (and not a throwaway thing) and that they are not alone.

If we could make 'First Love' required reading for all teenagers, we'd be giving them the best gift as they begin entering into relationships."

              Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc. is an American television and radio broadcasting corporation based in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was founded by Stanley E. Hubbard. The corporation has broadcast outlets scattered across Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, and New Mexico, but the flagship stations are KSTP radio, KSTP-FM and KSTP-TV, which serve the Twin Cities region of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..KSTP is still Hubbard's flagship, although there are now three different stations that carry that name. KSTP-AM broadcasts a sports radio format, and KSTP-FM broadcasts adult contemporary music; KSTP-TV is affiliated with ABC...Aside from terrestrial broadcast stations, other current ventures include the film network ReelzChannel (launched in 2006), the arts network Ovation, and the Hubbard Radio Network, which is used to distribute KSTP's local talk shows to subscribing radio stations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The cable channels are run through subsidiary company Hubbard Media Group.&gt;In 1981, Hubbard Broadcasting started U.S. Satellite Broadcasting (USSB), and later was instrumental in the development and launching of the first digital satellite system for television in 1994. The new satellite could deliver 175 channels to a (at the time) tiny, 18 inch dish. USSB's development partner, Hughes Electronics (a General Motors subsidiary), launched their own subscription satellite service called DirecTV. The two services did not compete against each other (they carried different channels), and were often marketed together to subscribers by retailers and in advertisements until DirecTV's 1998 acquisition of USSB.

             <p>
              December 6, 2004—The manipulation of computer voting machines in the recent presidential election and the funding of programmers who were involved in the operation are tied to an intricate web of shady off-shore financial trusts and companies,
              <strong>
               shady espionage operatives, Republican Party politicians close to the Bush family, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contract vehicles.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Lemme was no stranger to Florida politics. His wife, Mary Ann, worked as a secretary for Martha Walters Barnett, a partner with the politically-connected Holland &amp; Knight law firm in Tallahassee, where she specializes in campaign finance and election law and government contracts. Another Holland &amp; Knight partner, Ginny Myrick, was appointed by Jeb Bush as the vice chair of the Florida Community Trust, a state land acquisition and grant program. Although officially a bipartisan law firm,
              <strong>
               even Democrats working for Holland &amp; Knight largely support Jeb Bush.
              </strong>
              In addition, Bill McBride, Bush's Democratic opponent in the 2002 gubernatorial race and a Holland &amp; Knight partner who had defeated former Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary amid reports of voting irregularities from around the state, commented that his race against Bush "may be the Democrats' race to lose."
             </p>
             <p>
              The NASA connection to the money trail that is linked to the development of the vote switching program is of particular note. When the first sketchy details of the vote switching operation emerged, a Houston-controlled money tranche associated with an offshore entity called Five Star Trust, registered in the Isle of Man, was reported by high-level intelligence sources familiar with past Bush-related covert activities to be behind the operation. Five Star has been connected by these informed sources to have originated in 1983, when deposed Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush were allegedly looking for a repository for an estimated $3 billion in looted Philippine gold and gems. Since that time, Five Star's accounts are said to funnel more funds from Saudi Arabia as well as cash reserves hidden away in offshore artificial shells by Enron before it collapsed. What is not yet certain is whether Sean O'Keefe, the NASA administrator and close Cheney friend who supported Feeney's and Yang's activities in Florida, facilitated the transfer of Five Star funds from Houston to Cape Canaveral using contract vehicles of both the Johnson and Kennedy Space Centers to disburse the funds to the principal players. A NASA insider in Texas said he has long suspected large amounts of money have been moved into the United States and that these transfers involved NASA and Saudi and Chinese money sources.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...Past elections must also be investigated and those who were done in by this fraud, namely, people like Max Cleland, Gray Davis, Al Gore, and others must also have their day in court.

            <p>
             Goldbely does everything but pack shipments for restaurants that use its services. For merchants like Wayne Mueller, third-generation owner and pitmaster of Louie, this has made processing orders more efficient. “We don’t have to take phone calls,” Mueller says. “It’s streamlined our operation and made it much easier to manage.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Goldbely is fairly unique, as far as online food services go — even as the on-demand food market balloons with endless sites and apps. Instead of delivering nearby meals (like Grubhub or DoorDash), the company mostly connects with small but popular restaurants to help them sell their products to anyone in the country. That, in turn, gives people the chance to try regional food from miles away, without leaving their homes (much like a discovery app, which connects its users with items they may have never heard about before based on their tastes).

            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not insinuating anything. I'm looking for criminal activity of people in our sights re elite pedos.  I've long observed that US presidents, past and present, often visit places for a reason even if it appears 'random' to the asleep.  And if you're getting upset because you think I'm pointing a finger at Trump, has it not occurred to you the possibility that he is doing a 'white hat' thing by pointing to something himself?

              Thanks for the additional information.  I fixed the last 2 links above.  Lari's link shows that he's connected to the network of people involved with Paul Evans who owns a number of moving companies.  They work with the royal family and he is a trustee of the Hampstead school where the two children said they were abused.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Dignity Health recently launched its Human Trafficking Response Program for medical professionals. The goal of this program is to ensure trafficked victims are identified in the health care setting and appropriately assisted with victim-centered, trauma-informed care and services.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dignity Health partnered with the Arizona Anti-Trafficking Network and TRUST, or Training and Resources United to Stop Trafficking, in hopes of tackling the issue with collaboration. “This issue is not something that one person, entity, or agency can do alone,” Stacey Sutherland, the programs director at TRUST, said.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Richard Solari was born on February 24, 1925, in San Francisco to Joseph Solari and Alene Murphy Solari of San Jose. After graduating from Watsonville High School in 1942, Dick attended Salinas Jr. College for a semester and then transferred to UC Davis where he studied for a semester before enlisting in the US Marine Corps. He attended Officers Training School in Quantico, Virginia and studied in Arizona and Louisiana and graduated as a First Lieutenant in the Marine Infantry.
             </p>
             <p>
              Upon his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps in 1945, Dick started a 50 year career with
              <strong>
               Granite Construction Company
              </strong>
              and eventually became president, CEO and retired as Chairman of the Board in 1995...Dick was a 4th degree member of the Knights of Columbus for over 60 years and served a term as Grand Knight of the Watsonville Council. He was also a member of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic Charity organization dedicated to caring for the poor and sick, and a member of the Resurrection Catholic Community.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dick's family has strong roots in the Pajaro Valley dating back to his great-grandfather, James Piratsky, who was an early day owner and editor of the Register-Pajaronian. Piratsky was named to the California Newspaper Hall of Fame. Dick served on the Monterey Bay Aquarium board for nine years following its opening in 1984. As a co-founder of the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County he served on the board for approximately ten years and chaired for one term.
              <strong>
               For 19 years he served on the Dominican Hospital Board and served a term as chairman.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Dick was vitally active in assisting various organizations that served the needs of the community including the Pajaro Valley Shelter Services, Loaves and Fishes, Second Harvest Food Bank, Rebele Homeless Shelter, Land Trust of Santa Cruz County, Elkhorn Slough Foundation, Monterey Bay Aquarium, Dientes, Cabrillo College, Hospice Caring Project of Santa Cruz County, and the Cabrillo Music Festival.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Dick's hobbies included tennis, golf, reading, traveling and fishing. In later years, Dick enjoyed membership in an industry association known as the "Broken Backs."

             Did you know you are now also somehow a new “rule” for censoring and removing comments as The Truth is banned from GreatAwakening? Go to removed comments on GreatAwakening and see.

            <p>
             There is a major event happening in Kenosha &amp; Racine right now, but you cannot mention Racine on GreatAwakening or you will be banned and threatened.

            <p>
             Everything told about Racine is The Truth.

              Maybe he will help out again. I know from researching that these areas are highly important for their operations. There are locations in La. St. Louis, 2 in Pa. Tex. Tampa Chicago. They are using these poor children with disabilities for profit. Huge profits. Freemasons. The highest order I believe is De Molay to which BC belongs. The list might surprise you.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             OLD FORGE — Arcaro &amp; Genell owner Angelo Genell has a special name for the back door of his restaurant.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            “We don’t consider that the kitchen door; we consider that the family and friends door,” he said. “Family and friends, they walk through the kitchen to come to the restaurant. Some restaurants put tables in the kitchen as a novelty, but people just come in there automatically.”
           </p>
           <p>
            That list of family and friends started in 1962 when Angelo’s parents Angelo and Marie Genell went into business with Marie’s brothers, Frank and Anthony Arcaro. They purchased Laurenzi’s Restaurant at 443 S. Main St., lent their surnames in alphabetical order and started a tradition that continues with Angelo and his brother, Mark.
           </p>
           <p>
            Angelo, 58, said 2018 marks 40 years working at the restaurant in an official capacity. He doesn’t count the years he wasn’t paid.
           </p>
           <p>
            “We lived upstairs, so we were always downstairs helping our family,” Angelo said. “The next thing you know, 40 years have gone by.”
           </p>
           <p>
            During that time, he and Mark learned the family recipes they keep alive today, including their pizza’s cheese blend, which Mark calls “top secret.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Angelo said their pizza’s popularity can be attributed to a number of things — its rectangular shape, its balance between heavy and light, its aforementioned cheese blend — but the most alluring aspect has nothing to do with the pie.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “Basically, I think it’s that you’re eating it in Old Forge,” Angelo said. “It’s a destination spot.” For Tunkhannock resident Kathy Williams, an Old Forge tray runs “nose and nose” with New York pizza — and she has the experience to weigh in on the matter. “I’m originally from New Jersey and I never tasted pizza like this. I love it,” Williams said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Old Forge is where Arcaro &amp; Genell plans to stay, too. Instead of opening more locations, Angelo and Mark have opted to expand the existing building, with a restaurant remodel and the addition of a takeaway counter, both completed within the last five years. Mark said the takeaway counter has been a success with customers able to grab everything from desserts and gift baskets to pre-cooked pizza.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Along with its Italian dining experience, Arcaro &amp; Genell also keeps another Italian tradition alive: bocce. The outdoor game, which originated in Ancient Rome, traveled with Italian immigrants to their new homes. Today, Angelo said it’s become a popular pastime at the restaurant.
           </p>
           <p>
            “We’re involved with the bocce leagues with the Sons of Italy in Old Forge, and it’s starting to be a place where a lot of people can have fundraisers and raise money in a fun way,” Angelo said. Angelo said he doesn’t think of hosting bocce leagues and
           </p>
           <p>
            perpetuating his family recipes as consciously keeping tradition alive. He said it’s something he and Mark do automatically. “It’s just part of your makeup. You can’t make that happen, you know what I mean,” Angelo said. “It’s just the way we were brought up.”
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s a list of kitchen-door-using family and friends who’d probably argue they were raised properly.

                I'm on the fence about him. Like everyone here I  was overjoyed when he won in 2016. Sometimes I think he's really working to expose the bastards and sometimes I despair at the people who work within his administration. I understand that bringing down a cabal does not happen overnight but I think it's important to adopt critical thinking.  I am critical of him sometimes and when I find articles on him that are factual and don't necessarily paint him in a positive light I pay attention to those too.  I believe that it is really up to us, the people, to haul the politicians up by their bootstraps and not to give someone a free pass because of political ideology. For me, the fact that he came in almost as an independent candidate and not as a traditional Republican is a positive. In this post, the way we went into that pizza place I see more as an indication that he has heard about it and was making that public.  I don't know if he was endorsing it.  Somehow I get the impression he was shining light there.  I don't know his reasons but I pay attention to current events. We're on the same team.

                 Thanks for clarifying your position and I agree that critical thinking is always important.  Regarding the pizza place, Trump's comments seemed pretty straight forward to me, it was a stop intended to take a political opportunity to

                 From reading the QRV post and yours, I did not get the impression that there is a case to be made against the pizza place in of itself, and to do so based on Trump's campaign stop there seems unfair to their business which appears thus far to be a legit family business.  That was in part, the basis of my complaint tbh.

                  Yeah, I agree it was more about Biden. That's why I included his name in the title.  I don't think Trump  was tracking the place back to Whinge and Cringe but the pizza places in that area have mafia connections and that's an interesting link.

                  <p>
                   The United States Senate election in Delaware, 1972 was held November 7, 1972. Incumbent Republican United States Senator J. Caleb Boggs ran for a third term in the United States Senate. Boggs faced off against Joe Biden, a New Castle County Councilman. Though Senator Boggs was expected to easily win a third term over the then-unknown Biden, it ended up being the closest Senate election in 1972, and Biden narrowly beat out Boggs by a little over three thousand votes, winning what would be his first of seven terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In 2004, admitted mafia hitman and former Teamsters Local 326 President Frank Sheeran alleged in his memoir that in the week prior to Election Day an unidentified representative of the Biden campaign (described as the campaign's legal counsel) approached him about preventing the distribution of the Wilmington News Journal because Sen. Boggs was running an advertisement unflattering to Biden. In exchange for undisclosed considerations and because Sheeran felt "Biden was better for labor anyway," the Teamsters Union allegedly organized a strike preventing the newspapers from being delivered and sabotaged a shipment of newspaper printing materials and preventing the Wilmington News Journal from being distributed in the week prior to Election day. Sheeran's accusation is unclear as to whether Biden himself was aware of the plot, but after the election Sheeran said he "could always reach out to [Biden] and he would listen."

             Turns Out Shake Shack Founder Took At Least $11 Million In Coronavirus Aid After All -
             <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/danny-meyer-union-square-hospitality-group-ppp-funds_n_5f0a80f3c5b67a80bc08810d">

             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Shake Shack made a big deal earlier this year of returning $10 million in taxpayer funds that it had obtained from the federal Paycheck Protection Program to weather the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. But founder Danny Meyer then scooped up at least $11.4 million for his other restaurant empire, Union Square Hospitality Group.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Twelve separate Meyer restaurants received PPP loans, including Blue Smoke, Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern.
             </p>
             <p>
              After news of Shake Shack’s PPP loan emerged in April, Meyer and CEO Randy Garutti announced they were returning the money because they didn’t want to gobble up funds for smaller companies. The company instead planned to raise $75 million from investors by selling shares, CNN reported at the time.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Shack Shack — and Union Square Hospitality Group — relief funds are at the heart of complaints that the PPP subsidies went to big, high-valued businesses — rather than to struggling smaller companies, or straight to the masses of unemployed American workers.

               It was on ZH. I seriously hope there is some kind of investigation as to how they stole one thin dime. Maybe it was some kind of legal loophole that no one noticed but the crooks.
