            YESSSSS! I was thinking about this today after I told my dad about pizzagate and he just said it was "fake news." Broke my heart. I think we need a meme that plants doubt in the minds of unbelievers. I get it, it's a hard pill to swallow. I'm no good at actually making memes, but I was thinking of perhaps having a picture of the pope accompanied by the words, "#pizzagate is as fake as pedophilia in catholicism...oh wait."  Also since the pope said it was fake we should play off that, so we should have a pic of the pope with words like "#pizzagate is fake says the man who protects pedo's" or something to that effect. THOUGHTS?

            Here are a few meme ideas, ranging from small to large.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Turn the censorship to our advantage.  If facebook and twitter are censoring posts, tell people to post something Pizzagate related.  When the post gets deleted or the group won't be allowed to be made, it should wake them up to the censorship.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Denial.  Nobody directly accused other than Alefantis have bothered denying anything.  Just like in the move "Wag the Dog" where Dustin Hoffman's character says, "Deny the allegations" and it sets the reporters off, denying Pizzagate or saying "Don't Post #PIZZAGATE"  "You're Life Depends On It" "Go Back To Sleep" Or something equally inflammatory should get some more people questioning what is going on.  Ideally it gets people posting and then censored and then questing.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Occult stuff.  Draw the attention of your local religious leaders to the evil symbology.  This would best be done in meatspace and with clergy you trust and with more than one person present.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Getting Jesus involved.  Whether or not you're Christian, the Bible contains safeguards against censorship.  Christmas is around the corner.  If suddenly something like #JesusIsComing becomes linked with Pizzagate and people can't mention Jesus around Christmas time, that will get a lot of religious people very unhappy.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            a. Incidentally, the Bible is a big book and contains lots of passages.  Revelations has some good ones too, and very applicable to the current climate.  Check out Rev 9:20-21 and Rev 18:17
           </p>
           <p>
            b.  Addressing Pizzagate in prayer videos.  Don't even mention Pizza.  If you are Christian, consider making a video praying for the safety of the children. If they start censoring Jesus, they lose BIG.

            Andrew Breitbart - smoking gun in my opinion. In February 2011 he tweeted about Podesta and his underground sex slave stuff. He worked for mainstream media and was fired. Taken to court. Where is he now? Dead. He died in 2012. Coincidence...? I dont think so.

            You remember how they told people that "15 year olds can get cyber security jobs!!!" that was a lie from the new york times. The sad part is this is not the only guy that lied and made up stuff. They had a few other journalists working there who did the exact same

            and put the first page of google meme images on a search of "pizzagate" and then started to add a bunch of youtube videos on the subject.  Did this 2 hours ago and have started spreading it to some of my influential friends.  Feel free to like and contribute what you have as well as take anything you want and share it out.  Any advice is also welcome.

            I feel pretty helpless over these #pizzagate revelations, so in hopes of contributing something to keep the momentum going I've decided to create my own memes and they are posted on this thread:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1444234">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1444234
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            They are** free ** for everyone to use and post.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm following a few guidelines for my personal memes:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) the purpose of the meme is to create awareness, not shock, and to reach people not in touch with pizzagate
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Each meme should be colorful and make people notice and be curious about what's going on
           </p>
           <p>
            3) The meme will not contain any pictures of actual children or people ( only cartoons or graphics)
           </p>
           <p>
            4) The meme will be posted to my social media with a link to educational sources that are explaining the pizzagate revelations in a clear and concise manner.

            I have a question for Americans and especially for the ones living in DC . What do you plan to do besides internet investigation? Is there some legal action you can take? I dont know how the laws work there. I think this will take a long time and it giving the sickos time to get rid of all evidence.

             Yes, everyone is scurrying around like rats trying to save themselves. Things I've seen though suggest that the FBI has been working on this for at least a year, so they would have a lot of evidence from before people started covering their tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I don't understand is why the mainstream media is content to go down with this sinking ship. Are they really just that clueless?

            Think of it this way, if the BLACK MARKET were an urban Mall, than the Clinton Foundation is the mall owner, renting out stalls to human traffickers, drug smugglers, gun runners, and intelligence/blackmail dealers. They launder the money and take a commission off each transaction.  Kind of like eBay.  That's why the silk road got shut down so hard, for literally competing with the Clinton Foundation.

            Its a pity this thing already has momentum under the moniker 'Pizzagate'. If we could start afresh I'd be up for the meme "Investigate Podestagate"

            If you mention how all the chili parlors in Cincinnati have something on the menu called a ''Three-Way'', that is without making any direct accusations against them in terms of pedophilia and so forth, but simply to illustrate how the meanings of words can be changed around in a context, that might be helpful to ease the public a little bit. It's no so far fetched that food items would be used as code words for sexual things when it's so obvious. Also, the city is named after an ancient Roman governor, which is irrelevant by itself, but it's common knowledge in Cincinnati that ancient Roman governor is what inspired George Washington and the founding fathers of America to start the tradition of term limits on the President. That's some swamp draining meme complex there. Sure, it's kind off on a tangent, but if it helps to explain the purpose of this. Just don't let anyone tell you that you're a fool who thinks the movie Sausage Party is real, you see?

            If "Pizzagate is about psychological warfare!" then why are we still here? FBIAnon says we'll get nowhere with pizzagate and that our best bet is to focus on the Clinton Foundation...

            Yup they have the power and resources but we have truth and heart. It's scary to think that Clinton would've won the election if Breitbart didn't expose them like he did. Just think, there wouldn't have been any Breitbart news.

            I have a couple more questions so please excuse my ignorance as this is only my second post here and ive never used social media in my life because i could never stand govt spy sites like fakebook or twatter.... 
Regarding these so called "memes" where is it that i should post one if i create one and can it be animated and is there a size limit in mb and/or pixel size? 
The other question is where is the central hub to look at all of the evidence collected so far or is it just scattered throughout the forum? Thanks!

             I don't know a ton about social media either but facebook is a pretty good place to share memes.
Someone started a new subsection just for memes related to pizzagate. The link is somewhere in this thread. Not sure about the animation or size limitations.
Most of the basic evidence is in the sticky at the top of the subsection. Most of the other good evidence that isn't in there can be found scattered throughout but most of them are upvoted heavily so you should be able to easily find them by filtering for number of upvotes.

            Im new here, first post and honored to join the fight. I am in complete agreement with this strategy you outlined. I especially agree with point about convincing the public that this corruption is real and ongoing. The only way this is going to be won is to get everyone on board. We know that the tide of public opinion is changing in our favor as there is a large awakening going on right now so we need to take advantage of that momentum and accelerate it. To do this we need an aggressive counter propaganda campaign to recruit more truth warriors. The words "TRUTH", "LIES" should be continually associated into the memes. Not only portraying the MSM as liars or deceivers but also drive home the point that even some social media sites are filtering their news. Remember how many times Trump called them LIARS.... It needs to be repeated in every video.... LIARS... you have been LIED TO.... The google search suggestions are RIGGED, these are things that should be put in videos over and over to get it to sink in...because all it takes is evidence of a few lies for humans to lose all faith and jump ship to another platform.
In the middle of a PIZZAGATE video, show a demonstration of how google filters PIZZAGATE from the search suggestions, then cut back to the pedo stuff.... that will wake many up right there about the lies.
Use small disconnected solid proofs of conspiracy to get people to switch sides.
I also think we need to make every person feel like they are part of the team by never ridiculing any possible evidence brought forth. I know its impossible to save everything but anything that has any relevant significance to the case should be saved even if it is small but still significant. We may never find a smoking gun but i think if we could get 90% of the population to acknowledge that it is real and we have the stack of evidence we have now then i dont think we will need one,... once the tide of public opinion is solid somebody will be dragged in for questioning...the rats will start turning on each other once the first few get dragged in for investigation. Somebody(s) will squeal to save their own ass. I suggest as a strategy to get more on board to make some videos where we are actually asking for the publics help in capturing these horrible criminals and saving these children. Everybody wants to feel that they have a part to play, just look at how charities reel them in by the boatload, this is no different..... except this is a 100% honest noble cause and that is what will get them on board. Make a list of people needed, graphic designers , computer geeks, advertising students or professionals,  writers etc maybe law students for advice,...etc...appeal to the military vets to tell any child abuse stories they know of that they were forced to be part of..we all know the military has been satanic forever, they must have tons of skeletons in those closets.... just about everyone has something they can contribute on a small level. Put this stuff in videos, people will see it and think,..."damn, i should do something"
I dont know what i can contribute but im a good internet researcher so ill dig but i know you guys got most of the low hanging fruit already. Im also good at making animated gifs (i just learned about memes, my apologies for being out of the loop ive never been on social media until now because i hated it but i am here now because there is a good reason to be). I might also suggest using some of their own tricks against them and creating subliminal message vids... ill see what i can do on that front when i get some time. Peace

             Yeah just do whatever you're good at/motivated to do. Even just sharing memes and commenting in MSM "fake news" or "pizzagate is fake" articles goes a long way.

            link posted below to jeff epsteins flight logs, you will see many of the people that would be needed to clean this all up are in trump camp now too, reminder trump and clinton are both on these logs, as well as bloomberg and others, so the notion that some agencies (NSA/FBI) will go rogue and persue a case against the pedo rings, is a crazy.  thoughts?

             When Trump found out Epstein was trying to solicit underage girls at Mar-a-Lago, he banned Epstein from the resort. Does that sound like the actions of someone who is part of this pedo ring? When you're as rich as Trump is, it's impossible not to have overlapping social circles with these people.

            I don't see it.  Once it's up, make sure you include a link (

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1445124)

            ) back to this post so people can read about the strategy.  Then maybe ask

             @anon123
            </a>

            Slow down a bit and let's wait until Trump is actually in office. People still have a chance to be pardoned by a leaving president. Will all of them? No, but I do see Tony and John Podesta with a pardon if charges result before Obama is out of office.

            I love this. Thank you!!

            MSM and the Elite use fear and manipulation to brainwash us and get us to align with their agenda. They have it down to a science.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing is, they get power by exploiting OUR creative and life force energy for their gain. They get us to buy into one of their divide-and-conquer agendas and we go along with it and carry it out (fighting with our fellow humans on their behalf). They convince us that it's OUR idea to do what it is they want. They have to because they are few and we are many. They really have no power unless we agree to give it to them. They are so disconnected from their OWN life force energy they have to literally rape it out of children. Think about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is taking it back our power.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we are doing here is actually saying NO. They will keep doing it until we say no and mean it and actually stand up for ourselves in whatever way we can. We continue to get what we tolerate. We use our own creative and life force energy to support OUR divine/natural rights. We are sovereign beings! Let's shine light on the truth, unite with our fellow man in love, and take back the freedom that is rightfully ours.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean think about it, they've been using TV and movies, celebrities, and different "savior" figures to pull at our heart strings and get us so emotionally wrapped up in THEIR sinister ideas, that we can't even remember what we actually want for ourselves. We get wrapped up in ideologies and politics and fighting amongst ourselves and we're confused and out of touch with what's true. We keep looking outside of ourselves for truth - "who has the right answer??" - Stop. You know the truth. Everyone does deep down.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question to ask, what does your heart say? Your soul?
           </p>
           <p>
            What if people in the lower parts of the hierarchy trusted they could follow their intuition and heart and said what they actually think on air? They would lose their job sure, but the momentum would carry us through. We will catch those that fall! Have no fear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Transparency, honesty, truth, authenticity. That's what we need.
           </p>
           <p>
            Deep down, we all want to be free. Deep down we KNOW their is corrupt shit happening in government and a more beautiful world exists. Our hearts fucking know it. It's just a matter of helping people TRUST their intuition enough to take the risk of acting on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to help people feel safe in coming out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Expose how people have been manipulated and lied to. Appeal to both the emotional and logical side. Appeal to our need for unity and community. Shit, they have fucking PIXAR and Disney to communicate their messages. But even that won't stop the truth from coming out. Love and truth will win. It's up to us.
           </p>
           <p>
            After all is said and done, we will realize WE are the savior that we have been waiting for.

            Yeah. Gamergate centered around that redhaired girl. I dunno, PedoBear? Pizza with PedoBear face? I feel like using a child is just too disturbing, but maybe that's necessary. Just thinking out loud.

              The mainstream made a mistake promoting #fakenews - because they are the massive purveyors of it.. It dawned on the boneheads and that's when they stopped yakking about it. The MSM did our work for us and created the meme which can now easily be used against them.

             Yes, start small by flipping the script on the "fake news" narrative first. It'll be a long, long road to get Hillary voters and even some Trump voters to believe their beloved government is infiltrated by a pedo ring. There are many steps involved to get there. Discrediting MSM is the first and easiest step. Once we have more credibility than they do then we can start working the pedo ring angle.

              I think maybe Hillary voters and alot of libs won't look at this because they think we are pointing the finger at the Democrat party. Truth is this pedo ring cuts across party lines. I do not know if it's true or not...but i have come across info suggesting George Bush Sr. and Scalia were involved in this stuff. Also convicted pedo Hastert is a Republican. Maybe if we can convey that we want them ALL outed...the libs will begin to wake up...?
Also...where do i go to find memes that I can post on Twitter.? Thanks.

               Yeah definitely. It's just that the MSM does it's most biased and erroneous reporting when the topic is politics, and most of MSM favors the left. Perhaps if you could figure out a way to lump FOX in there and equally show their faults then we can get the bi-partisan message across, and if you can find fallacies in their work on non-politics topics then we can remove politics from the topic.

             I'm no good with meme making, but if it's easy to make a change, I'd love to see the same pic but zoomed out just a bit more, so it's a little less, in your face.

              I just started dabbling with memes as a result of pizzagate and all the can of worms it uncovered. Hopefully more polished images to come soon!

            Ask "What fake news site was it?" or some variation. That's one of the big things that told me there was something up. I read the NYT article and kept seeing "fake news" but there was no link. The words "fake news" were even made into a hyperlink, which you would assume was the offending article they are referencing, but its a link to another NYT article about fake news. I think we should lean on this particular part hard, because they can't go back and fix it.

             Yeah, basically find ways to use their own words against them. I read an article earlier that said "Spirit Cooking is just art". We can counter that argument by saying "Satanism is just a religion" and have devil worshiping pic. Today numerous MSM sites claimed OSU campus had a shooter. Make an meme that shows the cop as the only shooter. Point out article where MSM implies alt-right means white supremacy and then show definition of alt-right in dictionary that has nothing to do with white supremacy. And then coming up with a catchy phrase at the bottom of those memes like "Who's the fake news now?"

              I'd change the phrase to  "Killing children is just a religion".      Or,  Selling children is just an income.

              Twitter good place to start. Tim Kaine tweeted out today about gun violence at OSU. I tweeted back it was a knife and car that were used and quit spreading Fake News! I don't how to make meme, but it would have been good to use one today.

              Well, personally, I would avoid spreading misconceptions about my own religion. Most people that call themselves Satanists are followers of the Satanic Bible, and not related to any real occult activity, but I like the logic of using their own arguments against them. Someone suggested making a meme about the MSM being the real fake news sites, and bringing up all the times they spread gossip, bullshit, and misleading information.

               Yeah, perhaps use the weird and gross ingredients in spirit cooking instead of using the Satanism angle. "Menstrual blood mixed with breast milk, urine, and sperm is just paint!" Or a meme with that picture with Maria holding the head of an animal at chest level saying "Yep just art. Perfectly normal."

            I believe this is our true purpose as well, making the masses aware of what is going on. This includes figuring out which information is most effective in getting people to understand what is going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The investigation and research should be a secondary goal. I believe the FBI and other agencies are already sitting on more information than we could ever hope to get with our limited access/resources. They probably have numerous smoking guns to put away all the major players.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are waiting for 1 of 2 things to happen: public outrage to become so large that this scandal can no longer be ignored, or Trump to get into office and purge the people that are blocking them from moving forward with the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            What will most likely happen is there will be scapegoats such as the Clintons, Podestas, etc who will take the brunt of the punishment.
           </p>
           <p>
            When /if this happens, again it will be up to us to inform people of the enormity of the crimes and scandal if we want to try to take down everybody. This could possibly cause widespread chaos and complete lack of trust in governments worldwide,  thus why they probably view this as a last resort,  even if it means letting a massive amount of criminals and pedophiles off the hook.

             Excellently put. This is not, I repeat NOT a democrat only issue, absolute power corrupts regardless of the institution's exoteric identity, be it church, state, financial.

             We should be actively mentioning pizzagate to everyone we know irl and online. Planting the seed is the first step, once they are ready to swallow the blue pill they can take the rest. Its that simple. It starts with awarness.
            </p>
            <p>
             Btw how hard would it be if we all just spammed reddit's front page articles with nothing but comments about #pizzagate? Is this feasable? Fb? Ig ? I mean this is fast becoming mainstream... not like the clintons gonna put out hits on all of us.

             I hate to interject. I have been following all of this for a long time and have not put my own opinion in at all. I understand if I don't look credible or whatever. But in my opinion, the only thing that will sway people now is new evidence. We need something damning recorded live. We need something to show the people that this is happening now. I understand how complicated that would be, I understand how difficult it would be to really get that information. I'm just saying that I do not think people will fall on board until they see someone they respect saying something they cant believe but cant deny because they saw it for themselves.
We need something even MSM cannot deny.

              Denny Hastert is evidence of a political pedophile. And where there is one cockroach, there are many more. Maybe someone could do a meme on that. Might add..." Time to exterminate the entire nest"...or something like that.

              This is a good point. What I see happening is we'll see a "fall guy" or something take the blame. Perhaps he/she would be blackmailed into slipping up or accidentally leaking something. This would just be a strategy to try to close the case and take control of the narrative. But the public would certainly turn their attention toward it.

               Nothing will happen until the people tell everyone involved that we are not ok with this. Even if we are outnumbered, even if they say it isnt true, even if they damn us and call us fake, even if they show 100 news stories about us everyday. We can't act like we didnt see what we saw. We have concrete evidence for multiple people, and we the people have the power to prosecute these individuals. Why wait for someone who wont do anything? Why wait for the pedophiles to arrest the pedophiles? What are we left with? Why cant we stand up and say something? We the people have a VOICE!

              That's a fair point. Most people are not willing to watch a presentation about pedophilia that explains the evidence and connections. And each bit of evidence when viewed in a vacuum, is hardly convincing. It's a tricky problem for sure.

               I agree, people who do not believe this will not watch a 90 minute documentary, or even a 20 minute explanation. They NEED the "Smoking Gun" as much as we WANT it. It is very important that we prove to them that the people they respect are really doing this. We are exposing a lot of evidence that should reach everyone and land people in jail but its not happening. We need damning evidence, we need someone who has been doing this for years to release video evidence of the people that the public love today participating in these acts.

             After giving the basic background of Pizzagate, I give these two facts which I find to make a big impact:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) "If you're thinking this too sounds far fetched, just remember that Anthony Weiner sent a picture of his penis to a 15 year old, while laying next to his sleeping child. This is only taken by public as fact because he accidentally tweeted it. Not everyone is that dumb."
            </p>
            <p>
             2) After describing James Alefantis &amp; Comet Pizza, explain that James Alefantis had changed his name once upon a time. Go to google and physically type in "J'aime les enfants French to English" This seems to be the most effective if they have enough detail of the background of pizzagate.
             <strong>
              EDIT: He did not change his name. This was his given name (of greek origin). But still, got damn that's sketchy!
             </strong>

               Are we sure? I have done a lot of reading on this and swear he changed him name at some point. Link me to a source if you could. That's too big to be a coincidence I think..

            Awesome post.  It would be might be good to have a central place where those how make memes can post them.  That way the rest of us have somewhere to go to pick them up and spread them.  Any ideas?

             Yes, can we have one them all under one heading...something like "USE THESE MEMES"
They seem to be scattered. Empress above posted a bunch here:

              Need to make sure the mods are onboard.  Looks like the rules for posting might discourage meme posts.  Maybe they can edit the rules to encourage creative memes.
