            Just saw one of Chris Cornell's last televised interviews.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            It centered around the song he recently released  entitled   "The Promise".

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In answer to a question, Chris said: "Yes.  I'm donating all of the proceeds
from the song to The International Rescue Committee."
           </p>
           <p>
            Had never heard of it.
Found this:

            So far in what I can make out of it, my opinion is this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kirsten killed Chris by strangling him.
Vicky was very complicit.
           </p>
           <p>
            People speculate Kirsten and Vicky
were (are) having an affair.
           </p>
           <p>
            Based upon reports I read, Chris fought for his life.
(He had nine broken ribs).
           </p>
           <p>
            It was common knowledge in the industry
that The Cornell's marriage was "on the rocks".
Through.
           </p>
           <p>
            A drug was found in Chris' toxicology
report that he was not known to take.  It is speculated
Vicky or someone put i it into
his food or drink.  so he would act "loaded" later.  I understand Vicky was
not in Detroit with Chris.   But the subject
drug is ingested 23 hours before it
takes affect.  The plan was to create story that Chris had
relapsed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reports say Chris was off drugs for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course,  I cannot prove any of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I am thinking someone can.

            definitely shady circumstances, and at least the bodyguard guy must know more than has been let on.  maybe it was just the wife as the brains behind the 'suicide' if so than no p/g.

             But what about the articles stating Chris was intending to name names
and expose pedophile rings?
            </p>
            <p>
             Three days before Chris' death someone took his foundation
website down....it went dark it is reported.  Why?  It is  still down.
or at least  not in  it's original format I am told.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it is not true that Chris was going to name names, etc.I would have to agree with
you that Chris Cornell's death is not Pizzagate related.

              yeah there's still questions.  i'm not saying we can take this account as 100% on the right path (the wife).  i'd want to know how much $ was in the charity, and who else may have had access to the funds.  it wouldn't be the first time a wife killed her husband, but if i had to bet, i'd bet that it wasn't as simple as the wife was bilking $ and didn't want to get found out.

               If you feel this matter is worth your while to research, then do.
I think it is worth my time so far.

               According to my research, the foundation opened in 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
               In review of financials, it didn't have much money.
No more than one-half  million dollars.
              </p>
              <p>
               The foundation stopped filing Form 990 in 2014.

                thanks for the info.  yeah that's not too much $.  charity i guess a dead end (unless it is the wife to whom a few hundred grand could be a motive).

                 My opinion is the foundation was not the major reason
for the murder.

                <p>
                 I think she knew the marriage was over and
Chris was going to divorce her.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, think about it, if she and the bodyguard are unsavory...
the mob. cabal..whoever.could depend on them  to put a permanent end to Chris,  especially
if Chris was going to "spill the beans".
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now I have no real evidence that Chris was
going to help us expose pizzagate.  All  I have is what I have read on the internet
and in newspapers.

                 I am not in law enforcement or anything like that.

                   This has been reported in other newspapers.
Have not seen any specific evidence.

                   I understand through Randy Cody's website that
                   <br/>
                   a current ongoing private investigation exists now regarding this matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They do not like Vicky very much.

                   When Mr. Cody was writing about Vicky 
did you see the picture of the Wicked Witch from the Wizard of Oz
flying through the air on her broomstick included
there in the article?

                    shame that vicky does appear to be implicated (assuming for a second it was murder).  gonna be hard to get a real investigation without her driving the outcry.

             Wife is suspect.  Yes, along with body guard.
            </p>
            <p>
             Found out bodyguard Martin Kirsten. (have also seen
 his last name spelled "Kristen") was Heidi Klum' s bodyguard
for four years before he worked for the Cornell.   She left her husband for Kirsten I am told.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were an "item"  "in love" for about a year and a
half.  Rumor has it Ms. Klum  purchased
a home for Kirsten's mother.  Later it is
said she had to pay him off at the breakup 
to keep quiet.  Not saying this info. is germane to case but found it
somewhat interesting.
            </p>

             Vicky is extremely suspect.

              this article does make vicky looks suspect indeed.  i didn't know she was blaming ativan...which is suspect.  from this and other stuff i recall reading, i definitely suspect Kirsten, but yeah the wife now too looks a bit fishy.  still, the wife theory sounds a lil too simple tho
