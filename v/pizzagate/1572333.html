           <p>
            Their facebook page talks about The Carousel Center, which features a swirl, eerily similar to the FBI pedo logo:

            This is a comment on the page: "I run a Funday School on Wednesday for Children who mostly come from broken and Dysfunctional homes, they share their pain , their nightmares their fears and doubts, I know they don’t feel they are Loved, not often said out loud but it’s shown. 
The main focus of my Funday School is to share with the Children regardless of their age, how much Jesus Loves them and that He is their Best Friend and will always be there for them. When they share that they wake up frightened, I tell them to talk to Him the same as I did until I was deceived that I came from an Ape by my Teacher and my Mother who had Adopted me. The Children tell me they always feel better after they talk to Jesus"
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who has been around children KNOWS that they don't talk openly about their abuse. Because they have no frame of reference they don't even recognise it as abuse, usually not until they get help when they get older.  Children are egocentric, so everything that happens to them, they believe, happens BECAUSE of them.  So when they are abused the believe that they did something to cause it.  That brings with it great shame.  That's why children don't speak of abuse that happens to them.  Something is really off in those comments.

             What I find odd is their grammar is great, yet in places that don't make sense they have words that are capitalized. Definitely coded and something is just off.

            Fuspezza, can you please clarify the connection between Handrahan and the stuff you link to after saying "you went down the rabbit hole"? I saw nothing on her twitter related to the other stuff you linked to. We are getting a lot of disingenuous posts at the moment. Please clarify. Thanks.
           </p>
