Take his infamous television appearance.

Only problem? It wasn’t true. </p>

<p>Rod Wheeler Claims on The O’Reilly Factor Lesbian Gangs are Raping Young Girls</p>
<p>Wheeler, a Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department officer-turned-paid Fox News commentator, launched right in: &quot;Well, you know, there is this national underground network, if you will, Bill, of women that\'s lesbians and also some men groups that\'s actually recruiting kids as young as 10 years old in a lot of the schools in the communities all across the country,&quot; he reported. &quot;And they actually carry a number of weapons. And they commit a number of crimes.&quot;
Wheeler asserted that &quot;we\'ve actually counted, just in the Washington, D.C., area alone, that\'s Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, well over 150 of these crews. … And they — like I said, they recruit these kids to be members of these gangs.&quot; … 
Next came the pink guns. &quot;Now, the other thing, too, that our viewers are going to find very, very interesting, is the fact that they actually carry—some of these groups carry pink pistols,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, and here’s the retraction: </p>

<p>Then there’s the fact Rod Wheeler isn’t even licensed in DC, but stated he was on his website. That, too, went away! Oh, my bad! Probably somebody else’s fault! </p>

<p>Now-Notorious \'Private Investigator\' in Seth Rich Case is Unlicensed in D.C. </p>
<p>Until very recently, the website for his Capitol Investigations LLC referred to the company as the “most trusted full service Criminal and Civil Investigation firm serving Washington DC, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, New York &amp; Ohio.” The company’s site lauded Wheeler as “America’s criminal investigator” with 25 years of experience and an expert regularly seen on Fox News.
Maryland business registration lists Wheeler’s name in filings for Capitol Investigations, a sole proprietorship that formed Dec. 19, 2016.  And the fine print at the bottom of the website included a copyright reference to the “Rod Wheeler Companies.”
But the site—capitolinvestigatons.com—contained no references to any licenses. 
Days after City Paper began questioning Wheeler’s credentials in emails and phone calls, the website for Capitol Investigations LLC disappeared.</p>

<p>Oh, and he was FIRED from the DC police!  Yes, he did inhale! Same link: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Rod Wheeler, the Fox talking head, was fired from MPD. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still not convinced? Here’s a little something from Butowsky: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.oann.com/ed-butowsky-refutes-wheeler-lawsuit-clears-trump-of-any-russian-collusion/">http://www.oann.com/ed-butowsky-refutes-wheeler-lawsuit-clears-trump-of-any-russian-collusion/</a> </p>
<p>Wheeler claims he was misquoted by Fox News, but Butowsky says that’s not true.
Butowsky says Wheeler had other intentions, including getting in touch with former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, and more importantly — getting a job at the White House.
Butowsky had several White House connections, which Wheeler apparently attempted to take advantage of.
Wheeler repeatedly asked for a “way onto the Trump team,” saying that quote “I really think I could help him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What these show is that he’s pretty much conned his way up the ranks and has a pattern of making claims and then taking them back when challenged. So now comes an opportunity to do so AND make a little change! Plus there’s making nice-nice with the DNC-side of things. Maybe a nice cushy job with them for starting yet another fire that the POTUS has to be distracted in putting out.</p>',

            Butowsky said he was kidding about the comments he made regarding wheeler wanting a job at the White House.   This according to David Fulkenflick of NPR. Say What you will about NPR, but David is a very respected journalist. The story NPR The PBSNewshour  put out last night was actually pretty good, even though the headline was awful and misleading and I sent them a tweet to notify them as such.

            Rod Wheeler is a FREEMASON and a KNOWN LIAR (that's redundant).

            It is NO SURPRISE that his lawsuit against Fox is
            <strong>
             <strong>
              33 pages long!

           <p>
            You idiots DOWNVOATED me weeks ago when I outed him as a FREEMASON; now you change your tune.

             Also, that it was in complete tandem with the later that day Sy Hersh leaked audio seems like a timed event. Watching the Twitter trending change happen in real-time was amazing. I knew this stuff was happening but to watch it, man o man.

            Nope.  Podestas emails started pizzagate and they were phished.

            The fact that youve convinced YOURSELVES otherwise thru sheer repetition is extremely disturbing if unsurprising.

              is my bf and the KIKESHILL FAG BRIGADE felt he was too effective and downvoated him into the negatives, so now he cant post.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since i cant even move from the 19 orgasms he gave me i figured id check how retarded voat got in his absence.
             </p>
             <p>
              So if Rich had Podestas emails in MARCH 2016 why did he or wikileaks sit on for 4 months until supposedly dying?

            so the guy could be a nutcase (drugs will do that to people no question there)

            Maybe he pissed someone off and they set him up, and now he has a vendetta? There is definitely a motive for discrediting this guy.

            <p>
             I'm sure he pissed someone off. I'm also sure there must have been a few missteps along the way ... maybe one big enough to blackmail him when the time was right.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe now is that time to get him to play fetch.

              I will try. I keep getting distracted. I can barely keep up as it is. The summer is hard, people in and out constantly. By the time I've looked into things there are new things. One reason why I so admire your work (when do you have the time and focus??? )

               Thanks. I do the initial investigating and gathering of links in my downtime. Then I have to carve out a space and put things together. Working on a HUGE project involving The Cannibal Queen. Lord, it's going to take so much time to say what I need to, but it'll give insight (hopefully) into what this cult is all about .... and it is a cult.

                 Absolutely. Aaron loved his brother and was trying to protect him while keeping his parents from knowing the secrets.

                 Problem is that he obstructed justice in taking this on himself, but really ... could he really trust law enforcement?

                Maybe that's the point, they can't have a real detective looking into things, things that are being deliberately buried. Looks like Wheeler was a set up, either because he's a known bad investigator or because someone hates him and wants more nails in his coffin.

                 I believe there's more to it than that. I believe they gave Wheeler the job because he was a weasel. His job was to figure out where the other computer was and who had it. His coming out like he did and targeting Aaron is not good for Aaron's health. Wheeler is a fucking son of a bitch to do that. That's not for public consumption.
