            Though I admire Trey Gowdy, this hearing was a total disappointment. You got the guy from NCMEC as one of the witnesses. His fucking organization is part of the problem why these children are being abused and victimized. It was nauseating watching all the of them praise NCMEC. I'm sorry but I do not believe that organization has the children's best interest at heart. They are part of the problem and therefore they cannot be part of the solution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing, I know Trey Gowdy is no fool and I'm sure he knows all about our governments pedophillia fetish and that is the part which gets me everytime. What do you do when your own government is part of the perpetrators??? Why isn't that talked about? Do people not have the right to know that they ought to protect their children from even their own government??? What about all the children that CPS has snatched from parents and dumped into the hands of pedophiles and traffickers who not only collect government checks off the backs of these children but also on top of it they fucking make money off the flesh of these children by dishing them as commodities to to nasty fucking scum of the earth to do with whatever they like. Let's have a hearing on that and let's tell people how our goddam government has been systematically abusing and perpetrating crimes against the most weakest members of our society, the children? How about hearing where they aren't blowing it up each other's asses?
           </p>
           <p>
            Hate to be harsh in my criticism but unfortunately seeing as how none of the pizzagate perpetrators have been apprehended is driving me a little crazy to the point that I don't believe a goddam word that comes of any of these peoples mouths anymore. I don't believe Trump, sessions, or gowdy or anyone else. Do they mean well? Sure. Are they trying to do the right thing? Sure but I don't know as to just how much they are trying. I don't know what that means. I have no way of knowing what they are doing and just how much effort they are putting in. Are they putting in just enough to appease us and get Trump elected a second term??? I don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I know is unless the big guys in pizzagate are put away, I will not be voting come 2020 because I will have zero faith in the existence of a thing called "justice" by that time. This is too much for me. It has surpassed my thresholds of tolerance. I want real change. I don't want to be appeased and lulled. I want to be taken seriously. I want the government to take the citizenry seriously and level the playing field cuz this is too much. The amount of push back is just nutty... they've got all the cards of the deck stacked against us. It's not a fair fight. We get shut down and silenced while they parade around on TV vomiting out total lies. It's too much. I can't believe what I'm witnessing happening in this country. It's like the fucking twilight zone for me.
           </p>
           <p>
            .... sorry for ranting. I think I'll stop here.

             Have you made any attempts to meet with your representatives to share your concerns? Done any outreach to make others aware and ask the same of your reps?
            </p>
            <p>
             Grassroots is the only way to fix this. Vote people into power who will represent you. Or run for office yourself.
