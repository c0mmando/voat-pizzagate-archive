I mean, since I started following the Pizzagate investigation, researching and reading threads here on Voat, I have to say that I\'ve learned quite a few things. Some interesting and some very disturbing. </p>
<p>With that said, let me pull some Instagram pictures back out and see if I can accurately define the context and meanings of their related comments and hashtags. I think many of you will be surprised at what you\'ll discover in hindsight. </p>
<p><strong>1</strong> -  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/31558902274/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/31558902274/</a>  (The creepy Trevor Young and his victim Pic)</p>
<p>Why do I say victim? Easy.</p>
<p>Jimmycomet: &quot;Before&quot;</p>
<p>SCummings: &quot;After?&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmycomet: &quot;You don\'t wanna see... Trust me&quot; </p>
<p>SpyPigeon (Trevor Young): &quot;Amazing Night. Forgot about this.&quot; </p>
<p>Look closely at the both of them. No # to identify the person next to Trevor. We all now know that JA likes to identify the people in his pics. The unknown and unnamed person is definitely drugged, or about to pass out and looks like fresh make up on the face. I\'d bet anything that they weren\'t standing up for the pic, but that Trevor was actually over the person laying on the ground. Kinda reminds me of serial killers who paint their victims after they\'ve killed them or something. Idk, it looks very creepy to me. Plus, the comment &quot;Before&quot; leads to the question &quot;After&quot; as in &quot;Before and After&quot; pic. If this is the before picture and we don\'t wanna see the after, wtf happened to this person that is so horrible to see? </p>
<p>Check Trevor Young\'s Instagram account here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spypigeon/">https://www.instagram.com/spypigeon/</a>  <a href="http://archive.is/yDumd">http://archive.is/yDumd</a></p>
<p>He\'s a professional painter and if you can judge a person by what he creates, well, this person seems very isolated, dark and depressed or anguished. Almost all of his paintings are void of human life.

<p>Jimmycomet: &quot;No extra food!&quot;</p>
<p>This is in reference to the &quot;Lock up mom to give extra food&quot; guideline at the top of the map. Of course, extra food is given to help the mother\'s milk rise so she can feed all her piglets. JA\'s comment either means he\'s being mean to the mother and the piglets (which I doubt) or a more plausible explanation is to starve the mother to get her hungry enough to eat anything. We\'ve found out through the investigation, that starving pigs will eat anything including humans (dead bodies) in no time, including the bones, leaving no trace behind. Reminds me of the Richard Pickton Pig Farm case. Horrible.</p>

<p>Why would JA refer to Caris James as chicken, when we all now know that <strong>chicken</strong> is a coded pedophile word for young boy? The fact that this is the second time that Caris James is being referred to as chicken (The father, Scott Cummings also referred to Caris as chicken in this pic here <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/32401457425/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/32401457425/)</a>) leads me to believe Caris James is, in reality, a boy. But that \'they\' James, the parents and friends all groom the kids to become sexless, or bisexual. It almost seem as if the goal is to confuse the child about his/her sexuality or identity. They might even be grooming Caris to be a girl. I think someone already posted a thread on this theory, but I can\'t find it right now.</p>

<p>Jimmycomet:  #edibledc #baby #doublemayo</p>
<p>Jimmycomet: &quot;Time for baby to have own #babycaris. Done.&quot; </p>
<p>WTF? Who refers to a child as food? And what does he mean by &quot;having own #babycaris?&quot; And just the way he\'s positioned the giant pizza oven spoon, over Caris\' head... looks threatening, brrrr.  
</p>
<p>And there are so many more! I have just posted 5 of them... I mean, I wonder why police still didn\'t arrest this creep. They didn\'t even search CPP yet and we know there is a hidden room in there.</p>',

            That nest egg comparison caught my attention and brought me back to the definition of birding. Here is a pic where the # babybirding is posted. And we all know the technique of using dogs to scare kids in MK Ultra abuse :

            She is known to have flown at least 6 times on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet (Bill 26 times), is said to be a high ranking witch and openly admits to speaking to dead people. She says that she 'channels' Eleanor Roosevelt. Plus, we all know how interested in following the Laura Silsby case involving the attempted kidnapping of 33 (non-orphans) Haitian children story. And this is only the tip of the iceberg,

            I hope so. At the very least have someone ask them why there have been any no photographs of their child since 2015. (on social media) A precious girl of that age. (presumably now about 7.) would be a parents pride and joy and would be endlessly photographed. Makes no sense.

            i hear ya. It's just surprising he has not gone dark like Scott &amp; his wife have. Wonder if he is not privy to any nefarious arrangement. Though that is doubtful.

            I think it explains itself and supports my theory that he basically bought her. Do you have evidence that James supported this family? That is interesting. I do not think, as much of a deranged man as he might be, that he would lend her out tho. He seems to obsessed with her and would not need the money.

            Sorry. It is just so obvious to me what is going on here. I don't understand why others don't see it. Caris is his, was born to be his, and he is bragging about it because he can.

sorry but you seem to be in some kind of denial. She is "yummy" for obvious reasons. None having to do with food.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I was reading through to see if you made the connection. For people who don't know, Richard PIckton had a Pig Farm, where apparently the remains of over 30 people were found, maybe more, I don't remember right now. He's considered one of the worst serial killers of all time. The problem is, he regularly had well known parties on the property, and apparently everyone knew these were very sexual parties. There's more to this I've found on the Able Danger YouTube series that I'm not recalling, but I'll see if I can find the videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Here's one:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/6jd8rP195G0?t=1m39s">
             https://youtu.be/6jd8rP195G0?t=1m39s
            </a>
            These 2 guys are a little different than most youtube shows you're going to come across, and they've been doing it for years. They just talk to each other over skype. The one you see in person says his sister is an evil lesbian pedophile who works in the highest reaches of government and helps to organize these rings we are all now starting to realize exist.  Anyways, even if you don't watch the whole video, I'd suggest just skimming through all their uploads and seeing what they're about.

             I get it, felt the same way too at first, but lots of users on PG were doing it. I could type Alefantis, JA was shorter, hehe.

            I believe she is a girl. Not sure what the he was all about. But it is obvious she is a girl. Maybe it's some kind of inside joke. I hope that is not his child because then he would be an incestuous pedo to boot. There is no evidence that that is not Scott Cummings child. I  looked into the two history and they do have 3 children together.

            Idk why you have this feeling I'm trying to compete. Just trying to see if it sticks. It could. 
However, I don't think any normal person would compare a baby to tasty food and # doublemayo next to it.

            If that theory is true, then carisjames could also mean lovejames. Caris means love in welsh i believe. Since we all know he doesn't like kids and mocks them or makes creepy comments about them, the lovejames theory would be somewhat psychopathic. Uff this is not as easy to depict as I first thought. So many theories!

             He like kids alright. Many rapists don't like woman and yet still rape them. You don't need to like them to abuse them. In any case he could also have been straight out lying. Why would we believe a word this creep says? And yes, Caris does mean love in Welsh,. We don't even know if this is her legal name.

            Izette's comment about the money being hers is a habit she has. I say this because I saw another Instagram picture somewhere someone had posted where she saw something she liked and typed "My..." It looks like a pattern. The only reasonable other theory for the mistake in gender could be that James Alefantis is referring to Scott Cummings when he types "His money". Izette probably thinks JA is referring to the baby and corrects him. JA backs off and types "Just sayin' while mentioning both parents. So, is this evidence that Caris' parents are receiving money from JA? What for? He seems to not want to say too much after S-Cummings types "Haha, wait, what?!". As if, hold on, this is not funny at all, big mouth! 
What do you think?

                 If you start looking at all the comments and the situation, relationships in it's entirety, yes. What's more, it's almost as if they are bragging about it. I really , really hope I am wrong. Because if true, than she was doomed from birth.

            Not sure about the "have nothing to do with Caris per say" theory if only for the fact that that baby's sexuality is mentioned and mixed up. Here is an example:

            JA has possession of Caris with her parents blessings. Has has groomed her since infancy. That is what my gut tells me and I am seldom wrong. Scott Cummings, Caris father, is a bisexual swinger surely if he loves Butt mag which is also a gay hook up site. He is also likely a pedo since he is the chicken lover guy on instagram. He also made an item of furniture with pedo symbol on it.  Mom is sketchy as well. JA also made sexual references towards the mother that she was #miwf, (mother i want to fuck) not outside the realm of possibility they have had or are having some kind of love triangle.(it is my belief JA is Bi not strictly gay). The parents sketchy daycare center is also interesting since a waiver of silence was required by employees. Also, some very telling reviews. They seem to have gone MIA on social media at least, and there are no pics of Caris on social media since 2015. Linking CarisJames to me denotes ownership. Seems I am only ones that have this POV. I have no evidence of course, just good intuition and experience from having been around some shady people in my own personal life as well, including some bi &amp; gay men with pedo tendencies who were in Nambla.

            I tried making  a submission on this here on voat and it was deleted . It finally stuck.

            ps: in order to come to the above conclusion it is necessary you carefully examine the relevant Jimmy Comet Instagram comments and pics and the rather mysterious relationship between these people and their children. Taken all together, a picture start emerging.

             Great points. Thank you for sharing your point of view and I agree about the swinger theory because I found it odd that ccwoolman (Scott Cumming's partner and mother of Caris) actually points to the BUTT on Scott's shirt while evidently finding it funny. Here's the picture in question:

             We've found out through the investigation, that starving pigs will eat anything including humans (dead bodies) in no time, including the bones, leaving no trace behind. Reminds me of the Richard Pickton Pig Farm case. Horrible.

            A survivor of SRA made a youtube video not too long ago and she talked about being taken to a farm and being molested and abused and said the people that worked there were down right evil...so maybe this farm is some kind of sick place these people take their kids to after their born and let them get abused and it would be a good place to hide evidence.

               Wow! So you mean to say that they go there to watch what is being done to Caris at the Farm? They had nothing to do with this could mean they didn't participate, but they know it feels because they've been through the same thing themselves when they were young. This could make sense.
