            According to this, the Nazi Party supports death for pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Uf first glance means nothing. All parties are Anti-Pado, and AfD differs in this respect from the rest not at all. If at all, you could fear that they are likely to get worse. Finally, the Nazis, with its "death penalty for child abusers" propaganda, indeed worse and allegedly are the AfD yes rights so something close to them, as could be even worse fear. So, if at all that this is all rather negative?
           </p>
           <p>
            I see this differently. Keep clear of the 24% from Saxony-Anhalt, AfD have chosen with the exception of some pedophile among them nothing of Pados. But now let something with us, so we 20 years ago were still completely alone. And this is the contempt for the lies press.

lies press - word of the year

            The word "lies" was produced by the press lies press (ok, of their supporters) to the worst word of the year. What it is for me to the word of the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a long time since we felt Pados US law only in this situation - you know that the press, whenever this topic to writes something, lies. We know from our own experience in dealing with guys that you know it from the reports of other pados who it had to experience that it self-reported in the press, white it is right that even if he really had sex with children - really is against the law - it has the press is by no means sufficient, but in any event you still have a few lying on it, you know it when you scientific literature read yourself, that what the press as a scientifically proven, lie is - where always to our topic is reported, it is a lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the unpleasant and the impossibility to correct these lies. The only thing you can do is to have a blog to write.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only that it was our theme. If you have Stamps Collectors writes, why should you lie?
           </p>
           <p>
            However there are now other groups to determine that everything, really everything what the press writes to your topic, lies. And feel the same powerlessness, feel the same frustration against these lies gang that their unity lies opinion prevalent everywhere."

             AFD (Alternative for Deutschland) aren't "Nazi" nazis. Like they don't think Germany should re-open the concentration camps. They're "Nazis" in the same sense that a lot of Trump supporters are, like not wanting Muslims to take over the country.
