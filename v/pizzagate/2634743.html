<p>&quot;Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City — and making wisecracks about his just-ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl.</p>
<p>“I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an ‘offender,’ ” the financier told The Post yesterday.</p>
<p>“It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel,” said Epstein.</p>
<p>Epstein’s flippant reasoning aside, a New York judge ruled at a hearing last month that the moneyman is the most dangerous kind of sex offender: a Level 3.</p>
<p>That means, according to the state, Epstein is at “high risk” to repeat his offense and poses “a threat to public safety.”</p>
<p>But Epstein doesn’t seem bothered by the designation.</p>
<p>“The crime that was supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York,” he said.</p>
<p>Epstein recently returned to his $50 million East 71st Street mansion and celebrated his release from a Florida jail with his close pal, Britain’s Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Epstein served 13 months of an 18-month sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p>
<p>In court papers, the victim was identified as a 14-year-old girl.</p>
<p>At one point, Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple counts of statutory rape, according to investigators. Court documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to $1,000 for sexual massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan.</p>
<p>He also molested girls he had brought in from South America and Europe and once was given three 12-year-old girls from France as a “birthday gift,” the documents alleged.</p>
<p>Epstein struck a secret nonprosecution deal with the feds. The government agreed to drop its probe of various sex-crime allegations if Epstein copped to prostitution felonies in Florida state court.</p>
<p>**But in New York’s sex-offender database, Epstein doesn’t come up in a ZIP code search. He shows up only via the “name search” option, and no New York address is listed.</p>
<p>That’s because Epstein’s Upper East Side home is considered “temporary.” By state law, he is required to provide only his permanent address to the database, and Epstein listed his Florida home.**</p>

<p>&quot;Jeffrey Epstein’s East Side mansion houses Russian playmates&quot;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein is not letting his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a teenager interfere with his lifestyle.</p>
<p>But instead of having his assistants troll local high schools, the billionaire money manager — and registered sex offender — is importing his playmates from Russia, my source says.</p>
<p>A recent visitor tells me Epstein has a house full of young beauties at his East 71st Street mansion. “Half of them are from the former Soviet Union and the other half are a mix of Americans and Europeans,” said my source.</p>
<p>Although all the women appeared to be at least 17, the age of consent in New York state, they were all several decades younger than 63-year-old Epstein, the visitor said.</p>
<p>Epstein apparently has contacts in Moscow who provide matchmaking services for both his “orgy island” in the Caribbean (which he jokingly dubbed Little St. Jeff’s) and his Manhattan townhouse.</p>
<p>“When the Russian girls arrive in the city, they already have Jeffrey’s phone number,” said my source.</p>
<p>One procurer, Peter Listerman, claims in TV interviews that he introduced many oligarchs and A-listers to Russian models, and says: “I’m not a pimp, just [a] matchmaker.”</p>
<p>Listerman, or a dead ringer in an Astrakhan fur hat, was photographed entering Epstein’s mansion in January.</p>
<p>Epstein had no comment.</p>
<p>The mansion is called the Herbert N. Straus Mansion.</p>
<p>Google images has alot of pictures of it.</p>
