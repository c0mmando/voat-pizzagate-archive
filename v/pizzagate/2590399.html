<p>Lyrics to theme songs from fanaf 1
We\'re waiting every night
To finally roam and invite
Newcomers to play with us
For many years we\'ve been all alone</p>
<p>We\'re forced to be still and play
The same songs we\'ve known since that day
An imposter took our life away
Now we\'re stuck here to decay</p>
<p>Please let us get in!
Don\'t lock us away!
We\'re not like what you\'re thinking</p>
<p>We\'re poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we\'re forced here to take that role</p>
<p>We\'ve been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987</p>
<p>Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck and defend
After all you only got</p>
<p>[2x]
Five nights at Freddy\'s
Is this where you want to be?
I just don\'t get it
Why do you want to stay?</p>
<p>Five nights at Freddy\'s</p>
<p>We\'re really quite surprised
We get to see you another night
You should have looked for another job
You should have said to this place good-bye</p>
<p>It\'s like there\'s so much more
Maybe you\'ve been in this place before
We remember a face like yours
You seem acquainted with those doors</p>
<p>Please let us get in!
Don\'t lock us away!
We\'re not like what you\'re thinking</p>
<p>We\'re poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we\'re forced here to take that role</p>
<p>We\'ve been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987</p>
<p>Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck and defend
After all you only got</p>
<p>[2x]
Five nights at Freddy\'s
Is this where you want to be?
I just don\'t get it
Why do you want to stay?</p>
<p>Five nights at Freddy\'s </p>
<p>Here\'s the lyrics from FANAF 3</p>
<p>I really hate you
Stop getting in my way
I\'ve lost my patience
When are you gonna decay?
I want to throw you out
Just like my broken TV
If you\'ll come back once more
It shall be painful you\'ll see</p>
<p>I hope you die in a fire
Hope you\'ll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you\'ll get shot and expire
Hope you\'ll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire</p>
<p>It\'s almost over
Why can\'t you just let it fly?
Don\'t be afraid
It\'s not the first time you\'ll die
Your mechanical parts click
Sounds like when I broke your bones
Once I get my second chance
I won\'t leave you alone</p>
<p>I hope you die in a fire
Hope you\'ll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you\'ll get shot and expire
Hope you\'ll be taken apart
I hope this is what you desire</p>
<p>I hope you die in a fire
Hope you\'ll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you\'ll get shot and expire
Hope you\'ll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire</p>
<p>I hope you die in a fire </p>
<p>I hope you die in a fire that\'s a lovely song for children to be singing</p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>This crazy ass game has theme songs with messed up lyrics that hint at mk ultra, it\'s set in a pizzaria with illuminati checkerboard floor and its about homicidal animatronics that harm children and use their spirits to control the machines after they are corrupted.</p>',
