            Is it not the law that if an individual suspects or witnesses pedo activity, he is compelled to report it? That silence is complicity, witnessing a crime and not reporting it?  Everyone who walked into his homes and saw a the little girl pictures and pedophernalia, girl massages, must have suspected something -- would those guests who didn't participate still be legally culpuble for not reporting?

            trump in epsteins black book. Like, these coals have been raked over a thousand times. I dont put Tump 100% out of contention, but I wont give it any more contention without any more evidence. 
Billionaires do business with billionaires. They party with Billionaires.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm confidant Trump knew of Epsteins 'indiscretions' before hand. Did he participate? Or was he disgusted?
When Epstein landed in the clink and was charged he called Trump as one of his allowable calls - but every evidence is Trump let him hang out to dry and did not come to his defence. Maybe Epstein thought Trump would be a great character witness as someone known to not indulge in that perversity.
Trump also teases Hillary at high society dinners - insinuating she's stolen whole Haiti villages

            I urge you to resubmit this as a discussion post instead of a link post with a copy/paste comment in it. Will make the information you're trying to share more accessible.

            Also what do the mods have to do with any of this. Seems like some backhanded discrediting tactic if you ask me. Whatever tho.
            <br/>
            Also people ask for sources so that if they try to share the information they can back it up with some sort of credibility other than "I told you so"

             It was posted earlier as a discussion and they deleted because a link of proof wasn't in the title-bar, now your saying to re-do and go back so they can delete again?? Right.

             How about someone just answer the question? Who has more entry's in the black book of Epstein? Trump or Clinton?

              There was no link in the original discussion post. Tbh you could have probly just edited the discussion but erring on the side of people being lazy the mod just went ahead and deleted it and urged you to repost. Now I'm not deleting it and urging you to repost as a discussion with a link in the discussion so that people get to see both the link and the discussion. If you do this your post will not get deleted. And seeing as you've gotten barely any views on this post it's the perfect time to do this.

            While we all agree this verse is compromised, its always good to see if there is any consistency in their pledge, that Epstein is now relevant to Pizzagate.

            [ BB Epsteins BLACK BOOK - FUCK BOOK ]
           </p>
           <p>
            ( Note, Stephen Hawking was a guest visitor and lecturer at fuck island, he was NOT in Epstein fuck book. )

            When people ask for sources about shit it's time to assume they won't look past their nose or h-trapping especially when asking for a source for Epstein's alleged un-redacted, 95 page BB that allegedly lists:
           </p>
           <p>
            12 numbers for Trump
           </p>
           <p>
            3 for Trump vehicles,
           </p>
           <p>
            2 for Trump Towers,
           </p>
           <p>
            1 for Mar-a-Lago Club,
           </p>
           <p>
            1 for Mar-a-Lago Spa,
           </p>
           <p>
            3 for his Houseman (Howard Wilson),
           </p>
           <p>
            1 for Trump's Security,
           </p>
           <p>
            1 for Emergencies (labeled Norma direct)
           </p>
           <p>
            Which is less than the 14 numbers he has for Bill Clinton
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI allegedly drew squares around the BB stuff they were particularly interested in, like squares around:
           </p>
           <p>
            the 42 numbers under Ghislaine Maxwell
           </p>
           <p>
            the 150+ numbers under Massage heading
           </p>
           <p>
            the 13 numbers for Alan Dershowitz
           </p>
           <p>
            the 12 numbers for Trump,
           </p>
           <p>
            the 14 numbers for Bill Clinton,
           </p>
           <p>
            the 4 numbers for Courtney Love
           </p>
           <p>
            the 17 numbers for Joel Paschow
           </p>
           <p>
            the 10 numbers for Peter Soros
           </p>
           <p>
            the address for the NYC apartment building Epstein used for "models"
           </p>
           <p>

             Boy Howdy! 10 for Peter Soros? Soros+Clintons-Epstein-Podesta-Weiner-Trump-Dershowitz. Could be harder and harder to keep Epstein out of P-G.
